We will be equal before the law with all other married couples.<br /></p> \n<p>Around the world, LGBT people are fighting for their civil rights. There are not fewer gay people born in countries where the punishment for their existence is death or imprisonment, there is just more misery. And there are not more gay people in countries that legislate for equal marriage, but there might possibly be more happiness. </p> \n<p>Seventeen years ago it was hard to imagine the future for our family. In Britain, gay rights activists and groups such as the Homosexual Law Reform Society, Outrage! and Stonewall had been actively fighting for equal rights. But in 1996 we still had no protection from discrimination at work, few parental rights, no spousal inheritance, and no pension or work benefits. One in four gay teenagers attempted suicide and Section 28 worked in schools to prevent the “promotion” of homosexuality, effectively silencing teachers from helping young people who had questions about their sexuality. Getting married seemed an impossibility.</p> \n<p>When Rena and I planned our commitment ceremony in 2000, we had never witnessed a same sex wedding and neither had many of our guests. None of us were entirely sure what to expect. We sent out our invitations with some trepidation but as the day drew nearer we received replies full of support. One morning I opened the post expecting another reply from a friend but the letter I read was full of hate. An anonymous death threat had been posted to us and had reached our house. The writer promised to kill us if we went ahead with the wedding service. </p> \n<p>One of the most difficult aspects of coming out as a lesbian was the realisation that some people would not like me based on knowing only that one thing about me. I was unpopular in a world where I had previously enjoyed many privileges. A friend at the time told me she was upset by the reactions of her own social circle as they “don’t think you are a good person any more”. In my job as an actor, I am used to bad notices and my skin is appropriately layered, but in the early days of coming out I found it hard that I was being judged as a person, and especially as a mother, and found wanting. The letter I read in my kitchen that morning was an extreme example of how very unpopular I had become to one particular person. </p> \n<p>The police installed an alarm system and we went through the emergency procedures with the children. Thankfully, we never had to use the panic buttons but the letter was a reminder that love and marriage are intrinsic to what we understand about the best of human nature. It seemed to me that the letter writer was frightened that when Rena and I got married, if only symbolically, our love would become something to celebrate. </p> \n<p>And it did. Of course, it was just a wedding like many others; we made our promises to each other, the minister blessed us and we kissed. For Rena and me, it was the end of some of the doubts and fears that we had lived with for our first years; we had won immigration status for Rena, we had outlasted the controversy and our family was flourishing. In our hearts, it was the beginning of our married life. We hoped for the day when it would be legal for gay people to marry the person they loved. We didn’t dream it would happen in our lifetimes.</p> \n<p><em>If you would like to read the A Marriage Proposal in full now, you can purchase the ebook via the links on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://guardianshorts.co.uk/amarriageproposal/\">Guardian Shorts website</a>, prices from &pound;1.99.</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7bcbca0299538578762fdca9396df1b4f4a5b04\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/10/1428666801993/e386b6ea-147f-4791-a76e-2e9e590b5c45-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A Marriage Proposal\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Marriage Proposal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Shorts</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"News","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/10/1428666884625/d23c73a2-6247-4e95-a1ff-5451cef703d5-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian Shorts","altText":"A Marriage Proposal","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian Shorts"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/10/1428666800792/c0961b18-1881-40b1-9dd1-70d1e3edf6cb-765x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":765,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"A Marriage Proposal.

Without this right, the love expressed between two people cannot be formally recognised by society and government, across families and countries, through cultures and history. Without that right, Rena and I might never have been allowed to become a couple, to live together, to raise our children and be a family. We did not have that right, not then. But we were lucky enough to find each other at a time when there was a glimpse of change on the horizon. Hundreds of thousands of couples around the world are searching for their rights just as we did. Hannah Arendt showed the utmost importance of this search, famously asserting that: “Even political rights, like the right to vote, and nearly all other rights enumerated in the Constitution, are secondary to the inalienable human rights to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness’.”[1]</p> \n<p>Such rights have been established as the basis for human existence. Those countries that have legalised marriage for same sex couples have acknowledged that gay men and lesbians are equally entitled to those fundamental rights and responsibilities. To deprive gay people of full citizenship is to discriminate in a way that effects every aspect of their life, regardless of whether they want to get married, or have children. Where there is no choice there is no freedom. </p> \n<p>In 2001, the Netherlands became the first country in the world to legislate for same sex marriage. One of the principle motivations behind the legislation was the observation of depression, the higher rates of suicide and attempted suicide, and increased hospitalisation amongst the gay and lesbian community. The advocates for this change in law were the health care professionals who treated the depressed patients, in this case, at the Catholic psychiatric hospitals.[2] </p> \n<p>There have been many studies on the adverse effects that a ban on same sex marriage can have on the mental health of gay men and lesbians. From the improvement found in the mental health of homosexual men in Massachusetts once the State had legalised equal marriage[3] to the issues of institutionalised discrimination,[4] the correlation between the mental health of gay people and the openness with which they can live is clear. Simply put, when the government stops telling its citizens that there is something wrong with being gay, the mental health of gay people improves. Legislating against homophobia and giving gay people the same civil rights as straight people, is one way of a government leading the way in helping to end discrimination and improve the wellbeing of all its citizens.</p> \n<p>Other European countries soon followed the Netherlands: Belgium, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Iceland, Denmark and most recently, France. In England and Wales, the new legislation would come into effect in 2014.</p> \n<p>Of the few countries outside Europe to pass same sex marriage laws as of November 2013, three are on the South American continent: Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. Argentina was the first country in Latin America to legislate for same sex marriages, having established civil unions in some jurisdictions in 2002. By 2010, polls showed that nearly 70% of the country supported same sex marriages but the government had to contend with strong opposition from the Roman Catholic Church. The President of Argentina, Christina Fern&aacute;ndez de Kirchner, argued that, because same sex couples already existed, the Church was wrong to claim equal marriage was a moral issue which presented a threat to the social order. Prior to the debate in Argentina’s senate, Mrs. Kirchner said that, “It would be a terrible distortion of democracy if they (church leaders) denied minorities their rights.”</p> \n<p>When Uruguay’s senate passed the Marriage Equality Bill in April 2013, the objections from the Roman Catholic Church centered on the undermining of the family. But Senator Monica Xavier, president of Broad Front a left wing coalition group, stressed that the issue for Uruguay was one of civil rights, ‘Here we are speaking about RIGHTS, with capital letters. Rights that were denied and repressed for a long time … Rights that are inherent to people, that are not a legislative creation, but something that the law must recognize.”</p> \n<p>The question of civil rights was again central to the decision of&nbsp; the National Council of Brazil in 2013 when it voted by 14–1 to legalise same sex marriage in the entire country, unifying the many policies followed by different states. In the preceding years, there had been much debate about civil unions and same sex marriages but Jose Luiz Bednarski, the lawyer acting for the Sao Paolo state attorney general wrote in his opinion to the court, “The federal constitution establishes as a fundamental objective of the Federal Republic of Brazil to promote the good of everyone without bias of gender or any other form of discrimination. This certainly includes the choice or sexual orientation of a person.” The Sao Paolo ruling meant that existing same sex civil unions could be converted to marriages.</p> \n<p>All three Latin American countries faced considerable opposition from the Church. In Brazil, only half the population supported the legalisation of same sex marriage. But in each country, the government argued that the case for equal marriage would not weaken the institution of marriage, rather it would strengthen the constitution by honouring the civil rights of its citizens.</p> \n<p>The only African country to legislate for same sex marriage is South Africa and its ruling underlines the importance of recognising equal marriage as a civil right.&nbsp; In a test case launched by Marie Adriaana Fourie and Cecelia Johanna Bonthuys, the Supreme Court of Appeal found that enshrining homosexual discrimination in law could be compared, theoretically if not materially, to the ways in which race discrimination had been enshrined in South Africa’s law and so ruled in favour of the couple. Consequently, same sex marriage was legalised in 2006. Justice Albie Sachs ruled that: “The exclusion of same-sex couples from the benefits and responsibilities of marriage … represents a harsh if oblique statement by the law that same-sex couples are outsiders, and that their need for affirmation and protection of their intimate relations as human beings is somehow less than that of heterosexual couples.”[5]</p> \n<p>Again, the change in law faced considerable opposition. Violence and prejudice against LGBT people continues in South Africa. But the judgement from the Constitutional Court makes for particularly interesting reading, covering as it does, the right to be different and the right to have your relationship recognised by law. One of the findings of the court stated, ‘Prejudice can never justify unfair discrimination … Indeed, if as a nation we are to achieve the goal of equality that we have fashioned in our Constitution we must never tolerate prejudice, either directly or indirectly.’[6]<em> </em>The finding is significant given the context of the prejudice endured by South Africa’s black citizens. In its ruling, the court recognises that the hard won civil rights established in the new constitution must extend to all the country’s people or the battle against discrimination has not been won.</p> \n<p>The only other countries to allow same sex marriages are Canada and New Zealand, although in parts of Mexico and the United States same sex marriages are recognised at State level. On the debate for equal marriage at a federal level, the United States vice-president, Joe Biden, has said of equal marriage, ‘It’s the civil rights of our day. It’s the issue of our day.’ Like Israel, the American government also recognises same sex marriages that have been performed elsewhere. However, Israel recently rejected a bill legislating for same sex marriage even though polls show that the support for equal marriage is stronger among Israelis than in many other countries where same sex marriage has been legalised.</p> \n<p>Countries that (at the time of writing) have equal marriage laws under consideration include Colombia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and Vietnam. Many other countries, such as Australia, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Switzerland have civil partnership laws. </p> \n<p>In all, there are around thirty countries where equality for same sex couples is recognised by law. There are also many tribal customs and cultural exceptions to be found across continents. The desire for same sex marriage is not a modern phenomenon; it has been the hope of many couples, all over the world and throughout history. The difference now is that same sex marriages are being recognised as equal. When the New Zealand parliament passed the legislation for same sex marriage in 2013, the public gallery led the House in celebration by singing a traditional Maori love song, ‘Pokarekare Ana’. The New Zealand MP, Louis Wall, said at the time, ‘[Marriage equality] is not about gay marriage, same sex marriage or straight marriage. It’s about marriage between two people. There’s no distinction to be made. That is equality.”</p> \n<p>True equality, where your rights as an individual are recognised by law and by society, does not happen overnight. But with the advent of same sex marriage we start to see how legal equality can work. Some in the LGBT community have argued that with the change in law and in attitudes, they may feel a pressure to answer questions about marriage and children, to conform, which they did not expect when they realised their gender and sexual orientation. The identity of “otherness” is not one to surrender lightly. But difference is not about whether you love someone of the same sex or the opposite sex, or whether you accept a binary gender assignment. As we are discovering, these differences are only part of our identity, they do not necessarily define us. With laws that recognise the absolute right of individuals not be discriminated against for their differences, we can imagine our non-conformity in other ways, in what we create and how we contribute. Otherness is not determined by the mainstream, it is not to be found in prejudice and ignorance, in criminalisation and taboo. With absolute equality, we can define ourselves.<br /></p> \n<p><em><br /></em></p> \n<p><em>If you would like to read the A Marriage Proposal in full now, you can purchase the ebook via the links on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://guardianshorts.co.uk/amarriageproposal/\">Guardian Shorts website</a>, prices from &pound;1.99.</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35833e64927603b319b08f0d3c12781384c93ef3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/27/1427459083766/f6612373-d420-4385-9897-e00816376543-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"A Marriage Proposal\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Marriage Proposal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Shorts</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup> Hannah Arendt, <em><a href=\"http://learningspaces.org/forgotten/little_rock1.pdf\">Reflections on Little Rock,</a> </em>(1958).</p> \n<p><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup><sup> </sup>For an assessment of the impact of the Dutch legislation, see ‘<a href=\"http://www.euronews.com/2013/04/01/reflecting-on-12-years-of-gay-marriage-in-the-netherlands/\">Reflecting on 12 years of gay marriage in the Netherlands</a>’ at Euronews.com.</p> \n<p><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup> Mark L.

By which I believe he meant not that he held any murderous intentions toward her but that when Rena died, he would agree to bury her – unlike <a href=\"http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/05/16/danish-vicar-refused-to-bury-lesbian-after-opposing-marriage-for-gays/\">the 2012 case of a Danish vicar</a> who refused to inter a deceased women because she had been in a same-sex partnership for 20 years.</p> \n<p>The media sought our vicar’s views, not because Rena and I were regular visitors to his church, but because we were his parishioners and, as one of the few nations in the world that maintains an established Church, the opinions of the clergy still matter in England in the 21st century. The Church of England holds great influence on the private lives of English citizens, with holidays and rituals, historical and geographical landmarks, and in matters of political importance, such as fertility rights and marital rights. While Christianity has such an influence in our schools, our governments, our media and our culture, we are all affected by the policy of the Church. In our case that means births, deaths, but no marriages. </p> \n<p>The principle objection to the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, was offered by the Church of England. In their response to the government consultations on equal civil marriage, the Church offered objections based on traditional understandings of marriage as well as doctrine and possible legal challenges. Other religious organisations in England may also object to equal marriage but since their faiths are not established as the state religion, they are not considered so vulnerable to legal challenges from same-sex couples wanting to marry in church.</p> \n<p>The canon law of the Church of England and the civil laws of England have so far been in accordance and canon law defines marriage as between one man and one woman. But as <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9325171/Gay-marriage-raises-prospect-of-disestablishment-says-Church-of-England.html\">Right Reverend Tim Stevens points out</a>, “[when] the civil law of the state redefines [marriage] you have got a situation in which civil law and canon law are at odds.”</p> \n<p>The possibility that the new marriage law would cause a constitutional crisis and challenge the establishment of the Church of England was a consideration in the consultation process in 2013 and will continue to be of concern while canon law and the law of the land are out of sync. It is possible to change canon law and the process by which this can be done is documented by the <a href=\"http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2012/06/15/church-of-englands-argument-against-gay-marriage-is-without-foundation-paul-johnson/\">UK Human Rights Blog</a>; indeed the Church of England was founded during the reign of Henry VIII in response to the king’s frustration with the dominance of Rome over his own leadership. Part of his frustration was the Catholic Church’s refusal to annul his first marriage to Catherine of Aragon so that he could marry Anne Boleyn. Henry separated from the Catholic Church and married Anne. Without the change in law, the king would have been considered an adulterer as Matthew (5:32) makes clear: “But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.”</p> \n<p>There are many references in the bible to the sin of adultery, and divorce is consistently included as adulterous in and of itself. But by 1857, the Matrimonial Causes Act made provision for ordinary people to divorce and in 2005, the divorced heir to the throne (and possible future Supreme Governor of the Church of England), Prince Charles, married the divorced Camilla Parker-Bowles. Although their adultery had been ruled by the Church as a contributory factor in her divorce, and they were consequently not allowed to marry in church, they had a civil service instead and were nevertheless later blessed by the Church with the Archbishop of Canterbury presiding.</p> \n<p>The Church of England has proved itself practical in matters of divorce and remarriage. Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2005/feb/10/monarchy.constitution\">publically supported the marriage</a> between Prince Charles and Mrs Parker-Bowles saying, ‘He is the heir to the throne, and he loves her. The natural thing is that they should get married.’</p> \n<p>Put like this, it is tempting to wonder if it would take a homosexual heir to change the current position of the Church of England on same sex marriage. </p> \n<p>As it is, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill had to go through considerable scrutiny by the Church of England and apply a “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2012/dec/11/gay-marriage-quadruple-lock-religious-groups\">quadruple lock</a>” system to ensure that no one in the Anglican Church would be forced to perform a same sex marriage service. Not one of the (all male) bishops in the unelected House of Lords voted for same sex marriage at the Bill’s final stage in 2013. How could they? Existing canon law does not allow for same sex marriages and the provisions for the exemption of the Church may be insufficient.</p> \n<p>Anglican Church leaders worry that the <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/the-human-rights-act/\">Human Rights Act of 1998</a>, which came into force in Britain in 2000, could be used to pursue a claim of discrimination against the Church on behalf of same sex couples. Certain human rights, such as slavery, have already been seen to supersede the lessons of the Bible. These teachings are now seen not just as inconvenient to modern life, but as barbaric practices and so rightly rejected.[1] When reformers are criticised for picking and choosing which biblical traditions should still be observed, it is important to remember that our society has already chosen not to stone adulterers, sell our daughters, or put to death those who work on the Sabbath and we consider our choices absolute standards of civilised development.</p> \n<p>Not all religions find the issue of equal marriage problematic. Several different religious denominations have expressed their desire to conduct equal marriages. Quakers, Unitarians, Liberal Judaism and the Movement for Reform Judaism want to be able to marry same sex couples at their places of worship. <a href=\"http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/03/07/reform-judaism-backs-gay-marriage/\">Rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner wrote</a>: “A recognition of equality of marriage for homosexuals as well as heterosexuals can only strengthen society and the institution of marriage. We welcome moves to legislate to this end. We are all made in God’s image, an image that has a wide prism of characteristics and believe therefore that same-sex partnerships based on the same stability, faithfulness, love and mutual support as heterosexual relationships should be seen as fully equal in the eyes of the law.”</p> \n<p>Prohibiting same sex couples from marrying in church is not just a theoretical moral ban for many gay Christians; it effectively removes their ability to incorporate their personal beliefs into their union. Civil services are prohibited from including any religious content, including hymns and biblical readings. Same sex couples that wish to celebrate their commitment to their faith and their partners may not be married by any ordained minister from the Church of England and even with the introduction of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, same sex partners can be married in any religious building except for those belonging to the Church of England. While marriage services are specifically forbidden in Anglican Churches, no religious representative of any denomination will be allowed to conduct marriages unless their governing body has consented. To date, the Muslim Council of Great Britain and the Network of Sikh Organisations have stated their opposition to same sex marriages. They may allow for equal marriage in the future if they choose but the Church of England is expressly forbidden to conduct same sex marriages.</p> \n<p>Same sex marriage, along with the role of women in the Church, has the potential to threaten the unity of a faith that is practiced worldwide. It is the history of our Church to adapt either by immediate pressure (the dictates of the monarch) or by slowly adjusting to social change (the role of women, the immorality of slavery). It would be a brave church that would take the lead and be at the vanguard of moral reform. Perhaps it is not in the nature of such a monolithic structure to facilitate change but for those of us who are gay and have some residual faith we would welcome a chance to belong to a Church that would have us for its members. From birth to death and the love in between.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><em>And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. </em>St Paul to the Corinthians, <em>New King James Bible, </em>Corinthians 13:1–13</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup> For an enlightening and humorous look at some of these lessons, read <a href=\"http://www.humanistsofutah.org/2002/WhyCantIOwnACanadian_10-02.html\">‘Why Can’t I Own a Canadian?’</a> on the Humanists of Utah website. </p> \n<p><em>If you would like to read the A Marriage Proposal in full now, you can purchase the ebook via the links on the <a href=\"http://guardianshorts.co.uk/amarriageproposal/\">Guardian Shorts website</a>, prices from &pound;1.99.</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7bcbca0299538578762fdca9396df1b4f4a5b04\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426252694958/b4405ab3-afbf-4cef-879e-6dfeffead675-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A Marriage Proposal\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Marriage Proposal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Shorts</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"News","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426252763909/6afd8abb-ab69-47e7-b64a-df48749fb7d5-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian Shorts","altText":"A Marriage Proposal","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian Shorts"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/3/13/1426252693697/8b785e34-acb7-488a-897c-513ca12ef616-765x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":765,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"A Marriage Proposal.
