Not that many of us noticed at the time. It was – in Britain, in Europe, in Asia, Africa and the Americas – the decade of revolution; of profound and troubling upheaval, of sustained bloodshed and suffering, of dramatic social change, of political assertion and sexual openness. The cold war hovered at ignition temperature in October 1962 with the Cuban missile crisis. Intercontinental ballistic missiles tipped with nuclear warheads deep in hardened silos or in the hulls of nuclear-powered submarines reduced the potential warning time before total annihilation to, for Britons, a trifling four minutes. Political factions in British and European colonies in Africa, the eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf at first campaigned for and then fought for independence, and then in some cases when they got it, carried on fighting each other. A young president sent 18,000 American ‘military advisors’ to South Vietnam and thus committed the United States to a desperate, costly and ultimately humiliating post-colonial war. The Chinese at the beginning of the decade endured a famine believed to have claimed between 15 and 40 million lives, and at the end of the decade were deep in a cruel Cultural Revolution seemingly promoted to overturn the newly-established social structure, crush expertise and remove any threat to the political hierarchy. The Soviet Union brutally put down an independence movement in Czechoslovakia; a coalition of workers and students tore up the cobbles of Paris and dislodged a French president; peaceful protesters in the southern US states were shot, gassed and burned for trying to exercise rights that – in law – they already possessed. An old wound in Northern Ireland was freshly reinfected, and it festered for the next three decades. In Britain, to the music of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, some of the old moral certainties collapsed, with the notorious ‘trial’ of D H Lawrence’s suppressed novel Lady Chatterley’s Lover, and with the closure of the Lord Chamberlain’s Office, a branch of government that vetted all film and theatre scripts for suspected filth and innuendo. The development of a simple, orally-taken female contraceptive changed attitudes to sexual adventure before and beyond marriage; a president was assassinated, and his brother, and Martin Luther King, giant of the civil rights movement in the US. And at the climax of the decade, in an adventure launched and sustained as a demonstration of cold war authority, American astronauts landed on the moon. For those who were there at the time – whether or not they were dropping acid, smoking dope, snorting cocaine or shooting heroin – it was an extraordinary and extraordinarily exciting decade, which might be why most of us completely missed some of the other irreversible changes that began between 1960 and 1970.<br /></p> \n<p>In effect, we still haven’t caught up: we see, experience and evaluate the world in several very different ways precisely because of half a dozen developments in that decade, but hardly any of us registered those advances at the time, and even now, most people could not name the act, the year or the players behind the most profound scientific revolutions of the 60s. In part, that is because the pivotal moments can only be pinpointed by hindsight: each separate significant development was at the time, just another idea, another proposition, another assertion in the hubbub of debate and, in scientific debate, there is rarely a single lightbulb moment. The ideas are out there, sometimes toyed with for decades; they are debated, rejected, picked up again, re-examined, tested and then debated again. In science too, there are hardly ever any lone heroes: the work of any scientist or team of scientists is based on the observations of an older generation and the data of contemporaries, and will be overtaken or enhanced by the work of the next set of newcomers. Even so, there were key moments, significant documents and actors almost perfectly cast for the roles on offer and there is not much room for argument about the significance of some of the developments in that decade. </p> \n<p>In the years between 1960 and 1970, astronomers and physicists suddenly understood that the universe had indeed had a beginning: that matter, space and time had emerged from a cosmic egg, or exploded from nothing and nowhere in a big bang, at some time in the last 20 billion years. It was not eternal, therefore it was not infinite. It had a beginning, and therefore perhaps an end. What is more, both the beginning and the end could be described – not necessarily correctly, but certainly plausibly, and with logical argument – by physicists. Creation ceased to be the preserve of religious mystery, and at around that time the 3000-year-old belief in one God, maker of heaven and Earth, began to falter, and theologians continued to revise their ideas about the nature and role of a creator. </p> \n<p>In the same decade, geologists, geophysicists and oceanographers began to put together a new, bold theory of the making of the Earth itself. For the previous 300 years, the surface of the planet had presented a series of seemingly intractable puzzles. The presence of marine limestone, fossil fish and molluscs in the high hills and mountains far from the ocean was first hailed as evidence for the biblical flood; later generations of geologists were not so sure. The notion of a moving planet, a planet on which the continents rode around on oceanic crust, like suitcases on a conveyor belt, continuously crashing, piling up or even spilling open and breaking up, had been proposed decades before. In the 1960s, a US scientist delivered a hypothesis and two British scientists published a paper outlining a set of propositions, which, if true, would clinch the argument. And by the end of the decade, earth scientists had an almost complete theory of the Earth, one that explained seashells in the Dolomites, the upward surge of the Himalayas, the existence of seams of gold, copper and silver in old basalt, the geography of earthquakes and the inevitability of volcanoes. </p> \n<p>The third revolution of the decade happened literally overnight. Before the launch of the test communications satellite Telstar and its successors in geosynchronous orbit, planet-wide communication was clumsy, faltering and subject to occasional failure. News photographs could be transmitted by radio, but tended to be fuzzy, dark and unappetising. A British newspaper photographer in the US had to rush to an airport, get his plates or film on a plane, warn his newsdesk to pick up the material eight or nine hours later, develop the film and make the selection. Radio newscasters could pick up a radio link, but could not be sure of retaining it; reporters could telephone across the Atlantic – but had to ‘book’ a call with a transatlantic operator first – and television reporters had to wait another day before they could see any television film. The arrival of a communications satellite – predicted long before the first proof that spaceflight was possible – changed everything. The world became a global village and television viewers in Humberside could watch in horror the assassination of President Kennedy, almost as it happened. </p> \n<p>The fourth profound change of the decade was the global confrontation with death. This confrontation extended on many fronts, and many of the public health campaigns – among them, research into the hazards of smoking – had begun before the 1960s and extended long afterwards; others, such as heart transplant surgery were pioneered during the decade. But in 1966, the World Health Organisation took what now seems one extraordinary and radical step. It passed a resolution to eradicate smallpox. This disease, spread by a virus called <em>Variola</em> and originally called ‘small’ pox to distinguish it from the ‘great’ pox of syphilis, once killed, blinded or hideously disfigured millions of people each year around the world. In 1966, the WHO decided on a systematic, worldwide cooperation to eliminate the virus altogether. In 1977, the last-ever case of naturally-occurring smallpox was identified in the Horn of Africa.</p> \n<p>In 1968, too, an extraordinary photograph taken from Apollo 8 of Earthrise – of the blue planet Earth rising above the arid, barren landscape of the moon – both prompted and became the emblem of a new awareness of the Earth’s rareness and fragility, and signalled an increasing international concern for the environment and the planet’s resources. All these changes in public perception are more easily identified with hindsight: co-incidentally, by the beginning of this series of revolutions there was already a phrase available to describe them. In 1962, the historian Thomas Kuhn had written an influential book called The Structure of Scientific Revolutions and to characterise changes in attitude of the kind that followed an intellectual revolution, such as the 16<sup>th</sup> century switch from a geocentric universe in which the sun went round the Earth, to a Copernican universe in which the Earth went round the sun, he coined the phrase ‘paradigm shift’. During the 1960s, paradigms had shifted at the cosmic level, the geocentric level, at the social level and at the individual level. This is a story of four of those shifts.</p> \n<p><em>If you would like to read the Science that Changed the World in full now, you can purchase the ebook via the links on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://guardianshorts.co.uk/\">Guardian Shorts website</a>, prices from &pound;1.99.</em><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"546cc920fdba5a4b35dd537ccfc8ada5d9d94251\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430476294088/27563569-a8d0-468f-9d11-68cd4fe22c4f-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Science that Changed the World\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Science that Changed the World.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Shorts</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"News","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430476055815/f1f2073a-ad20-4503-8143-7a0a142b186a-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian Shorts","altText":"Science that Changed the World","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian Shorts"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430476292904/fb1ad9a6-f49d-4e06-a5ef-e06d06989609-765x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":765,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Science that Changed the World.

We will be equal before the law with all other married couples.<br /></p> \n<p>Around the world, LGBT people are fighting for their civil rights. There are not fewer gay people born in countries where the punishment for their existence is death or imprisonment, there is just more misery. And there are not more gay people in countries that legislate for equal marriage, but there might possibly be more happiness. </p> \n<p>Seventeen years ago it was hard to imagine the future for our family. In Britain, gay rights activists and groups such as the Homosexual Law Reform Society, Outrage! and Stonewall had been actively fighting for equal rights. But in 1996 we still had no protection from discrimination at work, few parental rights, no spousal inheritance, and no pension or work benefits. One in four gay teenagers attempted suicide and Section 28 worked in schools to prevent the “promotion” of homosexuality, effectively silencing teachers from helping young people who had questions about their sexuality. Getting married seemed an impossibility.</p> \n<p>When Rena and I planned our commitment ceremony in 2000, we had never witnessed a same sex wedding and neither had many of our guests. None of us were entirely sure what to expect. We sent out our invitations with some trepidation but as the day drew nearer we received replies full of support. One morning I opened the post expecting another reply from a friend but the letter I read was full of hate. An anonymous death threat had been posted to us and had reached our house. The writer promised to kill us if we went ahead with the wedding service. </p> \n<p>One of the most difficult aspects of coming out as a lesbian was the realisation that some people would not like me based on knowing only that one thing about me. I was unpopular in a world where I had previously enjoyed many privileges. A friend at the time told me she was upset by the reactions of her own social circle as they “don’t think you are a good person any more”. In my job as an actor, I am used to bad notices and my skin is appropriately layered, but in the early days of coming out I found it hard that I was being judged as a person, and especially as a mother, and found wanting. The letter I read in my kitchen that morning was an extreme example of how very unpopular I had become to one particular person. </p> \n<p>The police installed an alarm system and we went through the emergency procedures with the children. Thankfully, we never had to use the panic buttons but the letter was a reminder that love and marriage are intrinsic to what we understand about the best of human nature. It seemed to me that the letter writer was frightened that when Rena and I got married, if only symbolically, our love would become something to celebrate. </p> \n<p>And it did. Of course, it was just a wedding like many others; we made our promises to each other, the minister blessed us and we kissed. For Rena and me, it was the end of some of the doubts and fears that we had lived with for our first years; we had won immigration status for Rena, we had outlasted the controversy and our family was flourishing. In our hearts, it was the beginning of our married life. We hoped for the day when it would be legal for gay people to marry the person they loved. We didn’t dream it would happen in our lifetimes.</p> \n<p><em>If you would like to read the A Marriage Proposal in full now, you can purchase the ebook via the links on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://guardianshorts.co.uk/amarriageproposal/\">Guardian Shorts website</a>, prices from &pound;1.99.</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7bcbca0299538578762fdca9396df1b4f4a5b04\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/10/1428666801993/e386b6ea-147f-4791-a76e-2e9e590b5c45-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A Marriage Proposal\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Marriage Proposal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Shorts</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"News","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/10/1428666884625/d23c73a2-6247-4e95-a1ff-5451cef703d5-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian Shorts","altText":"A Marriage Proposal","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian Shorts"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/10/1428666800792/c0961b18-1881-40b1-9dd1-70d1e3edf6cb-765x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":765,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"A Marriage Proposal.
