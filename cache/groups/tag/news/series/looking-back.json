Accordingly, it is quite difficult to remember how those of us around at the time imagined the world in November 1962, when Harry Hess of Princeton, New Jersey, delivered a text on the History of Ocean Basins, and in September 1963 when Fred J Vine, and his supervisor Drummond Matthews, of the department of geodesy and geophysics at Cambridge, published an article in Nature headed Magnetic Anomalies over Ocean Ridges. Even those of us with only a secondary school science education knew that the planet was very old; that it had been occupied by successive waves of life, much of it now extinct, and known only by fossil evidence. We knew that the planet was dynamic, in the sense that volcanoes intermittently erupted and spilled new material around them, and earthquakes periodically and unpredictably distorted railway lines, offset roads, crumpled bridges and shook structures to fragments. Both kinds of event were arbitrary, or the consequences of forces deep within the planet that nobody understood, and might as well be arbitrary. The first were generally explained as evidence of weakness in the Earth’s crust, and the second by the existence of ancient geological faults. We knew that marine sediments could be found high in the mountains, and therefore the crumpled landforms must once have been submerged by ocean; and we knew that erosion erased those landscapes not continuously renewed by lava flows, so that the world was subject to constant change. We knew – or rather, we were sometimes told – that there had been cataclysmic episodes of unbelievable violence in the ancient past, and such violence might recur, but we happened to be living in a relatively quiet period. We knew that in general, the deepest strata were the oldest rocks, and most of us were brought up to believe that the ocean basins, the deepest surface rocks of all, must therefore be the oldest.</p> \n<p>‘The floor of the deep ocean basins is probably as old as the sea itself,’ wrote Rachel Carson in a 1951 bestseller The Sea Around Us. ‘While the bordering shelves of the continents have known, in alternating geological ages, now the surges of waves and again the eroding tools of wind and frost and rain, always the abyss has lain under the all enveloping cover of miles-deep water.’ And in another enormously influential book published in 1951, called A Land, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes tried to describe the enormous timescales that produced ‘the limestones and sandstones, the chalk and clay that make so great a part of the landscape of Britain. It makes my flesh weary to recall this seemingly endless levelling down. In fact it is not endless. So long as the hard skin on which we live rests on a morass of molten magma, there must come a moment when it will weaken and ruck up, and as the energy long curbed below is freed, the sedimentary rocks that have been laid so quietly on the sea floor may be thrust up ruggedly into the air.’ Both books provide a snapshot of the consensus among British and US earth scientists of the 1950s. For Rachel Carson, the planet was about 2.5 billion years old, and the moon was formed from a huge globule of granite flung away by centrifugal force from the spinning nascent Earth, to hover ever after as an orbiting companion. For her, the continents were more or less where they had always been, sometimes submerged, sometimes exposed. Yes, she like others were aware of the ‘association of island arcs and deep trenches, and always the two occur only in areas of volcanic unrest’ and that this had something to do with the origin of Barbados in the West Indies and Timor in the East Indies. ‘Both have deep-sea deposits, as though they had once been part of the sea-floor. Yet this must be exceptional.’ </p> \n<p>For Jacquetta Hawkes, Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor, Land’s End and the Isles of Scilly were, after 200 million years of erosion, the remnants of mountain ranges pushed up by molten substances that ‘must in their day have been 10 times their present height. These then are the stuff of this land and all lands: the sedimentary rocks formed during the long periods of denudation, and the igneous or fiery rocks – granites, rhyolites, basalts and gabbros – which at many different times must have penetrated or broken through them.’ Europe’s four active volcanoes – Vesuvius, Stromboli, Etna and Hekla – are ‘the last feeble throes on the Alpine convulsion’ slight ripples of which had ‘tipped up some chalk in the south of England.’ Both writers knew that a great deal remained unexplained: Jacquetta Hawkes, in particular, describes Gondwanaland, that vast continent that for 400 million years ‘was to unite South America, Africa, Arabia, southern India and Australia in one continuous landmass and the proto-Atlantic Ocean’ but not why and how it broke up. Rachel Carson described the mid-Atlantic ridge, its general course flexing at the equator between ‘the hump of Brazil and the eastward curving coast of Africa. To some people this curvature has suggested the ridge was one part of a great continental mass, left behind, in mid-ocean when according to one theory, the continents of North and South America drifted away from Europe and Africa.’ She does not countenance this as an explanation: how could she? The thick masses of sediments on the Atlantic floor ‘required hundreds of millions of years for their sedimentation.’ For her, and for Hawkes, the ocean floor was the basement, the foundation, the oldest part of the planet. It was pretty difficult to imagine how a continent could migrate across it. The seeming snugness of fit of the Brazilian bump and the west African concavity was just as likely to be a co-incidence: just one of those puzzling things in a perpetually puzzling world. There were, indeed, as both writers seem casually to concede, schools of thought that contended that continents could move. It was just that nobody could imagine how the continents could have moved, and then propose an empirical way of proving that they did.</p> \n<p>Between 1951 and 1961, however, some new and compelling evidence had emerged. When basalt lavas cool, the iron mineral crystals in them line up in ways that point to the magnetic north pole. Researchers armed with highly sensitive magnetometers developed in the 1950s discovered that the direction of this magnetism seemed to vary quite considerably, according to the age of the rocks. It didn’t take long to discover that the rocks pointed in puzzling directions: either the magnetic north pole kept moving (which it does, a bit) or the continents on which the rocks had formed had performed a slow and stately, but also very peculiar dance. During the same period, details of the submarine continental shelf contours became better known, and enterprising geologists began looking to see whether west Africa and Brazil really did fit or whether the visible match was just an illusion fashioned by the latest variation in sea levels. The answer was the same: in fact, 500 metres below sea level, the fit was even better. And resourceful researchers looked at the scars left by one huge, ancient glaciation in west Africa and traced its path all the way to the coast. On the other side of the Atlantic, exactly where the jigsaw puzzle outline of one continent fitted the other, they observed the continuation of the glacial path. At the end of this track, they found rocks that could only have been shunted there from central Africa. </p> \n<p>There was yet another discovery in the deep oceans: the slow realisation that the greatest mountain range on Earth actually existed in the mid-Atlantic, running from volcanic Iceland to volcanic Tristan da Cunha, and stretched around the continents to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and that one continuous chain of mountains stretched for 65,000km. </p> \n<p>In 1962, Harry Hess of Princeton put all the evidence together and said ‘the continents have moved by large amounts in geologically comparatively recent times. One may quibble over the details but the general picture on palaeomagnetism is sufficiently compelling …’ He then proposed that deep in the planet’s mantle, where the rocks formed a hot, slowly bubbling porridge, convection forced an achingly slow but inexorable movement of the planet’s crust, and the bits that moved were actually the ocean floor – none of which (another recent discovery) seemed to be more than 200 million years old. So the ocean floor was a conveyor belt that carried the continents around. </p> \n<p>And in 1963, Fred J Vine and his PhD supervisor Drummond Matthews, of Cambridge University, came up with a proposal in the journal Nature that clinched the argument. They reasoned that if Harry Hess was right, then new rocks were bubbling up at the centres of the ocean ridges, cooling, forming new basalt, and imperceptibly pushing the ocean floor away from the centre, on each side of the ridge. The old sea floor at the extremes of the ocean was somehow being destroyed: conspicuously, in the Pacific at least, in a deep trench that ran parallel to the Andes of South America. Since – every few million years or so – the Earth’s magnetic field reverses itself, with north at the south pole and the south pole suddenly in the Arctic ocean, and then back again, the ocean floor basalt on either side of the ridge would be marked by fat parallel lines where the magnetic direction of the rocks were alternately pointed north and south. If so, the ocean floor would be not just a conveyor belt, but a magnetic tape recorder that carried evidence of its own movement.</p> \n<p>Because Vine and Matthews were proved right, the prediction doesn’t look so courageous now. But at the time, it was pretty daring. In the first place, not everybody agreed that the poles had in fact periodically reversed themselves. And those who thought that such things had happened could not name a period in which even the most recent switch had occurred. That is because ocean floor research was still in its infancy, and the basalt in question was buried beneath lots of oceanic mud, and because during the cold war readings from submarine instrumentation remained a military secret, and techniques for actually dating rocks were still being developed. But within three years, oceanography had grown up a bit, researchers had dug a bit deeper, and the secret was out: by 1966, it had become possible to suggest a timescale of reversals for the last three and a half million years, and just as Vine and Matthews had predicted, these reversals were recorded in the ocean floor, on either side of the ridge. Sea floor spreading was real, and the continents were shifting.</p> \n<p>And upon that discovery, over the next few years an amazing number of things became clear, explicable and even predictable. The crust of the planet was not randomly faulted, with bits where the crust was inexplicably thin. The crust of the planet was broken into large pieces, all moving and grinding against each other. Sometimes individual plates rammed against each other and stuck together, to fracture and separate somewhere else. Sometimes fissures developed in great plates and then stopped altogether: the Great Rift Valley of eastern Africa is now seen as a division that stopped as soon as it had begun. The new paradigm began to explain all sorts of geographical ironies and oddities. Scotland and England really did turn out to be separate countries, first joined together by some ancient collision of landmasses hundreds of millions of years before the parliamentary Act of Union in 1707. The geological similarities that prompted the first European settlers in Canada to call a place Nova Scotia were not accidental. They were looking at bits of continental structure from which Scotland had separated. The Black Forest in Germany and the Vosges in France can be seen not as two parallel mountain ranges with remarkably similar geology and shape, but as a single mountain range split down the middle and then divided by a slumped stretch of land called a graben, a hollow to be scoured and filled with silt by a drainage system later to be named the Rhine. The Andes were still rising because the ocean floor was disappearing down a trench, with telltale attendant violence (the resultant earthquakes being shallowest on the eastern side of the range and deepest on the west), and pushing them up. The Himalayas existed because what is now India had broken off from the ancient southern supercontinent, and smashed into Asia, creating both the mountain range and the Tibetan plateau. The new perception meant that explanations could multiply, and continue to multiply. It explained volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands and earthquakes in Japan. It explained why earthquakes were frequent in California but not in Massachusetts, and why a fossilised carboniferous forest lay under the deep snows of Antarctica. The tropical monsoon system existed because the moisture laden air met the Himalayan barrier, rose, cooled and condensed into seasonal tropical downpours. Not only did this fill the Yangzte and the Yellow River, the Mekong, the Ganges and the Indus, and deliver the bounty to feed more than two billion people, it also removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and locked it up in sedimentary rocks. In the course of doing so, it may also have lowered the planet’s overall temperature and precipitated millions of years of ice ages.</p> \n<p>But the new paradigm began to explain not just this or that feature of the planet’s present surface: it began to explain almost everything, from the concentration of gold and silver into seams in the mountains of California or Argentina to the ever renewing cycle of water and carbon dioxide from volcanic discharges; why there were marsupials in Australia but placental mammals everywhere else; why mountain formation kept pace with the levelling processes of erosion. It also explained why Earth was a stable home for life: not cold and dead and arid and airless like Mars. Life could exist on Earth because the planet itself was still, in some sense, alive. It offered a self-renewing habitable space, an ideal home under continuous redecoration and repair, fully air-conditioned and supplied with running hot and cold water, courtesy of an all-purpose under-floor central heating system and a dynamic interior that at the same time generated an upper atmosphere magnetic shield to protect life on Earth from the most hazardous cosmic and solar assault. Not all of this was apparent in September 1963, when Vine and Matthews published a three-page paper in Nature headed Magnetic Anomalies over Oceanic Ridges. But that was one identifiable moment in which our collective view of the world in which we live began to change, and change forever.</p> \n<p><em>If you would like to read the Science that Changed the World in full now, you can purchase the ebook via the links on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://guardianshorts.co.uk/\">Guardian Shorts website</a>, prices from &pound;1.99.</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"546cc920fdba5a4b35dd537ccfc8ada5d9d94251\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432903052363/b3189e43-d502-4228-afc1-833e4237db3b-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Science that Changed the World\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Science that Changed the World.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Shorts</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"News","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432903116634/35f9486c-16c7-469d-9272-689622916f6f-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian Shorts","altText":"Science that Changed the World","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian Shorts"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432903051098/3118292b-b294-4314-a9d3-d5ce95e692d6-765x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":765,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Science that Changed the World.

The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vergeltungswaffe\">Vergeltungswaffe</a>-2 or V-2 rocket was the world’s first long range ballistic missile weapon: it was fired from Nazi-occupied Europe, reached an altitude of 100km or more than 60 miles, and then fell at the end of its arc to detonate at more than 3,500km an hour. It delivered enormous destructive power and – for at least one intended victim – an unexpected message of optimism. In February 1945, while V-2 rockets pounded London, Flight-Lieutenant Arthur C Clarke, an RAF radar instructor, wrote a letter to Wireless World proposing the V-2 as a vehicle for research into the ionosphere, that invisible, charged layer of atoms and molecules high above the stratosphere. Scientists knew it was there, knew why it was there and knew why it was important in shortwave radio transmissions, but they knew nothing <em>about</em> it. But the V-2 inspired another possibility: a rocket that could reach a speed of 8km a second parallel to the Earth’s surface – something the V-2 could not do – would, said Clarke ‘continue to circle it forever in a closed circuit: it would become an “artificial satellite”.’ He then added with an even bolder idea for the more remote future ‘perhaps half a century ahead’ – an ‘artificial satellite’ at the correct distance from earth would make one revolution every 24 hours: that is ‘it would remain stationary above the same spot and would be within optical range of nearly half the earth’s surface. Three repeater stations, 120 degrees apart in the correct orbit, would give television and microwave coverage to the entire planet.’ He apologetically added that this suggestion wasn’t going to be of the slightest use to post-war planners. He signed himself not as an RAF officer, but as a member of the British Interplanetary Society. The V-2 rockets continued to drop warheads on London and other cities, arriving unannounced at speeds several times faster than sound, and Flight-Lieutenant Clarke continued to think ahead. In October 1945, he submitted to and published in Wireless World a four-page proposal for a true broadcasting service, giving constant field strength at all times over the whole globe, something that would be ‘invaluable, not to say indispensable, in a world society’. The problem at the time was that intercontinental telephone and radio signals could – though with no great certainty – be bounced off the ionosphere, but microwave transmission of television signals was effectively impossible via the ionosphere. Clarke proposed a ‘second moon’ at an orbit with a radius of 42,000km and a period of exactly 24 hours, an artificial moon that would never rise and never set, a satellite that could be fitted with receiving and transmitting equipment, driven by solar power. In effect, he had described the modern satellite broadcasting station, although only in effect: Clarke’s solar power was a system of mirrors that would concentrate sunlight on the boiler of a low pressure steam engine, and his ‘second moon’ would in fact be a space station provided with ‘comfortable living quarters, laboratories and everything needed for the comfort of its crew, who could be relieved and provisioned by a regular rocket service.’ This was before the invention of the transistor, before the photovoltaic cell, before the rediscovery of the fuel cell, before the first jet plane had gone into civilian service, before any rocket capable of accelerating to 8km a second or faster. However great the initial expense, argued Clarke ‘it would only be a fraction of that required for the world networks replaced, and the running costs would be incomparably less.’ He had, in one short, articulate entertainment for a professional journal, proposed the global communications satellite, and the international space station. Clarke was later to tell some of this story again in his 1992 book How the World Was One: Beyond the Global Village, and the communications world in which he made these proposals was not very different from the world that still existed at the beginning of the 1960s. At that time most British households did not have telephones (most British houses did not have refrigerators, central heating, double glazing, loft insulation or fitted carpets and a surprising number still had neither bathrooms nor indoor lavatories). Most people still expected to use a public telephone booth (you could make a call for two pennies) and many households that possessed a telephone shared a ‘party line’: an economy measure that permitted one line to serve two households, although only one household at a time could actually use the line for a call. Wireless cellphones existed only in comic-strip fiction: from 1946 to 1964, the cartoon tough guy detective Dick Tracy wore a two-way wristwatch radio. There were computers, powered by valves that recorded and played data on tape: the biggest required a substantial building to house it. International telephone calls were possible but they were expensive, needed to be booked hours in advance, and a brief international call cost a significant proportion of the weekly average wage at the time. In the year that Telstar was launched, the US had only 550 telephone channels, by either radio or submarine cable, to handle four million international calls every year. Since a television signal at the time – black and white pictures made up by 405 scanning lines at 50 fields a second – took 600 channels, it was not possible to transmit a television programme between the US and Europe. Most urgent international communication was conducted by telegraph, at a price per word that varied according to the countries involved, but was so expensive that foreign correspondents and international reporters by then shared a second language known as cablese in which unnecessary words were omitted, prefixes and suffixes exploited and codes employed: ‘ExParis Londonwards smorning’ meant the correspondent was to forsake the French capital for the British metropolis before noon that day. ‘Upstuff job arsewards’ meant that he had resigned. All that began to change on 23 July 1962, with the first formal transatlantic broadcast via Telstar. It wasn’t a simple operation. Telstar, unlike its successors, was in an orbit with a highest altitude of 3,600 miles, which meant that it whizzed around the planet every two hours and 40 minutes, thus national broadcasters had precarious access to it for 20 minutes or so at a time and the satellite had to be tracked by a series of receiving stations. The signal sent up from the ground transmitter was about two and a half watts. By the time it had reached its reflector in space and bounced back to the receiver it had made a journey of 10,000 miles or more and had been attenuated to about a trillionth of a watt, so the receivers were monstrously large: National Geographic magazine at the time described the US receiver at Andover in Maine as ‘the world’s largest ear trumpet.’ But the success of the transmission also depended on a number of other new technologies: without the recently-invented maser (which stands for microwave amplification of stimulated emission of radiation) any such feeble signal would have been overwhelmed by all the other random noise of the universe. The maser became the instrument that could eliminate the interference and amplify the signal that mattered most, about four thousand times. The maser however, had to work at very low temperatures: it was kept at near absolute zero in a bath of liquid helium that was in turn kept cold in a tank of liquid nitrogen. The Telstar experiment was an international, cross-cultural project that depended on Bell Telephone Labs in the US, the Post Office in Britain, the British Broadcasting Corporation and the European Broadcasting Union plus the ingenuity of an army of engineers and scientists, and it tested international amity and understanding in unexpected ways. During a trial in the very early hours of 13 July 1962, before the formal first broadcast, the French received a good picture and the British receiver at Goonhilly, in Cornwall, did not: the problem turned out to be a component that had been fitted back-to-front, because, as a veteran remembered long afterwards ‘it all depended on how one defined left-handed and right-handed polarisation. The Americans had adopted one definition and we had taken another.’ Meanwhile, the British accused the French of having broken an international agreement by transmitting a live broadcast before the agreed date of 23 July 1962. The French responded by saying it hadn’t been a live programme, it had been pre-recorded on magnetic tape and the BBC instead had broken the agreement by reporting ‘live’ from the control room at Goonhilly. The Guardian’s science correspondent at the time, John Maddox observed that the first result of Telstar had been ‘to confirm the suspicions of those who consider that better communications may not be an unmixed blessing.’ That same month, on the formal day of its first public broadcast, Goonhilly picked up the first television pictures, of President John F Kennedy in Washington, talking about the US dollar. Telstar became one of the most famous satellites ever and a record called Telstar, by a band called The Tornadoes, became the first British single to reach the top of the charts in the United States.</p> \n<p>But Telstar on its own was an unsatisfactory compromise: real, practical communication at a global level would depend either on a network of Telstars, so that transmission could skip from one orbiting satellite to another as it passed overhead, which would mean a much more complex system of ground stations, or on the launch of a series of geosynchronous satellites, each in 24 hour orbit, always above a precise location on Earth. Telstar and its successors relayed film of the assassination of President John F Kennedy at Dallas in November 1963. A year later, a Syncom 3 – a satellite at geostationary orbit – relayed coverage of the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo. In 1965, the US launched Early Bird, the first Intelsat communications satellite. It could handle either 240 telephone circuits or one black-and-white television programme, but not both at the same time. It could only link Europe and North America, and then only intermittently, because it had no battery and could only function while its solar panels were pointing at the sun. The global communications revolution had a long way to go, but it had begun. You could get a message to the other side of the Atlantic in a second, as long as you tried to do so while the satellite had power. Early Bird was joined by other satellites and in 1965 an enterprising BBC producer, Aubrey Singer, conceived the idea for the world’s first global television show. It took another two years to organise and it needed the support of the European Broadcasting Union but it exploited four satellites to link 14 countries on five continents and featured live broadcasts only, with appearances by the Vienna Boys’ Choir, Maria Callas, Pablo Picasso, Marshall McLuhan (who coined the phrase ‘global village’), trams in Melbourne, subway construction workers in Tokyo, a cattle rancher in Canada, and the Beatles and friends singing All You Need Is Love. Altogether the show was transmitted to 41 nations and was watched by at least 400 million viewers. It was intended to unite the world. Until a few weeks before the broadcast, Soviet and other iron curtain partners had also planned to contribute, but pulled out: the recent six-day war between Israel and the Arab countries had soured the geopolitical mood.

This Guardian Short ebook will be serialised chapter-by-chapter over the next few weeks.</p>","byline":"","body":"<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2> \n<p>In the 1960s, our ideas about the world changed dramatically, and forever. Not that many of us noticed at the time. It was – in Britain, in Europe, in Asia, Africa and the Americas – the decade of revolution; of profound and troubling upheaval, of sustained bloodshed and suffering, of dramatic social change, of political assertion and sexual openness. The cold war hovered at ignition temperature in October 1962 with the Cuban missile crisis. Intercontinental ballistic missiles tipped with nuclear warheads deep in hardened silos or in the hulls of nuclear-powered submarines reduced the potential warning time before total annihilation to, for Britons, a trifling four minutes. Political factions in British and European colonies in Africa, the eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf at first campaigned for and then fought for independence, and then in some cases when they got it, carried on fighting each other. A young president sent 18,000 American ‘military advisors’ to South Vietnam and thus committed the United States to a desperate, costly and ultimately humiliating post-colonial war. The Chinese at the beginning of the decade endured a famine believed to have claimed between 15 and 40 million lives, and at the end of the decade were deep in a cruel Cultural Revolution seemingly promoted to overturn the newly-established social structure, crush expertise and remove any threat to the political hierarchy. The Soviet Union brutally put down an independence movement in Czechoslovakia; a coalition of workers and students tore up the cobbles of Paris and dislodged a French president; peaceful protesters in the southern US states were shot, gassed and burned for trying to exercise rights that – in law – they already possessed. An old wound in Northern Ireland was freshly reinfected, and it festered for the next three decades. In Britain, to the music of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, some of the old moral certainties collapsed, with the notorious ‘trial’ of D H Lawrence’s suppressed novel Lady Chatterley’s Lover, and with the closure of the Lord Chamberlain’s Office, a branch of government that vetted all film and theatre scripts for suspected filth and innuendo. The development of a simple, orally-taken female contraceptive changed attitudes to sexual adventure before and beyond marriage; a president was assassinated, and his brother, and Martin Luther King, giant of the civil rights movement in the US. And at the climax of the decade, in an adventure launched and sustained as a demonstration of cold war authority, American astronauts landed on the moon. For those who were there at the time – whether or not they were dropping acid, smoking dope, snorting cocaine or shooting heroin – it was an extraordinary and extraordinarily exciting decade, which might be why most of us completely missed some of the other irreversible changes that began between 1960 and 1970.<br /></p> \n<p>In effect, we still haven’t caught up: we see, experience and evaluate the world in several very different ways precisely because of half a dozen developments in that decade, but hardly any of us registered those advances at the time, and even now, most people could not name the act, the year or the players behind the most profound scientific revolutions of the 60s. In part, that is because the pivotal moments can only be pinpointed by hindsight: each separate significant development was at the time, just another idea, another proposition, another assertion in the hubbub of debate and, in scientific debate, there is rarely a single lightbulb moment. The ideas are out there, sometimes toyed with for decades; they are debated, rejected, picked up again, re-examined, tested and then debated again. In science too, there are hardly ever any lone heroes: the work of any scientist or team of scientists is based on the observations of an older generation and the data of contemporaries, and will be overtaken or enhanced by the work of the next set of newcomers. Even so, there were key moments, significant documents and actors almost perfectly cast for the roles on offer and there is not much room for argument about the significance of some of the developments in that decade. </p> \n<p>In the years between 1960 and 1970, astronomers and physicists suddenly understood that the universe had indeed had a beginning: that matter, space and time had emerged from a cosmic egg, or exploded from nothing and nowhere in a big bang, at some time in the last 20 billion years. It was not eternal, therefore it was not infinite. It had a beginning, and therefore perhaps an end. What is more, both the beginning and the end could be described – not necessarily correctly, but certainly plausibly, and with logical argument – by physicists. Creation ceased to be the preserve of religious mystery, and at around that time the 3000-year-old belief in one God, maker of heaven and Earth, began to falter, and theologians continued to revise their ideas about the nature and role of a creator. </p> \n<p>In the same decade, geologists, geophysicists and oceanographers began to put together a new, bold theory of the making of the Earth itself. For the previous 300 years, the surface of the planet had presented a series of seemingly intractable puzzles. The presence of marine limestone, fossil fish and molluscs in the high hills and mountains far from the ocean was first hailed as evidence for the biblical flood; later generations of geologists were not so sure. The notion of a moving planet, a planet on which the continents rode around on oceanic crust, like suitcases on a conveyor belt, continuously crashing, piling up or even spilling open and breaking up, had been proposed decades before. In the 1960s, a US scientist delivered a hypothesis and two British scientists published a paper outlining a set of propositions, which, if true, would clinch the argument. And by the end of the decade, earth scientists had an almost complete theory of the Earth, one that explained seashells in the Dolomites, the upward surge of the Himalayas, the existence of seams of gold, copper and silver in old basalt, the geography of earthquakes and the inevitability of volcanoes. </p> \n<p>The third revolution of the decade happened literally overnight. Before the launch of the test communications satellite Telstar and its successors in geosynchronous orbit, planet-wide communication was clumsy, faltering and subject to occasional failure. News photographs could be transmitted by radio, but tended to be fuzzy, dark and unappetising. A British newspaper photographer in the US had to rush to an airport, get his plates or film on a plane, warn his newsdesk to pick up the material eight or nine hours later, develop the film and make the selection. Radio newscasters could pick up a radio link, but could not be sure of retaining it; reporters could telephone across the Atlantic – but had to ‘book’ a call with a transatlantic operator first – and television reporters had to wait another day before they could see any television film. The arrival of a communications satellite – predicted long before the first proof that spaceflight was possible – changed everything. The world became a global village and television viewers in Humberside could watch in horror the assassination of President Kennedy, almost as it happened. </p> \n<p>The fourth profound change of the decade was the global confrontation with death. This confrontation extended on many fronts, and many of the public health campaigns – among them, research into the hazards of smoking – had begun before the 1960s and extended long afterwards; others, such as heart transplant surgery were pioneered during the decade. But in 1966, the World Health Organisation took what now seems one extraordinary and radical step. It passed a resolution to eradicate smallpox. This disease, spread by a virus called <em>Variola</em> and originally called ‘small’ pox to distinguish it from the ‘great’ pox of syphilis, once killed, blinded or hideously disfigured millions of people each year around the world. In 1966, the WHO decided on a systematic, worldwide cooperation to eliminate the virus altogether. In 1977, the last-ever case of naturally-occurring smallpox was identified in the Horn of Africa.</p> \n<p>In 1968, too, an extraordinary photograph taken from Apollo 8 of Earthrise – of the blue planet Earth rising above the arid, barren landscape of the moon – both prompted and became the emblem of a new awareness of the Earth’s rareness and fragility, and signalled an increasing international concern for the environment and the planet’s resources. All these changes in public perception are more easily identified with hindsight: co-incidentally, by the beginning of this series of revolutions there was already a phrase available to describe them. In 1962, the historian Thomas Kuhn had written an influential book called The Structure of Scientific Revolutions and to characterise changes in attitude of the kind that followed an intellectual revolution, such as the 16<sup>th</sup> century switch from a geocentric universe in which the sun went round the Earth, to a Copernican universe in which the Earth went round the sun, he coined the phrase ‘paradigm shift’. During the 1960s, paradigms had shifted at the cosmic level, the geocentric level, at the social level and at the individual level. This is a story of four of those shifts.</p> \n<p><em>If you would like to read the Science that Changed the World in full now, you can purchase the ebook via the links on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://guardianshorts.co.uk/\">Guardian Shorts website</a>, prices from &pound;1.99.</em><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"546cc920fdba5a4b35dd537ccfc8ada5d9d94251\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430476294088/27563569-a8d0-468f-9d11-68cd4fe22c4f-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Science that Changed the World\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Science that Changed the World.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Shorts</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"News","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430476055815/f1f2073a-ad20-4503-8143-7a0a142b186a-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian Shorts","altText":"Science that Changed the World","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian Shorts"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/1/1430476292904/fb1ad9a6-f49d-4e06-a5ef-e06d06989609-765x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":765,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Science that Changed the World.
