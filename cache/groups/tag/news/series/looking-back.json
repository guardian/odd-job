He identified 15 scripturally-recorded stages by which God made the world, starting with the words ‘And the Earth was without form, and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.’ Science, he reports ‘says that matter existed first in a highly attenuated gaseous condition, called aether, without any form, and non-luminous.’ This aether condensed to form nebulae, and then suns and worlds, which is matched by the next command ‘And God said, Let there be light.’ And so on. There were 1,307,674,368,000 ways in which 15 events could be sequentially arranged, says Kinns, and for science and the story of Genesis to be in such precise agreement at every stage could not possibly be by chance: obviously, God had revealed the story of creation to Moses, and Moses had (presumably) reported the timetable of events in the language and imagery appropriate to a Bronze Age tribe on the run in the desert of Sinai. The churchman was quite right about aether – that is, quite consistent with the science of the time – and even in 1909, Sir Oliver Lodge in his book The Ether of Space advocated ‘a view of the Ether which makes it not only present and all pervading, but also massive and substantial beyond conception. It is turning out to be the most substantial thing – perhaps the only substantial thing – in the material universe.’ Luminiferous aether or ether was a very old idea, invoked by Isaac Newton, and only reluctantly abandoned after Einstein’s 1904 paper on special relativity, and I quote Kinns and Lodge only to demonstrate that right up until 1965, anybody could believe and argue anything they liked about creation. There were really only three options. One was that the universe had no beginning. It was eternal and probably infinite and everything had always existed and although distant galaxies were indeed moving away, the universe would always look like that because new matter was being created continuously, to fill the gaps. The second was that the universe really did have a beginning and could possibly have an end. The second view had some religious support: Jewish, Christian and Islamic faiths all subscribed to the proposition that heaven and Earth were created, along with all the things on Earth, by Jehovah, God or Allah, but although these beliefs were enshrined in a Christian creed – and even non-believers knew this creed through choral masses composed by Bach, Palestrina, Byrd, Mozart and Beethoven – it is fair to say that nobody thought much about the details, and very few people subscribed to the precise sequence of events recounted in the Hebrew book of Genesis. To astronomers, the evidence of the receding galaxies was what mattered: if they were receding now, as if propelled by some initial force, then at a much earlier era they must have been much closer together and before that, all the stars and galaxies must have been just one big bursting blob of incredibly hot, dense stuff, and space-time would have been contorted in a very strange way called a singularity.</p> \n<p>There were powerful scientific proponents for each proposition. Leader and spokesman for the continuous or continual creationist team was the astronomer-royal of Great Britain, Sir Fred Hoyle, and it was he who dismissively coined the term the big bang, to mock his opponents. His team-mates, Hermann Bondi and Thomas Gold, postulated that – to keep the visible galaxy quotient more or less steady – matter was continually created, from nothing, everywhere in the universe. It wasn’t such a big postulate. To replace disappearing galaxies, all the universe had to do was deliver one brand-new atom of hydrogen per litre of volume every billion years. Gold, Bondi and Hoyle were all distinguished scientists with formidable and enduring achievements behind them. On the opposing team were a number of scientists of equal distinction. Among these was a Belgian priest called Georges-Henri Lema&icirc;tre who in 1931 had proposed a beginning for the universe in a ‘primeval atom’ or a ‘cosmic egg.’ Another was the Russian-born George Gamow, who in a famous paper known as Alpher-Bethe-Gamow (the real author was Gamow’s PhD student Ralph Alpher, but Gamow thought it would be fun to co-opt the name of the nuclear weapons scientist Hans Bethe to exploit a joke about the Greek alphabet and it was published on 1 April 1948) calculated that the proportions of hydrogen and helium in the universe could be explained by the cookery conditions in a very hot dense moment of creation. If the universe began hot, and then expanded, it must have cooled but still be detectably warm. So Gamow took a guess at the temperature of space itself: the space not just between the stars, but between the galaxies. The real point of all these stories – from eccentric clerics to fun-loving physicists – is that for most of the rest of the world, they were just stories: made up to explain the world in which we lived. I cannot now remember when I first heard someone say that there was speculation, and then there was wild speculation, and then there was cosmology, but it was probably already an old joke. Right up till 1965 there was no way of knowing who was right: whether the universe and everything in it, had a beginning, or whether it had always been there.</p> \n<p>And then in 1965, two papers appeared in the same edition of Astrophysical Journal Letters. In the first of these, four physicists from Princeton proposed that if the universe had begun as an incredibly hot, small region of space-time – perhaps 10 billion degrees Kelvin – then all that heat would still be there, spread throughout the universe. The universe would cool as it expanded, and if the universe had been expanding for 10 billion years or more, then there would be no glow. This remnant temperature would in fact be ferociously low: a few degrees above absolute zero. But the dark wastes of space would still radiate something that might be ‘heard’ with sensitive antennae. Two of the four scientists had set about the technically challenging task of trying to devise antennae that could tune into this radiation. But, they wrote, two other scientists working for Bell Telephone Laboratories had already tuned into the distant cosmos and – wherever they pointed a sensitive antenna originally designed for communication with the satellite Telstar – they had detected radiation at 7.3cm wavelength, with an intensity that, converted to temperature, would be about 3.5&deg;K, give or take a degree. In the same issue, the two Bell Telephone boffins, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, reported that they had detected an excess temperature that was ‘within the limits of our observations, isotropic, unpolarized and free from seasonal variations.’ That is, it wasn’t radiation from pigeon nests in the antenna structure; it wasn’t something in the atmosphere: it came from outer space and it came from everywhere. They had discovered the cosmic microwave background radiation that should exist if the universe had begun in a blast of heat and violence; they had detected the faint and fading rumbles of the big bang. Someone had predicted the discovery. Someone else, working independently and not even looking for that particular result, had discovered it. Once again, humanity’s picture of the universe had changed. The universe was not eternal or infinite. It had a beginning. Matter, space and time had come into existence at some point in the measurable past.</p> \n<p>So suddenly, serious cosmological researchers had somewhere to start: a beginning. They could contemplate the cosmos as it seemed to be now, and speculate about the initial conditions that made stars, galaxies, gas and dust fall out of some unimaginably hot, dense moment. They could use the Copernican principle to assure themselves that the physics that seemed to be true in the solar system would be just as reliable far away and long ago, nearer the beginning of time. They could use the laws of thermodynamics to begin to compose a budget of mass and energy that would account for the things they could see through optical telescopes and hear with radio telescopes and detect with x-ray telescopes delivered above the atmosphere by experimental rockets. They could use logic, mathematical physics and observation to collect data, frame hypotheses and test them. Within a dozen years, Penzias and Wilson were heading for a Nobel prize, and another Nobel laureate, Steven Weinberg, could compose a popular science classic called The First Three Minutes, which provided an account of exactly that: the things that must have happened in the first three minutes of time, in tiny, detailed, blow-by-blow stages when the world was brand new, and expanding at the speed of light. The universe, wrote Weinberg when he reached the end of his self-allotted third minute ‘will go on expanding and cooling, but not much of interest will happen for another 700,000 years’ when electrons and protons become cool enough to form stable atoms, and get on with the job of making stars and planets. That he could write such a book at all was made possible by Penzias and Wilson in 1965. The most important thing accomplished by their discovery ‘was to force us all to take seriously the idea that there <em>was</em> an early universe.’ The intellectual energy released by the publication of the two papers in 1965 drove research in a number of unexpected directions: theorists used mathematical logic, known physics and a series of ‘what-if’ scenarios to explore the seemingly unknowable – the first few minutes of creation – and ended up with a series of predictions, some of which have been confirmed, both by observation of the distant heavens with ever-more sophisticated instruments, many of them mounted on orbiting spacecraft, and by experiments in a series of increasingly powerful accelerators and colliders in which they could explore the creation of sub-atomic particles and – even more satisfyingly – actually spot the ones that their theories told them should exist. The hectic race to chronicle the brief history of time led researchers to unexpected conclusions. </p> \n<p>One of the most stylish intellectual advances happened in the 1980s, in pursuit of a particle that theory said should exist, and should be difficult to miss, but experience said didn’t exist or at least had never been spotted. The notional missing object was called the magnetic monopole: that is, a tiny magnet with only one pole, which in itself would be pretty strange. It would also be massive, and difficult not to observe. A number of different theories predicted these oddities: no sighting has ever been confirmed. Alan Guth, a young US physicist, picked up the entirely academic challenge of explaining why a particle that should be as easy to find as currants in a bun didn’t seem to exist anywhere. He proposed a strange, short episode in the very early universe – well inside the first trillionth of a second – when space itself did something strange and expanded far faster than light. This bizarre period of inflation ended with a universe so large that the initial pool of monopoles would, in effect, have been diluted out of existence. If a currant bun suddenly became as big as the solar system, you’d not expect to ever see a currant. In fact, cosmic inflation turned out to be a very neat idea: it explained why the universe was more or less the same in every direction, and it explained why the critical density of the universe seemed so nicely balanced between two alternative fates, continual expansion and eventual collapse. Cosmic inflation is not something that can be tested, even in the most powerful particle collider. So it cannot be demonstrated, the way gravitational force is demonstrated with every rocket launch, and every throw of a cricket ball: but it explains so many things that it is now orthodoxy. Physicists still argue about how and why it happened and why and when it stopped, and what exactly happened during the inflationary period, but they seem inclined to accept that there was one. They also accept that something very strange happened when the energy of creation started to condense into matter (the equation that absolutely everybody knows – the one that says that <em>e=mc<sup>2</sup></em> – means exactly what it says:<sup> </sup>energy and mass are equivalent and interchangeable) then what dropped into being should have been equal quantities of matter and antimatter. This is what happens routinely in particle accelerators; it is what theorists had predicted even before the first discovery of antimatter. But we live in a universe composed seemingly only of matter, and quite a lot of this matter has yet to be identified – most of the masses of galaxies are made up of something unexplained and unidentified, but massive, called ‘dark matter’ – so there remain a number of partly-answered or unanswered questions. </p> \n<p>The joyous investigation of the cosmos also raised interesting questions about space and time and the future of everything. What, actually, is time? Does it exist? If you can go in two directions in space, why can you go only in one direction in time? And if space can expand, then it must be something, it must have some sort of fabric: it cannot be nothing, it cannot be emptiness. It must have some sort of energy because the farthest galaxies are receding faster than predictions say they should. The upshot is that physicists can be very precise about some things – that the universe, for instance, is 13.798 billion years old – and very vague about others. They can explain and account for the stars and galaxies but these add up to only about 4% of the mass of the observable universe. The other 96% remains unexplained. They know to great precision the fundamental values and measurements of gravitational, electromagnetic and other forces and so on, but they cannot explain why these forces have the values they do have: on the other hand, they know that if these forces were even the slightest bit different, we would not be here. Matter would not have condensed at the right pace into nebulae, and then into stars. Stars would not have slowly ‘cooked’ hydrogen into carbon, oxygen and iron and all the other elements, and planets would not have formed, and without planets, water, carbon and oxygen, there would have been no life, and no curious, wondering forms of intelligent life. The adventure that began with the 1965 papers has answered some questions with unexpected precision and left others wide open. So it is possible to have some sympathy with the ridiculous Samuel Kinns with whom we began the chapter. It is worth pointing out that 120 years on, we are still left with a universe filled with <em>something</em> that seems to be highly attenuated and without any detectable form, and non-luminous. Aether wouldn’t be the right word, but – since nobody ever found a specimen of aether, or even a proper definition of it – it would not be the wrong word either. And the expectations implicit in Kinns’s argument haven’t gone away. Does it look as though the universe was made so that intelligent life could exist? Or does intelligent life exist because universes are forever popping into random existence and we just happen to be in the one that looks exactly right for the only intelligent life we know about? Freeman Dyson, one of the giants of modern physics, once observed that the universe ‘in some sense must have known that we were coming.’ Albert Einstein once said that the most incomprehensible thing about the universe was that it <em>was</em> comprehensible. Steven Weinberg’s last paragraph in his book The First Three Minutes went even further. ‘The more the universe seems comprehensible,’ he wrote ‘the more it also seems pointless.’ &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> \n<p><em>If you would like to read the Science that Changed the World in full now, you can purchase the ebook via the links on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://guardianshorts.co.uk/\">Guardian Shorts website</a>, prices from &pound;1.99.</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"546cc920fdba5a4b35dd537ccfc8ada5d9d94251\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434120771672/f85c4153-40f8-4a4e-bb46-da968d83252e-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Science that Changed the World\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Science that Changed the World.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Shorts</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"News","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434120829472/fca4c9c3-471b-434b-b08f-895edd96de81-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian Shorts","altText":"Science that Changed the World","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian Shorts"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434120769019/dc3dab08-1d9e-407d-bd62-96099743e60f-765x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":765,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Science that Changed the World.

Accordingly, it is quite difficult to remember how those of us around at the time imagined the world in November 1962, when Harry Hess of Princeton, New Jersey, delivered a text on the History of Ocean Basins, and in September 1963 when Fred J Vine, and his supervisor Drummond Matthews, of the department of geodesy and geophysics at Cambridge, published an article in Nature headed Magnetic Anomalies over Ocean Ridges. Even those of us with only a secondary school science education knew that the planet was very old; that it had been occupied by successive waves of life, much of it now extinct, and known only by fossil evidence. We knew that the planet was dynamic, in the sense that volcanoes intermittently erupted and spilled new material around them, and earthquakes periodically and unpredictably distorted railway lines, offset roads, crumpled bridges and shook structures to fragments. Both kinds of event were arbitrary, or the consequences of forces deep within the planet that nobody understood, and might as well be arbitrary. The first were generally explained as evidence of weakness in the Earth’s crust, and the second by the existence of ancient geological faults. We knew that marine sediments could be found high in the mountains, and therefore the crumpled landforms must once have been submerged by ocean; and we knew that erosion erased those landscapes not continuously renewed by lava flows, so that the world was subject to constant change. We knew – or rather, we were sometimes told – that there had been cataclysmic episodes of unbelievable violence in the ancient past, and such violence might recur, but we happened to be living in a relatively quiet period. We knew that in general, the deepest strata were the oldest rocks, and most of us were brought up to believe that the ocean basins, the deepest surface rocks of all, must therefore be the oldest.</p> \n<p>‘The floor of the deep ocean basins is probably as old as the sea itself,’ wrote Rachel Carson in a 1951 bestseller The Sea Around Us. ‘While the bordering shelves of the continents have known, in alternating geological ages, now the surges of waves and again the eroding tools of wind and frost and rain, always the abyss has lain under the all enveloping cover of miles-deep water.’ And in another enormously influential book published in 1951, called A Land, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes tried to describe the enormous timescales that produced ‘the limestones and sandstones, the chalk and clay that make so great a part of the landscape of Britain. It makes my flesh weary to recall this seemingly endless levelling down. In fact it is not endless. So long as the hard skin on which we live rests on a morass of molten magma, there must come a moment when it will weaken and ruck up, and as the energy long curbed below is freed, the sedimentary rocks that have been laid so quietly on the sea floor may be thrust up ruggedly into the air.’ Both books provide a snapshot of the consensus among British and US earth scientists of the 1950s. For Rachel Carson, the planet was about 2.5 billion years old, and the moon was formed from a huge globule of granite flung away by centrifugal force from the spinning nascent Earth, to hover ever after as an orbiting companion. For her, the continents were more or less where they had always been, sometimes submerged, sometimes exposed. Yes, she like others were aware of the ‘association of island arcs and deep trenches, and always the two occur only in areas of volcanic unrest’ and that this had something to do with the origin of Barbados in the West Indies and Timor in the East Indies. ‘Both have deep-sea deposits, as though they had once been part of the sea-floor. Yet this must be exceptional.’ </p> \n<p>For Jacquetta Hawkes, Dartmoor, Bodmin Moor, Land’s End and the Isles of Scilly were, after 200 million years of erosion, the remnants of mountain ranges pushed up by molten substances that ‘must in their day have been 10 times their present height. These then are the stuff of this land and all lands: the sedimentary rocks formed during the long periods of denudation, and the igneous or fiery rocks – granites, rhyolites, basalts and gabbros – which at many different times must have penetrated or broken through them.’ Europe’s four active volcanoes – Vesuvius, Stromboli, Etna and Hekla – are ‘the last feeble throes on the Alpine convulsion’ slight ripples of which had ‘tipped up some chalk in the south of England.’ Both writers knew that a great deal remained unexplained: Jacquetta Hawkes, in particular, describes Gondwanaland, that vast continent that for 400 million years ‘was to unite South America, Africa, Arabia, southern India and Australia in one continuous landmass and the proto-Atlantic Ocean’ but not why and how it broke up. Rachel Carson described the mid-Atlantic ridge, its general course flexing at the equator between ‘the hump of Brazil and the eastward curving coast of Africa. To some people this curvature has suggested the ridge was one part of a great continental mass, left behind, in mid-ocean when according to one theory, the continents of North and South America drifted away from Europe and Africa.’ She does not countenance this as an explanation: how could she? The thick masses of sediments on the Atlantic floor ‘required hundreds of millions of years for their sedimentation.’ For her, and for Hawkes, the ocean floor was the basement, the foundation, the oldest part of the planet. It was pretty difficult to imagine how a continent could migrate across it. The seeming snugness of fit of the Brazilian bump and the west African concavity was just as likely to be a co-incidence: just one of those puzzling things in a perpetually puzzling world. There were, indeed, as both writers seem casually to concede, schools of thought that contended that continents could move. It was just that nobody could imagine how the continents could have moved, and then propose an empirical way of proving that they did.</p> \n<p>Between 1951 and 1961, however, some new and compelling evidence had emerged. When basalt lavas cool, the iron mineral crystals in them line up in ways that point to the magnetic north pole. Researchers armed with highly sensitive magnetometers developed in the 1950s discovered that the direction of this magnetism seemed to vary quite considerably, according to the age of the rocks. It didn’t take long to discover that the rocks pointed in puzzling directions: either the magnetic north pole kept moving (which it does, a bit) or the continents on which the rocks had formed had performed a slow and stately, but also very peculiar dance. During the same period, details of the submarine continental shelf contours became better known, and enterprising geologists began looking to see whether west Africa and Brazil really did fit or whether the visible match was just an illusion fashioned by the latest variation in sea levels. The answer was the same: in fact, 500 metres below sea level, the fit was even better. And resourceful researchers looked at the scars left by one huge, ancient glaciation in west Africa and traced its path all the way to the coast. On the other side of the Atlantic, exactly where the jigsaw puzzle outline of one continent fitted the other, they observed the continuation of the glacial path. At the end of this track, they found rocks that could only have been shunted there from central Africa. </p> \n<p>There was yet another discovery in the deep oceans: the slow realisation that the greatest mountain range on Earth actually existed in the mid-Atlantic, running from volcanic Iceland to volcanic Tristan da Cunha, and stretched around the continents to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and that one continuous chain of mountains stretched for 65,000km. </p> \n<p>In 1962, Harry Hess of Princeton put all the evidence together and said ‘the continents have moved by large amounts in geologically comparatively recent times. One may quibble over the details but the general picture on palaeomagnetism is sufficiently compelling …’ He then proposed that deep in the planet’s mantle, where the rocks formed a hot, slowly bubbling porridge, convection forced an achingly slow but inexorable movement of the planet’s crust, and the bits that moved were actually the ocean floor – none of which (another recent discovery) seemed to be more than 200 million years old. So the ocean floor was a conveyor belt that carried the continents around. </p> \n<p>And in 1963, Fred J Vine and his PhD supervisor Drummond Matthews, of Cambridge University, came up with a proposal in the journal Nature that clinched the argument. They reasoned that if Harry Hess was right, then new rocks were bubbling up at the centres of the ocean ridges, cooling, forming new basalt, and imperceptibly pushing the ocean floor away from the centre, on each side of the ridge. The old sea floor at the extremes of the ocean was somehow being destroyed: conspicuously, in the Pacific at least, in a deep trench that ran parallel to the Andes of South America. Since – every few million years or so – the Earth’s magnetic field reverses itself, with north at the south pole and the south pole suddenly in the Arctic ocean, and then back again, the ocean floor basalt on either side of the ridge would be marked by fat parallel lines where the magnetic direction of the rocks were alternately pointed north and south. If so, the ocean floor would be not just a conveyor belt, but a magnetic tape recorder that carried evidence of its own movement.</p> \n<p>Because Vine and Matthews were proved right, the prediction doesn’t look so courageous now. But at the time, it was pretty daring. In the first place, not everybody agreed that the poles had in fact periodically reversed themselves. And those who thought that such things had happened could not name a period in which even the most recent switch had occurred. That is because ocean floor research was still in its infancy, and the basalt in question was buried beneath lots of oceanic mud, and because during the cold war readings from submarine instrumentation remained a military secret, and techniques for actually dating rocks were still being developed. But within three years, oceanography had grown up a bit, researchers had dug a bit deeper, and the secret was out: by 1966, it had become possible to suggest a timescale of reversals for the last three and a half million years, and just as Vine and Matthews had predicted, these reversals were recorded in the ocean floor, on either side of the ridge. Sea floor spreading was real, and the continents were shifting.</p> \n<p>And upon that discovery, over the next few years an amazing number of things became clear, explicable and even predictable. The crust of the planet was not randomly faulted, with bits where the crust was inexplicably thin. The crust of the planet was broken into large pieces, all moving and grinding against each other. Sometimes individual plates rammed against each other and stuck together, to fracture and separate somewhere else. Sometimes fissures developed in great plates and then stopped altogether: the Great Rift Valley of eastern Africa is now seen as a division that stopped as soon as it had begun. The new paradigm began to explain all sorts of geographical ironies and oddities. Scotland and England really did turn out to be separate countries, first joined together by some ancient collision of landmasses hundreds of millions of years before the parliamentary Act of Union in 1707. The geological similarities that prompted the first European settlers in Canada to call a place Nova Scotia were not accidental. They were looking at bits of continental structure from which Scotland had separated. The Black Forest in Germany and the Vosges in France can be seen not as two parallel mountain ranges with remarkably similar geology and shape, but as a single mountain range split down the middle and then divided by a slumped stretch of land called a graben, a hollow to be scoured and filled with silt by a drainage system later to be named the Rhine. The Andes were still rising because the ocean floor was disappearing down a trench, with telltale attendant violence (the resultant earthquakes being shallowest on the eastern side of the range and deepest on the west), and pushing them up. The Himalayas existed because what is now India had broken off from the ancient southern supercontinent, and smashed into Asia, creating both the mountain range and the Tibetan plateau. The new perception meant that explanations could multiply, and continue to multiply. It explained volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands and earthquakes in Japan. It explained why earthquakes were frequent in California but not in Massachusetts, and why a fossilised carboniferous forest lay under the deep snows of Antarctica. The tropical monsoon system existed because the moisture laden air met the Himalayan barrier, rose, cooled and condensed into seasonal tropical downpours. Not only did this fill the Yangzte and the Yellow River, the Mekong, the Ganges and the Indus, and deliver the bounty to feed more than two billion people, it also removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and locked it up in sedimentary rocks. In the course of doing so, it may also have lowered the planet’s overall temperature and precipitated millions of years of ice ages.</p> \n<p>But the new paradigm began to explain not just this or that feature of the planet’s present surface: it began to explain almost everything, from the concentration of gold and silver into seams in the mountains of California or Argentina to the ever renewing cycle of water and carbon dioxide from volcanic discharges; why there were marsupials in Australia but placental mammals everywhere else; why mountain formation kept pace with the levelling processes of erosion. It also explained why Earth was a stable home for life: not cold and dead and arid and airless like Mars. Life could exist on Earth because the planet itself was still, in some sense, alive. It offered a self-renewing habitable space, an ideal home under continuous redecoration and repair, fully air-conditioned and supplied with running hot and cold water, courtesy of an all-purpose under-floor central heating system and a dynamic interior that at the same time generated an upper atmosphere magnetic shield to protect life on Earth from the most hazardous cosmic and solar assault. Not all of this was apparent in September 1963, when Vine and Matthews published a three-page paper in Nature headed Magnetic Anomalies over Oceanic Ridges. But that was one identifiable moment in which our collective view of the world in which we live began to change, and change forever.</p> \n<p><em>If you would like to read the Science that Changed the World in full now, you can purchase the ebook via the links on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://guardianshorts.co.uk/\">Guardian Shorts website</a>, prices from &pound;1.99.</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"546cc920fdba5a4b35dd537ccfc8ada5d9d94251\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432903052363/b3189e43-d502-4228-afc1-833e4237db3b-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Science that Changed the World\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Science that Changed the World.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian Shorts</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"News","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432903116634/35f9486c-16c7-469d-9272-689622916f6f-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian Shorts","altText":"Science that Changed the World","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian Shorts"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432903051098/3118292b-b294-4314-a9d3-d5ce95e692d6-765x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":765,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Science that Changed the World.
