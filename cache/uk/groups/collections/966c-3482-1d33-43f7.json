For the day, though, it was a game that stopped a nation. Maybe only the 1995 World Cup final in South Africa and Fiji beating the British Lions in Suva in 1977 come close in terms of national impact.<br /></p> \n<p>Indeed, the miracle may not have been the All Blacks fronting up in Apia, but rather Manu Samoa getting its best players together for what will no doubt go down as a historic event in the tiny country which became independent from New Zealand in 1962. That Manu Samoa’s foreign-based players did commit – many at their own expense – says just how much the match meant to the Samoan people. </p> \n<p>Locals have been going bonkers all week in anticipation. The Samoan Government declared an official half-day, although hardly anybody did any work. They’ve been too busy singing gorgeous island tunes, serenading not just their own team but the All Blacks as well. All Blacks captain Richie McCaw and Dan Carter are rock stars from another planet.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ddc73e590392f3c968b174dcdc20fd70c8cf05e6\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ddc73e590392f3c968b174dcdc20fd70c8cf05e6/0_58_2785_1673/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richie McCaw is given a royal welcome at Faleolo Airport on 6 July.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richie McCaw is given a royal welcome at Faleolo Airport on 6 July.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah Peters/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>To be sure, the small island nation – population 190,000 odd – can rightfully claim NZ rugby owes her a debt of gratitude given Samoa has provided the All Blacks with some of its best players since the 1960s, if not even earlier. Players like Frank Bunce, Tana Umaga, Jerry Collins, Bryan Williams, Mills Muliaina, Rodney So’oialo, Va’aiga Tuigamala and countless others. </p> \n<p>In today’s All Black line-up, players with Samoan heritage included Sonny Bill Williams, Keven Mealamu, Jerome Kaino, Charles Piutau, George Moala, and Nepo Laulala. The Hurricanes’ Julian Savea and Ma’a Nonu would have played too had they not booted up for last weekend’s Super Rugby final.<br /></p> \n<p>So much fanfare and expectation. As for the game? It fizzled – a dour albeit tense contest with the All Blacks scraping home 25-16. The early verdict seems to be the All Blacks were poor – not unexpected given the tight scheduling of the fixture so soon after the Super final. The hard Apia stadium turf and blazing sun and humidity wasn’t exactly to the All Blacks’ liking either. </p> \n<p>“I was just pretty glad a bit of cloud came over because it was pretty hot without the sun. So I’d hate to think ... I don’t know if I would have strung words together,” McCaw said. “I’m just pleased we managed to get on the right side of the scoreboard.” </p> \n<p>Indeed, the All Blacks skipper spoke not in jest; his team held on for dear life in a what at times was a brutal contest. Head knocks to Colin Slade and Moala are just the first confirmed injuries. It’s possible many more will be reported in coming days.<br /></p> \n<p>For Samoa, this was the best performance against the All Blacks, eclipsing their 35-13 loss in 1993. The biggest takeaway for the All Blacks will be the performance of Dan Carter. The maestro looked very sharp in trying conditions with a 20-point haul off the boot, and a try-assist for Moala’s five pointer. With Beauden Barrett’s wobbles off the tee in the Super final, the All Blacks No1 five eighth selection for the World Cup looks a whole let clearer courtesy of the Apia Test – Carter in a canter. Was there ever any doubt?<br /></p> \n<p>Alas, these are one of those rare games were the rugby itself doesn’t really matter. It’s all about the occasion, the carnival festival and the joy of a whole nation feeling happy about themselves and their place in the world. The All Blacks might only be a rugby team, but they brought more smiles than aid dollars today. <br /></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/debd8bf4e072dc526b0f89775aee494692795626/0_198_2999_1802/2999.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1802,"width":2999,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Fiona Goodall/Getty Images","altText":"Iose Amosa and his son Amosa, five months old, join fans at Otahuhu Rugby Club to watch the international Test match played in Apia between the All Blacks and Samoa.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Fiona Goodall/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/ddc73e590392f3c968b174dcdc20fd70c8cf05e6/0_58_2785_1673/2785.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1673,"width":2785,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Richie McCaw is given a royal welcome at Faleolo Airport on 6 July.

More than six weeks later he still wears a back brace all day, and is some way from riding on the roads again.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Fabian Cancellara <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/fabian-cancellara-withdraws-tour-de-france\" title=\"\">crashed heavily amid a pile up in the Tour de France peloton</a>. CT scans later showed the Swiss cyclist had fractured two vertebrae and had to withdraw from the race – but not before he had finished the last 30 miles of the stage.</p> \n<p>That Cancellara is resilient was never really in doubt. This is a man, whose flat-out speed was so relentless that, a few years ago, someone started the (entirely false) rumour that he must have a small electric motor concealed inside his bike frame.</p> \n<p>But more widely, the incident shows once again that for all their sometimes spindly physiques – Nairo Quintana, the Colombian who is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/tour-de-france-2015-chris-froome-alberto-contador-nairo-quintana-vincenzo-nibali-cycling\" title=\"\">one of this year’s Tour favourites</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bikeradar.com/road/gear/article/pro-bike-nairo-quintanas-tour-de-france-canyon-ultimate-cf-slx-44680/\" title=\"\">weighs in at just 58kg</a> – professional cyclists are tough. Ridiculously tough.</p> \n<p>Crashes are part of their job. Professional cyclists have almost other-worldly bike-handling skills, but if you are riding at 30mph amid a packed group of a hundred or more, the slightest error, often someone else’s, can bring a world of pain.</p> \n<p>The classic cyclists’ injury is the broken collarbone, the result of the instinctive urge to stretch out an arm to break a fall. Such a mishap saw <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/bradleywiggins\" title=\"\">Bradley Wiggins</a> forced to quit the 2011 Tour. But back injuries are far from unknown. Monday’s crash was the second time in four months that Cancellara has suffered such an injury.</p> \n<p>The pro cyclists’ instinctive reaction to a crash is, if they possibly can, to climb back on the bike and assess the damage while riding on, getting patched up by a team doctor leaning out of a car window.</p> \n<p>Among the most famous examples is the Dutch rider <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/jul/11/team-sky-flecha\" title=\"\">Johnny Hoogerland in the 2011 Tour</a>. He was catapulted into a barbed wire fence at high speed after another rider was clipped by a TV car, lacerating his legs and buttocks, and requiring an eventual 33 stitches. While most of us would sit at the side of the road and howl, Hoogerland got back on the bike, doing well enough in the stage to take the King of the Mountains jersey. He finished the Tour.</p> \n<p>Perhaps more astonishing too was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/books/the-secret-race-by-tyler-hamilton-and-daniel-coyle.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Tyler Hamilton in the 2002 Giro d’Italia</a>, an era before the US rider was tainted by drugs bans.

But could Johnathan Thurston be the greatest Origin player of all time? Yes, better even than the King, Wally Lewis, a man whose statue stands watch outside the former Lang Park in much the same way as Christ the Redeemer overlooks Rio de Janeiro?<br /></p> \n<p>Of course, in the entertaining (but admittedly pointless) quest to elevate one above the other, there are strong cases to be made for both of them; and Andrew Johns, Mal Meninga, Darren Lockyer, Brad Fittler and Cameron Smith too, while we’re at it. </p> \n<p>No-one, for instance, has made such a mark on Origin as Lewis. One of its founding fathers, Lewis had a profound influence on the Maroons, and with him at five-eighth, and captain, Queensland won seven of the first 10 Origin series. Perhaps just as tellingly, after his retirement the Maroons secured just five of the next 14. And it wasn’t just results he influenced. Lewis played a major role in creating the sporting and cultural juggernaut that is Origin today. And he did it not just with his skills and firing synapses but the sheer force of his presence. </p> \n<p>Thurston doesn’t have the bare-knuckled belligerence of Lewis the player: he seems too boyish for that, what with his kookaburra laugh and his playful sense of humour. Nor does Thurston, despite the damage he’s done to NSW, inspire hate from across the border as Lewis once did (pantomime hate though it may have been for most). No, even the most one-eyed of Blues supporters would struggle to dislike Thurston. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/07/nsw-state-of-origin-aaron-woods-profile\">NSW State of Origin star Aaron Woods: the mummy's boy with a warrior spirit | Patrick Skene</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But while Thurston doesn’t have the aura of Lewis he shares his unquenchable thirst to win, and with Thurston this is in evidence no matter the occasion or location, be it an Origin decider at Suncorp Stadium, a Test match at Old Trafford, or a friendly table tennis game within the confines of the North Queensland Cowboys’ clubhouse. Some athletes are afraid to win, afraid of the effort it will take and the cost it may bear. Thurston seems afraid to lose. </p> \n<p>Thurston also has arrows in his quiver that Lewis didn’t, like a prodigious step and near faultless goal-kicking. And unlike Lewis, who bustled on the field and relied more on strength than speed, the slighter- framed Thurston has an impish air, the cheek to try the unexpected. Doze off for a moment and Thurston will have managed the rugby league equivalent of tying an opponent’s shoelaces together and sticking a ‘kick me’ sign on his back </p> \n<p>More significantly, however, no-one has Thurston’s numbers. From the time the then 22-year-old former Souths Sunnybank junior debuted for the Maroons in the 2005 series, to the time of writing, Thurston has amassed figures as good as any Origin player in history: 19 wins (equal with Lewis and Lockyer), a 63% winning record (better than anyone), most points in Origin (174 and counting, ahead of Meninga’s 161) and most consecutive Origin matches (30, surpassing Gary Larson’s 24).Thurston was the only player to have played in all 24 games during the eight years of Queensland’s reign. </p> \n<p>Hard to believe, then, that early in Queensland’s streak there existed a school of thought that Thurston — already a star at NRL level — hadn’t quite imposed himself on Origin football in his first four games (2005 and Game I, 2006), and that perhaps Scott Prince might be a better option to partner Lockyer in the halves. But Thurston soon put paid to such nonsense and over the course of the streak he showed that when the biggest games came down to the wire he was at his best. The mark of a champion if there ever was one. As his Cowboys team-mate Paul Bowman once said of him, “He just has that ability to keep pushing himself beyond what most other guys do. You see him in the 80th minute keep turning up, keep turning up.” </p> \n<p>In the decisive Game III of the 2006 series it was Thurston whose chip kick set up Queensland’s opening try, and it was Thurston whose break late in the match from deep in his own half led directly to the Brent Tate four-pointer that got Queensland believing, <em>knowing</em>, they could pull the game out of the fire and put an end to their three-year losing streak. And after being man of the match in Game I, 2007, it was Thurston’s grubber kick in Game II of that year that found Steve Bell for the match-winning, series-sealing, try. </p> \n<p>In 2008 Thurston faced one of his biggest challenges, leading Queensland’s attack in the absence of an injured Lockyer. Prior to the series he spoke about not putting any added pressure on himself “by saying I’m going to step up and be the man with Locky away”. But that’s precisely what he did. It his ‘show and go’ with the scores level in the deciding game that saw Billy Slater score the winning try beside the uprights.</p> \n<p>One could go on like this at length, highlighting the moments, the games, when Thurston came into his own. But perhaps the most telling of these was following Locker’s retirement at the end of the 2011 series, when Thurston took Lockyer’s jumper and all the additional expectation and pressure that came with it. Queensland could have used the retirement of one of their greats as an excuse to lose, considering how much effort it takes to win. After six-straight series who would begrudge them a loss in the wake of their talismanic captain leaving the game? </p> \n<p>But Thurston, among others, would have none of it. In the deciding game of the 2012 series—before which he used a sports psychologist to help him deal with the pressure—it was another man-of-the-match performance from Thurston that helped get Queensland over the line 21-20. “There’s a fair bit of relief tonight,” he said after that win, sealed after a memorable field-goal by Cooper Cronk. “We were under a fair bit of pressure. We just had great self belief and we’re like a big family. I’m just so proud and pleased to be a part of it.” </p> \n<!-- Error: Failed to load image asset --> \n<p>Just as proud and pleased were the Maroons faithful who now had a new king to coronate.

He was the mercurial winger who failed to have enough of these to make him a Manchester United force. On Monday Fenerbahce <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/06/fenerbahce-nani-manchester-united-transfer\" title=\"\">paid only €6m (&pound;4.3m) to take Nani</a> to the Turkish club. This low fee for a player just two years into a five-season deal underlines how his stock at Old Trafford had crashed.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2013/sep/05/nani-new-contract-manchester-united\" title=\"\">That contract</a>, awarded by David Moyes, caused the cognoscenti’s eyebrows to be raised. When Louis van Gaal’s predecessor granted Nani fresh terms worth around &pound;115,000 a week the winger was already in freefall. The Portuguese’s inconsistency was proving final.</p> \n<p>The previous campaign of 2012-13 had been dismal. Three goals in 21 appearances, of which 15 were starts, was the return in Sir Alex Ferguson’s final year in charge. United won the title, to hand Nani a fourth winner’s medal of his what-might-have-been time at the club.</p> \n<p>He was the enigma’s enigma. During eight years in Manchester the faithful were caught in an unwanted game of jam tomorrow, hoping the tricks, skill and undoubted talent would move from maddening flashes to menacing consistency.</p> \n<p>This was the feat achieved by Cristiano Ronaldo, the countryman who preceded Nani’s arrival at United by four years and who left in 2009 having alchemised a supreme talent into being the world’s best player, alongside Lionel Messi.</p> \n<p>If Ronaldo is the impossible act to emulate for every footballer of the current generation bar the Argentinian, Nani can hardly peer in the mirror and see someone who fulfilled his potential at United. He is still only 28, in the midst of the supposed golden years, but Nani’s career “peak” may prove to be the registering of 10 goals in each of the 2010-11 and 2011-12 seasons.</p> \n<p>For all elite athletes the defining challenge is mental – to perform at their best on virtually any given day. The former Sporting Lisbon man failed too often. Nani’s highlights reel may be a riveting spectacle but the feature-length film of the United years contains too many duff scenes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2c5a0d481f5183b6e165288bee85d8c33a6272b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436260994071/87bd16db-0987-49b6-88d2-b85a51466b51-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nani was given a hero's welcome at the airport in Istanbul by Fenerbahce fans who are delighted he has joined the club.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nani was given a hero’s welcome at the airport in Istanbul by Fenerbahce fans who are delighted he has joined the club.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ozan Kose/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Those double-digit goalscoring campaigns were the best of times for him. The 2010-11 season was capped by being voted United’s finest performer by team-mates. On being crowned the players’ player of a season in which he helped propel the club to the title and the 2011 Champions League final, Nani told Manutd.com: “I have done my best to help the team win the league and, of course, I have been very focused on working hard and improving as a player. This has been my most consistent season for United. Every year I’ve been here I have improved and this one was fantastic for me. I created a lot of goals and scored more than last season, so I’m very happy. I hope to do even better next season.”</p> \n<p>The following September the United website offered a feature entitled “The evolution of Nani”. It stated that winning the best player gong had established him among his peers. “It was very important for me inside the dressing room, with my team-mates,” he said. “It showed me that now everyone knows my position inside, on the team, and how important I am in the team, how much responsibility I have for the team and the club as well. That’s making me more confident, making me happier, making me want more responsibility. Now I’m in the right position to do everything I wanted in the past.”</p> \n<p>But on match-day Nani could only flicker in and out of the consciousness. Even in that award-winning term Ferguson had not trusted him to start the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2011/may/28/barcelona-manchester-united-champions-league-final\" title=\"\">European Cup final at Wembley</a>, a showpiece lost 3-1 to Messi’s Barcelona.</p> \n<p>Having signed for United in summer 2007 from Sporting Lisbon for &pound;17m the record shows four goals in 41 appearances in 2007-8, six in 30 (08-09), six in 38 (09-10), 10 in 48 (10-11), 10 in 39 (11-12), three in 21 (12-13), and one in 13 outings in 13-14.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e844ef8f5e0f4baa0c75b39a2c41bb068bebd33\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436261108968/f2a7c7ff-0564-4861-a85b-43b186bb7dd7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nani spent last season on loan at Sporting and scored 11 goals, more than in any single season with Manchester United.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nani spent last season on loan at Sporting and scored 11 goals, more than in any single season with Manchester United.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Costa/NurPhoto/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>These are disappointing numbers. The opening match apart, last year was spent on loan back at Sporting. United, keen to put him in the shop window to attract a suitor, paid all of Nani’s salary. He promptly surpassed his best ever United tally by scoring 11 for Sporting. It suggested the Primeira Liga was his natural level.</p> \n<p>As he contemplates Super Lig football, the CV shows four Premier League titles, the Champions League, the League Cup and the Fifa Club World Cup. But Nani will not be remembered as a serial winner who accrued an impressive haul of honours.</p> \n<p>Instead he was the underachiever with an embarrassment of disappointing epitaphs: Ronaldo-lite, the great pretender, a maverick without portfolio, the best United player never to show his best consistently.</p> \n<p>He once said: “That’s one dream I’ve got: to be the best in the world. But I don’t let it frustrate me.”</p> \n<p>To achieve what he could have, perhaps Nani should have allowed more exasperation in.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436260858613/Nani-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Manchester United's willingness to sell Nani to Fenerbahce for £4.3m shows how far his stock has fallen.

The 20 days in which the race has wound around the Hexagon have seen the withdrawal of the mighty Festina squad after their soigneur Willy Voet was caught with a carload of EPO, the bitter tears of a peroxided Richard Virenque, a series of hotel raids that led to all four Spanish teams dropping out of the race, a procession of arrests, confessions and sit-down protests, and a jut-chinned rebel sitting cross legged in the road as the race teetered on the edge of disaster. That image of “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Pantani\">il Pirata</a>”, his goateed face the picture of insouciance, has become iconic.</p> \n<p>Five days after his victory at Plateau de Beille, Marco Pantani pulled on the Yellow Jersey after an extraordinary stage to les Deux-Alpes. Crossing the line, he closed his eyes and raised his arms in a cross, a new Christ crucified. Attacking 5km from the summit of the Galibier, 48km from the finish in Deux-Alpes, the slight figure of the Italian took flight in the high mountains. He crushed the hopes of an out-of-condition Jan Ullrich, who floundered in adrift in the pouring rain, the German crumbling in the face of the Italian climber’s utter dominance. Pantani called his victory “the best day of my career” and dedicated his win to Luciano Pezzi who had steered Felice Gimondi to victory in 1965.</p> \n<p>Rewind to June 1998. The sodden martyr of the Deux-Alpes is now the consecrated Christ of the Montecampione. Pantani goes into the stage with a slender 27” lead over Pavel Tonkov. There’s a 34km time-trial to come, where the solid Russian will surely assert his dominance. Pantani has one chance to win the Giro as the race winds through the enchanted valley of the Bresciano. He has one chance to find the moment of magic that will put enough time between himself and his unexpected rival. And finally he finds it. The Italian attacks again and again until he breaks the thread that binds Tonkov to his wheel and he is gone. Pantani carries his slender lead into the time-trial where the Maglia Rosa seems to give him wings. The Giro is his.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0bcd5ae3540f0237f0f4392d803cbeb0dd2e08d5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436182108809/62f9fc55-15e8-4ba2-85d2-31c583a07eff-460x321.jpeg\" alt=\"Marco Pantani\" width=\"460\" height=\"321\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marco Pantani stands on the podium after winning the 1998 Tour de France</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Rebours/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s the summer of 1987 and Channel 4 are in their second year of covering the Tour de France. The mad, epic glory is bursting on to our screens in full glorious colour from the narrow confines of the monochrome newsprint to which cycling had previously been confined. We’ve lived the internecine drama of the 1986 Tour and now we’re insatiable. Who will feed our appetite for the grand exploit and some good old-fashioned team infighting?</p> \n<p>Stephen Roche is no tortured martyr of the velo. The Irishman was always a more calculating rider, though he shares the Italian’s individuality. And he will not only take the Double but he will go on to add the Rainbow Stripes of the <a href=\"http://www.podiumcafe.com/2010/9/27/1714556/a-worlds-tale-stephen-roche-villach-austria-1987\">world champion in Villach, Austria</a>, with a blistering attack just 500m from the finish line on a rain sodden afternoon to take the Triple Crown. Only one other rider has ever achieved that feat – step forward Eddy Merckx.</p> \n<p>By the time Roche arrived on the start line in West Berlin, two years before the Wall came tumbling down, he had already won the Giro in controversial circumstances. The Irishman finally beat his team-mate Roberto Visentini after the balance of power had see-sawed between them throughout the race. First blood went to Visentini in the prologue. It was advantage Roche in the Poggio time-trial and the Pink Jersey after Carrera won the time trial. But Visentini fought back – by stage 13 his lead was 2’42”. Roche had said the road would decide who deserved to be the leader and the road had spoken.</p> \n<p>But if it had, Roche wasn’t listening.</p> \n<p>There was no love lost between Roche and Visentini. The Italian felt he was the rightful team leader - he was the defending champion and Roche had lost most of the 1986 season to a knee injury. The Irishman accused the Italian of being a dilettante who didn’t need to ride a bike: a daddy’s boy, a playboy, not a team player. And in 1987 Roche was in the form of his life, coming into the Giro off the back of a string of wins and podium places. Then came the betrayal – Visentini reneged on his promise to ride for Roche at the Tour de France. “Balls,” said Visentini in an interview in 2014, after he learned that Roche had been inducted into the Giro Hall of Fame, “an excuse made up to explain what happened.”</p> \n<p>For the Italian, the events of stage 15 dealt him a psychological blow from which he never recovered. On the road to Sappada, the fratricidal struggle at the heart of the Carrera team played itself out over 224km and three tough mountain passes. It was Romulus and Remus on bicycles. If LeMond had slain the Badger on the roads of France in 1986, then Roche would knock the shine off Golden Boy Visentini in Italy.</p> \n<p>The deed was done. But Roche didn’t take the heat Hinault did the year before – maybe fans and media are sentimental enough to believe in chivalry and chauvinistic enough to excuse an English-speaking rider. Visentini had played with Roche’s head and his team had tried to silence him. The next day, on what became known as the “Marmolada Massacre”, Roche rode on head high, flanked by Scotland’s Robert Millar, as the crowds jeered and booed, soaked him in wine, spit and who knows what. He discovered a tough streak in his nature that he never knew he had. “My attitude towards the public was: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2012/jun/04/tour-de-france-stephen-roche\">‘Say what you want, I am not going home.’</a>” It was the ideal preparation for the Double, which is won as much in the head as by the legs.</p> \n<p>Roche’s French triumph was built on one of the most iconic stages in modern Tour de France history, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/tomfordyce/2012/06/stephen_roche_remembers_one_sp.html\">stage 21 from Bourg-d’Oisans to La Plagne</a>. The stage when the Irishman rode himself into and beyond the red, necessitating oxygen after he crossed the finish line. The stage when he saved the Tour by crossing the line only seconds after the Spanish climber Pedro Delgado to the immortal, disbelieving words of Phil Liggett: “Just who is that rider coming up behind – because that looks like Roche! That looks like Stephen Roche!” It was Roche – and he would ride into the Yellow Jersey during the final time-trial.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"434e4736becc7708196d119373789a0083d2d597\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436184871110/6cde7128-c548-4660-ad2e-9c7816e3d4de-460x298.jpeg\" alt=\"Roche\" width=\"460\" height=\"298\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Roche at his home in Ireland in August 1987.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photosport/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Spain’s Miguel Indurain came close to matching Roche and Merckx – after precisely engineering the Double in 1992 and 1993 through his unstoppable prowess against the clock, it was a brash young American called Lance Armstrong who came between “Big Mig” and the Triple Crown in Oslo in 1993. When Armstrong was summarily stripped of his titles in 2014, he was allowed to keep those Rainbow Stripes.</p> \n<p>Like the “sphinx of Pamplona”, “<em>Ma&icirc;tre</em>” Jacques Anquetil constructed his Grand Tour victories by demoralising the opposition by crushing them in the race of truth. Anquetil’s only Double – in a career that saw him become the first rider to win all three of the Grand Tours – came in 1964, and he won it in atypical style, by beating his eternal rival Raymond Poulidor on the legendary climb of the Puy de Dome.</p> \n<p>Look in the dictionary under <em>mano a mano</em> and you’ll see a black and white image of the two Frenchman going elbow to elbow, on the roughly paved slopes of the extinct volcanic conk of the Puy de Dome. With the race ending with a time-trial into Paris, Poulidor had no option but to seize the day on his favoured terrain. 58” behind Anquetil, he would never have a better opportunity to pull on the Yellow Jersey.</p> \n<p>What resulted was an almost mythical battle between guts, courage and determination and the implacable force of cold-hearted calculation. Though Poulidor would cross the line ahead of his rival, Anquetil still clung on to the race lead by a slender 14” – 13 more than he needed, according to Monsieur Chrono. The Norman cracked over the final kilometre and began haemorrhaging time. But too bad for Poulidor – he was incapable of forcing his advantage. He admitted later: “It’s said that Anquetil bluffed me that day, but he didn’t. I was at the end of my strength and so was he. To say I should have attacked earlier is science-fiction.” The fact was Anquetil took the Double and Poulidor would never wear the Yellow Jersey. </p> \n<p>And then there was Merckx. The greatest of them all, who would win an unprecedented – and never equalled – 11 Grand Tours. Merckx didn’t just “do” the Double, he stamped his authority all over both races with margins of victory in the double digits. And he won in the mountains, the time-trials and on the flat showcasing his extraordinary versatility. Never more so than in his last Double in 1974 – on an innocuous stage to Orleans, his shorts soaked with blood from an operation wound that refused to heal, Merckx simply shot away from the peloton like a human bullet and took 1’ 25” from the hard chasing pack over the closing 14km of the stage. It was heady stuff. By the time the race reached Paris, Merckx had won a record eight stages.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3636684f652278da1d7d92849c9c137e13ec2c6d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436184266289/7e93ac58-85d1-4bf8-8ec2-3bbd4dddcc98-460x342.jpeg\" alt=\"Merckx\" width=\"460\" height=\"342\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eddy Merckx in action during the 1970 Tour de France.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Bernard Hinault – “the Badger” – announced himself as the most fearsome rider since Merckx by winning both the Vuelta and the Tour at the age of 23. The effortless way he cruised to the Giro-Tour Double in 1982 only confirmed that here was the first rider in a generation to challenge the career achievements of the Cannibal. But 1985 was different. A hard-fought win over Francesco Moser in Italy saw him take the race with a slender margin of 1’ 08” over the Italian who had pushed him every inch of the way by sprinting for every time bonus available. Moser might have overhauled the deficit but he simply ran out of road. Lurking behind the Sheriff, and taking the third spot on the podium, was another young hot shot American by the name of Greg Lemond.</p> \n<p>The story of the 1985 Tour de France is often overshadowed by the internecine warfare of the 1986 race when Hinault was forced to make good on a promise to his younger team-mate, though not without a fight. And it was Lemond who would prove Hinault’s closest rival in 1985 after his team leader crashed heavily during a bunch sprint into St Etienne. The indomitable Badger was wounded, his nose broken and his eyes blackened – bloodied but definitely unbowed. He would win, but not without a little help from his friends – chiefly LeMond. </p> \n<p>It was the American that took off after Delgado and Roche and neutralised their attacks on the slopes of Luz-Ardiden, when his leader began to flounder in the mist. LeMond claimed he had sacrificed his own chances of overall victory that day to drop back and aid his failing team leader. Hinault knew he owed LeMond a favour and declared publicly, on TV, that next year’s race would be “for the American”. In 1986 we would finally get the shootout at the OK Corral.</p> \n<p>LeMond v Hinault, Anquetil v Poulidor, Coppi v Bartali. These are the great rivalries that have driven riders to achieve the seemingly impossible. And no rivalry was greater than that of Fausto “<em>il Campianissimo</em>” Coppi and Gino “<em>il Piou</em>” Bartali. If Merckx laid waste to his rivals on the way to his Double victories, Coppi was simply on another planet in 1949 when he beat Bartali at the Giro and then the Tour. It was the first Double and the glamourous pin-up of the Italian sport treated the faithful <em>tifosi</em> to a display that remains unparalleled. </p> \n<p>On stage 17 of the Giro – a monstrous 245km of pain that crossed the Maddalena, Vars, Izoard, Montgen&egrave;vre and Sestriere under lowering and unforgiving skies – Coppi simply flew, crossing four of those forbidding Alpine passes alone and riding 190km solo to the finish in Pinerolo. He replicated the feat three years later by crossing the Croix de Fer, Galibier and Montgen&egrave;vre in first place before winning at Sestriere by seven minutes and putting the Tour firmly beyond the reach of his rival. The day before he had become the first man to win on the 21 hairpins of Alpe d’Huez – the first ever summit finish in a Grand Tour. Fausto Coppi was touched by the angels, his effortless pedal stroke propelling him effortlessly into the stratosphere.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c3c533542e9eb48905aca565cdcbd57c81f72cb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436184498482/c56b71a3-91ad-4a08-bdf3-a3babe6f66bd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Coppi\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fausto Coppi at the 1952 Giro D’Italia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olycom SPA / Rex Features</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It took another 12 years before Anquetil matched Coppi’s feat. It is 17 years since Pantani wore Yellow in Paris. Is it possible that Alberto Contador – the slight Spanish rider with the classical climbing style of a true mountain goat and the most calculating cycling brain in the modern sport – can equal that feat? </p> \n<p>He was forced to dig deep, perhaps too deep, during the brutal last week of the Giro. He had 34 days to ready himself for the most mountainous Tour in years, where he faces the combined might of 2013 champion Chris Froome, 2014 Giro winner Nairo Quintana and 2014 Tour de France champion Vincenzo Nibali. Froome and Nibali gave us a tantalising glimpse of their current form at the Criterium du Dauphine. Quintana is already the winner of the Tirreno-Adriatico. All three will have watched Contador’s performance on the Colle de Finestre and perceived either fatal weakness or a calculating champion holding something in reserve for the roads of France.</p> \n<p>Contador has already completed the most difficult part of his journey towards the holy grail of cycling. And as the winner of the 2014 Vuelta, he is on course to become only the third rider in cycling history to hold all three Grand Tour titles consecutively. Only Merckx and Hinault have achieved that feat and they are the greatest of the great. In this modern era of intense specialisation, to match them would be extraordinary.</p> \n<p>Stamina, recovery, calculation, courage, determination, physical and mental toughness all play their part in a successful tilt at cycling’s most glittering prize. As the most successful Grand Tour rider of his generation, Contador has shown an abundance of those qualities in riding to his seven victories. But whether the Tour de France is a race too far, only the road can decide.</p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://100tours100tales.wordpress.com/\">This article appeared first on 100 Tours 100 Tales</a><br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/festinagirl\">Follow Suze Clemitson on Twitter</a><br /></strong></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436182385034/4455da9d-c31b-467d-a5e0-504b8acff97c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Luca Zennaro/EPA","altText":"Contador","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Luca Zennaro/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436182108020/62f9fc55-15e8-4ba2-85d2-31c583a07eff-1020x711.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":711,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Marco Pantani stands on the podium after winning the 1998 Tour de France Photograph: Laurent Rebours/AP","credit":"Laurent Rebours/AP","altText":"Marco Pantani","cleanCaption":"Marco Pantani stands on the podium after winning the 1998 Tour de France","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Laurent Rebours/AP"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436184870151/6cde7128-c548-4660-ad2e-9c7816e3d4de-2060x1334.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1334,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Stephen Roche at his home in Ireland in August 1987.
