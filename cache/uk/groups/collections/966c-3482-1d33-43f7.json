The distrust in the relationship between Madrid’s vice-captain and the president, Florentino P&eacute;rez, is not new but, with Monday morning’s front-page headlines here, it has come to the surface – making rapprochement more difficult. United may feel that their hand has been strengthened.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/21/manchester-united-real-madrid-david-de-gea-sergio-ramos\">Manchester United tell Real Madrid: if you want De Gea, we’ll have Ramos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ramos has two years left on his contract at the Santiago Bernab&eacute;u but it is rare for a renewal to be allowed to run so late and negotiations have been at a standstill for some time, while the relationship between president and player has descended into bitterness, acrimony and mutual suspicion. Ten years after joining the club, Ramos is prepared to leave. The Guardian reported United’s interest on Sunday afternoon and the Spanish sports daily AS followed with the stark headline: “Sergio Ramos Wants to Go Now” on Monday morning.</p> \n<p>On the other side, underlining that this is a battle that is likely to be partly played out in public, deepening the divide between player and president, the sports supplement of the newspaper La Raz&oacute;n opened with a front-page photograph of Ramos celebrating a goal by lifting his hand to his heart, where Madrid’s badge adorns the shirt. It is accompanied by a headline that demands: “Respect the badge!”</p> \n<p>Ramos has been at Real Madrid for 10 years and scored the goal that rescued the d&eacute;cima, their 10th European Cup. He is the club’s vice-captain and has played over 400 games. He was also among those players who fell out with Jos&eacute; Mourinho and publicly defended Carlo Ancelotti. P&eacute;rez did not appreciate that, nor did he welcome Ramos’s demands during contract negotiations. Ramos earns €6m-€7m a year after tax; €12m fewer than Cristiano Ronaldo and less than Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Iker Casillas. P&eacute;rez also does not trust players who accumulate power.</p> \n<p>Ramos believes Madrid have repeatedly briefed against him in an attempt to damage his reputation and his standing with supporters, portraying him as a money-grabber not interested in the club. That sense, which has grown over recent weeks, has come to a head and was reflected in the headline in La Raz&oacute;n this morning – a newspaper that is extremely close to P&eacute;rez.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"66a14916c1bf1991cf379568d792e6ee45593e0c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434988239413/6b4cfd9a-fdc4-4aca-9655-20ba03559ab1-311x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The front page of AS featuring Ramos.\" width=\"311\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The front page of AS featuring Ramos.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AS</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In an aggressive editorial Ramos and his agent are accused of lacking commitment by Josep Pedrerol, who also hosts a TV show that has been critical of the defender and a champion of the president, while his competitors on the TV channel Cuatro are lined up on the other side. “[Ramos] will go down in history as the man who scored the goal of the d&eacute;cima,” La Raz&oacute;n’s editorial reads. “But he could also be remembered as the footballer, who while he was an idol at the [Bernab&eacute;u], auctioned himself to clubs from all round Europe for a few euros.” The suggestion that he might not respect the badge is about the gravest accusation to level at him.</p> \n<p>Last week the Barcelona presidential candidate Jordi Maj&oacute; said that he had been offered Ramos but admitted that he had not spoken to the player or indeed to the player’s agent, who insisted that the story was categorically untrue.</p> \n<p>AS, which has long been critical of P&eacute;rez and a defender of both Ramos and the goalkeeper Casillas, this morning suggested that Ramos was annoyed that Madrid did not deny the story, when other rumours have been denied and other players protected.</p> \n<p>Some supporters naturally concluded that Ramos had offered himself to Madrid’s greatest rival and that, the player’s camp suspect, is exactly the point: that not only did Madrid not deny the story, they were behind it. Real would deny that but there could be no better way of damaging his status and justifying an eventual sale that might otherwise be unpopular with supporters than releasing that rumour. It is a tactic that has been employed before. It also serves as an expression of Madrid’s annoyance at what they see as Ramos’s manner of negotiating and his refusal to accept their first offer of contract renewal.</p> \n<p>While they have not yet said anything publicly (and nor has Ramos), Madrid’s position remains that any interested clubs would have to pay the full buy-out clause, €180m, in other words the player is not for sale. And nor have they received a bid, the line goes. Meanwhile the posturing continues via third parties.</p> \n<p>“Encouraging interest from Barcelona sounds like a joke in very bad taste,” La Raz&oacute;n concluded. Ramos would probably agree, while insisting he was not responsible for doing so. The lack of trust is extreme. It has got nasty already; it may end up getting nastier. United will hope that it ends with them getting their man.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/22/1434987797938/Sergio-Ramos--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A parting of the ways between Real Madrid and their iconic defender Sergio Ramos appears increasingly inevitable.

That will mean that whole epic saga will have to be aborted and the young Spaniard will be forced to remain at United. Unless, that is, Real find some other token of exchange – and this is where the Daily Mail starts to get excited. “<strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong>, <strong>Gareth Bale</strong>, <strong>Karim Benzema</strong>, <strong>Luka Modric</strong>, <strong>Raphael Varane</strong> and <strong>Dani Carvajal </strong>could all come up in negotiations with United,” blurts the giddy organ before adding a disclaimer for the benefit of the light of head: “there are no guarantees that United will get their way.” </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/22/petr-cech-arsenal-chelsea\">Petr Cech closes in on Arsenal move after Chelsea reluctantly pave way</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Meanwhile the Daily Mirror reckons that if De Gea eventually move to Real, Louis Van Gaal will replace him with Ajax goalkeeper <strong>Jasper Cillessen</strong>. You may remember Cillessen as the keeper whom Van Gaal humiliated in the World Cup by hauling him off just before a penalty shootout and replacing him with Tim Krul, all of which raises an interesting issue: if Cillessen joins, what will happen when United concede a penalty at Old Trafford? Ah, yes, silly question. </p> \n<p>Elsewhere, <strong>Manchester City</strong>’s interest in Fabian Delph appears to have cooled, but the club continues to have the hots for <strong>Jack Wilshere</strong> and, if they fail to land Paul Pogba, will submit an offer for the midfielder that Ars&egrave;ne Wenger cannot refuse. Hmm, something about that last sentence doesn’t feel quite right. Reckon it’s that bit about Ars&egrave;ne Wenger, Earth’s most stubborn man, not being able to refuse an offer. Never underestimate Wenger’s powers of refusal. If the man were not a football manager, he would be a record-breaking fakir, capable of lying on beds of nails for years while refusing to acknowledge any pain. Having said that, Wenger’s concentration may be weak at the moment, as word is he’s deliberating over what to do now that Geoffrey Kondogbia has left Monaco for Inter rather than London. Having failed to take the player from <strong>Monaco</strong>, perhaps Wenger will take inspiration from them? For the Ligue 1 club are planning to re-invest some of the Kondogbia windfall in <strong>William Carvalho</strong>. Milan, who had been even more interested in Kondogbia than Arsenal were, are also eyeing up Carvalho, but may plump for Marseille’s <strong>Giannelli Imbula</strong> or Zenit’s <strong>Axel Witsel </strong>instead. Lots of name for you there, Ars&egrave;ne. </p> \n<p>No excuses. <strong>Juventus</strong> want to prise <strong>Yannick Ferreira Carrasco</strong> from Monaco, and there is not much Liverpool can do about that no matter what they think. Meanwhile, <strong>New York City</strong> are to offer <strong>Andrea Pirlo</strong> a holiday in the USA. </p> \n<p><strong>Newcastle </strong>hope that offering <strong>Charlie Austin</strong> the No9 shirt could be the key incentive that will make the striker choose to go to St James’ Park. And if that doesn’t work, maybe the club will throw in a biscuit or a shiny sticker album, too. </p> \n<p>Tottenham hope that holding the door open for <strong>Roberto Soldado</strong> and handing him his suitcases will help convince the former striker to leave White Hart Lane for <strong>Galatasaray</strong>. Also Turkey-bound, if Manchester United’s wishes come true, is <strong>Nani</strong>, in whom <strong>Fenerbahce</strong> are interested. </p> \n<p><strong>Javier Hern&aacute;ndez</strong>, meanwhile, is on his way back to Madrid, not to Real but to <strong>Atl&eacute;tico</strong>. <strong>Sevilla</strong> want <strong>Steven Nzonzi</strong> and are prepared to help <strong>Stoke</strong> keep up the ‘z’ quotient on their team-sheet by giving them the Polish midfielder <strong>Grzegorz Krychowiak</strong> in return. </p> \n<p>And <strong>Sunderland</strong> are chasing <strong>Stewart Downing</strong>, whom they fear may be tempted to rejoin <strong>Middlesbrough</strong> instead. </p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/121079f2e745b4d030a0d25a263492bfb4e4aa86/0_127_1929_1158/1929.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1158,"width":1929,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alan Walter/Action Images","altText":"Charlie Austin","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alan Walter/Action Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T07:33:08Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T07:38:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Paul Doyle","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/pauldoyle"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Football","Transfer window","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"football/transfer-window","webTitle":"Transfer window"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Paul Doyle","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/pauldoyle"}}],"series":{"title":"Rumour Mill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/series/rumourmill"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/football-transfer-rumours-charlie-austin-newcastle-united","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a37m","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/23/football-transfer-rumours-charlie-austin-newcastle-united","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/23/football-transfer-rumours-charlie-austin-newcastle-united"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/121079f2e745b4d030a0d25a263492bfb4e4aa86/0_127_1929_1158/1929.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1158,"width":1929,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Is Charlie Austin set to sneak off to Tyneside?

The 21-year-old Texan will head to the Open seeking a third major victory in succession, the first time such a feat has been possible on the old course since 1960. Then, Arnold Palmer finished second, aged 30.</p> \n<p>“I’ve now been doing it for a while,” Spieth says. “I don’t really think of my age.”</p> \n<p>Spieth is in illustrious company. He is the youngest US Open champion since Bobby Jones in 1923 and the youngest since Gene Sarazen, a year earlier, to claim multiple major titles. Before Speith, only Craig Wood, Ben Hogan, Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods had won the Masters and US Open in the same year.</p> \n<p>“The focus this year was on the majors,” Spieth says. “The goals were the majors. They weren’t on winning a certain number of times or getting into contention in a major. It was: ‘Let’s find a winning formula in a major’.</p> \n<p>“There’s now a piece of golf history and, as a golf historian, that’s very special and it gives me goose bumps. It’s amazing. And just to think of what our team has been through, how fast we’ve risen to get on tour and to contend and win major championships, it’s amazing. And it gets better every week with our team.</p> \n<p>“Those names are the greatest that have ever played the game and I don’t consider myself there but I’m certainly off to the right start to make an impact on the history of the game.”</p> \n<p>Spieth’s acknowledgment of a fast track to the summit is pertinent. He took a gamble three years ago in dropping out of university, backing himself to succeed in the professional game by an unconventional route. The reward has already reached more than $16m in prize money. From the outset, the consequence of failure drove Spieth on.</p> \n<p>St Andrews will be fascinating. Woods, a two-times winner there, now <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/tiger-woods-parody-former-self-us-open\" title=\"\">looks a spent force</a> but will return. Tom Watson and Nick Faldo will use the platform to bid their farewells to the Open. McIlroy, who departed Chambers Bay insisting he had struck the ball better than ever before in a major, adores the Open venue.</p> \n<p>“I can strike the ball better than I did this week,” Spieth says. “I can get more positive. I can improve in all aspects of my game, I believe that. It’s just about now looking to St Andrews and everything prior, how are we going to best prepare for it and how are we just going to fine-tune. It’s just fine-tuning, it’s nothing major and that’s what we normally have to do anyways. And there’s always a way to get better.”</p> \n<p>Whereas McIlroy will use the Scottish Open as his Open precursor, Spieth will compete in the John Deere Classic. That event was the first Spieth won on the PGA Tour, two years ago. McIlroy is the holder of the two tournaments Spieth encounters next. After St Andrews another links-like venue, Whistling Straits, hosts the US PGA in August.</p> \n<p>“I’m just focused on the Claret Jug,” Spieth says. “I think the grand slam is something that I never could really fathom somebody doing, considering I watched Tiger win when he was winning whatever percentage of the majors he played in. He won the ‘Tiger Slam’ but he never won the four in one year. And I figured if anybody was going to do it, it would be him, which he still can.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/21/us-open-2015-jordan-spieth-wins-in-thrilling-finish-to-add-to-masters-crown\">US Open 2015: Jordan Spieth wins in thrilling finish to add to Masters crown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Chambers Bay was somewhat of a British-style course, so are the next two majors.

How classy it is there, all the traditional things about it, the grass, the white outfits. In my head I even think of the wooden rackets.”</p> \n<p>Bouchard has not been smiling much over the past few months. The Canadian will go into Wimbledon in a slump that at first was annoying but soon became worrying. Twelve months ago the 21-year-old seemed the heir apparent and the darling of the photographers as she reached her first grand slam final. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/05/petra-kvitova-crushes-eugenie-bouchard-second-wimbledon-title\" title=\"\">Although she was well beaten by an inspired Petra Kvitova in the final</a>, she finished the year ranked No 7 and as she began 2015, she seemed set for even bigger things.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/10/whats-wrong-with-eugenie-bouchard\">What's wrong with Eugenie Bouchard?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/10/whats-wrong-with-eugenie-bouchard\" title=\"\">But somewhere along the line things have gone wrong</a>. Going into her match with the American, Alison Riske, in Eastbourne on Tuesday, Bouchard has lost her opening match in seven events this year and, almost more worryingly, she has been getting into winning positions only to let them slide, losing five of those matches in three sets. Last year she showed herself to be a fighter, scrapping through numerous matches; this year she has been folding under the pressure.</p> \n<p>Struggling in the so-called “sophomore year” is nothing new. Many champions have battled to cope with the increased expectations after a big season. The former world No1 Chris Evert pointed out recently that outside her stellar grand slam efforts – two semi-finals and a final – Bouchard also had nine first-round defeats in 2014 so this year’s travails are not wildly out of the blue. However, the manner of the defeats is disturbing and even the usually mentally strong Bouchard is beginning to wonder what is happening to her.</p> \n<p>“At the beginning I was really impatient,” she says. “I expected this year to be like last year and even better. But as it’s gone on, I’ve realised, maybe it is a slump, I’m in a little downward curve and it’s actually normal because first of all everyone told me it’s going to happen and then everyone’s telling me it’s happening right now, so maybe it actually is.</p> \n<p>“Then I realised I should just accept it. It’s not going great right now. Although I feel better in the gym, I feel better on the practice court, the results are still not there but I know that, if I do the proper things, the results will come eventually, whether it’s this week or next week, at the US Open Series or even next year.</p> \n<p>“So the way I’ve learned to accept it and deal with it is just to say, you know what, I could lose a couple more matches and I’ll still survive. It’s just a tennis match. I feel like people freak out so early. They’re quick to jump on me when I do well; they’re quick to jump on me when I lose. I am just trying not to worry about it.”</p> \n<p>When winning is your job, that is not easy. And typically, when the chips are down, the daggers sharpen. Sports Pro Magazine recently made Bouchard No1 in their list of the “most marketable athletes”, a list based on future earnings potential as much as anything. With William Morris Endeavour having acquired IMG in December 2013, Bouchard, now an IMG player, is in the same stable as both Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams, with whom she shares an agent. Sharapova and Williams are the two highest female earners in the sport, according to Forbes Magazine and, while Bouchard is not yet in their league, she already boasts high-profile deals including Nike, Babolat and Coca-Cola, with whom she signed a three-year deal last summer.</p> \n<p>Bouchard was snapped up by IMG Models in December 2014 and this year has conducted a number of high-profile photo-shoots for various magazines. Inevitably some suggested she should “spend more time on the court” and there was little attempt to hide the sexism.</p> \n<p>“I have heard lots of comments like that,” says Bouchard, who adds that modelling is hard work. “I didn’t realise I had to be playing tennis 24 hours a day. If I’m not doing a shoot, then maybe I’ll just be at the mall – does that mean I’m not allowed to go to the mall any more? Am I not allowed to go to a movie or not watch another sport? There are always going to be people who disagree with what you do but that means at least you stood up for something and did something in your life.”</p> \n<p>On the surface Bouchard is made of strong stuff and seems not to care too much what people think about her. She stands by her statement from last year that she has no time or inclination to make friends on Tour; this is her livelihood. In a Fed Cup tie in April – the second time she had done this – she refused to shake hands with her opponent at the draw ceremony, leaving Alexandra Dulgheru hanging, to much embarrassment all round. It backfired spectacularly as Bouchard promptly lost both her singles matches as Canada lost the tie.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>“In terms of this handshake I almost think maybe I should have [done it] because it created such a thing, that to me was so small,” she says, with more than a hint of exasperation in her voice. “Everyone always says, be yourself, be yourself, but then they tell you what to do, so they contradict themselves. I’m going to do what I believe in and, if I am here at a tournament, I believe I’m here to work and not to socialise, so that’s what I do. I’ve been told to be myself, so I think that’s what I try to do.”</p> \n<p>Having enjoyed the best year of her career, Bouchard surprised almost everyone in the sport by announcing she had parted ways from Nick Saviano, the coach credited with a lot of her success. Her new coach is Sam Sumyk, the man who helped Victoria Azarenka to the world No1 spot, but in terms of results the pair have not exactly hit the ground running.</p> \n<p>If there is one thing that might inspire a return to form, though, it is a return to Wimbledon, where she won the junior title in 2012 and where last year she played with the aggression and the confidence that has been so lacking this year to date, standing tight to the baseline and always looking to dictate. “I have obviously looked back on those couple of weeks and have such nice feelings thinking about it,” she says. “I have thought: ‘What was I doing during that tournament that made me play so well?’ I was in my bubble. I’ve thought about what I was focusing on and maybe going back to that experience to try to play better. I’m just trying to focus on what I’m doing now and hopefully the great memories I can create this year.”</p> \n<p>Despite the doom and gloom of the first half of 2015, Bouchard remains just outside the top 10 at No 12 and her goals have not dimmed. “My first goal is just to win a grand slam and, if I could choose, it would be Wimbledon,” she says. “Having that title and that success is something that I’ve dreamed of since I was younger. If you do that and have a good year as well, then maybe there’s a good chance you’ll be No1.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434997721474/Aegon-Classic-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Eugenie Bouchard has endured a difficult start to the 2015 season, losing in her opening round of competitions on six occasions.

This would be a jaw-dropping and unprecedented defection in Queensland sport, akin to, say, Wally Lewis quitting the Maroons for the Blues. It simply can’t happen. And, God forbid, if it does, Carmichael could be in serious trouble with his board and loyal Reds fans.</p> \n<p>Here’s the background to what is an evolving news story: late on Sunday, Carmichael issued <a href=\"http://www.redsrugby.com.au/News/NewsArticles/tabid/581/ArticleID/15547/Queensland-Rugby-exits-Quade-Cooper-negotiations.aspx\">an extraordinary media statement</a> saying the Reds had ceased negotiations with Cooper. Carmichael accused Cooper’s manager, Khoder Nasser, of having “unrealistic expectations”. The Reds CEO was also miffed at Cooper’s recent trip to France where he signed a deal with Toulon.</p> \n<p>And then the coup de grace of send-offs: “We have come to the difficult decision that the investment we have made previously and were prepared to continue to make has not been recognised, particularly when taking into account our commitment to him over a very long period of time. As a consequence, we are no longer prepared to be involved in any further discussions as this will leave the organisation further exposed,” Carmichael said.</p> \n<p>The particularly nasty subtext to that statement – and one that wouldn’t have been lost on Nasser – is, of course, the Reds standing by Cooper when he was charged with burglary in 2009. It was a low blow from the Reds boss. Cooper resolved the burglary charge <a href=\"http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/police-drop-burglary-charge-against-quade-cooper-20100716-10ddg.html\">without conviction</a>, and has long repaid any perceived debt to the franchise by putting bums on seats for many a season. “People can love or hate Quade but he brings people to the game. It’s his X-factor that is responsible for the 30,000 crowds, the buzz and what the Reds have become,” is what Will Genia had to say about Cooper’s effect on the Reds’ bottom line. If anything, the Reds ought to be paying Cooper commission on ticket sales.</p> \n<p>By any measure this has been a massive dummy spit by Carmichael. He’s clearly showing signs of strain in the wake of two mediocre seasons. Certainly, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/skirmish-involving-reds-boss-jim-carmichael-mars-will-genia-and-james-horwills-farewell-20150611-ghll0u.html\">a skirmish he had with a junior club official</a> at Suncorp two weeks ago supports that view. And this is from an administrator some had tipped for the Australian Rugby Union top job only a few years ago.</p> \n<p>One final point on Carmichael’s press release: he suggests Nasser has been difficult to deal with in negotiations. Nasser is also Sonny Bill Williams’s agent. This is what New Zealand Rugby CEO Steve Tew had to say about his dealings with Nasser: “Everyone in here found Khoder very straight up, which was refreshing. Obviously, he has a different way of doing things. He has a very clear view of what he wants for his clients and he puts it on the table. We had very efficient negotiations; no mucking around. He’s very easy to deal with: he tells you what he wants.” It’s a shame for Reds fans that Carmichael couldn’t find the same common ground with Nasser as the All Blacks had done.</p> \n<p>So where to now for Cooper? He has a four-year deal on the table from the Australian Rugby Union. There is, of course, the issue of paying $220,000 to get a release from the Toulon contract. But it’s understood Cooper will spring for that himself as recent conversations with dual Wallabies/Waratahs coach Michael Cheika has him convinced he has future in Australian rugby.</p> \n<p> The ARU is making all the right noises about keeping Cooper in Australia. “We respect the QRU’s position, but ultimately he is now a free agent and has to consider a new landscape,” ARU general manager Rob Clarke said on Monday. “The decision sits with him as to which road he wants to take, but he will do so knowing that the head coach of the Wallabies and the ARU is fully supportive of Quade playing for Australia, from Australia.”</p> \n<p>Cooper, 27, is a complex character. However, he remains a huge talent – one yet to fulfil his potential at international level. Carmichael looks to have made the wrong call. Thankfully, the ARU, no doubt heavily influenced by Cheika, are taking a far more measured and practical approach in negotiations.

Andrew Bogut became the third Australian in two years to win an NBA championship after his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/17/golden-state-warriors-nba-title-cleveland-cavaliers\">Golden State Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers</a> and compatriot Matthew Dellavedova in a thrilling finals series. Earlier in the season history was made when four Australians shared the court for the first time, while the future looks equally bright with both <a href=\"http://www.nbadraft.net/2016mock_draft\">Ben Simmons</a> and <a href=\"http://pickandroll.com.au/thon-maker-nbpa-mvp-reclassification/\">Thon Maker</a> being potential number one draft picks in coming years.<br /></p> \n<p>As the dust settles on an exciting denouement to the playoffs, we have rated the performances of Australia’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2014/dec/09/australias-seven-strong-invasion-of-the-nba-points-to-bright-future\">seven-strong NBA contingent</a>, with grades awarded relative to expectations.</p> \n<h2><strong>Matthew Dellavedova (Cleveland Cavaliers)</strong></h2> \n<p>One of the most persistent storylines (both positive and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/26/australian-matthew-dellavedova-labelled-dirty-us-media\">negative</a>) of the past month, the rapid rise of Dellavedova is nothing short of astonishing. Undrafted in 2013 after four years at college, the point guard from country Victoria scrapped his way to a barely-guaranteed contract with the Cavaliers. Fast forward to the present, and this scrawny 24-year-old is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/08/matthew-dellavedova-cavaliers-nba-golden-state-\">winning games in the NBA finals</a> while having his named chanted by an adoring Cleveland crowd.</p> \n<p>Although Dellavedova underwhelmed at the tail-end of the finals, evidently exhausted following a brief stint in hospital, he was never realistically going to fill the large shoes of injured team-mate Kyrie Irving on a consistent basis. Nevertheless, his play-off heroics again, again and again make Dellavedova more than deserving of top-marks. As LeBron James explained of the determined Australian, “He gives us everything until the tank is empty, and he has a small little reserve tank that he continues to work through. He’s huge for us.”</p> \n<p>Following such well-publicised performances, Dellavedova’s manager will be busy over the American summer. Yet while the restricted free agent is certain to attract lucrative offers from elsewhere, it would be hugely out of character for Dellavedova to abandon the opportunity for NBA success in pursuit of dollars. Instead, expect Delly-mania to remain alive and well in Cleveland come October.</p> \n<p><em>Grade: A</em></p> \n<h2><strong>Andrew Bogut (Golden State Warriors)</strong></h2> \n<p>To his detractors, Bogut was no more than a bit-part player as Golden State marched almost inexorably to the Larry O’Brien Trophy. In spite of that shiny new championship ring, the former number one draft pick’s absence in the last two games against Cleveland has been noted, as has his limited scoring (10 points in the six games).</p> \n<p>Such criticisms, though, are misconceived. While the towering centre may have fallen victim to tactical manoeuvrings in the finals, Bogut played a crucial role for the Warriors throughout the season. Although the numbers might not show it (averaging 6.3 points and 8.1 rebounds), Bogut is the crux of Golden State’s defence and creates important space for team-mates in attack – his screens are a core element of their offensive play.<br /></p> \n<p>After a promising start to his NBA career, Bogut fell victim to injury after injury and seemed destined for a slow decline to eventual retirement. Through hard-work and selflessness, Australia’s NBA veteran has added his name to the short list of compatriots with a digit adorned by those much-sought championship rings. That, surely, is a feat worthy of high praise, regardless of individual playing time in the finals.</p> \n<p><em>Grade: B+</em></p> \n<h2><strong>Joe Ingles (Utah Jazz)</strong></h2> \n<p>Making his long-awaited NBA entrance after a career in Europe, it appeared the ascension of Ingles to basketball’s top stage could have been over before it began when the Los Angeles Clippers waived him in late October. The 27-year-old was thrown a lifeline by Utah, and was promptly catapulted into the starting five where he was soon clocking up 21.2 minutes per game – well above anything he would have achieved in California.</p> \n<p>While his five points, 2.3 assists and 2.2 rebounds averages are respectable if not outstanding, Ingles became an important leadership figure on a young Jazz team. He was part of Grantland’s <a href=\"http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-fourth-annual-luke-walton-all-stars/\">Fourth-Annual Luke Walton All-Stars</a>, for “journeymen thriving in unexpectedly large roles”, and will likely continue earning substantial minutes alongside countryman Dante Exum next season.</p> \n<p><em>Grade: B</em></p> \n<h2><strong>Aron Baynes (San Antonio Spurs)</strong></h2> \n<p>The butt of <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com.au/us-sports/blake-griffin-v-aron-baynes-aussie-nba-player-monstered-by-clippers-star-in-playoffs/story-e6frf6ju-1227312168314\">more than a few jokes</a> following his torrid outing against slam-happy Blake Griffin, Baynes can nevertheless feel content with a strong season in San Antonio. Off the back of an impressive World Cup performance for the Boomers, the imposing centre almost doubled his average minutes per game from the previous campaign, with corresponding increases in scoring and rebounding.</p> \n<p>Baynes also cemented his position in the Spurs rotation, thanks initially to team-mate injuries and then good play, appearing in 70 of 82 regular season games. While the 2.08 metre (6’ 10”) behemoth is never going to be a marquee big-man, his consistency and multiple double-double performances highlighted a much improved season.</p> \n<p>Baynes is now a free agent, although San Antonio retain qualifying offer rights, and it remains to be seen whether the burly Australian will stay or pursue opportunities elsewhere. Fans of rock band <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxw2FZBd7aY\">Spuran Spuran</a>, featuring Baynes alongside fellow players and the team’s coyote mascot, will no doubt be disappointed if the “Head Banger” departs.</p> \n<p><em>Grade: B</em></p> \n<h2><strong>Patty Mills (San Antonio Spurs)</strong></h2> \n<p>In the space of three weeks last June/July, Mills went from the ecstasy of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2014/jun/17/patty-mills-nba-finals-victory\">earning an NBA championship ring</a> to the agony of facing an extended spell on the sidelines to repair a torn rotator cuff. After asserting himself as a dynamic sixth-man with the defensive hustle and three-point range to rival the best, assisting his San Antonio Spurs side to the title in the process, Mills rapidly fell back to earth. Unsurprisingly, his 2014/15 season suffered as a result.</p> \n<p>Originally given a seven-month rehabilitation time-frame, the 26-year-old Canberran returned from injury in late December and immediately rallied his team to a win over Houston. Yet Mills looked rusty in the ensuing months, struggling to regain form despite the occasional glimpse of excellence. Most tellingly, the sharp shooter’s three point percentage dipped from 43% in 2013/14 to 34%, with a commensurate decline in points per game.</p> \n<p>While the Mills of old returned for patches of a thrilling playoff series against the Los Angeles Clippers, San Antonio’s game seven loss meant an early exit for the Australian. More will be expected of him come October. And bonus points for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4y-Iqq2Wjgw\">this piece of comedy gold</a>.</p> \n<p><em>Grade: B–</em></p> \n<h2><strong>Dante Exum (Utah Jazz)</strong></h2> \n<p>Grading the rookie season of Utah’s other Australian is no easy task. As the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2014/jun/27/dante-exum-nba-draft-utah-jazz\">number five pick in a talent-packed NBA draft</a>, Exum has failed to meet expectations: his statistics compare unfavourably to those of fellow lottery selections, and the guard looked lost on the parquet at times. Yet considered as a 19-year-old transitioning from high school basketball to the best league in the world and the assessment is much kinder: Exum showed glimpses of his fantastic potential and built fruitful partnerships with several team-mates.</p> \n<p>The reality, of course, is somewhere in the middle. Exum emerged as a starter for the Jazz, notched up double digit hauls not infrequently and showed great defensive awareness. Conversely, the Australian Institute of Sport youth product was occasionally schooled by experienced opposition and averaged a mere 2.4 assists per game – far from ideal for a pass-first point guard.</p> \n<p>There were always going to be teething pains on Exum’s path to basketball stardom, and his rookie year has been a mixed bag. With a year of NBA experience under his belt, a dominant Summer League and patient pre-season could set the stage for a much-improved sophomore campaign.</p> \n<p><em>Grade: C+</em></p> \n<h2><strong>Cameron Bairstow (Chicago Bulls)</strong></h2> \n<p>Selected with the 49<sup>th</sup> pick in the 2014 draft, Bairstow was always going to struggle to earn playing time on a crowded Bulls roster. Despite a strong showing at the Basketball World Cup, Bairstow was unable to out-muscle the likes of Taj Gibson, Joakim Noah and Pau Gasol for a regular rotation position at club-level, ending the season with a measly average of <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/2528354/cameron-bairstow\">3.6 minutes per game</a>.</p> \n<p>While the 24-year-old won’t be panicking just yet, thanks to the relative security of a <a href=\"http://www.spotrac.com/nba/chicago-bulls/cameron-bairstow/\">three year contract</a>, Bairstow will be well aware that 2015/16 could make or break his NBA career. The power forward has demonstrated his determination before – sticking out four years at college instead of chasing professional offers overseas – and has the physicality and shooting accuracy to become a reliable rotation player. Bairstow will need a considerable uptick in minutes, though, if he is to prove his worth in Chicago.</p> \n<p><em>Grade: N/A</em></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fc5d21f5c4530a99f1682ed6b7ba85beed25f089/0_139_2288_1375/2288.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1375,"width":2288,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Richard/USA Today Sports","altText":"“He’s huge for us,” says LeBron James of the Cavaliers’ Matthew Dellavedova.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Richard/USA Today Sports"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T02:00:16Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T02:03:44Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":3,"contributors":[{"name":"Kieran Pender","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/kieran-pender"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["NBA","Australia sport","US sports","Basketball","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/nba","webTitle":"NBA"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"sport/basketball","webTitle":"Basketball"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Kieran Pender","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/kieran-pender"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/23/australian-players-nba-how-they-rated-this-season","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a293","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jun/23/australian-players-nba-how-they-rated-this-season","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jun/23/australian-players-nba-how-they-rated-this-season"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fc5d21f5c4530a99f1682ed6b7ba85beed25f089/0_139_2288_1375/2288.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1375,"width":2288,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"“He’s huge for us,” says LeBron James of the Cavaliers’ Matthew Dellavedova.

It’s time to keep him away from baseball<br /></p>","byline":"Les Carpenter","body":"<p>If there were a hall of fame for liars, connivers and manipulators Pete Rose would be elected on the first ballot. <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/13114874/notebook-obtained-lines-shows-pete-rose-bet-baseball-player-1986\">It shouldn’t take an ESPN investigation</a> to stifle a half-baked movement new baseball commissioner Rob Manfred has been feeding in revisiting the question of allowing Rose anywhere near Major League Baseball. Rose has been trying to swindle us for years. </p> \n<p>Nobody plays a fool quite like Pete Rose, dangling contrition just enough to pull at the heartstrings of a public that feels there is nothing more un-American than banning baseball’s all-time hits leader from the game. For years he insisted he never bet on baseball. Then when evidence grew that he not only bet on baseball games, but did so on his own team, he made a distinction that he only bet on Cincinnati Reds games as their manager. On Monday, that flimsy parsing of fact blew up when written evidence was unsealed that <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/13114874/notebook-obtained-lines-shows-pete-rose-bet-baseball-player-1986\">showed he bet on the Reds while also playing for the Reds</a>.</p> \n<p>No one should have doubted that Rose bet on baseball while he played for the Reds. The evidence that he did was strong. John Dowd – the former federal prosecutor who investigated Rose for Major League Baseball in 1989 – felt he had strong proof that Rose had bet on his own games as a player. But unlike the NFL, which has relied on rickety logic in the Ted Wells report to suspend Tom Brady, baseball’s then-commissioner Bart Giamatti insisted on something more. Baseball wanted concrete proof. </p> \n<p>Now that proof exists, in writing no less. Among the gems ESPN was able to pull from documents it obtained is that Rose clearly bet on the Reds 21 times during the 1986 season and at least one time on each of 30 teams between March and July of that year. If Manfred has any spine in the first great test as a commissioner he will take tuck the Rose redemption files deep in the cabinet, slam the drawer, lock it up and throw away the key. </p> \n<p>Rose’s many apologists see a double standard in his lifetime ban. They like to point out that baseball’s Hall of Fame is filled with racists, wife beaters and steroid cheats. They say Rose’s ban is more a cosmetic attempt by baseball to pretend its players, managers and executives are immune from gambling even as its players, managers and executives own race horses and play high-stakes card games in their clubhouses. </p> \n<p>But the reason Rose should be kept far from baseball isn’t about gambling or the game’s integrity or any other old fashioned phrase that rings empty in a modern world. The reason he should be kept from baseball is that he has never been honest about the one thing baseball needs him to be honest about. Instead he goes on rolling out whatever garbled fiction keeps his name alive for the devoted sycophants who see a hitting hero rather than an aging septuagenarian who twists reality while pawning his signature in any strip mall or baseball card store that will set up a table, folding chair and cash register. </p> \n<p>He repeatedly broke a gambling rule that might seem quaint in a world where Floyd Mayweather can pull in more than $1m on a football bet and be celebrated on the internet, but then Rose took everybody’s trust and ground it into the ground like gum under a pair of spikes. </p> \n<p>Now that he wants back in and he’s found a commissioner that might just be willing to capitulate, the answer should be no. The Pete Rose redemption tour should stop now at the ballpark gates, before they are opened and he worms his way down to the field. Baseball has lost much of its integrity in recent years with steroid scandals, stadium schemes and frivolous television standoffs like the one that has kept the Dodgers off local TV for more than a year. Why sell more of that integrity to a player who has never been apologetic about his repeated disdain for the one rule that gives some confidence to a buying public that the games themselves are real, that the competition on the field is pure? </p> \n<p>The choice is up to baseball now. Manfred has been sending signals that baseball is softening its stand against Rose. This spring, Rose slipped onto national telecasts, offering his opinions as a analyst. He’s always been one for talking; spinning whatever story will get him through the moment. Eventually time runs out on talking. </p> \n<p>On Monday, another hole was punctured in another lie. At what point does baseball tell Pete Rose to stay away for good? </p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1435007560379/28367ea5-de55-415c-9768-1e55cb55dbe1-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty Images","altText":"Pete Rose","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-22T21:15:24Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T21:18:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":42,"contributors":[{"name":"Les Carpenter","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/les-carpenter"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["MLB","Baseball","Sport","US sports","Cincinnati Reds","Gambling"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/mlb","webTitle":"MLB"},{"id":"sport/baseball","webTitle":"Baseball"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"sport/cincinnati-reds","webTitle":"Cincinnati Reds"},{"id":"society/gambling","webTitle":"Gambling"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Les Carpenter","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/les-carpenter"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/pete-rose-bet-on-baseball-as-a-player-his-redemption-tour-stops-now","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a33k","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/22/pete-rose-bet-on-baseball-as-a-player-his-redemption-tour-stops-now","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/22/pete-rose-bet-on-baseball-as-a-player-his-redemption-tour-stops-now"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1435007560379/28367ea5-de55-415c-9768-1e55cb55dbe1-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"There have been moves to restore Pete Rose’s reputation recently.
