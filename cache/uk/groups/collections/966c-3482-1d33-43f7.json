Why is it that misunderstanding dogs them at every turn? Even a heartwarming <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/06/england-women-twitter-world-cup-mothers-partners-daughters\" title=\"\">official tweet</a> welcoming back England’s women’s World Cup squad this week was “taken out of context”. “Our #Lionesses go back to being mothers, partners and daughters today,” it ran, “but they have taken on another title – heroes.”</p> \n<p>I’m afraid I shrieked with laughter when I read this. It’s not my favourite piece of gender-boggling WTF-ery this week: that came courtesy of the senior US administration official who told the Daily Beast: “Behind every successful man is a woman – and Isis is no exception.” Despite having read that multiple times now, I’m still no closer to getting my head round all the angles.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/england-womens-world-cup-mark-sampson-germany\">Women’s World Cup: England win nation’s support with World Cup bronze</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Anyway, I do hope the FA managed to laugh at themselves too. “The most important thing is to be able to laugh at yourself,” Jeffrey Archer once told Dame Edna Everage. “You’d have to do that,” came the deathless reply, “otherwise you’d be missing the joke of the century.”</p> \n<p>Alas, indications are that Wembley’s finest minds have yet to get in on the gag. Following the insta-reaction to that unfortunate tweet, the FA issued an immediate statement asserting that it had been taken “out of context”. Without wishing to provide too much context to that remark, I have to remind the FA that football doesn’t generally believe in context. When the comedian Reginald D Hunter did the Professional Footballers’ Association awards a couple of years ago and peppered his turn with the N-word, he kicked off a race row, with Kick It Out issuing a statement declaring it condemns this sort of thing “irrespective of context”. In the end, though, it’s nice not to have to get too worked up about all this. You can always feel when some sort of seismic rebalancing has happened, and England are there now: that happy point where you’re powerful enough to rise above such twattery. It’s the FA who come off worse, and anyone with whom you’d care to spend any time can see it.</p> \n<p>In fact, given how splendidly the sport has kicked on over the past few weeks, can we not now live without this whole Lionesses business? For my tastes, it’s all a bit “Simba’s World Cup”. If Australia wish to field a national side called the Socceroos, then that is a matter for them. But it’s hardly as if we need a female analogue for the so-called Three Lions.</p> \n<p>Who says “the Three Lions” when they’re talking about England? Honestly: have you ever heard anyone remotely normal refer to “the Three Lions” in conversation unless they were being drippingly sarcastic? It is a classification used by nobody but weedy Nike marketers and prime ministers who dream of Ben Tek popping in the goals for Upton Villa. Indeed, it was once used about the prime minister himself, back when David Cameron, Prince William and David Beckham were judged our best hopes of securing hosting rights to the 2018 World Cup (Bob Hope and No Hope being unavailable).</p> \n<p>The England side’s own achievements and the boosted profile of the game mean they really need no other name than England. Unless the “mothers, partners and daughters” bit was the FA laying the ground for the successor to its most famous coinage: Wags. But no. Even by their malarial standards, the MoPeDs would be a horror too far.</p> \n<h2>Hayatou feels the heat in Blatter’s shoes<br /></h2> \n<p>On an infinitely more serious note, I find myself plagued with worry for Issa Hayatou, the Confederation of African Football president who appears to have been finessed into the position of de facto Fifa No3.</p> \n<p>As you will know, the women’s World Cup final was not attended by either Fifa’s president, Sepp Blatter, or its secretary general, J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Valcke. Valcke is assumed to be off the idea of international travel for the same reason as Blatter, who declared: “Until everything has been cleared up, I am not going to take the risk of travelling.”</p> \n<p>Everything? What, all of it? At this rate, Sepp’s only hope of seeing another country before he goes to the great boardroom in the sky is to steal across the mountains from Switzerland to Austria under cover of night – or, to give the manoeuvre its proper name, to pull a reverse Von Trapp.</p> \n<p>Anyway, all this power-playing appears to have resulted in Hayatou being the most senior figure deputised to travel to Canada for the World Cup final on Sunday.</p> \n<p>Given that he was accused of selling his vote for the Qatar World Cup – though has not been accused by US prosecutors – and is already under investigation by the IOC, Issa must be feeling decidedly nervous.</p> \n<p>Could the Fifa No3 role be as perilous as the al-Qaida No3 role traditionally was? That position in the late Osama bin Laden’s organisation was long judged to be dead men’s shoes, what with America’s habit of killing its holders with unsettling frequency. Between 9/11 and 2009, the US took out no fewer than nine al-Qaida No3s.</p> \n<p>Back in the day, were you a sensible al-Qaida No4 called in for promotion by Ayman al-Zawahiri, the smartest thing to do would have been to claim you were actually really happy making a difference in your current role, and felt you wanted to stay to see through the changes you’d implemented to the training camp curriculum or diversity programme or whatever.</p> \n<p>Perhaps it was just being roundly booed in the stadium on Sunday which accounted for Hayatou looking decidedly unhappy. Or is the Fifa No3 gig now similarly uncoveted?</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/8/1436349289879/Lucy-Bronze-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lucy Bronze blocks a shot from Germany's Celia Sasic in England's third place play-off win in the Women's World Cup.

It’s too bad. He’s about the best welterweight Mayweather could have fought. </p> \n<p>But there are plenty of other names jockeying for a shot at the man they call “Money” in what might be his final ring battle. Mayweather has mentioned some fighters, while other potential opponents have put their own names into the mix. Let’s consider the contenders. And let’s rate them on a scale of one to five stars in both likelihood and whether whether they’re worth a damn as Mayweather opponents.</p> \n<h2>Andre Berto</h2> \n<p>Mayweather recently threw this name out alongside Karim Mayfield. There’s almost no chance this fight will happen, even though some are calling Berto the favourite and the pair have been involved in <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2015/06/25/floyd-mayweather-andre-berto-is-delusional-hes-not-even-on-my-speed-dial/\">some squawking about prank calls</a>. It doesn’t fit the Mayweather method. He likes opponents who have at least a modicum of credibility, usually because they have a recent win of note and some palpable popularity at least somewhere. Berto has neither – a win over Josesito Lopez doesn’t count. I’m not sure why he even brought up their names, unless it’s to troll Amir Khan, who wants the fight so bad.</p> \n<p>Likelihood: **<br />Desirability: * </p> \n<h2>Kell Brook</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e3534f0d668557ca4dece82f0098ea0c05e055b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352602063/ea2ea49a-341d-46f7-b148-576607986bcb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kell Brook\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kell Brook celebrates after beating Jo Jo Dan in their IBF welterweight title fight in March 2015.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Brook is just a touch too dangerous to be terribly likely, which is exactly why he’s one of the best options. He’s young, explosive and undefeated. That he has some fans in the UK&nbsp;would bring some additional marketability to the fight; Mayweather is usually fond of taking on opponents with an ethnic or regional constituency, and the UK fits that approach,&nbsp;as he showed with the fight against&nbsp;Ricky Hatton. But his combination of “good” and “hasn’t fought in the U.S. much” handicaps him as the guy to get the call.</p> \n<p>Likelihood: **<br />Desirability: **** </p> \n<h2>Gennady Golovkin</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27568d39cda9fbf01d2917b4fa1add4b0b02ec21\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436353026218/b584aa2b-edb1-4e08-afe3-1ea953ee4364-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Golovkin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gennady Golovkin.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mayweather is at least indulging the fight, which is weird. Mainly he’s indulging it by saying Golovkin is unknown, isn’t smart enough and&nbsp;would have to face some additional weight restrictions. Make no mistake, were Mayweather to take this fight even with some unusual limitations at 154, we would be talking about one of the ballsiest moves he could make.&nbsp;Golovkin is huge compared to Mayweather and he’s&nbsp;skilled and powerful. He’s also been doing solid ratings on HBO. But he’s just too risky for Floyd’s final fight.</p> \n<p>Likelihood: *<br />Desirability: ***** </p> \n<h2>Amir Khan</h2> \n<p>One gets the impression Mayweather enjoys tormenting the especially thirsty Khan, and right now he’s got him cotton-mouthed and dehydrated. It’s too bad <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/30/amir-khan-fights-off-spirited-challenge-from-chris-algieri\">Khan struggled against Chris Algieri</a>, even if Algieri deserves more credit than Khan deserves blame for the closeness of the fight. Before that showing, Khan’s length and speed figured as an interesting theoretical challenge for Mayweather, if not one in reality. Still, it’s credible enough-ish.<br /></p> \n<p>Likelihood: ****<br />Desirability: *** </p> \n<h2>Anthony Mundine</h2> \n<p>Mundine – the most recent entrant in the Mayweather sweepstakes, who pitched his services in <a href=\"http://boxa.com.au/open-letter-to-floyd-mayweather-from-anthony-mundine/\">a clawing&nbsp;open&nbsp;letter</a> – has losses to Manny Siaca, Garth Wood and Joshua Clottey on his record. None of them are remotely in the class of Mayweather.&nbsp;Mundine earned a quality win in his last fight, against&nbsp;Sergey Rabchenko,&nbsp;but his only argument for a shot against&nbsp;Mayweather is&nbsp;based on his big mouth and tendency to make&nbsp;controversial remarks. One big problem with that selling point, though, is that Mundine is mainly known in Australia, and Mayweather isn’t even welcome in that country.</p> \n<p>Likelihood: *<br />Desirability: *</p> \n<h2>Karim Mayfield</h2> \n<p>You can&nbsp;understand how Mayweather could throw out Berto’s name. He’s been a TV staple for forever. But&nbsp;Mayfield? He’s practically been banished, owing to the kind of outings that make boxing’s bloodlust crowd screech like they just hopped up on a chair after seeing a mouse. Plus, losses to Thomas Dulorme and Emmanuel Taylor in two of his last three fights –&nbsp;that’s such a bad look. Is there such a thing as half a fist? Would it look like a middle finger?<br /></p> \n<p>Likelihood: *<br />Desirability: *</p> \n<h2>Shawn Porter</h2> \n<p>Last weekend, Porter beat Adrien Broner, who had played Mayweather’s “little brother” in a past life, owing to his talent, flashy/obnoxious personality and winning ways. So we got a storyline. It was also a good win for Porter, elevating his profile before 2.4m&nbsp;viewers. Stylistically, it’s one of the more interesting possibilities.&nbsp;Marcos Maidana’s pressure gave Mayweather some trouble&nbsp;and Porter would&nbsp;pressure him, but he doesn’t hit that hard, and has been outboxed, so it’s not as risky.</p> \n<p>Likelihood: ****<br />Desirability: **** </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/queensberry-rules-boxing-blog/2015/jun/12/boxing-mixed-emotions-knock-out-punches\">The mixed emotions of watching a boxer you know and like being knocked out</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Errol Spence</h2> \n<p>OK, this one isn’t serious. Spence mistakenly said that he wanted to fight Mayweather next, when he meant Keith Thurman. Spence is just a prospect, albeit a damn good one, or else this would rank higher in terms of desirability. Mayweather is talking up Spence as a candidate to face some of the guys who are targeting him, like Porter and Thurman. If you believe that <a href=\"http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/355355-errol-spence-jr-on-intense-sparring-with-floyd-mayweather-jr\">Spence gave Mayweather a black eye in sparring</a> – as is alleged – this could be a desirable fight.</p> \n<p>Likelihood: *<br />Desirability: *** </p> \n<h2>Keith Thurman</h2> \n<p>Thurman would promote the fight well with his loquacity; he’s thought of as a powerful puncher; he can box; and he’s a rising name. He’s not as threatening as he once seemed, with his power fading in recent fights. So he has that mix of vulnerability and a perception of being really good, and the ability to market a fight. It’s confusing that Mayweather seems to be talking him down.</p> \n<p>Likelihood: ****<br />Desirability: ****</p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> This article first appeared on <a href=\"http://bloguin.com/queensberryrules/\">The Queensberry Rules</a><br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tqbr\">The Queensberry Rules</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timstarks\">Tim Starks</a> on Twitter</strong></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436350035769/4d2198b3-43b6-447d-8d7d-674a08875747-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Reuters/Reuters","altText":"Mayweather","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Reuters/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352603302/ea2ea49a-341d-46f7-b148-576607986bcb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kell Brook celebrates after beating Jo Jo Dan in their IBF welterweight title fight in March 2015.

Though he may not be aware of writer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15_-cKwNWDA\">William Goldman’s classic blunders to avoid</a>, like never get involved in a land war in Asia, and never go in against a Sicilian when death is on the line, he most certainly knew that you should never go to Suncorp for an Origin decider and expect anything but misery. NSW’s last win in a Suncorp decider was, after all, way back in 2005, and that was a rare enough event in itself. As such, Daley pointed out a few days ago, “We have got to be more focused than we have ever been, we have got to be hungrier than we have ever been because that is what it is going to take to win up there.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/queensland-romp-to-state-of-origin-series-win\">Queensland romp to State of Origin series win with demolition of NSW</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As we know now, what with the image of NSW’s eviscerated carcass strewn across the Suncorp turf fresh in our minds, the Blues looked neither focused nor hungry on Wednesday night.

Tackles they should have made were missed, and their frustration and embarrassment at their impotence was evident in a few cheap shots, like James Tamou’s swinging arm on Jacob Lillyman and Trent Merrin’s upending tackle on man-of-the-series Corey Parker, who may be greying behind the ears but seemingly has more between them than the entire NSW pack put together. </p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457447742__\n</div> \n<p>The stats for the evening explain the 52-6 scoreline, a record Origin margin. Queensland scored eight tries to a lucky one (and a sublime Johnathan Thurston landed nine goals from nine attempts, and could have done so blind-folded so in-the-zone was he) on the back of an incredible 64% of possession. Queensland completed 37 or 42 sets (88%) to NSW’s 17 from 25 (68%). Queensland made just 181 tackles to NSW’s 319 and, tellingly, missed just nine tackles to NSW’s 26.</p> \n<p>Significantly, for this is a game in which momentum is crucial, Queensland also won the penalties by the massive margin of 12-5. NSW will feel chagrined by that last stat, and only once in their past dozen visits to Suncorp have they won more penalties than the Maroons, but most of the penalties against them last night were no-brainers. Under duress, NSW simply lost all sense of discipline.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/cameron-smith-snubs-nine-network-during-state-of-origin-decider\">Cameron Smith snubs Nine Network during State of Origin decider</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What these stats don’t explain is<em> why </em>NSW were so overwhelmed, why they were incapable, particularly early on, of matching Queensland’s intensity, and an autopsy will need to be held to find the answers. It hardly needs to be said – though you can never say it enough for Meninga’s liking – that this Queensland team, ageing though it is, is a version of the greatest Origin team of all time. Those names: Smith, Cronk, Thurston, Inglis (and Slater, though he didn’t play last night). They’re the Beatles. The Rolling Stones. The Beat Generation. The Renaissance artists in cleats. They’re key components in a team with passion, a team with immense skill, and a team so practiced at their art that when they rise to the occasion, as they almost always do, it seems like instinct, rather than the consequence of hard work, belief and motivation.</p> \n<p>But for all that, the gap between the two sides is not the chasm it was last night. It’s easy to rewrite history this morning but it’s no illusion; NSW <em>have </em>been creeping up on an ageing Queensland for the best part of the past four series. The Blues lost deciders in 2012 and 2013 by just one and two points respectively. Last year they won the first two games to claim the Origin shield for the first time since 2005, and this year they perhaps should have won Game I in Sydney before coming from behind to win game 2 in Melbourne. While through this period question marks have endured over many of the Blues’ personnel, such as Trent Hodkinson, Mitchell Pearce and Will Hopoate (and these question marks are now writ in 100 point and highlighted in red), the Blues were rightly seen as a real chance to win last night at Suncorp and bring the curtain down on the Maroons’ unprecedented era of success.</p> \n<p>That they didn’t, spectacularly so, points not just to Queensland’s skill, a left-side attack that’s sharp enough to split hairs, and the underestimated ability of Meninga to motivate his team despite all the gold that spills from the Maroons’ war chest, but the failure of Daley and his team to harness their best when it mattered most.</p> \n<p>“Geez, I didn’t see that coming,” Daley said after the slaughter. “We were never in it. It came down to possession. When you don’t feel in control, you lose your way at times. We have taken a lot of steps forwards over the last couple of years, tonight we took a few steps backwards. That wasn’t us tonight… I’m shocked it ended up like that.”</p> \n<p>Queensland will be shocked too, but in an altogether different way. They may be ageing, they may be nearing the end of the greatest era in Origin history, but as NSW now know they’re intent on raging, raging, against the dying of the light. </p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f6e68353e2e2f6c7765aa11d0718eeaddbb45d3e/0_287_4276_2564/4276.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2564,"width":4276,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Cameron Spencer/Getty Images","altText":"The Maroons’ Game III victory broke records – and NSW hearts.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T02:08:25Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T06:17:20Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":14,"contributors":[{"name":"Paul Connolly","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/paul-connolly"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["State of Origin","NRL","Rugby league","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/state-of-origin","webTitle":"State of Origin"},{"id":"sport/nrl","webTitle":"NRL"},{"id":"sport/rugbyleague","webTitle":"Rugby league"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Paul Connolly","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/paul-connolly"}}],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-457447742","source":"AAP","durationInSeconds":76,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/09/150709palashay_FromGAus-16x9.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/09/150709palashay_FromGAus/150709palashay_FromGAus.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436417430612/Annastacia-Palaszczuk-Ori-012.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":640,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk  Photograph: AAP","credit":"AAP","altText":"Annastacia Palaszczuk Origin","cleanCaption":"Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk  Photograph: AAP"}}],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/09/state-of-origin-queensland-brilliance-matched-by-nsw-embarrassment","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agxh","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jul/09/state-of-origin-queensland-brilliance-matched-by-nsw-embarrassment","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/09/state-of-origin-queensland-brilliance-matched-by-nsw-embarrassment"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f6e68353e2e2f6c7765aa11d0718eeaddbb45d3e/0_287_4276_2564/4276.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2564,"width":4276,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Maroons’ Game III victory broke records – and NSW hearts.

These are not normal circumstances. </p> \n<p>Despite the fact that NBA free agency officially kicked off at midnight last Wednesday, we’ve already seen 90% of the transactions. By Monday night, Yahoo Sports’ Eric Freeman could only list <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/13-remaining-free-agents-who-can-help-nba-teams-045311370.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">13 available free agents</a> who could potentially be difference makers. Under these conditions it’s not at all too early to start separating the winners from the losers.<br /></p> \n<h2>Winners</h2> \n<h2>San Antonio Spurs</h2> \n<p>There’s an argument to be made that the Spurs aren’t just the best-run team in the NBA, but the best-run team in all of US sports. It’s difficult to imagine any other team establishing themselves as immediate title favorites, while also improving their long-term prospects, quite like the Spurs did during the first week of free agency.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>It started with a yawn-inducing move that nearly everyone expected. The Spurs signed Kawhi Leonard almost as soon as they could, giving a deal to their future (current?) franchise player worth $90m over the next five years. A few hours later, they <a href=\"http://www.si.com/nba/2015/07/02/danny-green-spurs-nba-free-agency-lamarcus-aldridge-gregg-popovich\">handed a four-year, $45m contract</a> to 3-and-D poster child Danny Green. In the midst of all this, the Spurs traded Tiago Splitter to the Atlanta Hawks to make room for the Portland Trail Blazers’ LaMarcus Aldridge, possibly the top prize of this free agency class, who they signed to a maximum contract of four years and $80m on Saturday.</p> \n<p>They were able to afford to do all of this because their HOF veterans Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili were willing to return on reduced contracts. Yet again. This sacrifice on the parts of Duncan and Ginobili apparently inspired free agent David West, formerly of the Indiana Pacers, <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/summer-of-spurs-rages-on--david-west-to-sign-in-san-antonio-for-veteran-minimum-215751606.html\">to sign a minimum contract with the Spurs</a> on Monday. </p> \n<p>In other words, the Spurs haven’t merely won the off-season, they may have just successfully defeated the salary cap.</p> \n<h2>Golden State Warriors</h2> \n<p>If it weren’t for the Spurs’ crazy week, the current NBA champions would have remained favorites to win again next season. After all, the Warriors will be defending their title with basically the same team. Their only major concern heading into free agency was keeping forward Draymond Green, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13185246/draymond-green-golden-state-warriors-agree-5-year-contract\">who almost immediately accepted</a> a five-year, $85m contract.</p> \n<p>In fact, the Warriors have even benefited from losing a key player they couldn’t keep. By sending over-qualified bench player David Lee to the Boston Celtics, who are busy putting together the most aggressively uninteresting team in franchise history, Golden State has <a href=\"http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2015-07-07/david-lee-trade-warriors-celtics-gerald-wallace-salary-cap-savings\">freed up considerable financial resources</a>. <br /></p> \n<h2>Cleveland Cavaliers</h2> \n<p>The team the Warriors defeated in the NBA finals won’t be losing too many players, either. All the Cavaliers had to do to remain favorites in the Eastern Conference finals was to keep LeBron James and most of his supporting cast together, and hope for better health during next season’s playoffs. Barring unforeseen calamity, they’re on the way <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/cleveland-cavaliers-free-agency-2015-7\">to do just that</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Despite the non-stop speculation about his place on the team, Kevin Love was <a href=\"http://www.theplayerstribune.com/kevin-love-cavaliers-unfinished-business/\">never going anywhere</a>. The Cavaliers re-signed the power forward to a five-year, $110m contract on the first day of free agency. Shortly afterwards, the team came to a four-year, $40m agreement with Iman Shumpert.</p> \n<p>Of course, none of this matters until LeBron’s return is official, but by all accounts <a href=\"http://grantland.com/the-triangle/how-lebron-james-gets-what-he-wants-by-waiting/\">that will happen</a> once the Cavaliers take care of Tristan Thompson (the two share the same management). The Cavaliers continue to make moves during this negotiating period, they <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13212088/mo-williams-returning-cleveland-cavaliers-2-year-43-million-deal\">added Mo Williams</a> to their bench just yesterday.<br /></p> \n<h2>The Dallas Mavericks</h2> \n<p>By <a href=\"http://www.sbnation.com/2015/7/6/8900581/dallas-mavericks-deandre-jordan-signing-analysis\">stealing DeAndre Jordan away</a> from the Los Angeles Clippers, the Mavericks have kept themselves in playoff contention for the time being. Owner Mark Cuban has said that if they weren’t able to get Jordan, who they signed for four years and $80m, the Mavericks would probably have gone into tank mode.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/statuses/617113448179191808\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Mark Cuban admitted this was a DeAndre or doom summer. Mavs would have gone in tank mode if they struck out.</p>— Tim MacMahon (@espn_macmahon) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/espn_macmahon/status/617113448179191808\">July 3, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>And Jordan wasn’t Dallas’s only move as the Mavericks also signed Wes Matthews, formerly of the Trail Blazers, to a four-year deal. Although it’s uncertain what Matthews will be able to bring to the team once he recovers from his Achilles injury, it’s a move that has kept Dallas relevant while hastening the rebuilding process within their conference competitors in Portland.<br /></p> \n<h2>Memphis Grizzlies</h2> \n<p>The success or failure of the Grizzlies’ entire offseason was dependent on one question “Were they able to re-sign Marc Gasol?” The answer? Yes. <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/2015/news/07/07/marc-gasol-confirms-new-5-year-contract-with-memphis.ap/\">Yes they were.</a><br /></p> \n<h2>Miami Heat</h2> \n<p>Updates: no, Dwyane Wade won’t be playing for another team. Despite some pre-free agency rumblings, Miami were able to sign the guard to <a href=\"http://www.si.com/nba/2015/07/02/dwyane-wade-miami-heat-free-agency-grades-one-year-20-million\">a one-year deal</a> worth $10m. No, making this deal with Wade didn’t prevent them from retaining the services of Goran Dragic, who re-signed with the Miami Heat <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13179887/goran-dragic-miami-heat-reach-agreement-five-year-90-million-deal\">for five years and $90m</a>. No, we don’t know why we bother worrying about Pat Riley’s teams when they always end up being fine.<br /></p> \n<h2>Losers</h2> \n<h2>Sacramento Kings</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd3bff6d1724b26b230f94d84f44e9ec772e34b5\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/fd3bff6d1724b26b230f94d84f44e9ec772e34b5/0_74_2168_1302/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sacramento Kings’ DeMarcus Cousins dunks against Nerlen Noel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sacramento Kings’ DeMarcus Cousins dunks against Nerlen Noel.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Slocum/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What the hell is going on in Sacramento? How did they become an even more dysfunctional organization <em>after</em> the Maloof family sold the team? <br /></p> \n<p>In the days leading up to free agency there were reports that newly signed head coach George Karl wanted DeMarcus Cousins, their only true star player, gone. These were followed by reports that Kings owner Vivek Ranadive responded to this ultimatum by toying with the idea of rashly firing Karl just months after hiring him to replace Mike Malone, the head coach whom he had previously rashly fired.<br /></p> \n<p>Oddly enough, these revelations about Kings ownership didn’t exactly help them attract free agents. Most embarrassingly, free agent Wes Matthews turned down a <a href=\"http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/25231967/report-wes-matthews-agrees-to-three-year-45-million-deal-with-kings\">four-year/$64m contract</a> with the Kings to take a less lucrative deal with Dallas. This was particularly painful for Sacramento because they had already dumped salary in the hopes of making major moves this summer.<br /></p> \n<p>Instead, the Kings have decided to spend most of that freed up cap space on point guard Rajon Rondo, who was such a pain for the Mavericks that the team created a phony injury to avoid playing him in the postseason. In handing Rondo <a href=\"http://www.si.com/nba/2015/07/03/rajon-rondo-sacramento-kings-free-agency-grades-vivek-ranadive-george-karl\">a one year, $10m contract</a>, the Kings may have finally found an identity, something which has eluded them for years. Unfortunately, that identity could be “The Most Dysfunctional Team In Basketball.”</p> \n<h2>The Los Angeles Clippers</h2> \n<p>When asked about the Clippers offseason, JJ Redick <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/j-j--redick-gives-clippers-offseason-an-f--unless-there-s-an-f-minus-204408431.html\">gave his own team a F</a>. While his bosses may not have liked to hear him say that, it’s not like they could offer a counter-argument. No team was hurt more by a single move this past week than the Clippers were when big man DeAndre Jordan signed with the Dallas Mavericks.</p> \n<p>Losing Jordan has left the Lakers with two superstars in Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, a handful of useful but flawed supporting players and absolutely no financial wiggle room to make any major improvements. Their biggest moves of the offseason have been to trade for Lance Stephenson, who couldn’t handle the harsh media spotlight of Charlotte, and handing a ridiculously optimistic <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/clippers/2015/07/01/paul-pierce-agrees--contract--clippers/29593477/\">three year contract</a> to near-retiree Paul Pierce.</p> \n<h2>The Los Angeles Lakers</h2> \n<p>Maybe Redick was being a tad unfair in grading the Clippers, since they arguably had the better offseason of LA’s two NBA teams. The Los Angeles Lakers failed to attract any major free agents, despite having cash to spend and a supposed mystique to sell to players. Most comically, they had to beg LaMarcus Aldridge <a href=\"http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/07/the-lakers-got-a-second-chance-at-lamarcus-aldridge-but-it-wont-matter\">for a second meeting</a> after thoroughly botching theirf first.</p> \n<p>Aldridge decided to sign with the Spurs, who could end up being the best team in the NBA, rather than the Lakers, who could end up once again being one of the worst. That isn’t what should trouble Lakers fans. What should trouble them is that the Lakers organization was apparently surprised by this turn of events.<br /></p> \n<p>(Potential saving grace of the Lakers’ off-season: Roy Hibbert was great on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYeup5zrZbs\">Parks and Recreation,</a> so it’s nice that he will get more acting opportunities now that he’s <a href=\"http://www.libertyballers.com/2015/7/5/8896591/lakers-add-hibbert-lou-williams-to-roster\">closer to Hollywood</a>.)<br /></p> \n<h2>The New York Knicks</h2> \n<p>In some respects, it’s been a much easier week to be a Knicks fan than a Lakers fan, because at least Knicks fans have been conditioned to not expect anything good to happen.<br /></p> \n<p>There’s even <a href=\"https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/untitled-article-1436194798\">an argument</a> that the Knicks’ failure to do much of anything during the busiest week of free agency in league history could turn out to be something of a positive. Rather than making any franchise-crippling mistakes, the biggest decision the Knicks made was to bring in Portland Trial Blazers center Robin Lopez on a relatively modest <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/nba-free-agency-new-york-knicks-robin-lopez-deandre-jordan-070315\">four-year deal</a>. While this makes sense, it feels weird to start praising a team just for not having the resources necessary to pursue a terrible, short-sighted plan this time around.<br /></p> \n<h2>Portland Trail Blazers</h2> \n<p>There’s also a positive way to spin this Portland Trail Blazers season: rather than making any desperate moves to stay in contention, the Trail Blazers have fully committed themselves to the art of giving up. Working with the understanding that LaMarcus Aldridge was already gone, Portland has spent the last week waving goodbye to <a href=\"http://www.h4-entertainment.com/2015/07/after-losing-four-starters-the-portland-trail-blazers-are-lottery-bound/\">roughly half their team</a>. Wes Matthews is now in Dallas, Robin Lopez is in New York, Nic Batum is with the Charlotte Hornets and Aldridge, of course, has ascended to basketball heaven. <br /></p> \n<p>Although it’s painful to see a club allow itself to be dismantled after spending such a brief period as a contender, it’s weirdly noble in a way. The Trail Blazers saw how impossible it would be to contend in the Western Conference and decided to look ahead to the future rather than doing anything stupid.<br /></p> \n<h2>Detroit Pistons</h2> \n<p>Speaking of “doing anything stupid,” that brings us to the Pistons. After a season where they somehow failed to even make the Eastern Conference playoffs, and an offseason where they lost Greg Monroe to the Milwaukee Bucks, the Pistons decided the key was to re-sign Reggie Jackson by any means possible. As a result, the Pistons signed Jackson, a sixth-man caliber offensive contributor they acquired in a trade deadline deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder, to an inexplicably huge <a href=\"http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/07/05/report-detroit-pistons-sign-restricted-free-agent-reggie-jackson-for-five-years-80-million/\">five-year, $80m contract</a>.</p> \n<p>In a week where teams were happily handing out four or five year deals to every player with a pulse and half-decent employment history, the Pistons still somehow managed to come up with the worst free agent contract so far.

Turn your back for a second and the action will have unfolded in your absence.</p> \n<p>The latest episode of drama came late on Saturday night, when a majority of the population were glued to their TVs watching Chile and Argentina in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/chile-argentina-copa-america-final-match-report\" title=\"\">Copa Am&eacute;rica final</a>. It was then that news broke that Stephen Keshi, the national team head coach, had been relieved of his duties with immediate effect. To the neutral observer, this would have appeared an unfathomable decision by the Nigeria Football Federation. After all, Keshi signed a two-year deal only in April. To football fans within the country, however, the news was greeted with little surprise and, to an extent, with relief. Relief that Keshi’s tumultuous relationship with the NFF had come to an end.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.thenff.com/2015/07/nff-terminates-keshis-contract/\" title=\"\">NFF released a statement </a>immediately after the conclusion of the meeting held by its disciplinary committee that lasted well into the night. It said its decision was made “having thoroughly reviewed the reports/findings of the NFF disciplinary committee and the NFF technical and development committee, as well as having reviewed the actions and inactions of Mr Stephen Keshi, in the performance of his duties as the Super Eagles’ head coach, which we found to lack the required commitment to achieve the federation’s objectives as set out in the coach’s employment contract.”</p> \n<p>The NFF, in conclusion, added that the sacking was “without prejudice to the settlement of any existing and due financial obligations between the NFF and Mr Keshi”.</p> \n<p>Shuaibu Amodu, the NFF technical director, was appointed the caretaker coach and Salisu Yusuf was named as his assistant.</p> \n<p>The sacking marked the end of a messy marriage of convenience between the NFF and Keshi. The NFF took decisive action against Keshi after it was stated by Ivory Coast’s FA that the former Super Eagles captain was <a href=\"http://www.fedivoir.com/fifci/?q=article/s%C3%A9lectionneur-des-el%C3%A9phants-3\" title=\"\">among the 59 candidates</a> who applied to take over from Herv&eacute; Renard, the African Cup of Nations-winning manager who left for the French club Lille.</p> \n<p>Keshi was summoned by the NFF to explain his action and his statement at the disciplinary hearing was that “neither he, his agent nor anybody acting on his behalf” applied for the Ivory Coast job.</p> \n<p>It turned out the application was submitted by the football agent Hermann Brice De Souza on 11 June. De Souza, originally from Benin Republic, works out of France and Togo, where Keshi coached the national team in three spells between 2004 and 2011. On 20 June, the day after the application was made public, De Souza wrote to the Ivorian FA seeking to withdraw it. There is no proof De Souza acted on Keshi’s behalf but the application contained a detailed CV and cover letter which NFF sources claim establishes proof of contact between Keshi’s camp and De Souza.</p> \n<p>Keshi was also queried for inviting the non-league player Okechukwu Gabriel for June’s Cup of Nations 2017 qualifier and handing him the No10 jersey, made famous by the silky feet of Austin “Jay Jay” Okocha. The NFF quoted the clause in Keshi’s contract which read: “The head coach shall select the best crop of players for the Super Eagles who are ready to excel in friendly and competitive games in consultation with the technical committee and the technical study group of the NFF.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"538a0938b027c35f25bd06adce9e6b6c5191ee08\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436278063309/b7ea5ba1-bfc7-42fd-af0e-4d281ada0393-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nigeria celebrate their Africa Cup of Nations triumph in 2013 after beating Burkina Faso in the final under the guidance of Stephen Keshi.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigeria celebrate their Africa Cup of Nations triumph in 2013 after beating Burkina Faso in the final under the guidance of Stephen Keshi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But to believe the NFF’s claims that Keshi was sacked solely for these two indictments would be ignorant.

He was reinstated following the intervention of the then president, Goodluck Jonathan, further testament to the complex web of interaction between sports and politics in Africa.</p> \n<p>The Confederations Cup in Brazil took place without much event as the team crashed out at the first hurdle despite a 6-1 walloping of minnows Tahiti. Few voices of dissent were raised following his questionable team selections and tactics. World Cup qualifiers came around and the team did just enough to qualify but it was at this point that performances dipped and a host of underwhelming players began to earn invitations to the Eagles’ fold.</p> \n<p>Despite taking Nigeria to the round of 16 in Brazil, Keshi’s contract was allowed to lapse but again forces above the NFF ensured he was allowed to take charge of qualifiers for the 2015 Cup of Nations on a game-by-game rolling contract. Playing out in the background was the leadership crisis at the NFF which meant a lasting solution could not be found. With the unwanted distraction of the NFF’s politics, the Super Eagles failed to qualify for the Cup of Nations, becoming the first defending champions to suffer that fate.</p> \n<p>At the time, Amaju Pinnick had emerged as the NFF chairman and, rather surprisingly, Keshi was offered a new deal worth about &pound;16,000 a month. Keshi, however, was far from impressed. “From the clauses I have seen so far, I don’t know what words to use but the contract can be described as a ‘slave contract’,” he said, possibly in reference to clauses that made him answerable to several committees and a code of conduct regarding his media presence.</p> \n<p>A conclusion was reached and he signed a two-year deal in April but the relationship was far from cordial. High-ranking officials claimed political intervention yet again was key to securing a new deal but a change in government weeks later meant Keshi’s position was no longer safe. Keshi was sacked days after Ita Ekpenyong, head of the state security service and widely believed to be his last major government backer, was relieved of his duties by the new president Muhammadu Buhari.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80c8502c597c085e4d3b3c413d0d81fa8de631c4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436278314541/883313a7-dead-4cd2-a011-d6458dbf48f5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Pogba heads France's first goal in their 2-0 defeat of Nigeria in the last 16 of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Pogba heads France’s first goal in their 2-0 defeat of Nigeria in the last 16 of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Gross/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Keshi has always been a hugely divisive figure in Nigerian football and his sack has reopened fervent debate across the country. In one corner stands a group that believe he is a charlatan who got lucky at the 2013 Cup of Nations. His perceived high-handedness, in particular the exclusion of the local hero Sunday Mba from the World Cup squad, also gained him more enemies than friends. In the other corner, though, is a camp eternally grateful to Keshi for ending Nigeria’s trophy drought of 19 years while blooding some unknown players in the process. They point to his integration of home-based players with their foreign-based colleagues and staunchly believe he has been made scapegoat of a failing football system.</p> \n<p>Pinnick’s dislike of Keshi has always been apparent and it was only a matter of time before the coach was dismissed. “From the beginning I told Keshi as a friend not to accept the NFF contract when it was offered him,” the former Gombe State FA chairman Shaibu Gara Gombe <a href=\"http://africanfootball.com/news/542517/Keshi-dug-his-own-grave-Gara-Gombe\" title=\"\">told AfricanFootball.com</a>. “For God’s sake that contract was enough to tell you that you are not needed. Whether or not Keshi applied for the job, he dug his grave by himself.</p> \n<p>“Keshi himself knows the NFF president Amaju Pinnick doesn’t like him, Keshi knows that Chris Green [the NFF head of the technical committee] is his No1 enemy in the NFF and he still went ahead to take the job. So I am sorry but he got what he bargained for. However, I don’t think the appearance of his name for the Cote d’Ivoire job is enough to get him sacked. The simple truth is that the NFF never wanted Keshi.”</p> \n<p>As expected, the NFF is pursuing the appointment of a foreign manager and, according to the journalist Colin Udoh, “with the speed of progress, Nigeria may have a new coach by the weekend”. It is believed that more than 50 applications have been received for the vacant post. Elite managers with international experience who are available are in short supply and Nigeria may have to appoint someone without experience of managing in Africa, as Egypt did with H&eacute;ctor C&uacute;per. This would amount to significant risk, with the journalist Mike Ikeogwu saying: “The NFF should not hire a foreign coach but rather look inwards and pick another indigenous coach to continue from where Keshi stopped. We should give our coaches a platform to develop their potential.’’</p> \n<p>This represents a fresh low for Nigerian football, which regularly seems to find new depths to plumb. Not for the first time, it finds itself at a crucial crossroads. The time to get things right is now.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436277518990/Stephen-Keshi-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Stephen Keshi denied that he had applied for the Ivory Coast job before his dismissal by Nigeria.

The column is taking a break in the off-season but you can still send questions to <a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">knowledge@theguardian.com</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theknowledge_gu\">on Twitter</a>.</p>","byline":"Guardian sport","body":"<p><strong>“Cochabamba’s Club Jorge Wilstermann is named after Bolivia’s first commercial pilot,”</strong> wrote John Wilson back in 2010. <strong>“Are there any other teams out there named after individuals?”</strong><br /></p> \n<p>This question had the Knowledge inbox bulging at the seams, with the names pouring in of a deluge of men (and a couple of women) who have the privilege of a team named in their honour. We decided to discount teams named after saints (because there are so many of them) and those that reside in towns and cities already named after the great and the good – Milton Keynes Dons, for example. Here, then, are a few of our then-favourites:</p> \n<p><strong>Vasco da Gama </strong>Formed out of a rowing club already named after the famous Portuguese explorer.</p> \n<p><strong>Willem II </strong>The Eredivisie side from Tilburg are named after King Willem II of the Netherlands. Tilburg housed his military headquarters.</p> \n<p><strong>Newell’s Old Boys </strong>Isaac Newell came into the world in Strood, Kent, on 24 April 1853. By the time he left it, on 16 October 1907, he had created what would go on to be one of Argentinian football’s most famous clubs.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Club Atl&eacute;tico Aldosivi </strong>Another side from Argentina. “The name originates from the first two letters of the last names of the four original founders,” writes Russell Yong. “Allard, Dollfus, Sillard and Wiriott – the W changing to a V due to there being no W key on the telegraph that originally announced the club’s formation.”<br /></p> \n<p><strong>CD O’Higgins </strong>Born in Chile, Bernardo O’Higgins Riquelme was the illegitimate son of Ambrosio O’Higgins – a future governor of Chile and viceroy of Peru, born to Spanish parents in Sligo in Ireland. He grew up to be a leader of the home side in the Chilean War of Independence and is seen as one of the country’s founding fathers. When two clubs in the city of Rancagua merged in 1955 they kept the prefix of one of the clubs, O’Higgins Braden.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Club Presidente Hayes </strong>One of the few clubs – if not the only one – named after a US president. Hayes was apparently very merciful towards Paraguay after taking charge of peace talks after the War of the Triple Alliance (which sounds like it should be in Star Wars, but was actually an exceptionally bloody affair in the 1860s involving Paraguay, Argentina, &shy;Uruguay and Brazil). Hayes’s role led to a number of institutions being named in his honour, including this football club from Asunci&oacute;n.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>CD Luis Angel Firpo </strong>The oldest club in El Salvador. Originally named Tec&uacute;n Um&aacute;n but changed to CD Luis Angel Firpo in honour of the Argentinian boxer’s epic bout and narrow defeat to the heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey in 1923.</p> \n<p><strong>Renato Curi Angolana </strong>“An amalgamation of two clubs: dell’Angolana and Renato Curi,” wrote Fergal Hunter. “The latter was created in honour of Renato Curi who played for Perugia in the 1970s. He was a midfielder who joined them when they were in Serie B, helped get them promoted to Serie A and led them to sixth place. He died in October 1977 of a heart attack on the pitch during a Serie A match with Juventus. He was 24. Perugia’s stadium is also named after him.”<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Club Atl&eacute;tico Douglas Haig </strong>Why would a club from Pergamino, just north of Buenos Aires, name itself after a British first world war Field Marshall? According to the club: “On 18 November 1918 after the resounding victory of the Allied forces, a group of British workers on the Argentinian central railroad decided to start a club to participate in the local soccer championship. This required the consent and support of the chief of the railway, Ronald Leslie, who, as a condition, requested that the club take the name of General Douglas Haig.”<br /></p> \n<p><strong>CD Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba</strong> “Named after not one, but two individuals,” wrote Tim Dockery. “They are the result of a 1930 compromise when Sportivo Godoy Cruz (named after a signatory of the Argentinian Declaration of Independence, Tom&aacute;s Godoy Cruz) merged with Deportivo Bodega Antonio Tomba (Tomba’s store was a sponsor of that club).”<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Colo-Colo </strong>The only Chilean side to have won the Copa Libertadores were named after Colocolo, a Mapuche chief of the 16th century. The name translates as ‘mountain cat’.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Deportivo Walter Ferretti </strong>Ferreti was a Sandinista comandante known as “Chombo” who was killed in a road accident in 1991. The old ministry of the interior team (where he used to work) is named after him.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Joe Public FC </strong>The Trinidad and Tobago club, once home to Kenwyne Jones and former Dundee and Gillingham defender Brent Sancho, is named after, well, everybody basically.<br /></p> \n<h2>WHICH PLAYERS HAVE MOVES NAMED AFTER THEM?</h2> \n<p><strong>“In France, a powerful acrobatic volleyed goal is referred to as ‘Une Papinade’ after Jean-Pierre Papin scored many in his time,”</strong> observed Nick Dunmore in 2007. <strong>“Apart from the Cruyff turn, what other moves across the world are named after players?”</strong></p> \n<p>Many players have lent their names to particular moves, though as you’d imagine, not all of them are cap-doffingly positive paeans like the one afforded to Cruyff. But let’s start with the positives, because we’re all about spreading the love.</p> \n<p>The sauciest penalty of all - the sort Zin&eacute;dine Zidane so nearly jiggered up in the 2006 World Cup final, the cheeky chip down the middle - is known the world over as a Panenka, after Czechoslovakia’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp2HZNheCZ8\">Antonin Panenka</a>, who clipped the ball straight down the middle at 1mph past Sepp Maier in the final of the 1976 Euros against West Germany.</p> \n<p>There is real debate, however, when it comes to the 360-degree turn, often referred to as the ‘Garrincha turn’. As Paul Doyle noted in his <a href=\"http://football.guardian.co.uk/theknowledge/story/0,,1725658,00.html#article_continue\">Sprechen sie Fu&szlig;ball?</a> article of 2006, “PlayStation games refer to it as the Marseille turn, also known in English as the double drag-back, Zidane turn, Maradona turn and, according to earlier computer games, the [David] Rocastle 360. Zidane himself calls it la roulette.”</p> \n<p>Norwegians meanwhile refer to the ‘Flopasning’ - literally ‘the Flo pass’ - named after Jostein Flo, formerly of Sheffield United. “This was the favourite tactic of the national side in the first half of the 90s,” explained David Glass. “The move involved one of the full-backs, usually Liverpool’s Stig Inge Bjornebye, hoofing a long diagonal ball up to the giant Flo. He would then knock the ball down to one of the midfielders who would be steaming in. Pretty basic, but quite effective before opposing sides worked out what was going on. The term is still used in Norway.”</p> \n<p>Jack Robinson, Southampton’s goalkeeper of 1899 vintage, was similarly honoured after showing some Austrians how to tackle low shots by diving to stop or catch the ball. “That type of save was referred to as ‘a Robinsonade’ in Austria and some parts of Central Europe until the middle of the 20th century,” explained Pete McAuliffe. “Robinson was also an England international. It is perhaps worth asking whether the term still exists on the continent given the plight of the current England No1, though with a different meaning for any element of hapless goalkeeping.”</p> \n<p>Whoosh! There goes the love! So we might as well move on to more derogatory terms - and, speaking of hapless goalkeeping, the case of Franck Grandel. Peter de Koning explained: “Grandel, a Guadeloupe-born goalkeeper, made some comical mistakes during his first season in the Dutch league at FC Utrecht. So much so that fans started referring to mistakes leading to goals as ‘Grandelletje’.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile in Denmark, a hospital pass is known as a ‘rigtig Jesper Olsen’ (‘a real Jesper Olsen’). “It’s named after Olsen’s square ball across his own defence that set up Spain’s equaliser in Denmark’s 1986 World Cup match,” explained Aidan Curran. “Having been 1-0 down, Spain went on to destroy the Danes 5-1. Sometimes Danish politicians use the term to mock an opponent’s blunder or gaffe.”</p> \n<h2>WHICH FOOTBALL CLUBS HAVE HAD SHIPS NAMED AFTER THEM?</h2> \n<p> \u0012<strong>“On a recent tour of Rotterdam Docks I noticed a container ship called Borussia Dortmund, painted, of course, in garish yellow and black,” </strong>wrote Paul Corrigan, also in 2010.<strong>”Do any other clubs have ships named after them?”</strong></p> \n<p>“As a seaman, I know of the ship that Paul is referring to,” writes Roland de Boer. “Whilst working aboard another vessel I have passed it in the North Sea on a few occasions recently. I have also encountered the ‘Borussia M&ouml;nchengladbach’ which is green and white, the ‘AT Bilbao’, the ‘Kaizer Chiefs’, and the ‘Juventus’. No doubt there are many others. Vessels are named by their owners or holding companies. Sometimes the name seems random but some vessels are named after famous figures (real, literary or mythical), places, song titles or for family members. Of course, the odd wealthy football fan can also pay homage to his team in this way.”</p> \n<p>Well let’s take a look at the good ship Borussia Dortmund. Built in 1998, she’s currently stationed in St Petersburg, though seems set to head to Hamburg this week (<a href=\"http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/datasheet.aspx?SHIPNAME=Borussia+Dortmund&amp;TYPE_SUMMARY=&amp;PORT_ID=&amp;menuid=&amp;datasource=SHIPS_CURRENT&amp;app=&amp;mode=&amp;B1=Search\">you can follow her progress on this brilliant tool here</a>). <a href=\"http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/showallphotos.aspx?mmsi=210001000#top_photo\">More than 20 photos of her in all her glory can be found here</a>, as she flits from port to port. There’s also <a href=\"http://www.vesseltracker.com/en/ShipPhotos/558058-Juventus-I289973.html\">the aforementioned Juventus</a> and a couple of <a href=\"http://www.vesseltracker.com/en/VesselArchive/All/All.html?search=arsenal+\">Arsenals</a> too.</p> \n<p>Incidentally, while on the subject of Dortmund, it would be remiss of us not to recall the instance when an investigation by the German consumer TV show Plusminus in 2000 claimed to have found tributyltin - a toxic anti-bacterial chemical that can cause health problems in humans - in the club’s replica Nike shirts. Tributyltin is more commonly used as a paint on ships to protect them from barnacle damage. “We knew that the substance was still used in coatings for ships, but it shouldn’t be in textiles that people wear,” said scientist J&uuml;rgen Kundke. Dortmund pulled the shirts from their club shop, as did the Kaufhof, Karstadt and Hertie department stores, though Nike were quick to insist: “Small doses of TBT when used in textiles are not normally dangerous to humans.”</p> \n<p>Moving on, Michel van der Velde notes that<strong> “</strong>a towage company from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IJmuiden\">IJmuiden</a>(close to Amsterdam) re-named one of their ships after the local second division football club two months ago. Telstar, whose famous players include Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Arjan de Zeeuw, Heinz Stuy and Louis van Gaal, <a href=\"http://www.iskestugs.nl/fleetlist/\">can be seen here</a> [not any more it can’t - Archive Ed].” And Nick Tolerton adds that “there was a whole fleet of ships named after teams, the Consolidated Fisheries Ltd fleet of deepwater Grimsby steam and motor trawlers”. He goes on to add:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>In the 1960s this ran to more than 20 ships named after football teams, and over the decades from the first in the early 1930s nearly 30 clubs were represented. Inevitably there was a Grimsby Town. However, as well as ships named after the more glamorous clubs of the 50s and 60s - an Arsenal, Aston Villa, Everton, Spurs, and Wolverhampton Wanderers (the last of those must have been a tight squeeze to paint up on the stern) - the smaller clubs were well-represented, including an Aldershot, Gillingham, Port Vale, and, generously considering their rivalry with Grimsby, a Lincoln City. The one foreign team, inevitably at that time, was the Real Madrid of 1961.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>More information about Grimsby Trawlers of the day, including the Consolidated Fisheries Ltd ‘football fleet’ and details of them getting in trouble for calling a ship “Notts County” (a schoolboy error) <a href=\"http://homepage.ntlworld.com/grimsby.trawlers/consolship1.htm\">can be found here</a>.</p> \n<p>Switching to tourist boats, Justin Horton offers word of the Spanish ferry company Iscomar, which “repainted its vessel Isabel Del Mar with the badge of RCD Mallorca as part of <a href=\"http://www.diariodeibiza.es/pitiuses-balears/2009/09/20/iscomar-retira-barco-reducir-gastos/360434.html\">a sponsorship deal</a>. It is to be hoped that neither party to the agreement goes down.” And Genoa resident Michael Nimmo adds that “one of the companies (Rimorchiatori Riuniti) where I work, organises boats in the harbour here. A lot of their workers are Genoa fans, and in honour of one of our star players two years ago, Thiago Motta (formerly of Bar&ccedil;a and now of Inter) the company called one of their boats The Brazilian, and gave it No88 (his squad number). He came down and signed autographs and had his photo taken, but needless to say he left shortly after.”</p> \n<p>While we’re on the subject of football’s seafaring links, it is worth digging into the history of Boca Juniors. After losing a play-off against local rivals Boedo for the right to their black-and-white-striped kit in March 1907, Boca agreed to visit Buenos Aires harbour and take the colours of the first foreign ship to come in. The 4,146-tonne freighter Drottning Sophia arrived from Copenhagen, flying the Swedish flag and the rest is history. When the club released a limited-edition 105th anniversary shirt in 2010, it even bore the yellow and blue national flag on the front.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><em>Send your questions to <a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">knowledge@theguardian.com</a></em></strong><br /></li> \n</ul>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/050f37f79effa83f652d1d3186021aaa044e2e00/230_61_1199_719/1199.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":719,"width":1199,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Mathew Brady/AP","altText":"President Rutherford B Hayes","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Mathew Brady/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-08T09:00:07Z","lastModified":"2015-07-08T09:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Guardian sport","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/guardian-sport"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Football","Sport","Vasco Da Gama","Newell's Old Boys","Norway","Austria","Denmark","Borussia Dortmund","Zinedine Zidane"],"tags":[{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"football/vascodagama","webTitle":"Vasco Da Gama"},{"id":"football/newellsoldboys","webTitle":"Newell's Old Boys"},{"id":"football/norway","webTitle":"Norway"},{"id":"football/austria","webTitle":"Austria"},{"id":"football/denmark","webTitle":"Denmark"},{"id":"football/borussiadortmund","webTitle":"Borussia Dortmund"},{"id":"football/zinedine-zidane","webTitle":"Zinedine Zidane"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Guardian sport","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/guardian-sport"}}],"series":{"title":"The Knowledge","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/series/theknowledge"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jul/08/football-knowledge-things-named-after-things-people","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aejb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/blog/2015/jul/08/football-knowledge-things-named-after-things-people","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jul/08/football-knowledge-things-named-after-things-people"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/050f37f79effa83f652d1d3186021aaa044e2e00/230_61_1199_719/1199.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":719,"width":1199,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rutherford B Hayes, 19th president of the United States and Paraguayan fotballing inspiration.
