An analogous sensation afflicts those drawn to conspiracy theories about the Fifa scandal. Guys, guys, guys … this already IS a massive conspiracy. Do we really need to claim it’s all actually about something else?</p> \n<p>Yes is the answer. Yes we do. I can’t remember whether this was all foretold in an appendix to The Wealth of Nations or if it was the Book of Revelation, but we have now reached the bit of late-stage capitalism/endtimes where it is <em>de rigueur</em> to float conspiracy theories even about conspiracies.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/10/fifa-world-cup-bidding-postponed\">Fifa bidding process for 2026 World Cup postponed</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>God knows the homemade Fifa investigation board now dominates two walls of my bedroom, and is beginning to look like one of those LSD spiderwebs, what with all the lines of yarn linking pictures of Exco members with ones of Princess Di and the Twin Towers and whatnot. I’m particularly proud of my work proving Sepp Blatter is the direct descendant of Jesus and his wife Mary Magdalene. Eat my dust, Robert Langdon – this ends HERE.</p> \n<p>Here, then, follows a roundup of the best actual Fifa conspiracy conspiracies currently doing the rounds, so you can find the perfect one in which to lose yourself:</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Blatter is the victim of a conspiracy. Though this has much to recommend it, it’s faintly undermined by the fact that the chief tinfoil hatters on it are Blatter and Blatter’s daughter. The first whiff of this came when Sepp cast the FBI arrests as an attempt to “interfere with” Fifa’s congress. “I am not certain,” he hedged, “but this does not smell good.” You’ve heard of selective hearing: say hello to selective smelling. This is the equivalent of working in a sewage treatment facility and complaining about a colleague’s aftershave. “I don’t know if you want to call them dark forces,” Blatter’s daughter has confided of those mysterious agencies out to destroy her father, “but, I mean, they really tried hard.” Frankly, this conspiracy needs to try harder – for any hope of traction they need to get at least Oliver Stone on board.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> It’s just a marketing ploy for the Fifa vanity movie United Passions. You’ve always got to love the PR stunt conspiracists. They see everything! Even now there are those claiming the hacking of Sony Pictures was nothing more than a publicity stunt for crappy Seth Rogen comedy The Interview, despite the fact it led to senior executives coming under heavy fire, and the pissing off of a series of A-list stars. And so with Fifa, whose dedication to United Passions is so absolute that it is willing to destroy its organisation and incur 428 consecutive life sentences just to get this motion picture seen.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> And so to a group of conspiracies we shall place beneath the umbrella heading Because America. Because, you know … AMERICA. Sample theory: the US is as terrified by how powerful soccer has become as it once was by Jimi Hendrix’s rise, which is why it has to kill it. As it did Jimi. Don’t fancy that one? There are plenty of other flavours, although Henry Kissinger’s love of soccer means the traditional conspiracy theorist’s darling will be feeling a little left out of this party. Still, big names attached to the Because America conspiracy theories include Jack Warner, who, of course,<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/31/ex-fifa-vice-president-jack-warner-swallows-onion-spoof\" title=\"\"> cited an Onion article as evidence for his belief that this all stemmed from the US losing out to Qatar for 2022 hosting rights</a>.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Deserving of a category all of its own is the idea that this is a specifically anti-Russian conspiracy by the US. A Mr V Putin of Moscow is on board with this one, obviously, which is best glossed by the Kremlin official who told Time: “So there are clearly forces in America that are trying to turn anything positive that we have into a new channel of confrontation. And even if there was bribery going on [at Fifa], why would the Americans only bring it up now, just after Fifa refused the demands of [US] senators to revoke Russia’s right to host the champions?” Why indeed? Sport’s always been war by other means; now it’s cold war by other means.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> And with an inevitability as edifying as it is imaginative: it’s the Jews. Come on, you knew it was them all along, didncha? This conspiracy suggests the FBI arrests somehow derailed the Palestinian FA’s threat to seek Israel’s suspension from Fifa, and of course the US will do anything for Israel, even for Israel’s FA … I’m sorry, I haven’t the strength to go on with this paragraph. Maybe another time.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, conspiracy seekers, pick one of the above. Pick three. Just don’t allow yourself to be a slave to what they’re telling you, which is that this is just a vast international conspiracy involving money laundering, wire fraud, bribery and racketeering.</p> \n<p>(Incidentally, just as an FYI to any tempted to contact me and wake me up to the reality of any of these conspiracies, but most particularly the Jews one: all emails I receive will be handed directly to a selection of world governments – and, indeed, to THE world government – who will come round when you are sleeping and implant a listening device in one of your upper molars. So do stay your hand: your activities are simply too damn important to be compromised by this kind of surveillance.)</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433929769070/baltter-and-depardieu-006.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":324,"width":540,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Fifa's president Sepp Blatter, right, give the thumbs-up with Gérard Depardieu at the Cannes premiere of the Fifa film United Passions.

In Sydney, the real estate boom has gentrified boxing’s inner-city heartland, moving it to clusters in the distant outer suburbs, and 40 kilometres out west, Blacktown has become the new epicentre of Australian boxing. The Vinegar Hill Boxing Gym sits in the heart of a dusty industrial area, in the roof cavity at the back of a concrete factory wedged between exhaust muffler and scrap metal dealers. It is named after the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vinegar_Hill\">1798 Battle of Vinegar Hill</a> – the last stand of the Irish Rebels against the English and its local namesake, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Hill_convict_rebellion\">1804 Battle of Vinegar Hill</a> when the British Colonial army crushed an Irish convict rebellion nearby. The gym reeks of struggle.<br /></p> \n<p> The posters hanging off the cinder blocks surrounding the ring are old-school – Thomas Hearns, Mike Tyson, Roberto Duran, Sugar Ray Leonard, Muhammad Ali, Sonny Liston. It is a surreal yet suitable habitat for a boxing blue blood, Nigel Benn, nicknamed the Dark Destroyer and at his peak one of England’s most recognisable sporting heroes. Benn’s record as an amateur boxer was 41-1 before he turned professional in 1987. Over a nine-year career he won two world titles, at middleweight and super middleweight, and finished with a professional career record of 42-5-1 with 35 knockouts. </p> \n<p> Trainer Rod Williams waits patiently on the ropes for Benn’s private training session to start. Williams is a wiry and wise South African who moved to Australia from the tough streets of Johannesburg at the age of 10. A champion coach, he has devoted his life to the fight game and now trains a stable of rookies and elite amateurs including Benn’s son Conor. Benn was so impressed at Williams’s work with his son that he joined the stable himself to keep learning. </p> \n<p>Williams trains champions like Benn, but he also works with novice fighters. “They are the ones who teach me how to teach,” he says. Since taking on Benn over a year ago, Williams has been shocked at his ability to do new things. “He could easily have played the old dog you can’t teach new tricks to, but in every single session he’s done everything I’ve asked,” says Williams. “He has never put the ‘I’m the Dark Destroyer’ on me. He’s good that way. For a man over 50 his stamina and strength is amazing.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90681ca1314927b66512cbba2b23381322dd8652\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/90681ca1314927b66512cbba2b23381322dd8652/0_57_2953_1912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benn working the pads with trainer Rod Williams.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benn working the pads with trainer Rod Williams.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Abbott for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> Inside the ring, Benn explodes into action. The stereo blares while Williams calls the shots and Benn obliges. Conor leans on the ropes watching his father’s every move. Conor has now had 20 amateur fights and is planning to join the Hatton Academy in Manchester run by former world champion Ricky Hatton. “I still watch my father’s fights” Conor says with a smile. “I look up to him and he’s my inspiration. I didn’t know how big he was growing up in Spain. Until we went to England and everybody wanted a photo – it was bizarre. Look at him – he’s still looking good!”</p> \n<p> Benn Snr is in mint condition and throwing thunderclap straight rights into the pads, working feverishly through three-minute rounds with half-minute rests. Between rounds, Williams chimes in: “Conor brings a lot to the table genetically but gets no special privileges.” “He’s got the DNA!” shouts Benn, sweating profusely, but Williams continues. “Conor loves it to death but he has to be patient.”</p> \n<p> The buzzer rings and the gruelling rounds continue. Williams has his eyes closed now as Benn machine guns short punches into the pads before exploding with a series of vicious left hooks. Williams stops Benn mid-round to explain an adjustment in angles. Benn soaks it in: “I got you, I see what you mean.” As the end of the 12<sup>th</sup> round looms, Benn finishes with a furious flurry that goes one minute over time. “That’s what an old man can do!” he yells. Towelling off the sweat, he invites my questions: “Bring it on!”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"962f64d59c54d91236d6dbf2c01f86ddbc35d305\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/962f64d59c54d91236d6dbf2c01f86ddbc35d305/0_126_2953_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"“It’s all in the mind,” says Benn to the photographer as he hurtles through his training regime.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">“It’s all in the mind,” says Benn to the photographer as he hurtles through his training regime.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Abbott for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Born in 1964 in Ilford in east London to immigrant parents from Barbados, Benn was brought up in Essex before moving to Spain and then settling in Australia in 2013: “Tell you the truth my wife Carolyne suggested it,” Benn says. “I said to her ‘Australia? You must be mad, everything’s venomous’. Then I worked through it. We black men don’t surf so that ruled out sharks.” Eventually, he was convinced. Twelve years in Spain was enough, and it was easy to communicate in Australia. His first day in Sydney had a huge impact. He remembers ordering fried rice in English from a Chinese waiter. “I thought, ‘Here we are!’” he says. “I fell in love with it all – the size of the beaches, the big blue sky, the barbecues and focus on families getting together.”</p> \n<p> Benn left painful memories back in England. At the age of eight his hero older brother Andy was killed suspiciously and violently at just 17, and a hole was created that nothing could fill. “Something severed when my brother died,” he says. “I was living but not living. Andy used to lie on the bunk bed and cuddle me – I was his lion cub. He had proper respect in Ilford. I was a scared little boy who didn’t want to die. I cried myself to sleep every night.”</p> \n<p> After Andy’s death, Benn began smoking, hustling on the street, and eventually continuing his brother’s work fighting against the National Front racist skinheads. “The black and white communities would come to together at Ilford Town Hall to listen to soul music and they [the skinheads] would wait for us outside,” says Benn. “I was into Bruce Lee at the time and I remember knocking one skinhead out with a hop, skip and a jump through the air and my leg cracked him.” Benn remembers shouting: “I was born here mate. I’m more English than you are.”</p> \n<p> School was a blur as he roamed the streets until the early hours of the morning. Even though he went wild fighting on the streets, Benn’s staunch father was there for him with some tough love Bajan style. Benn smiles. “I would get in some trouble, my father would hear about it and when I got back home he would bellow in a thick Bajan accent ‘If you can’t hear you can feel’, followed by a clip. He gave it to me but I still respect him today.”</p> \n<p> The value of his father’s discipline became apparent later in life. “I didn’t understand at the time but later he explained it to me. He said by hook or crook, you’re not going to end up like your brother.” Benn’s father insisted he join his older brother in the British Army and he took to “squaddie” life with relish, kicking off his boxing career and surviving some harrowing times in Northern Ireland including losing friends in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droppin_Well_bombing\">Ballykelly bombing</a>. “I was just a brother wanting to do my time and get out,” he says. After almost five years Benn left the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers with an exemplary record, tried security but was lured into professional boxing, skyrocketing to a 22-0 record and building a reputation as an exciting puncher with a growing fanbase.</p> \n<p> It all came crashing down when he was “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope-a-dope\">rope-a-doped</a>” brilliantly by fellow Brit Michael Watson and having punched himself out, was knocked out himself. “I had some friends who disappeared to hang out with Michael,” says Benn, who sat alone in the change room after the fight. “I didn’t want to leave the house and decided to go to America.” The experience was an epiphany and defeat can be instructive. “I’d been lying to myself about how good I was.”</p> \n<p>Boxing was different in America. “It’s the land of truth over there,” says Benn. “Guys off the street can give you a tough spar. Reputations mean nothing.” But the move paid off. He won the world middleweight title against Doug De Witt in New Jersey in 1990. In his first defence he brutalised fearsome Iran “the Blade” Barkley in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-wpk99I3Q8\">famous one round war</a> that made him an international star. When Barkley looked away from him at the weigh-in, Benn knew he had his man.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5522f50d70bb2c0e7046251a3451d0781ae4487\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a5522f50d70bb2c0e7046251a3451d0781ae4487/0_336_3828_2298/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benn v Eubank in November 1990.

It was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7to-Ch5Omaw\">a violent, brutal fight</a>, the British Bulldog versus the American Pitbull, and Benn was bludgeoned near unconscious and out of the ring in the first round before getting himself back into the contest, roared on by a partisan crowd. McClellan eventually retired on one knee in the 10th round, dehydrated, confused and blinking.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a906bbfeb7352bd33c10d02f6461e81ca84ed7c2\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a906bbfeb7352bd33c10d02f6461e81ca84ed7c2/398_140_1131_1490/759.jpg\" alt=\"Benn launches a counter-attack during his 1995 fight with Gerald McClellan in London. \" width=\"759\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benn launches a counter-attack during his 1995 fight with Gerald McClellan in London. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> British fight writer Hugh Mcilvanney described the fight as “relentless, mutually destructive aggression…one of the most brutal fights any of us at ringside had witnessed.” McClellan was rushed to hospital cutting Benn’s celebrations short. He had scored one of the bravest, most dramatic victories in English sporting history – a titanic struggle and the devil took the hindmost. Benn had a damaged nose and jaw, urinated blood for three days and had a shadow on the brain. The fight left McClellan blind, 80% deaf and paralysed in a wheelchair, in the care of his sisters.</p> \n<p>This year marks 20 years since McClellan was paralysed. Eight years ago Benn returned to England to raise $250,000 to assist McClellan’s care. In an emotional reunion, Benn was granted forgiveness by McClellan’s sister, who once told the media “We want Benn dead, we want his money”, and, “How does a man who almost killed a man sleep at night?” To see <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYCFR1KrD6g&amp;t=32m19s\">Benn and McClellan embrace</a> is one of the most moving moments in boxing history with the latter in his wheelchair asking: “Am I handsome?” </p> \n<p>“It’s my greatest moment in the ring but I can’t celebrate it,” says Benn. “I’ve done what I can and I’m grateful it’s been laid to rest. It’s a cross I have to bear but ultimately I’m here to support my family.” Benn was never the same again and his career soon ended. Without the discipline of boxing his life descended into a path well trodden of chaos featuring drugs, cheating, fast women and slow horses. Famously, Benn was once quoted as saying: “I was Satan’s right hand man.” He suffered depression and attempted suicide one lonely night in the car. Rock bottom is a good foundation and Benn found salvation in religion joining a long line of religious boxers including Evander Holyfield and George Foreman.</p> \n<p> In an attempt to expel his demons Benn left his marital home and went to live with his pastor who assigned him to a 63-year-old woman. “She broke me down slowly,” he says with a wince. “She made me deal with my unresolved issues with drugs, sex addiction and the anger at the loss of my brother. No more spliffs, no more cheating, no more swearing. Get this. I was only allowed to watch Little House on the Prairie and loved it. I’ve got all 11 seasons on DVD!”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aa49de6a034d32456106df0255ea17d04ba64141\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/aa49de6a034d32456106df0255ea17d04ba64141/0_0_2953_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A portrait of former World Champion Benn after his workout.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A portrait of former World Champion Benn after his workout.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Abbott for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Benn interrupts the memories, checking his watch. “We’re late for Blacktown PCYC, let’s go,” he says. Blacktown Police Youth Citizens Club is one of the most diverse sports clubs in Australia, a kaleidoscope of cultures blending together daily. Presiding over operations at her front office desk is community veteran club manager Jo Tau, a Samoan Dutch Kiwi who has one eye on her computer and the other keeping track of movement in the centre. She has no doubt of the importance of the PCYC. “More than once community tensions have calmed down when the different groups have met here or know each other from here,” she says. “Most recently we had some tension between the South Sudanese and Pacific Communities and leaders from our club helped return things to normal.”</p> \n<p> Tau remembers how Benn built the relationship with her and her husband, coming over to their house and cooking for the pair. “A world champion, in our little shack!” she says excitedly. “Nigel is a very humble man and has a presence about him that brings people in. I’ve had clients in my office who have nearly dropped to the floor like screaming schoolgirls when they’ve seen him. We’ve got a world champ interacting with our kids and adults, in of all places, Blacktown!” Pointing upstairs to the thudding boxing gym, she says: “His culture up there is all about family. We see the power of boxing here to engage youth. It’s not just something anyone can do and Nigel doesn’t sugarcoat, he gives it to them big time.”</p> \n<p> Benn has also helped out with at-risk youth and Tau is thrilled with the results. She says 30 disengaged kids who stopped going to school were spellbound by Benn’s presence after seeing highlights of his career. “Every time they are quiet, no fidgeting,” she says. “He shares his stories from the heart, then has a big laugh with all of them at the sausage sizzle afterwards. And sure enough some of them go back to school. He’s here to make a difference and he has been changing lives here for more than two years.”</p> \n<p> The upstairs boxing gym is bristling with feverish hustle, the windows foggy and the air larded with the aroma of toil. Around the ring fighters are lined up to do one round on the pads with Benn, whilst some are skipping and others thudding the heavy bags monotonously – the echoes of aspiration. A grandmother in a hijab looks on and smiles as her two grandsons wrestle a big punching bag. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"774cdc52409b22827d38296ff2ff3e32ee61e219\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/774cdc52409b22827d38296ff2ff3e32ee61e219/0_0_2953_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conor Benn (standing, left), son of Nigel Benn, is among those training at Blacktown PCYC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conor Benn (standing, left), son of Nigel Benn, is among those training at Blacktown PCYC.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Abbott for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> Legen Hale arrived in Australia in January 2015, a proud Maori from Hamilton, New Zealand, and overweight at 150 kilograms. By his own admission he had no discipline and focus and came to Australia to turn his life around. Five months after first arriving at Blacktown PCYC, Hale has lost 45 kilograms under the tough love of the Dark Destroyer. “Nigel pushed me to the limit and stood by me on a hard journey. Every day he was on me,” says Hale. “My clothes are loose, I’ve got a great job, my own car, I’m moving faster, concentrating more. At the weekly weigh-in Nigel would look me in the eye and say – ‘You can’t lie to me, you’re just lying to yourself’.” Eventually Hale broke: “Finally I got discipline and accountability and I have a platform,” he says. “I’m now mentoring some youth myself and hope to have my first fight in five months. Crazy stuff.”</p> \n<p> Suddenly the gym lights up as one of the serious fighters does a round of padwork in the ring with Benn. The blows are loud and crisp and the children stop to watch. Gavin Smith has Brazil 2016 Olympic dreams. He has had 18 amateur fights for Blacktown PCYC and is the current ABL junior welterweight champion. “Nigel has been in my corner for at least 10 fights,” says Smith. “We rock up to a small town in the middle of nowhere and I walk in to the ring with his hand on my shoulder. By the time I reach the ring I’m 10 foot tall.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57498285c590bdf31d9bc19df2d2651e147c3617\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/57498285c590bdf31d9bc19df2d2651e147c3617/0_0_2953_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benn training amateur fighter Gavin Smith at the Blacktown PCYC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benn training amateur fighter Gavin Smith at the Blacktown PCYC.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Abbott for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> Some of the fights involve road trips of hundreds of kilometres during which Benn shares his wisdom. “He never talks about my opponent,” says Smith. “He says, ‘Relax, you’ve done the hard work. This is the easy part’. He is so enthusiastic, so passionate and encourages you to give everything. Go home, eat right, stay out of trouble. Discipline and focus. He makes us believe in ourselves.” When Smith won the state title, Benn jumped in the ring and hoisted him up on his shoulders to celebrate. “I’m the NSW champ, I’m sitting on Nigel Benn’s shoulders having just executed his game plan using some tricks he taught me,” says Smith. “It’s unbelievable.”</p> \n<p> As the session draws to a close, Benn is once again caked in sweat. He towels off and says goodbye to each fighter with a hug and shoulder bump and a “God bless you man.” Everyone has left the gym except for the Benn family; Conor is unwrapping his hands after a torrid session and Nigel’s youngest son and two girls are telling stories and laughing. “My new drug is serving people whether its through boxing or in my role for Hillsong as a volunteer assisting people with their marriages or helping those less fortunate,” Benn says. “I’m great friends with an 80-year-old woman whose lawn I cut and do odd jobs for. It’s a required part of the service.”</p> \n<p> Behind every redemption story is a rock. In this case it’s Benn’s wife Carolyne. “I look at women differently now,” he says. “More respectful. And I just love my wife, man.” Despite his past, Benn is optimistic for the future. “Boxing has helped millions around the world as a trigger for self belief, identity and connecting. It is therapy for rage,” he says.</p> \n<p> Religion has helped Benn overcome the sadness and anger of losing his brother. “The man upstairs has filled the hole left by my brother’s death,” he says. <br /> Life seems good. “I won two world titles and filled Old Trafford, owned a Bentley and a mansion, had tea at Buckingham Palace, DJ’d at Ministry of Sound, served proudly in the British Army and here I am cutting the grass of an 80-year-old woman,” he says. </p> \n<p>“And lovin’ it. I look at my life now and I feel blessed, no more drugs or smoking, I’m fittest I’ve ever been. Look at my family. I can’t ask for more.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/532da7aa11eeeb74cc85fe850d6eb5c78390b366/0_85_2953_1776/2953.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1776,"width":2953,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Matthew Abbott for the Guardian","altText":"Former World Champion Nigel Benn in the ring at Blacktown PCYC after a long afternoon of training and teaching.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Matthew Abbott for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/90681ca1314927b66512cbba2b23381322dd8652/0_57_2953_1912/2953.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1912,"width":2953,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Benn working the pads with trainer Rod Williams.

The game will be all the poorer for his absence</p>","byline":"Jonathan Horn","body":"<p>The 13-year-old Ryan Giggs made an instant impression on Sir Alex Ferguson. “He just floated over the ground, like a cocker spaniel chasing a piece of silver paper in the wind,” the momentarily lucid Scot <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2013/may/08/sir-alex-ferguson-best-quotes\">later reflected</a>. My introduction to Chris Judd, though sadly less poetic, was equally vivid. We attended the same school and his reputation preceded him. The ear benders, coat tuggers and clipboard wielders were unanimous – this kid was in a different orbit. And indeed he was, playing out of the goal-square with two, then three and finally four opponents hanging off him. The teenage Judd was the biggest of fish in the smallest of ponds. Conserving energy and avoiding injury seemed to be his priorities. Occasionally, he deigned to get out of second gear. But when the ball hit the ground in his vicinity, the mouthguard flashed and the eyeballs whitened. You heard the authoritative thump of ball on boot and you saw the future. If you were willing to overlook the wallpapered shoulders, everything about him screamed professional footballer.</p> \n<p>Draft prospects rarely come so ready-made. Even the most iridescent talents tend to be half-formed. They’re barrel-chested but chicken-legged. They have all the tricks but eschew hard work. They can read the game but drift in and out of it. They sprout muscles in all the wrong places, cultivating physiques for Schoolies Week, rather than centre-square stoppages. Another member of that side was truer to type. Brendan Goddard looked like a primary schooler – mop-headed, all arms and legs, hurl and burl. He would chastise himself, backchat umpires and blow his top at team-mates. He would chase the ball like it owed him cash. The skills were there. The poise would come later. Some champions – Brereton, Ditterich and Coleman spring to mind – swing into league football on a chandelier. Thirty minutes into his career, Judd resembled a 100-gamer. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/afl-legend-chris-judd-retires\">AFL legend Chris Judd calls time as stellar career ends in injury</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Coaching against him, Mick Malthouse knew he’d seen something special. “They’ve unearthed another one haven’t they?” he said. “Jesus….” Every decade or so, a player emerges who represents a seismic shift in the game. Anthony Koutofides, with his video-game athleticism, was one. Judd immediately typified an era that merged total professionalism with unprecedented media saturation. We knew everything and gleaned nothing. We knew his Tertiary Entrance Rank, his vertical leap and his favourite Sopranos character. We added a Y to his surname. But he never stood revealed. His newspaper columns were suitably left of centre but offered few clues. At night, Rebecca Judd told us whether to take an umbrella to work. Yet her husband remained elusive.</p> \n<p>In his footballing autumn, he was as unknowable as ever. When his coach broached the subject of his retirement last year, there was a curious lack of warmth, perhaps befitting the era, perhaps the coach, perhaps the player. Few footballers were more admired. But we didn’t get mushy about Chris Judd. There were no “We Love Juddy” t-shirts at his retirement press conference. Perhaps he was too perfect, too aloof. He’s never seemed sufficiently enamoured with being a footballer, a treasonable offence in these parts. There was an urgency to removing the halo, to shrivelling him to mortal proportions. There had to be a Cousins or a Carey lurking in there, surely. Whether <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxmMRmEIEeg\">chicken winging</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSd3YUxdp-U\">allegedly eye gouging</a> he found himself an unlikely figure of opprobrium. To his eternal credit, he looked like he couldn’t give seven stuffs what we thought of him. </p> \n<p>He remains a strangely hard sell. If you took a footy neophyte from say, Antwerp, and sought to explain the appeal of the modern generation of superstars, the careers of Franklin, Ablett and Goodes would be easy to summarise. Judd is trickier. It’s a career of two distinct yet equally fruitful halves – pre and post groin injury; with hair and without; east and west of the Nullarbor. For a player of sustained excellence, he is perhaps best explained in terms of short bursts. When it came to imposing himself on a game – a half here, 10 minutes of monstering there – few midfielders in football history can touch him. You think of his five first-half goals at the Gabba, where shots came out of packs like arrows from a bow, laying waste to some of the most flint-hearted defenders in the game. There’s the opening quarter of the 2005 grand final, the free-for-all with Adam Goodes in the 2006 qualifying final, the third quarter of the 2010 final at the SCG, the second half of the 2013 elimination final against Richmond. He was blessed with that rare ability to play on a slow burn, yet turn up the wick and tilt things his team’s way when the situation demanded it. </p> \n<p>It didn’t look particularly easy in the end. He no longer slalomed past opponents. The crisp, 400-metre runner didn’t make the trip east. He became a heavy haulage player. The grimace was more pronounced. When he won possession, he gripped the ball like he was rescuing it from a fire. Even at rest, he stalked the boundary line, sucking in exaggerated breaths, sipping from a water bottle in each hand, preparing to reload. For a man who was nauseous before big games, he still cut a figure of the utmost self-belief. In many ways, the Carlton theme song provided the perfect musical accompaniment – a slow build, a whiff of arrogance. Indeed, his was always an aristocratic game. It’s impossible to imagine him running around in the lower grades. It would be like Baryshnikov bobbing up at Dracula’s Theatre Restaurant. He’ll never be dragooned into coaching. It would be insulting for him to be crammed into the commentary box. It’s probably for the best. We sometimes expect them to be secular saints, fonts of all wisdom, mountains of magnificence. But ultimately, they are what they do. And few, in our lifetime, did it better than Judd.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e1fd7eb0273acad06f8ce75448b73bc677881ef6/0_84_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graham Denholm/Getty Images","altText":"Chris Judd speaks to the media, announcing his retirement during a Carlton press conference at Ikon Park on 9 June, 2015.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graham Denholm/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-09T21:45:02Z","lastModified":"2015-06-09T23:37:33Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Jonathan Horn","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jonathan-horn"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["AFL","Carlton","Australian rules football","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/afl","webTitle":"AFL"},{"id":"sport/carlton","webTitle":"Carlton"},{"id":"sport/australian-rules-football","webTitle":"Australian rules football"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jonathan Horn","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jonathan-horn"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/10/few-better-than-chris-judd-comment","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49j5h","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jun/10/few-better-than-chris-judd-comment","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jun/10/few-better-than-chris-judd-comment"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e1fd7eb0273acad06f8ce75448b73bc677881ef6/0_84_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chris Judd speaks to the media, announcing his retirement during a Carlton press conference at Ikon Park on 9 June, 2015.

In one amazing finals run, he dragged the Warriors to a four-game sweep of the Washington Bullets, who had the league’s best record that season.</p> \n<p>In the sweep he averaged 29.5 points, 4.0 rebounds and 5.0 assists. The Warriors’ second-leading scorer, Jamaal Wilkes, averaged just 11.5 points a game. That’s how dominant Barry was.</p> \n<p>But perhaps his biggest legacy is the one he left in his sons Jon and Brent, who played in the NBA, and Scooter, who played on Kansas’s 1988 National Championship team with …</p> \n<h2>2) Danny Manning</h2> \n<p>By his last year at Kansas, Manning was already considered the best player in college basketball. But his 1987-88 team was not one of the school’s best. The team finished third in a strong Big Eight with a 9-5 conference record. An 11-loss regular season earned the Jayhawks a sixth-seed in the Midwest Region. After an easy win over 11th seed Xavier in the first round and a hard-fought three-point victory against Murray State in the second, Kansas rolled over Vanderbilt in the Sweet 16 and defeated conference rival Kansas State 71-58 to wind up in the Final Four, played in Kansas City, just a 40-minute drive from campus.</p> \n<p>Manning scored 25 points and had 10 rebounds in beating Duke on the first night of the Final Four, and then delivered 31 points, 18 rebounds and two blocks against Oklahoma <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/05/sports/ncaa-championship-manning-is-magnificent-as-kansas-wins-title.html\">in one of the greatest championship game performances ever.</a>That team is forever known as “Danny and the Miracles,” which is perhaps the best nickname of a one-man team until a player later spawned the name Jordanaires …</p> \n<h2>3) Michael Jordan</h2> \n<p>Six times Jordan’s Bulls won NBA titles– but his greatest performance was his last. Chicago’s 1997-98 team was not nearly as dominant as even those that had won in prior years. Jordan was 34, Scottie Pippen, was 32 and after two straight championships following Jordan’s return to basketball in 1995, there was a sense this was indeed the end of the Bulls’ run.</p> \n<p>But for one last time, Jordan dominated a finals opponent. This one was Utah, with John Stockton and Karl Malone both in their prime. Jordan scored 33 and 37 points in the first two games. </p> \n<p>Then in game six, Jordan <a href=\"http://www.si.com/nba/point-forward/2013/04/23/phil-jackson-michael-jordan-push-off-bryon-russell\">gently nudged Utah’s Bryon Russell,</a>and dropped the jump shot that finished the Jazz, in a finals run that was the finest until a player who grew up in Chicago went on a tear of his own …</p> \n<h2>4) Dwyane Wade</h2> \n<p>At 24 years old in 2006, Wade was at the peak of his professional career. James and Bosh were still four seasons away from joining him in Miami. The Heat was Wade’s team, and it seemed he did everything on it. But it was in the finals against Dallas that he really took off. From games three to five he scored a total of 121 points and almost single-handedly destroyed the Mavericks.</p> \n<p>He wrapped up the championship scoring 36 in game six with 10 rebounds, five assists and four steals. It solidified his reputation as perhaps the game’s best player at the time and <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=aw-wade110106&amp;soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma\">one of its most likeable superstars.</a></p> \n<p>Lost in Wade’s brilliance was an outstanding Finals run by a Dallas opponent who would come to overwhelm Wade’s Heat five years later …</p> \n<h2>5) Dirk Nowitzki</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d2489ca1c5eda2fde31c2ffc916d435951041ac\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/5d2489ca1c5eda2fde31c2ffc916d435951041ac/0_31_2463_1479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dirk Nowitzki was unstoppable in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dirk Nowitzki was unstoppable in 2011.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Year after year Nowitzki delivered superstar seasons for the Dallas Mavericks while never winning the biggest games. Then in the year of LeBron, Wade and Bosh, that changed. Over a six-game finals he was unstoppable.</p> \n<p>With Miami leading the series 2-1, Nowitzki scored 21, 29 and 21 points in three-straight games to lead Dallas to its elusive championship. He also averaged 9.7 rebounds in the Finals and made 45-of-46 free throws. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/13/dirk-nowitzki-cries-alone-interview_n_875999.html\">Then he wept.</a> Yet it might not have been the best postseason run in 2011.</p> \n<p>That came from …</p> \n<h2>6) Kemba Walker</h2> \n<p>Connecticut’s 2010-11 team was not one of its best. Walker, a junior guard from New York, was the Huskies’ best player. As UConn struggled through the regular season there was a thought it might not even make the NCAA Tournament. At 9-9 in the Big East, the Huskies came into the Big East tournament as a ninth-seed and had to beat DePaul and Georgetown to even hope for an NCAA bid. Then Walker <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyF6amZw82M\">hit a shot at the buzzer</a> to beat Pittsburgh. Two games later, he scored 19 to lead UConn to the tournament title.</p> \n<p>In the NCAAs he had 33 in the second round against Cincinnati and 24 in a Sweet 16 win over San Diego State. He scored 18 in the first game of the Final Four against Kentucky and 16 in the championship winner over Butler.</p> \n<p>A year later he was named the <a href=\"http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2012-12-11/top-75-players-ncaa-tournament-history-lew-alcindor-christian-laettner-top-list\">28th-best NCAA Tournament player ever.</a> </p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433897726312/05935b67-05fd-4922-bfff-8092d92565f0-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"AP","altText":"Michael Jordan shoots against the Jazz in 1998.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: AP"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433898295620/f6136a21-e45f-4ba4-a13a-e87a8d39aa64-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rick Barry: grumpy but brilliant.

There are compelling reasons for both</p>","byline":"Teresa Genaro","body":"<p>Within minutes of his Triple Crown victory Saturday afternoon at Belmont Park, horse racing fans began to ask the inevitable question: will American Pharoah race again?<br /></p> \n<p>It is one of the paradoxes of thoroughbred racing that the very achievements that the sport most trumpets and that fans most want to see – victories in Triple Crown races, and the ultimate triumph, a sweep of them – often lead to the swift retirement of the horse that accomplishes them, because his value is in the breeding shed far exceeds his value on the racetrack.<br /></p> \n<p>Kentucky breeders begin looking for stallion prospects early, and colts that can run a distance on dirt – and thus potentially produce a Kentucky Derby winner – are the industry’s prized competitors. A nice-looking two-year-old that wins his first race impressively might merit a call to the owner, said Dan Rosenberg, the owner of Rosenberg Thoroughbred Consulting and the former president and CEO of Three Chimneys Farm in Versailles Kentucky. Currently the executive director of Thoroughbred Charities of America, Rosenberg was at Three Chimneys for 30 years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/gallery/2015/jun/08/american-pharoah-belmont-park-scenes\">American Pharoah wins,&nbsp;and fans enjoy the day at Belmont Park – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Off that first race, we might not make an offer,” said Rosenberg, “but we’d express interest and start to build the relationship, staying in touch as the horse’s career unfolds.” </p> \n<p>Charlie Boden, stallion manager of Darley America, the breeding operation of Dubai’s Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, said that interest gets serious after a horse wins a significant race.</p> \n<p>“That could be as early as August of their two-year-old year,” said Boden. </p> \n<p>With stallion deals not uncommonly agreed before the Triple Crown races, included in the contract will be “kickers,” accomplishments that will trigger an increase in the contract terms, along with stipulations about who makes the decisions about when the horse will race. </p> \n<p>Also included is what Boden called the “sunset date” for the horse’s racing career, commonly the Breeders’ Cup Classic, held each autumn, or the end of the horse’s three-year-old year. Rosenberg said that in all of his years negotiating contracts, he’d never seen one that stipulated that a horse be retired after winning the Triple Crown, though from a purely financial standpoint, such a move could make sense.</p> \n<p>“It’s a double-edged sword,” he acknowledged, referring to winning the Triple Crown, or even winning one of the Triple Crown races. “I’ve read emails and posts from disappointed racing fans saying, ‘You greedy bastards, you retired the horse and you don’t care about us.’”</p> \n<p>“But do the math,” he continued. “It’s really easy. If American Pharoah stands at $100,000 [per mating] and he’s bred to 150 mares, compare that to what he could win on the racetrack. It’s a no-brainer and you’d be out of your mind to risk him getting hurt and losing all that potential.” </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/07/american-pharoah-the-best-triple-crown-winner-hes-the-most-important-anyway\">American Pharoah the best Triple Crown winner? He's the most important anyway</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Still, he said, he expects American Pharoah to stay in training … for financial reasons, not for sporting ones.</p> \n<p>“If he can beat older horses, this summer or in the Breeders’ Cup Classic,” Rosenberg said, “his value will go up.” </p> \n<p>Boden agreed with Rosenberg’s prognostication, though for different reasons. </p> \n<p>“Purses these days are hefty,” he pointed out. “He’s got $10 million sitting there next March [in the Dubai World Cup]. That’s $6 million to him [if he wins]. The Breeders’ Cup Classic is $5 million. He stands to make another $10 million before the end of March next year.</p> \n<p>“If he’s going to the breeding shed, he could get 100 horses to breed to him at $100,000, but that’s a year down the road, assuming he’s fertile and if he wants to breed, and those are two big ifs. We know that we can run and beat just about every sumbitch that lines up next to him.” </p> \n<p>Boden also noted that American Pharoah’s pedigree might work against him with regard to his stud fee. He is sired by Pioneerof The Nile, from the first crop of foals by a horse that finished second in the 2009 Kentucky Derby.</p> \n<p>“He doesn’t have a really fancy kind of page that makes you drool,” said Boden. “Pioneerof the Nile is an exciting young stallion that’s probably going to stand for $100,000 next year because he got a Triple Crown winner, and it’s hard for the son to stand for more than the father.” </p> \n<p>Setting aside geldings and horses that were injured after the Kentucky Derby, the 10 horses that won the Kentucky Derby from 2000 to 2014 raced an average of 3.5 times after the first Saturday in May, not counting races in which they were attempting to win the Triple Crown. Only four of those 10 went on to race the following year.</p> \n<p>The first Triple Crown winner in 37 years, American Pharoah is in uncharted territory, with no contemporary peers. The last Triple Crown winner, Affirmed in 1978, raced 13 times after his Belmont Stakes, running a full season as a four-year-old; Seattle Slew, the 1977 Triple Crown winner, ran eight times after the Belmont, through November of 1978. Secretariat raced six times after winning the Belmont and was retired at the end of the year. </p> \n<p>“It’s the nature of the game, really,” admitted Rosenberg. “The really good ones have to retire. They have to keep their value.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/95720793b3538b9f7888961c3b2cfb8f0c6a8e26/0_162_5184_3114/5184.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3114,"width":5184,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Seth Wenig/AP","altText":"Bob Baffert and American Pharoah","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Seth Wenig/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-10T08:30:03Z","lastModified":"2015-06-10T08:30:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":10,"contributors":[{"name":"Teresa Genaro","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/teresa-genaro"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["American Pharoah","Horse racing","Sport","Kentucky Derby","Belmont Stakes"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/american-pharoah","webTitle":"American Pharoah"},{"id":"sport/horse-racing","webTitle":"Horse racing"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/kentucky-derby","webTitle":"Kentucky Derby"},{"id":"sport/belmont-stakes","webTitle":"Belmont Stakes"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Teresa Genaro","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/teresa-genaro"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/10/uncharted-territory-whats-next-for-american-pharoah-after-triple-crown","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49jft","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/10/uncharted-territory-whats-next-for-american-pharoah-after-triple-crown","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/10/uncharted-territory-whats-next-for-american-pharoah-after-triple-crown"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/95720793b3538b9f7888961c3b2cfb8f0c6a8e26/0_162_5184_3114/5184.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3114,"width":5184,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Trainer Bob Baffert shows off Triple Crown winner American Pharoah.

Some are giant strides (overarm bowling, six-ball overs, the advent of Twenty20, and the like) while others are small steps – lbw-rule tinkering, advances in bat technology, pinch-hitting – but cumulatively no less significant.</p> \n<p>The latest nudge along the evolutionary road came on Friday evening at the County Ground during Worcestershire’s T20 Blast fixture against Northamptonshire. Northants were 145-2 chasing 212 for victory, with 67 runs required from 30 balls, well over 13 an over. As Moeen Ali prepared to start the 16th over, Pears wicketkeeper Ben Cox ditched the gloves and pads and positioned himself on the edge of the circle, more or less <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ciaranthomas91/status/606913389902888960\">on the angle of second slip</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ciaranthomas91/statuses/606913389902888960\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Worcestershire are currently fielding without a keeper off Ali.

It seems that Steve Rhodes, a former wicketkeeper himself and now Worcestershire’s director of cricket, came up with the idea after watching MS Dhoni stand back to India’s spinners. “In a game when you’re trying to stop the opposition scoring, it’s a legitimate tactic,” he said afterwards.</p> \n<p>The batsman first faced with the prospect was not quite as enthusiastic. “I saw Daryl Mitchell [the Worcestershire captain] tell Ben Cox to go back and I thought he was going to keep from the edge of the ring,” Northants’ Josh Cobb said. “Then I turned around and saw him without pads or gloves on. It’s in the Laws and they’ve obviously looked into it and there’s no Law against it. You’ve just got to question whether it’s in the spirit of the game. But that’s probably because it’s never been done before. When they first come out, these things usually get questioned and left alone.”</p> \n<p>The idea of playing without a wicketkeeper isn’t a new one and in a way goes all the way back to the early 1800s when a longstop was routinely employed directly behind the keeper to prevent boundaries (the keeper at that stage being more concerned with stumpings and run-outs than actually stopping the ball – a longstop would generally wear more protective clothing as mobility on the boundary wasn’t deemed as important as it was behind the stumps).</p> \n<p>But there have been a few more recent precursors. In a John Player League game at Lord’s in 1972 Warwickshire captain MJK Smith posted his wicketkeeper to the boundary for the final ball of a limited-overs game against Middlesex, who needed three runs to win. In 1979 England played a day-night game in Sydney against the West Indies, who ended up, like Middlesex, needing three to win off the final ball. So Mike Brearley, who had been in the Middlesex side denied by Smith’s ingenuity seven years earlier, sent wicketkeeper David Bairstow to field as longstop.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/08/england-new-zealand-odi-eoin-morgan\">Eoin Morgan and new-look England face tough questions from New Zealand</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bairstow was on the receiving end of a few beer cans, Brearley on the receiving end of some Aussie abuse, but Colin Croft was on the receiving end of a fine Ian Botham delivery and England won by two runs. Brearley, in Art of Captaincy, describes the plan as the “perfectly logical conclusion” of “how maladaptive attacking fields are in one-day cricket”. </p> \n<p>In 1988 the ploy was used in a slightly different fashion by the Reverend Andrew Wingfield Digby, captain of Dorset, in a story retold in Andrew Ward’s Cricket’s Strangest Matches. With 11 overs of their two-day Minor Counties match against Cheshire remaining, the game seemed to be dwindling to a draw. Cheshire were 92 for six but in the middle of a solid 43-run seventh-wicket partnership. The batsmen, Neil Smith and Geoff Blackburn, seemed dug in for the duration but there was no suggestion of them chasing the 201 needed for victory.</p> \n<p>So Wingfield Digby dismissed his wicketkeeper from his post and ordered Graeme Calway to bowl wides. And that Calway did, 14 of them in all, and all running down to the boundary. In all it meant 60 runs from the over (Calway having already been struck for one boundary off the bat) and left Cheshire with a far more palatable 53 to chase in 10 overs. The batting team, thus tempted, were bowled out and Dorset won by 18 runs with 12 balls to spare.</p> \n<p>Worcestershire’s strategy last week was something different again. Did it work? Well enough – only one bye was conceded in the remainder of the innings and Worcestershire ended up winning by 14 runs. And it’s an idea that has a sound logic behind it: in a situation where runs are more important than wickets the switch essentially trades a catcher for a run-saver. Though whether the idea will catch on remains to be seen – don’t expect to see Jos Buttler fielding at fly slip at any point at Edgbaston on Tuesday.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://id.theguardian.com/email/list\"><strong><em>This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

The game will be all the poorer for his absence</p>","byline":"Jonathan Horn","body":"<p>The 13-year-old Ryan Giggs made an instant impression on Sir Alex Ferguson. “He just floated over the ground, like a cocker spaniel chasing a piece of silver paper in the wind,” the momentarily lucid Scot <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2013/may/08/sir-alex-ferguson-best-quotes\">later reflected</a>. My introduction to Chris Judd, though sadly less poetic, was equally vivid. We attended the same school and his reputation preceded him. The ear benders, coat tuggers and clipboard wielders were unanimous – this kid was in a different orbit. And indeed he was, playing out of the goal-square with two, then three and finally four opponents hanging off him. The teenage Judd was the biggest of fish in the smallest of ponds. Conserving energy and avoiding injury seemed to be his priorities. Occasionally, he deigned to get out of second gear. But when the ball hit the ground in his vicinity, the mouthguard flashed and the eyeballs whitened. You heard the authoritative thump of ball on boot and you saw the future. If you were willing to overlook the wallpapered shoulders, everything about him screamed professional footballer.</p> \n<p>Draft prospects rarely come so ready-made. Even the most iridescent talents tend to be half-formed. They’re barrel-chested but chicken-legged. They have all the tricks but eschew hard work. They can read the game but drift in and out of it. They sprout muscles in all the wrong places, cultivating physiques for Schoolies Week, rather than centre-square stoppages. Another member of that side was truer to type. Brendan Goddard looked like a primary schooler – mop-headed, all arms and legs, hurl and burl. He would chastise himself, backchat umpires and blow his top at team-mates. He would chase the ball like it owed him cash. The skills were there. The poise would come later. Some champions – Brereton, Ditterich and Coleman spring to mind – swing into league football on a chandelier. Thirty minutes into his career, Judd resembled a 100-gamer. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/afl-legend-chris-judd-retires\">AFL legend Chris Judd calls time as stellar career ends in injury</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Coaching against him, Mick Malthouse knew he’d seen something special. “They’ve unearthed another one haven’t they?” he said. “Jesus….” Every decade or so, a player emerges who represents a seismic shift in the game. Anthony Koutofides, with his video-game athleticism, was one. Judd immediately typified an era that merged total professionalism with unprecedented media saturation. We knew everything and gleaned nothing. We knew his Tertiary Entrance Rank, his vertical leap and his favourite Sopranos character. We added a Y to his surname. But he never stood revealed. His newspaper columns were suitably left of centre but offered few clues. At night, Rebecca Judd told us whether to take an umbrella to work. Yet her husband remained elusive.</p> \n<p>In his footballing autumn, he was as unknowable as ever. When his coach broached the subject of his retirement last year, there was a curious lack of warmth, perhaps befitting the era, perhaps the coach, perhaps the player. Few footballers were more admired. But we didn’t get mushy about Chris Judd. There were no “We Love Juddy” t-shirts at his retirement press conference. Perhaps he was too perfect, too aloof. He’s never seemed sufficiently enamoured with being a footballer, a treasonable offence in these parts. There was an urgency to removing the halo, to shrivelling him to mortal proportions. There had to be a Cousins or a Carey lurking in there, surely. Whether <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxmMRmEIEeg\">chicken winging</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSd3YUxdp-U\">allegedly eye gouging</a> he found himself an unlikely figure of opprobrium. To his eternal credit, he looked like he couldn’t give seven stuffs what we thought of him. </p> \n<p>He remains a strangely hard sell. If you took a footy neophyte from say, Antwerp, and sought to explain the appeal of the modern generation of superstars, the careers of Franklin, Ablett and Goodes would be easy to summarise. Judd is trickier. It’s a career of two distinct yet equally fruitful halves – pre and post groin injury; with hair and without; east and west of the Nullarbor. For a player of sustained excellence, he is perhaps best explained in terms of short bursts. When it came to imposing himself on a game – a half here, 10 minutes of monstering there – few midfielders in football history can touch him. You think of his five first-half goals at the Gabba, where shots came out of packs like arrows from a bow, laying waste to some of the most flint-hearted defenders in the game. There’s the opening quarter of the 2005 grand final, the free-for-all with Adam Goodes in the 2006 qualifying final, the third quarter of the 2010 final at the SCG, the second half of the 2013 elimination final against Richmond. He was blessed with that rare ability to play on a slow burn, yet turn up the wick and tilt things his team’s way when the situation demanded it. </p> \n<p>It didn’t look particularly easy in the end. He no longer slalomed past opponents. The crisp, 400-metre runner didn’t make the trip east. He became a heavy haulage player. The grimace was more pronounced. When he won possession, he gripped the ball like he was rescuing it from a fire. Even at rest, he stalked the boundary line, sucking in exaggerated breaths, sipping from a water bottle in each hand, preparing to reload. For a man who was nauseous before big games, he still cut a figure of the utmost self-belief. In many ways, the Carlton theme song provided the perfect musical accompaniment – a slow build, a whiff of arrogance. Indeed, his was always an aristocratic game. It’s impossible to imagine him running around in the lower grades. It would be like Baryshnikov bobbing up at Dracula’s Theatre Restaurant. He’ll never be dragooned into coaching. It would be insulting for him to be crammed into the commentary box. It’s probably for the best. We sometimes expect them to be secular saints, fonts of all wisdom, mountains of magnificence. But ultimately, they are what they do. And few, in our lifetime, did it better than Judd.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e1fd7eb0273acad06f8ce75448b73bc677881ef6/0_84_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graham Denholm/Getty Images","altText":"Chris Judd speaks to the media, announcing his retirement during a Carlton press conference at Ikon Park on 9 June, 2015.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graham Denholm/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-09T21:45:02Z","lastModified":"2015-06-09T23:37:33Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":27,"contributors":[{"name":"Jonathan Horn","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jonathan-horn"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["AFL","Carlton","Australian rules football","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/afl","webTitle":"AFL"},{"id":"sport/carlton","webTitle":"Carlton"},{"id":"sport/australian-rules-football","webTitle":"Australian rules football"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jonathan Horn","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jonathan-horn"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/10/few-better-than-chris-judd-comment","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49j5h","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jun/10/few-better-than-chris-judd-comment","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jun/10/few-better-than-chris-judd-comment"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e1fd7eb0273acad06f8ce75448b73bc677881ef6/0_84_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chris Judd speaks to the media, announcing his retirement during a Carlton press conference at Ikon Park on 9 June, 2015.

Doctors attended to an old injury, one that had made him walk a little funny for years, putting all his weight on one foot as he made every other step. The injury dated back to the most glorious episode of his playing days but it also effectively ended his career.</p> \n<p>Just two weeks before the 1998 World Cup, Bilic’s hip was partially fractured. Against all medical advice, despite not being able to train at all because of the pain, he decided to travel to France with the Croatia team and played the whole tournament with painkillers, further aggravating the injury. Most people will have remembered him for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/1999/feb/06/newsstory.sport4\" title=\"\">getting Laurent Blanc sent off in the semi-finals</a> (“I panicked. I was paranoid that I would get a yellow card which would prevent me from playing in the final if we got there, so I theatrically went down to save myself from getting booked – although he did hit me,” he told FourFourTwo Croatia in 2011) but this was Bilic sacrificing his health and career for his country.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/west-ham-slaven-bilic-new-manager\">West Ham appoint Slaven Bilic as their new manager to replace Sam Allardyce</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Croatia spectacularly finished third in their first World Cup appearance but the consequences for Bilic were serious: at 30, he was done. Unable to fully recover, he played a handful of games for Everton the next season and was released in July 1999 – but not before picking up a hefty pay-off for the two years he had left on his contract.</p> \n<p>Before Everton, Bilic was a keen leader in the West Ham defence, where he is remembered very fondly despite spending only one-and-a-half seasons with the club. Somehow he always seemed destined to take over as manager there one day, ever since his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2012/jun/06/croatia-slaven-bilic-interview-euro-2012\" title=\"\">coaching career took off with Croatia</a>, whom he took to the 2008 and 2012 Euros (but failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup). Bilic, who describes himself as an anglophile, has never hidden his affection for West Ham or his desire to return there. “I would love to work in England,” he <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2012/jun/06/croatia-slaven-bilic-interview-euro-2012\" title=\"\">told the Guardian in 2012</a>. “Because of the language and the unique football culture, which is different to anywhere else.”</p> \n<p>A qualified lawyer who is fluent in English, German and Italian and a tattooed, earring-sporting guitar player who had some success in his homeland with the alternative rock outfits Newera and Rawbau, Bilic is very easy to like. He is intelligent, eloquent and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2012/jun/17/euro-2012-slaven-bilic-croatia-racist\" title=\"\">says meaningful things in his public appearances</a>.</p> \n<p>Some people will also say he tries hard to win the affection of fans and the media. Taking over at Lokomotiv Moscow in 2012, he spoke Russian – well, attempted to – on his unveiling; at Besiktas he wore an Ottoman-style beard and readily accepted being portrayed as a football manager version of a great conqueror, especially after beating Tottenham and Liverpool in the Europa League. Domestically, Bilic, competed well with Besiktas’s far richer rivals, Fenerbahce and Galatasaray, but he failed to win a game against either in two years. Although polls showed a majority of supporters wanted him to stay, the club decided against it. When he was leaving Istanbul, fans waited for him at the airport, carried him on their shoulders and presented the now clean-shaven Bilic with a T-shirt that said, in Croatian, no less: “Farewell, grand commander.”</p> \n<p>But is he good enough for the Premier League as a manager? That has been a matter of much debate in his homeland and elsewhere. There are those who think Bilic is an average coach who is very good at selling his image and that his teams are prone to crumbling when the going gets tough. He has overseen some brilliant wins in his career, including <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2007/nov/21/minutebyminute.sport\" title=\"\">two against England with Croatia</a>, but he also had some major failures – such as twice <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2009/sep/09/world-cup-qualifier-england-croatia\" title=\"\">losing heavily to Fabio Capello’s England</a> in the next qualifying campaign and not reaching the 2010 World Cup. His tenure in Moscow was largely unsuccessful. Besiktas fans do not have too much to show for his time there, except the really good impression he left.</p> \n<p>His ideas are hard to pinpoint – while he does favour attacking football and either a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-4-2 formation, the manager himself thinks that classical formations are “dying out”. “Fluidity is much more important – you want your team to stay compact, and your lines to remain close to one another, so they can flow over,” he has said.</p> \n<p>And as for his influences, he lists Ars&egrave;ne Wenger and Marcello Lippi, both of whom he stayed with at the beginning of his coaching career, studying their methods and approach. “You don’t have to be a tyrant to earn the respect of your players,” Bilic said in that Guardian interview. “The only authority you need is the authority of knowledge.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, the new West Ham manager will feel comfortable discussing everything from tabloid culture to tactical theory with the media, and the players will love him for his friendly mentality and support. But the jury is still out when it comes to Bilic’s true managerial quality. Upton Park will be the place where he seeks final confirmation that that he is more than a “rock star manager”. If he is still around when the Hammers move to the Olympic Stadium this time next year, you will know he has found it.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433863635053/Slaven-Bilic--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Slaven Bilic readily accepted being portrayed as a football manager version of a great conqueror at Besiktas and was loved by the fans but there was little in the way of success.
