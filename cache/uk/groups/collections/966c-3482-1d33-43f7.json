Sometimes it was unbearably tense yet it remained impossible to take the eyes from the action that was being played out on terrestrial TV.</p> \n<p>Kids raced from their screens as Richie Benaud bid Channel 4 viewers farewell to the nearest patch of grass or their local cricket club to try to bowl like Freddie Flintoff or Shane Warne or to bat like Kevin Pietersen or Ricky Ponting. Among those transfixed was the 14-year-old Jos Buttler, who remembers the thrill. “I think back to when I was a kid and inspired by the 2005 Ashes,” he says. “It inspired everyone to pick up a bat and play the game and pretend to be Marcus Trescothick in the back garden.</p> \n<p>“That 2005 series was amazing, probably the best ever and even now everyone can remember it like yesterday. As players you want to be people who inspire the younger generation or the public to watch the game and play it themselves. That is part of our job: to inspire people and make it fun.”</p> \n<p>It is too much to expect that the 2015 series will touch those heights. Even if this were to happen the action would not be available to the majority of the country. Sky Sports have held the rights since 2006. We can debate at length the drop in participation and whether the England and Wales Cricket Board’s decision to abandon terrestrial TV has much to do with that. Do the extra millions compensate for the inaccessibility of cricket? But the toothpaste will not return to the tube.</p> \n<p>The terrestrial channels are no longer interested in Test cricket. It was brilliant in 2005, but it is an unwieldy product, unpredictable in its timings and tough to schedule. And expensive. For the majority – and the casual supporter – the cricket continues to come second hand.</p> \n<p>Both sides may try to draw on the 2005 experience – even the Aussies acknowledge it was one of the greatest series ever – and both have one survivor as a first-hand witness. Ian Bell and Michael Clarke were relatively peripheral characters in the great contest of 10 years ago but they were there.</p> \n<p>The Australians might be more watchful of stray balls on the outfield and be a tad more flexible at the toss – with Glenn McGrath suddenly out of the fray how did they continue with their determination to bowl at Edgbaston? England will seek to recapture that spirit of adventure, which meant that they refused to be cowed by a side universally regarded as superior – with Ponting, McGrath, Warne, Adam Gilchrist and the rest near their peak. As in 2005 England start as the underdogs and underdogs have to snap away relentlessly at their foe.</p> \n<p>That Edgbaston Test began with England hitting a wonderful, preposterous 407 from 79 overs on the first day and it ended with the <em>Observer</em>’s estimable football correspondent, Paul Wilson, writing: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2005/aug/14/newsstory.sport\" title=\"\">“Might as well admit it now … that nothing in the next nine months of overhyped, overpaid bladder-chasing is likely to be as gripping, as heroic or as memorable as the denouement of the Edgbaston Test match.”</a></p> \n<p>Just a pale imitation of 10 years ago would keep everyone happy this time.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436012994559/Andrew-Flintoff-of-Englan-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Can Andrew Flintoff's exploits for England in the Ashes victory over Australia in 2005 be replicated this summer?

The student recommended Steve to help a cyclist with a mental health issue and he turned him round remarkably quickly.</p> \n<p>I was immediately impressed by Steve’s approach. He’s very strict, not fluffy; he challenges you strongly, tells it like it is. I had to work very hard to persuade him to come out of NHS practice and university, but he did.</p> \n<p>He has this knack of making people respond positively. He is fair and pragmatic, and by helping you look in the mirror he provides insight into people’s psychology, helping them optimise their behaviour and performance.</p> \n<p>I was in my late 30s then, and bullish. Steve made me stop in my tracks and analyse my own behaviour. Even though we’re very different people, his ideas chimed with me. His notion of empowerment and ownership balanced with accountability, responsibility, commitment, hunger and conflict resolution struck a strong chord, and the neutral sounding board he provided was fundamental in the success we have enjoyed.</p> \n<p>Steve’s a kind, warm person. He’s witty and good company and he has this neutrality that means he’s brilliant to disagree with because he doesn’t get annoyed. So you’re free to put all your cards on the table and look at things from a different angle. When we’re approaching a big event like the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/tourdefrance\">Tour de France,</a> the dynamic intensifies. I’ll lead, but we’ll collectively ponder: “Is the mood right? Is the culture right? Is the mindset right? Are there any unresolved issues?” then it’s into battle and executing the ideas.</p> \n<p>Steve has been a great educator in my career and my life. We’ve been through several Olympic Games, some big moments. We’ve learned together and he’s just as open to learning as I am. That’s been the fun part of it. </p> \n<p><em>Follow Team Sky on Twitter at the Tour de France, 4-26 July, </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/teamsky\"><em>@TeamSky</em></a></p> \n<h2>HIS STORY <em>Professor Steve Peters, 62, consultant psychiatrist</em></h2> \n<p>Since I came on board with Dave our relationship has built up gradually and the thing we’ve shared – in addition to getting the best out of elite athletes including Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton and Bradley Wiggins – is that we’re both mavericks in the sense of thinking outside the box and being willing to take risks.</p> \n<p>Dave is the type of person who, when he comes to a river, doesn’t dip his toe in and measure the temperature. He makes a calculated risk, jumps, and if it is deep he just starts swimming. I told him early on that he needed to surround himself with like-minded people because that would bring out the best in him, whereas if he surrounded himself with people who keep measuring the temperature of the water and dipping their toes in he was going to get frustrated.</p> \n<p>When we have brainstorming sessions approaching an event, like the Tour De France, the focus and fine-tuning ramp up significantly. Dave will always ask: “Am I missing something?” I like to optimise performance and to know that whoever I’m working with will get the best out of themselves. Dave has a similar outlook.</p> \n<p>Dave’s insightful, driven and intolerant of second best. He just won’t accept it and he gets frustrated with complacency, which I do too. If that happens he’ll step on whatever the difficulty is to put it right; he won’t sit back on his laurels. Dave is constantly searching for what he calls “marginal gains” – the small percentages that add up to a big difference. Coupled with his energy and organisation, this is what gives him that X factor.</p> \n<p>Outside the velodrome we are different people socially. Dave enjoys keeping fit and he leads a more solitary life whereas I’m a people person who has lots of friends around. Dave is more of an individual. His accolades and achievements haven’t changed his character. That shared desire to optimise potential still unites us.</p> \n<p><em>Steve Peters’s </em>The Chimp Paradox <em>is published by Vermilion.

As with his batting over the past 18 months, he appeared to have timed it perfectly.</p> \n<p>Yet the joke was on Root that day. The agreement among those players and support staff during that enchanting evening session in St John’s Wood was to perform the salute in unison should the all-rounder reach three figures, before a last-minute switcheroo left the young Yorkshireman flying solo. One of the team’s arch-pranksters had, on this occasion, become the pranked.</p> \n<p>It was a scene that embodied the reboot that has occurred for the England team as they head into this much-anticipated Ashes series. Whatever result – bar a harrowing one – emerges from the five Tests with Australia, this season will go down as one in which the senior men’s side reconnected with the public at large, with frowns turned upside down through cavalier cricket and a tangible sense that those participating are similarly enjoying the ride.</p> \n<p>On the field, Root has been unquestionably central to the unburdened approach that was fostered under caretaker Paul Farbrace as the team awaited the arrival of the new head coach, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/01/trevor-bayliss-england-australia-coach\" title=\"\">Trevor Bayliss</a>. While New Zealand and their buccaneering captain, Brendon McCullum, took a share of the credit for teasing attacking, joyful play, it must be couched with the reminder that, before the tourists had picked up a bat in all three formats, England had already been shown the way by the 24-year-old.</p> \n<p>In the opening exchanges of that first Test victory at Lord’s, Root’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/21/england-new-zealand-first-test-match-report\" title=\"\">counterattacking 98</a> alongside 92 from Stokes turned an ominous 30 for four into a sizeable first-innings total. In the first one-dayer at Edgbaston, a 71-ball century from No3, after arriving at the crease to face the second ball of the day, led the way towards England’s first ascent beyond the 400-run barrier; and in the one-off Twenty20 at Old Trafford he <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/23/england-new-zealand-twenty20-international-cricket\" title=\"\">top-scored with 68</a> from 46 balls.</p> \n<p>This is a batsman who has risen from England’s 5-0 whitewash in Australia 18 months ago, having been dropped for the fifth Test. The home series the summer before had been eventful, with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jun/12/cricket-australia-david-warner-incident\" title=\"\">David Warner’s nightclub right hook</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/20/joe-root-england-australia-ashes\" title=\"\">a maiden Ashes century at Lord’s</a> the standout moments. But by the fourth Test in Melbourne in the winter, despite smiling in the face of Michael Clarke’s hostile pace attack, he had been reduced to mere survival mode.</p> \n<p>“Joe called me from Sydney and told me the news,” says his father, Matt Root, who first gave him a cricket bat when he was one day old and has nurtured his enthusiasm for the sport thereafter. “He was gutted to miss that final Ashes Test but not too down on himself. He vowed then that if he came back, he would make it much harder to drop him again.”</p> \n<p>Newly installed as Test vice-captain this summer – further confirmation, if needed, that the top job remains his destiny – Root has made good on that promise with his 2,928 international runs since exclusion only bettered by New Zealand’s Kane Williamson (3,440) and Sri Lanka’s Kumar Sangakkara (3,950). This has been his golden period at No5, albeit one that is set to intensify when hostilities resume in Cardiff on Wednesday. In nine Tests against Australia he averages 33, half that when playing against the rest of the world.</p> \n<p>Root’s original entry into cricket is well documented. He and younger brother Billy, himself a batsman and in line to make his championship debut on Sunday when Nottinghamshire host Middlesex, were absorbed into club life by their father at Sheffield Collegiate. Aged seven and five, they were drawing elders from the pavilion to watch them in the nets. At 12, after years of enthusiasm as a substitute fielder, Joe was deemed ready to play for the fourth team, from where he has moved through the ranks of Yorkshire and England.</p> \n<p>What is less well known are the lengths he went to sharpen his eye. “When Joe was 13 I caught him in the garage taking a saw to his bat – he wanted to take the edges off to practise solely with the middle,” says Root Snr. “I don’t know where he got the idea but I agreed to do it for him. I remember we were at Doncaster and he was using this inch-and-a-half-wide bat in nets before the game. People had their mouths open as he struck our bowlers cleanly.”</p> \n<p>His sense of fun? “Oh, he has always had that. It comes from wanting to be involved in the game all the time. Plus, you have to remember this England team have known each other for a long time. Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes are all old age-group team-mates, plus there are the other Yorkshire lads in the squad. They all genuinely enjoy each other’s company and in any job you operate better if you’re having a good time.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436019972363/Joe-Root-of-England-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Joe Root is a symbol of the new attacking brand of cricket England hope to take into the Ashes series against Australia.

After a brief summer fling over 10 years in the making, the bicycle-mad city of Utrecht will bid a tearful farewell to the Tour as the peloton heads off on a week’s worth of potentially fiendish stages through the Netherlands, Belgium and north-west France.</p> \n<p>Although far from barbarous, these assorted <em>parcours</em> ought to offer up a mouth-watering array of technical challenges and have every chance of creating potentially race-ending dilemmas for assorted general classification contenders as they struggle to cope with coastal crosswinds, the teeth-rattling perils of riding at high speed across dastardly French cobbles and one particularly brutal church-lined climb. BMC will be confident of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/tour-de-france-2015-stage-one-rohan-dennis-yellow-jersey\" title=\"\">nursing Rohan Dennis through these obstacles in yellow</a> and, with their weighty war chest, almost certainly have the personnel to do so.</p> \n<p>Having been zipped into the <em>maillot jaune </em>after Saturday’s individual time trial, Dennis will have the honour of leading the peloton out of Utrecht as the riders make their way to Zeeland, an old western Dutch province from which a newer but better-known southern hemisphere nation takes its name. With large tracts of the area submerged below sea level, the cyclists will make their way along the coast on a journey that could be considerably enlivened by the intervention of North Sea crosswinds.</p> \n<p>Should the air currents of the day rise to the occasion – and plenty of the riders will hope they do not – there’s every chance of chaos as the peloton is quite literally blown apart and splits into echelons, those groups of riders stretched diagonally across the road as each takes short pulls on the front before rotating and sheltering from the wind.</p> \n<p>With road-width limited, the last place any competitor will wish to find himself is in that long line of forlorn riders snaked out in single file behind the main group, hanging on for grim death just to stay in touch with the wheel in front. A particular skill at which lanky Dutch and Belgian rouleurs are particularly adroit, echelon riding provides much potential for inter-team chicanery and skulduggery as riders collude to “put it in the gutter” and deposit assorted rivals out the back and out of contention. Both here and in Thursday’s stage six along the similar terrain of the Normandy coastline from Abbeville to Le Havre, much will depend on the weather.</p> \n<p>At the mercy of the gods, the riders are unlikely to appreciate one of the better ones apparently riffing on their considerable pain as they pass the seven chapels that line the winding, upwards route to Monday’s stage three finish at Mur de Huy, a punishing climb with an average gradient of 9.3% – rising to 26% on one particular bend – which traditionally serves as the finish of the Fl&egrave;che Wallonne Classic, won in April this year by Movistar’s Alejandro Valverde.</p> \n<p>Then it’s on to the <em>pav&eacute;</em>, a hellish surface that ought to provide no end of entertainment on Tuesday, as the peloton clatters across seven sectors of these attritional, energy-sapping cobbles en route from Seraing to Cambrai. In a deliberate nod to another famous old Classic, four of them feature in Paris-Roubaix, where each stone is almost certainly a mini-memorial to tyres blown, flesh grazed and dreams dashed.</p> \n<p>On a wet day, the greasy surface can send even the most seasoned riders slithering towards the crowd-lined verge. When it’s dry, riders enjoy the comparative luxury of choking dust and the suffocating heat generated by the throngs of enthusiasts lining a narrow, broken and uneven route more accustomed to serving tractors towing farm machinery.</p> \n<p>It was on just such a stage last year that the eventual winner, Vincenzo Nibali, took nearly three minutes out of Alberto Contador, while Chris Froome did not even make it to the first sector. Of the four big race favourites, the Colombian Nairo Quintana is expected to fare worst on the cobbles, having “recced” but never raced on them. Carnage seems inevitable as up to 198 riders attempt to position themselves in something approaching safety at the head of the field. Only a small fraction of them will fit there.</p> \n<p>And so to the sprinters. With Mark Cavendish entering the race in such brilliant form, it’s a genuine disappointment he will not go wheel-to-wheel against his German rival Marcel Kittel in this year’s Tour following his season of illness and injury.</p> \n<p>Flat and long, Wednesday’s spin from Arras Communaut&eacute; Urbaine to Amiens M&eacute;tropole, followed by Livarot to Foug&egrave;res on Friday, look nailed on to be fought out by the fast men. In a Tour that Froome and other GC hopefuls believe doesn’t really start in earnest until stage 10’s jaunt up the mountains, the perilous week ahead will provide no shortage of opportunities for each of them to ruin their chances before they get within a goat’s bleat of a Pyrenean foothill.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436030641074/Vincenzo-Nibali-built-a-u-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Vincenzo Nibali built a useful advantage over the cobbles on his way to winning last year's Tour de France.

The Australia No3, once the butt of English jokes, heads into Wednesday’s first Test sitting at the top of the world rankings and the most talked about batsman on either side.</p> \n<p>“My game’s developed a lot over the last couple of years,” he says, in his softly spoken manner. “That’s happened through a lot of hard work. I’m very hard on myself. The rankings don’t bother me too much as long as I’m scoring runs and we’re winning games.”</p> \n<p>Developed is something of an understatement with the right-hander having enjoyed an almost rocket-fuelled ascent into the batting stratosphere in the past 18 months. Originally plonked down at No8 as a leg-spinning all-rounder on his Test debut against Pakistan at Lord’s in 2010, Smith will walk out to bat in Cardiff after Australia’s first opener is removed as the man who must not be allowed to bed in.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/joe-root-england-ashes-australia\">Joe Root’s sense of fun matched by his poise and passion for the England cause</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Smith is the most deceptive of players. His looks, even at 26, remain that of a schoolboy, his second middle name, Devereux, attracts sniggers on social media and the reason given for his selection during the 2010-11 Ashes – his captain, Ricky Ponting, hoped he could lighten the mood of a downbeat dressing room – has been eternally referenced. The joke is now on world cricket, with 1,617 runs in his last 23 innings at an average of 89.83 kickstarting a fresh search for any weaknesses.</p> \n<p>Can his homespun technique, one that remains fidgety at the crease despite the removal of bat tap in his trigger movement, stand up to the rigours of the swinging Dukes ball on English pitches? This is the question that has been posed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/27/englands-stuart-broad-puts-up-his-dukes-as-he-relishes-villainous-role\" title=\"\">by Stuart Broad</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/graeme-swann-england-no1-steve-smith-ashes-australia-icc-test-rankings\" title=\"\">the now-retired Graeme Swann</a> and one which, for the sake of series-publicising opprobrium, has been read as rhetorical, with the implication being that England, despite serving the ball up for three of his nine Test centuries, do not rate him.</p> \n<p>“It’s obviously pre-Ashes. Guys come out and say a lot of things,” says Smith, remaining as cool as during his last Test outing when he scored 253 runs in two innings in Jamaica, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/12/australia-west-indies-second-test-steve-smith\" title=\"\">199 of which came in the first innings</a>. “I’m just going to go out there and try to do what I’ve been doing over the last 12-18 months, and that is scoring runs, keep letting my bat doing the talking.”</p> \n<p>While his bat has had plenty to say for itself since his maiden Test century at the Kia Oval in 2013, Smith, it must be said, has chirped up in recent times too. “After beating them so convincingly in Australia it’s going to be nice to go into their backyard,” he said back in April. “If we continue to play the same way we’ve played over the last 12-18 months, I don’t think they’ll come close to us.”</p> \n<p>Now, he rows back somewhat. “I might have got my words a little bit wrong there,” he says. “England are very tough in these conditions. We haven’t won here in 14 years. It’s going to be a tough series, they play very well in their own backyard and we’re going to have to be at our best if we’re going to triumph.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2010/may/08/steve-smith-england-australia\" title=\"\">With a healthy lick of poetic licence, the Sydney-born Smith can be viewed as the one that got away</a>. His mother hails from West Malling in Kent and he played second XI cricket for the county in 2007, where the academy director at the time, and now the England assistant coach, Paul Farbrace, claims he tried to sign him permanently using that dual-nationality route.</p> \n<p>Smith recalls only a contract offer from Surrey, whose second string he also turned out for that summer. Either way, any overtures to become an Englishman were always going to fall on deaf ears. “I went home and got offered a rookie contract with New South Wales,” he says. “I always dreamed of playing for Australia, so the decision wasn’t too difficult. I would have enjoyed playing some county cricket and learning my art that way, but I never had any ambitions at all to play for England, that’s for sure.”</p> \n<p>It was at the Sydney Cricket Ground where he got to know England’s new head coach, Trevor Bayliss, who went on record this week to state his admiration for his former player in all of the Dukes-related chuntering. Smith, who began the tour with an ominous 111 against Kent before retiring his wicket, is more than happy to repay the favour. “From my experiences with him, Trevor has been a very good coach. He’s taught me a lot about the game of cricket,” says Smith. “He talks about the game of cricket non-stop.</p> \n<p>“His emotions, as a coach, are a great trait to have. You wouldn’t know if you’d had a good day or a bad day at the end if you’re looking at him. He understands the game as well as anyone I’ve come across, so I think he’ll be really good for England.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435943882770/Australias-Steve-Smith-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Australia's Steve Smith warmed up for the Ashes series with a century against Kent.

Jay Gatsby knew this. And just like the doomed hero of F Scott Fitzgerald’s novel, this year’s revamped BBC highlights programme has been forced to remake itself. Catching <em>Wimbledon 2day</em> (the much-derided digit, we were told, reflected its place on BBC2) each night during the first week was like watching a time-lapse video of a caterpillar turning into a butterfly. On Monday, it was a mess, something that John McEnroe inadvertently expressed when he walked on to the set with the opening line “this is so bizarre”. By the weekend, however, we had witnessed a miracle of evolution.</p> \n<p>We may never know what the Wimbledon presenters did to be cast out of their beautiful All England eyrie – a place from where they once cast their beneficent, omniscient eye on events like Saruman at the start of Lord of the Rings – and into the hospitality complex over the road. As for what prompted the decision to dress the set with box hedges and white cabanas and a wipe-clean Perspex bar, so that it looked like before-midnight Ibiza, one can only hypothesise. Perhaps the producers had seen last month’s return of <em>TFI Friday</em>, and someone had told them “The 90s are BACK!”</p> \n<p>But Tim Henman is not zany, and a show broadcasting from a leafy SW19 postcode was never going to conjure the anarchic energy of any of the shows it was hoping to be. When camera shots loomed and zoomed from wild angles they suggested less an atmosphere of madcap fun than a dangerous stalker lurking in one of those box hedges, about to pounce on Balding.</p> \n<p>Happily, the very social media that the producers were working so hard to win over with their #anyonefortennis hashtag also showed them the error of their ways. By Tuesday the guests, who had been standing around with the self-consciousness of businessfolk waiting to board their first-class Eurostar carriage, were being allowed to sit on stools that look delightfully like marshmallows. And the awful “seeds board”, next to which Lindsay Davenport had stood cluelessly as Balding stuck tennis balls on the faces of knocked-out players, had been filed in a cylindrical upright drawer.</p> \n<p>Realising that only a mass blood transfusion was going to enliven its politely cardboard studio audience, the crowd was inched a little further into the background every day, until by Thursday it had disappeared from shot completely. Highlights of the day’s games were allowed to run at greater length, culminating in a stonking 24-minute edit of Friday’s Williams‑Watson match.</p> \n<p>And once the format had laid aside its desperate lurch at comedy, it relaxed into some genuinely funny banter, such as the segment on Wimbledon’s new ice baths that led Pat Cash to remark, deadpan: “It can be a little bit embarrassing when you come out.”</p> \n<p>Harry Hill would certainly have approved of the video clip that showed his granddaughter hitting a ball into his forehead – so good we got a slo-mo replay. Whether you like the BBC’s round-up packages has always depended on how much you enjoy an overwrought pun – how else would we have known that Thursday was World UFO day, if it wasn’t for Phil Jones?</p> \n<p>But this is an audience that appreciates clever, and by the end of the week <em>Wimbledon 2Day</em> was slowly finding its audience. Friday evening’s show boldly opened with the one-minute silence, a reminder of why we love to hang out with these excellent BBC pundits – not because they’re stand up comedians (they’re not) but because they have gravitas and an admirable sense of perspective. Reflecting on the theme, McEnroe joked: “Clare, they’re coming after us on this show – to hell with these people”.

On the eve of the British Grand Prix, one of the season’s highlights, the Mercedes team principal has called for the sport to pull out of a vortex of criticism. “We have got into a spiral where everybody with a negative message to deliver has found an ear,” he told the<em> Observer</em>. “All of us involved in the sport are stakeholders and our duty is to help to promote it and make it attractive.”</p> \n<p>Wolff is an increasingly calm figure at the vanguard of F1, but he is cross to the point of incandescence at the way his sport has been attacked by officials, drivers and commentators. F1 has been something of a soft target this year as his Mercedes team have dominated, with none of the other nine teams – even Ferrari – capable of mustering a meaningful challenge.</p> \n<p>Bernie Ecclestone, F1’s chief executive, last month <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/f1-chaos-bernie-ecclestone-austrian-grand-prix-jenson-button-fernando-alonso\" title=\"\">used the word “crap” to describe the “product”</a> he has to sell. On Saturday Ecclestone said: “We are damaging it ourselves and I am as guilty as anyone.” This past week, Max Mosley, a former president of the FIA, the sport’s governing body, and the man who worked closely with Ecclestone to turn F1 into a global empire, said: “There are no two ways about it, if Formula One continues on its current path, it is headed for a major crisis.</p> \n<p>“The futures of six out of 10 teams on the grid are uncertain, there is too much artificiality in the racing, costs are far too high, and all that is giving us uncompetitive – and at times – boring racing.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/03/damon-hill-f1-drivers-voice\">Damon Hill: more powers for F1 drivers can restore sport’s human touch</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Drivers, past and present, have also lined up to attack the sport. Wolff, however, says: “The way we are speaking about, it or writing about it, determines the way it is perceived. Because how many people have access to the paddock and are able to look at cars and make a judgment? The answer is very few. But there are tens of millions watching a grand prix at weekends and what we tell them is what they perceive to be happening. If we are our own worst salesman how will they ever buy into our product? It’s like a CEO of a car company saying: ‘My car is a crap car. Who is going to buy that car?’ I know people will say about me: ‘Of course he’s not criticising because he’s winning.’ But we are developing a negative momentum. If you’re in a spiral of nonstop criticism it will trigger opinions from people who have no clue.”</p> \n<p>There is a worry in the paddock that there may eventually be no product to sell, that more teams could disappear, together with sponsors. “It’s like putting your profile on Facebook,” Wolff said. “You’re not going to put your most ugly picture on Facebook and you’re not going to say that actually I’m not sporty, and I’m not very intelligent, and I’m not very good looking either. But please like me. You have to show your best side, try to promote yourself – even if you think you are ugly and you should be losing weight.” He added: “We need to take criticism on board. But we also need to be positive.”</p> \n<p>Wolff has been particularly angered by suggestions that the current cars are too easy to drive. Nigel Mansell, the 1992 champion, said recently: “Drivers can drive with a couple of fingers.” David Coulthard said after last month’s Canadian Grand Prix: “The sport has gone from the bucking bronco cars driven by Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost and Nigel Mansell to an exercise in systems management which Fernando Alonso likened to piloting airliners. The drivers are just not tested sufficiently.”</p> \n<p>To those criticisms, Wolff said: “It’s fair enough to ask are the cars loud enough. But when I hear people say they are easy to drive that is absolute nonsense. Go and ask any driver. He will tell you that the car is difficult to drive.</p> \n<p>“I had lunch with Nico [Rosberg] recently and he told me that these cars are mind-blowingly fast and so hard to drive. The cars are very difficult, intellectually and physically.”</p> \n<p>Yet, as Wolff concedes, this hardly matters if most of the fans find the sport too “expensive,” “technical” and “boring”, as revealed in a recent survey. Tellingly, 89% said that racing had to become more competitive.</p> \n<p>The best news for F1 in the past week came at Wednesday’s meeting of the habitually hopeless Strategy Group, which is made up by the six leading teams, plus Ecclestone and the FIA president, Jean Todt. It came up with some positive ideas for once – although the most important issue, that of costs and the distribution of money, has still to be resolved.</p> \n<p>Speaking about the most significant of the proposed changes, Wolff said: “It would be good to stop all radio communication with the driver, which makes the car appear remotely controlled from the pitwall. We are also going to make the cars noisier. We should also do more stuff with the drivers. We’ve said to Bernie to bring the drivers downtown and show them to the people. There’s no reason why the drivers should not be more accessible. The more we can have them with the fans the better.”</p> \n<p>The torrent of criticism has undoubtedly damaged F1, but if that has finally provoked a reaction – especially from Todt and Ecclestone, who have shown a lack of leadership – so much the better.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the best response to Ecclestone’s disparaging comment at Silverstone this weekend came from the Force India’s team principal, Vijay Mallya, who said: “He shouldn’t be selling the product if he thought it was crap. But considering that he sells the product – that he calls crap and makes billions out of it – he needs to work with the participants to uncrap it!” Precisely.</p> \n<h2>WHAT’S WRONG WITH FORMULA ONE?</h2> \n<p><strong>Mark Webber, former Formula One driver </strong>“There’s two things essentially wrong: First, on the sporting front F1 needs to get rid of Pirelli. The tyres have no grip, which means the drivers aren’t able to follow each other because when you do, you damage the tyres. Even if Pirelli increased the grip of their tyres, we would need three or four pit stops per race and that would be comical too. What the sport needs is more noise and more grip.</p> \n<p>Second, there is the commercial concern. F1 is a business model that hasn’t moved with the times. Sponsors want their pound of flesh, access and more rights and unfortunately F1 doesn’t deliver. It means the teams are becoming ever more reliant on drivers bringing their own budgets so F1 is no longer the place it was for the best drivers in the world. Unquestionably, the top half-dozen are the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the sport but we’ve never had so many ‘pay’ drivers on the grid as wedo now.”</p> \n<p><strong>Derek Bell, five-time winner of Le Mans 24 Hours </strong>“What people are overlooking is that Formula One is a spectator sport: we are out there to entertain the public and we are in the entertainment business and we must never forget that. For the spectators to have to read a handbook to their son or daughter trying to explain why the guys are coming in for this, that and the other and some are slower than others and the difference between the tyres that have yellow lines and those that have red lines.</p> \n<p>Equally, technically it’s gone too far. I know the manufacturers have to show willingness to do hybrids but it doesn’t help racing. There is also a need to restrict the ridiculous rise in the technical costs of running the cars and we need to make them not so technical to drive, so the public can understand what the drivers are doing. Make it simpler.”</p> \n<p><strong>Roger Davis, Formula One fan </strong>“I’ve followed Formula One and motor sport generally all my life. My first British Grand Prix at Brands in 1978 cost about &pound;6 and was fantastic. It was a real spectacle then, there were 30 cars on the grid, it was the pinnacle of motor racing. But really I miss the characters. F1 now is all a bit too corporate, it’s sanitised. It’s all spin and corporate speak. For me, Niki Lauda and Kimi Raikkonen are the best people in F1 because they speak their minds.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/4/1436024786685/Toto-Wolff-Mercedes-team--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Toto Wolff is all smiles ahead of the British Grand Prix, but rounded on F1's critics including Bernie Ecclestone.
