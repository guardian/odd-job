defence spending, the former head of the RAF has said.<br /></p> \n<p>Sir Michael Graydon said any prime minister who wants to be “remembered as a statesman” should take the opportunity to commit to maintaining the Nato target of spending a minimum of 2% of national income on defence.</p> \n<p>Neither the Conservatives nor Labour pledged in their manifestos to meet the 2% target beyond 2015/16 after the next defence spending review.</p> \n<p>Tory former security minister Baroness Neville-Jones said during the election campaign she was “willing to bet” a Conservative government would stick to the commitment, with the prime minister coming under renewed pressure following his victory on 7 May.</p> \n<p>In a foreword to the latest UK National Defence Association (UKNDA) report, retired air chief marshal Graydon wrote: “The prime minister has now an opportunity to do what he and the other major party leaders felt unable to do in this election campaign, namely to repair the damage done to our defence and security in recent years and to our reputation as a serious contributor to world security.</p> \n<p>“He can start immediately, by endorsing the House of Commons defence committee report of March 17 this year – ‘Re-thinking defence to meet new threats’, and in a simple statement make good his commitment to the Nato minimum of 2% of GDP.</p> \n<p>“It is an opportunity which any prime minister who aspires to be remembered as a statesman should take.”</p> \n<p>The UKNDA, a group of former military chiefs and politicians, wants the government to commit to the Nato target of 2% as a minimum for the rest of the parliament and protect the budget from public-spending cuts. </p> \n<p>Military chiefs should also be free to give their views publicly in line with the approach adopted in the US so that MPs and the public “can be reassured of the adequacy of defence provision”, the report

If you do not have trained staff and clear reporting routes, how do you know?”</p> \n<p>The Guardian sought data going back five years to compare guidelines and strategies across institutions and to document the extent of sexual violence.</p> \n<p>Eighteen universities provided some data on the number of allegations recorded. However, there was no standard system of reporting. Some listed individual rapes, sexual assault and harassment, broken down by year; some listed merely “confidential conversations with harassment advisers where incidents of this nature were discussed”. </p> \n<p>The numbers cited ranged between two and 44 over the past five years.

That figure includes all contact, from phoning the helpline, to counselling and advocacy services, but it gives an indication of the scale of the problem. She said universities have a duty of care to their students and said age 18-24, which most students fall into, is the peak age range in which sexual assaults occur.<br /></p> \n<p>The response of universities to allegations of sexual violence was too “hit and miss”, Whitfield said.</p> \n<p>“We’ve had clients come to us who have said: ‘I’ve spoken to the university and nobody knew what to do, so I Googled rape and found you’, to those who say ‘I was led to believe that I had to go to the police and I’m not ready’, to those who have said ‘I’ve been referred by the university’,” she said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There’s no evidence of a specific strategy or joined-up work across all the universities</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Fee Scott, Devon Rape Crisis Service</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Susuana Antubam, the NUS women’s officer, said most universities are not doing enough to acknowledge and confront the problem, even when their students highlight the issues through their unions and NUS initiatives.

US colleges have an additional legal duty to respond to sexual violence allegations.</p> \n<p> Commenting on the Guardian’s report, Fee Scott of Devon Rape Crisis Service said: “There’s no evidence of a specific strategy or joined-up work across all the universities. The low figures are unsurprising given there is no strategy that targets these specific issues, part of a very big and growing problem.”</p> \n<p>Scott, whose centre is based in Exeter, a university town, said her office was contacted by 1,200 clients a year, a third of whom are aged between 18-24.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2014/sep/15/sexual-harassment-rife-universities-nus-survey\">Sexual harassment rife at UK universities, says NUS</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“In terms of money, time and resources, it is these big universities that should be taking the lead on this,” said Scott. “If a prestigious university put out a strong message that we don’t accept sexual violence, instead of leaving it to students, that would be very powerful.”</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group, said: “Russell Group universities take the issue of any kind of harassment, abuse or violence against women extremely seriously indeed.

He said Isis propaganda was so powerful he had to be vigilant about his own children. But some will argue that his ideas walk a fine line between vigilance in the face of potent extremist propaganda and criminalising thought.</p> \n<p>Scotland Yard has recently said police are making nearly an arrest a day as they try to counter a severe Islamist terrorist threat. On Friday, the Met confirmed it is investigating the potential grooming and radicalisation of a 16-year-old east London girl to run away and join her sister in Isis to become a “jihadi bride”. Police estimate that about half the 700 thought to have gone to Syria to support Isis have since returned to Britain.</p> \n<p>Chishty said communities in Britain had to act much earlier. He said: “We need to now be less precious about the private space. This is not about us invading private thoughts, but acknowledging that it is in these private spaces where this [extremism] first germinates. The purpose of private-space intervention is to engage, explore, explain, educate or eradicate. Hate and extremism is not acceptable in our society, and if people cannot be educated, then hate and harmful extremism must be eradicated through all lawful means.”</p> \n<p>He said that what was new about Isis is the use of social media and the internet to spread its message and urge people lured by it to join the group or stage attacks in their home country.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/22/david-cameron-backs-plans-ofcom-block-extremist-messages-tv-censorship\">David Cameron backs plans for Ofcom to block 'extremist messages' on TV</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Asked to define “private space”, Chishty said: “It’s anything from walking down the road, looking at a mobile, to someone in a bedroom surfing the net, to someone in a shisha cafe talking about things.”</p> \n<p>He said friends and family were best placed to intervene. Questions should be asked, he said, if someone stops shopping at Marks &amp; Spencer or starts voicing criticism. He said it could be they were just fed up with the store, but alternatively they could have “hatred for that store”. He said the community should “look out for each other”, that Isis was “un-Islamic”, as proven by its barbarity.</p> \n<p>In February, three teenage girls from a school in Bethnal Green, east London, slipped away from their families to travel to Turkey and then into Isis-held territory in Syria. Their families said there had been no clue, but Chishty said there must have been some change in the children: “My view as a parent is there must have been signs.”</p> \n<p>The propaganda of Isis was so powerful, the officer said, that he feared his own children might be vulnerable. He said his message to fellow Muslim parents was: “I am not immunised.” “If I feel the need to be extra vigilant, then I think you need to feel the need to be extra vigilant,” he said.</p> \n<p>He said he had heard of cases of children seemingly influenced by Islamist views in stable families in which the parents or guardians had moderate views.</p> \n<p>In the example of primary school children defining Christmas as “haram”, he insisted this was “factual” and said that while it may not be a police matter, parents and family needed to ask how children as young as five had come to that view, whether it be from school or their friends. Chishty said: “All the ugly bits of the problem, which are uncomfortable, you have to … deal with them properly, as a state, as a nation, as a community.” <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>He added that Muslim communities had done a lot to fight extremism but, given that there was no end in sight to the struggle and no slowing up in the stream of young people being attracted to extremism, it would need a level of vigilance not seen before. He said that current strategies were not working. “We are in unchartered water … We are facing a risk, a threat which is global, which is powerfully driven by social media, reaching you on your own through your mobile phone.”</p> \n<p>The UK’s counter-radicalisation strategy has been criticised for co-opting those trusted by the young, such as teachers and youth workers, to inform on them to the authorities.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/mar/29/british-muslim-communities-women-face-challenge-extremism\">My journey into the complex lives of British-Muslim women and girls | Sara Khan</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Chishty said it did not make someone an extremist if they criticised “British values”, but friends and family should ask why, especially if it marked a change in their view. He said more work was needed to understand why youngsters were attracted to Isis: “Some are bored, overqualified, underemployed … It is not a holy war.”</p> \n<p>Chishty warned of a very real threat to Muslims in Britain from the backlash that might follow a terrorist attack, which counter-terrorism officials believe is a matter of when, not if.</p> \n<p>After the murder of Lee Rigby in May 2013 by two men espousing jihadi views, attacks against Muslims increased from one to seven a day, and there were 28 attacks on Muslim buildings. Such an attack, and even terrorist atrocities abroad, such as January’s massacre in Paris of Charlie Hebdo staff, were making community relations in London more challenging, but he said police had boosted their efforts to reassure and protect all communities.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432315016279/5943484d-eb0c-4f82-a0c2-836325d672b3-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Zohra Bensemra/Reuters/Corbis","altText":"Teenagers read Qur'an","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/Reuters/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-24T13:16:11Z","lastModified":"2015-05-24T23:40:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1462,"contributors":[{"name":"Vikram Dodd","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/vikramdodd"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Islam","Islamic State","Children","Police","UK security and counter-terrorism","Religion","Society","UK news","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/islam","webTitle":"Islam"},{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State"},{"id":"society/children","webTitle":"Children"},{"id":"uk/police","webTitle":"Police"},{"id":"uk/uksecurity","webTitle":"UK security and counter-terrorism"},{"id":"world/religion","webTitle":"Religion"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Vikram Dodd","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/vikramdodd"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/24/jihadi-threat-requires-move-into-private-space-of-uk-muslims-says-police-chief","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/496fx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/may/24/jihadi-threat-requires-move-into-private-space-of-uk-muslims-says-police-chief","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/24/jihadi-threat-requires-move-into-private-space-of-uk-muslims-says-police-chief"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432315016279/5943484d-eb0c-4f82-a0c2-836325d672b3-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Teenagers read a children’s edition of the Qur’an.

However, CCTV footage showed he was not being followed and he was detained under the Mental Health Act.</p> \n<p>While waiting to be assessed at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham, Burrell wet himself and was left handcuffed on the hospital floor for five or six hours. He died from a heart attack four days later.</p> \n<p>Jurors found that the police used an unreasonable amount of force to detain Burrell in the hospital’s A&amp;E unit and in a separate seclusion room, and that it “more than minimally contributed to his death”. They also found that a blanket used to cover Burrell’s face had a “more than minimal” contribution to his death and should have been removed.</p> \n<p>In the letter, which has been seen by the Guardian, May is told that the Burrell family had to wait 17 months for the student’s body to be released for burial and four years for an inquest.</p> \n<p>“There was no support or counselling offered to Kingsley’s family who have endured the grief and their fight for justice on their own with assistance from family and friends,” the letter says. “I am sure you will agree that this is totally unacceptable and yet again … we have been hearing the common phrase ‘lessons learned’.
