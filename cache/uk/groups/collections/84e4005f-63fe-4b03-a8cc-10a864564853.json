Two months later, he was rendered to the US military prison on Cuba. US authorities have made it clear that they have no intention of charging him.</p> \n<p>David Cameron has raised the case of Aamer with Obama on two occasions this year – at their meeting in the White House in January and at the G7 summit in Bavaria earlier this summer. Ministers are privately frustrated that the White House appears not to be taking any concrete steps towards securing Aamer’s release.</p> \n<p>In an open letter printed on Saturday, US Independence Day, more than 80 prominent Britons, including the former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve and the Labour leadership contender Jeremy Corbyn, urge Obama “to facilitate the transfer from Guant&aacute;namo of Shaker Aamer ... and his return to his family in the UK - his British wife and his four British children”.<br /></p> \n<p>They add: “It has not escaped our notice that, while the US is celebrating its foundation under the rule of law, the continuing detention of men at Guant&aacute;namo – largely without charge or trial – continues to undermine America’s notion of itself and its international standing.”</p> \n<p>The letter, drawn up by the <a href=\"http://westandwithshaker.org/\">We Stand with Shaker</a> campaign, notes that Aamer has twice been approved for release from the base – in 2007, under President Bush, and in 2010, by Obama’s Guant&aacute;namo Review Task Force. The letter is also supported by Sir Keir Starmer, the former director of public prosecutions, and six former Labour and Tory cabinet ministers, including Tessa Jowell and Andrew Mitchell.</p> \n<p>The comedian Russell Brand, one of the signatories, said: “Barack Obama, who inspired so much hope and has presided over so much pain and disappointment, in this single act of compassion can alter history.”</p> \n<p>The letter comes amid deep frustration in Whitehall at the apparent failure of the Obama administration to take steps towards releasing Aamer. Obama told Cameron at their White House meeting in January that he would prioritise Aamer’s case, though he would only act in a way that protected national security.</p> \n<p>The Foreign Office told the Guardian last month that Aamer’s case “remains a high priority for the UK government”. It added: “We continue to make clear to the US that we want him released and returned to the UK as a matter of urgency”. The FO said that after Cameron raised the case at the G7 summit, Obama “made assurances that, whilst there is no fixed timetable for a decision, it is under active, high-level consideration”.</p> \n<p>Coalition government ministers made at least 15 requests to the US for Aamer to be transferred to the UK, the Guardian understands. British officials privately refer to extreme “sensitivities” surrounding the case.</p> \n<p>Aamer has accused British security and intelligence officials of knowingly making false statements, notably that he was a member of an al-Qaida network in London. Clive Stafford Smith, founder of the legal charity Reprieve, who has regularly visited Aamer at Guant&aacute;namo Bay, says he is prevented from divulging evidence he knows about the case by a confidentiality agreement. He has told the Guardian that MI6 “stabbed him [Aamer] in the back” by giving US courts false intelligence. </p> \n<p>The high court in London heard in 2010 that the police were investigating Aamer’s allegations of British security and intelligence agency complicity in his mistreatment. Aamer’s US lawyer, Brent Mickum, said: “I have seen records of interviews with him by the UK security services … They were fully aware that he was complaining about his treatment and had been tortured.”</p> \n<p>Aamer has been on hunger strike, and his physical and mental health has deteriorated badly over the years.</p> \n<p>In May, the former Conservative ministers Andrew Mitchell and David Davis, with the Labour MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Andy Slaughter, met senior officials in Washington to try to secure Aamer’s release. </p> \n<p>“It is difficult for us to shake off the depressing notion that the Obama administration is indifferent to the repeated requests of the British government. It is a slap in the face for America’s staunchest friend,” the MPs wrote in a joint article in the New York Times.</p> \n<p>Aamer married Zin Siddique, a Briton, in 1996. She lives in Battersea, south London, with their four children, the youngest of whom – Faris, now 13 - he has never met.</p> \n<p>Downing Street has tried to show patience with the White House because it appreciates that the US Congress has to be given 30 days’ notice of the release of any inmate from Guant&aacute;namo Bay. Republicans, who have majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, could scupper Obama’s plan to close Guant&aacute;namo Bay by the end of his second term.</p> \n<p>One signatory to the letter said: “The White House haven’t even informed Congress about Shaker Aamer. This is spitting in the prime minister’s face.”<br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bd2c478074f54adc8b12974d038179bbf31656cb/0_0_4881_2929/4881.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2929,"width":4881,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dominic Dudley/Demotix/Corbis","altText":"Protesters demand release of Guantánamo Bay prisoner Shaker Aamer<br>17 Jun 2015, London, England, UK --- London, United Kingdom. 17th June 2015 -- An inflatable model of Guantánamo Bay prisoner Shaker Aamer stands in front of Big Ben during a protest outside the Houses of Parliament in London demanding his release. -- Amnesty International organised a protest outside the UK Houses of Parliament in Westminster, London to demand the release of UK resident Shaker Aamer, who has been held at the Guantánamo Bay detention centre since 2002. --- Image by © Dominic Dudley/Demotix/Corbis","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dominic Dudley/Demotix/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T18:06:56Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T23:17:28Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":344,"contributors":[{"name":"Richard Norton-Taylor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/richardnortontaylor"},{"name":"Nicholas Watt","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nicholaswatt"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Shaker Aamer","Guantánamo Bay","Obama administration","US news","World news","Boris Johnson","Alan Johnson","David Cameron","Dominic Grieve","US military","Law","Rendition","Politics","UK news","Keir Starmer","Tessa Jowell","Andrew Mitchell","Russell Brand","Clive Stafford Smith","David Davis","Jeremy Corbyn","US Congress","Culture","Human rights"],"tags":[{"id":"world/shaker-aamer","webTitle":"Shaker Aamer"},{"id":"us-news/guantanamo-bay","webTitle":"Guantánamo Bay"},{"id":"us-news/obama-administration","webTitle":"Obama administration"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"politics/boris","webTitle":"Boris Johnson"},{"id":"politics/alanjohnson","webTitle":"Alan Johnson"},{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"politics/dominicgrieve","webTitle":"Dominic Grieve"},{"id":"us-news/us-military","webTitle":"US military"},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law"},{"id":"world/rendition","webTitle":"Rendition"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"law/keir-starmer","webTitle":"Keir Starmer"},{"id":"politics/tessajowell","webTitle":"Tessa Jowell"},{"id":"politics/andrew-mitchell","webTitle":"Andrew Mitchell"},{"id":"culture/russell-brand","webTitle":"Russell Brand"},{"id":"law/clive-stafford-smith","webTitle":"Clive Stafford Smith"},{"id":"politics/daviddavis","webTitle":"David Davis"},{"id":"politics/jeremy-corbyn","webTitle":"Jeremy Corbyn"},{"id":"us-news/us-congress","webTitle":"US Congress"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"law/human-rights","webTitle":"Human rights"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/03/former-uk-ministers-urge-obama-to-free-shaker-aamer-from-guantanamo-bay","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ac9v","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/03/former-uk-ministers-urge-obama-to-free-shaker-aamer-from-guantanamo-bay","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/03/former-uk-ministers-urge-obama-to-free-shaker-aamer-from-guantanamo-bay"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bd2c478074f54adc8b12974d038179bbf31656cb/0_0_4881_2929/4881.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2929,"width":4881,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An inflatable model of Shaker Aamer in front of parliament at an Amnesty protest demanding his release.

It also found flaws in the Metropolitan police operation that led to the killing.</p> \n<p>Rodney was killed in Edgware after police forced a car he was travelling in to stop. Officers said they had intelligence that Rodney was part of a gang, possibly armed with automatic weapons, on its way to rob a Colombian drug gang.</p> \n<p>His mother, Susan Alexander, said her son should have been arrested rather than shot, and said the Metropolitan police had still not learned lessons. “He did not deserve to die and we do not have a death penalty in this country,” she said.</p> \n<p>Long’s acquittal takes the pressure off police chiefs who would have faced a potential rebellion from armed officers if he had become the first police marksman to be convicted of murdering a suspect.</p> \n<p>The jury deliberated for just over 12 hours before announcing that, by a majority, they were not convinced of the prosecution case.</p> \n<p>Long, standing in the dock in a grey suit and blue tie, nodded his thanks to the seven women and five men. Sitting nearby, Alexander showed no emotion. Both of them have endured a complaints and criminal justice system that has taken a decade to reach this point.</p> \n<p>After the verdict, Long said: “It has been very difficult facing trial for something that happened 10 years ago when I had acted to protect the lives of others as a part of my job and based on my training and experience.</p> \n<p>“Police firearms officers do not go out intending to shoot people and, like me in this case, have to make split-second life or death decisions based on the information available to them at the time.”</p> \n<p>Long told the jury that as his unmarked police car pulled alongside a silver Golf containing three suspects, Rodney ducked down in the rear seat and came back up. He said Rodney’s movement “seemed a totally unnatural movement to me”, adding: “I have never seen a suspect behave in such a distinct way.”</p> \n<p>Long said: “All I had was seconds to make the decision whether I was going to let my colleagues be shot by someone with a submachine gun or whether I was going to take life. I chose to take his life. That was the decision I made and I stand by it.”</p> \n<p>Long fired eight times from two metres away. His first two shots missed.

They reversed their initial decision not to prosecute and charged Long, who found himself in the dock a decade after the shooting.</p> \n<p>On 30 April 2005, intelligence led police to suspect Rodney and at least two other men were going to carry out an armed robbery to steal drugs from a Colombian drug gang.</p> \n<p>Police chiefs put an armed team on standby to intercept Rodney and his colleagues, with surveillance officers following the suspects across London.</p> \n<p>Long and the armed officers were receiving intelligence updates. He told the jury that the intelligence said the suspects had two fully automatic weapons and may have acquired a third. The Guardian understands this intelligence came from intercepts.</p> \n<p>Long, a firearms veteran and instructor, said the weapons were Mac 10s, capable of firing 1,000 rounds a minute. One of the suspects was overheard by a surveillance officer as saying they had “two Big Macs and a little one”.</p> \n<p>Long told the jury of his state of mind: “I believe they had very dangerous, very compact weapons. I was very conscious of the danger involved in this situation.”</p> \n<p>As the VW Golf containing Rodney drove through north London, police decided to box it in and force it to a halt, known as a “hard stop”. One unmarked police car closed the Golf off from the front, another from the rear, and the third, containing Long, pulled up alongside.</p> \n<p>Long was to “cover” the suspects with his police issue Heckler &amp; Koch G36C carbine weapon as his armed colleagues rushed from their cars to arrest the suspects at gunpoint. Rodney was sitting in the rear of the Golf, Long was in the front passenger seat of his unmarked vehicle.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>All I had was seconds to make the decision … I chose to take his life.

He had allegedly looked around, slid across a seat or bent down, and then sprung up. The suspect must have being going for a weapon to open fire, Long said.</p> \n<p>He told the jury: “All I had was seconds to make the decision whether I was going to let my colleagues be shot by someone with a submachine gun or whether I was going to take life. I chose to take his life. That was the decision I made and I stand by it.”</p> \n<p>Long pulled the trigger eight times while no more than two metres from Rodney, shooting the suspect in the arm, body, twice around his right ear and then, after a pause of three-quarters of a second, twice through the top of his head. Long’s first two shots had missed. He said: “I remember thinking if I could give him more time. I decided I could not.”</p> \n<p>It is time that presented Long with a problem. The audio track of a video recording of the incident, by an officer in another car, as well as other data, showed that for Long’s statement to be correct, within two seconds he saw Rodney, witnessed all the movements he said the suspect made, assessed the suspect was about to shoot, decided himself to open fire and fired eight times.</p> \n<p> Max Hill QC, prosecuting, alleged Long had shot the suspect on sight: “Was there time for Azelle Rodney to look left, then look right, then duck down, then come back up with shoulders hunched?” he asked. “Four actions, none of them requiring many seconds to perform, but bear in mind the time available is 0.2 seconds at the most, for all of those movements.</p> \n<p>“We say that the movement of the vehicles during the hard stop, the restricted visibility and the rapid timing of events mean that Mr Long cannot have seen what he claimed. This must mean that he has tried to explain his decision to open fire, to justify his action after the event.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3f826012afe57a48be741fe1c9b9450ad07333bb\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3f826012afe57a48be741fe1c9b9450ad07333bb/62_241_1486_1975/752.jpg\" alt=\"Azelle Rodney.\" width=\"752\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Azelle Rodney.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Rodney died quickly from his wounds.

It argues that its services are unique and that it may struggle in future to meet the needs of the 16,000 children it supports in street drop-in centres and schools in London and Bristol.</p> \n<p>But while saying that an “in principle” funding agreement was in place, those close to the charity said nothing had been signed and key conditions had not been met. A Kids Company spokesman said: “We are confident that we will reach an agreement; it is just we don’t have one at the moment.”</p> \n<p>Kids Company said it intended to reform itself. “In partnership with a city-based group of philanthropists, the charity is being supported by the new government to create a more sustainable organisation and funding structure that will be better able to tolerate unpredictable income streams in the future,” it said in a statement. </p> \n<p>Ministers and officials have been concerned over the instability of Kids Company. A former minister told the Guardian: “Where there has been frustration on both sides of the conversation is we had an unsatisfactory process where Camila would effectively come in and say ‘I’m about to fold if you don’t give me &pound;5m. That happened on a regular basis and more often than not the hole was plugged.</p> \n<p>“There is a recognition in governments of all colours that what Kids Company do is extremely valuable and they reach parts of the statutory [social care] system that other parts do not seem to. But the charity keeps growing and there’s been no retrenchment. She [Camila] cannot say no.

She’s running something rather amazing. But it is difficult to replicate at scale and run in a way that’s accountable for public money.”</p> \n<p>Kids Company hit back at suggestions that it was poorly managed and its effectiveness could not be demonstrated, pointing to research by the London School of Economics, Cambridge University and the Tavistock and Portman NHS trust which recognised the impact of its work. “The success of Kids Company as measured by the young lives that have been transformed and in many instances, saved, is beyond question,” it said.</p> \n<p>The charity said it had struggled financially because philanthropic and public donations had shrunk at a time when it had to meet the practical and emotional needs of an increasing number of high-risk vulnerable children who are not being supported by the statutory system.</p> \n<p>A senior children’s charity chief executive said that although Batmanghelidjh could “rub people up the wrong way”, her organisation offered a much-needed service. “It [Kids Company] is a touchy-feely service. Camila throws caution to the wind. There is a growing need for the type of work that they do. They are reaching children that the statutory services cannot and saving children who would otherwise be failed.”</p> \n<p>But another charity boss said Kids Company was seen by some other children’s organisations as uncollegiate in receipt of special privileges. “In general, the rest of the sector have found Kids Company to be pretty idiosyncratic,” they said.</p> \n<p>Cameron’s official spokeswoman denied that Downing Street had been involved in any negative briefing about Batmanghelidjh. The spokeswoman said: “The government’s priority is to do all it can to make sure every child has the best start in life. As part of that the Cabinet Office has been working to continue to support Kids Company during the difficult situation that they face.</p> \n<p>“As part of ensuring that that work is put on a sustainable footing, they [the Cabinet Office] have requested changes to [the charity’s] management structure, which is in the best interests of the charity.

Its mission statement reads: “Many of the 36,000 children, young people and families that our services reach live in exceptional poverty. We see the impact of such acute deprivation at our centres every day.”</p> \n<p> Kids Company’s core work confronts the undiminished consequences of child poverty and government cuts – so it is interesting that this row with the government comes just two days after the secretary of state for work and pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, revealed that legally binding targets on child poverty were to be scrapped. The announcement was made immediately after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/blog/2009/jan/28/heathrow-third-runway-transport\">Wednesday’s debate</a> on the future of Heathrow and it was muffled by the noise over runways.</p> \n<p> But child poverty campaigners were acutely aware of the implications of the decision to abandon the internationally accepted system (based on counting how much money a family has) and shift to a measurement of child poverty based on parental educational attainment and employment, as well as a handful of “life chances” factors – family breakdown, debt and addiction. This was a move away from seeing poverty as the result of structural factors such as low wages towards viewing it as the consequence of ill-advised lifestyle choices.</p> \n<p> Naomi Eisenstadt, the Oxford academic and first director of Sure Start, who was this week appointed by the Scottish government as independent poverty adviser to Nicola Sturgeon, described the announcement as “the dismantling of all our efforts on child poverty”. She said: “In keeping with the narrative on welfare reform on scroungers and strivers, they are now defining poverty not by poverty but behaviours. It is completely disgraceful.”</p> \n<p> Child poverty figures released last week showed that the number of children living in relative poverty was unchanged at 2.3 million – a statistic heralded as a triumph by the government, since the number had been widely predicted to increase. But there was cynicism from opposition MPs after Duncan Smith’s decision to scrap targets, over whether his announcement had been slipped in before the consequences of the promised &pound;12bn further cuts to welfare are felt.</p> \n<p>The chancellor, George Osborne, is expected to outline where some of those cuts will fall in the budget next Wednesday. If as predicted, child tax credits are hit, the bulk of the new cuts will fall on the poorest 30% of households.</p> \n<p> <a href=\"http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/case/spcc/rr04.pdf\">Research by LSE, Manchester and York</a> shows that spending related to children fell under the coalition from nearly &pound;40bn in 2009-10 to &pound;36bn by 2014-15, while spending on pensions rose from &pound;94bn in 2009–10 to &pound;103bn in 2014-15. “It is a general disinvestment of the state in children,” said Imran Hussain, policy director of the Child Poverty Action Group.</p> \n<p> Charities which receive government funding to carry out work that is no longer provided by the state have increasingly found themselves in a difficult position – often dependent to some extent on government grants, but determined to speak out about the consequences of government cuts.</p> \n<p>Charities such as the Trussell Trust and Shelter have been warned by the government to tone down their criticisms of policy. In this climate, people like Batmanghelidjh who are outspoken critics of government policy can expect to run into problems.</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435943119336/1f2c92cc-40c6-4f8b-8100-7174fa004e59-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ben Stansall/PA","altText":"Kids Company founder Camila Batmanghelidjh  attends a ‘big society’ chaired by David Cameron at Downing Street in 2010.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ben Stansall/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T17:13:05Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T23:07:59Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Amelia Gentleman","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733733291/AmeliaGentleman.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ameliagentleman"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Camila Batmanghelidjh","Children","Society","Iain Duncan Smith","Politics","UK news","Conservatives","Poverty","Social exclusion"],"tags":[{"id":"society/camilabatmanghelidjh","webTitle":"Camila Batmanghelidjh"},{"id":"society/children","webTitle":"Children"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"politics/iain-duncan-smith","webTitle":"Iain Duncan Smith"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"society/poverty","webTitle":"Poverty"},{"id":"society/socialexclusion","webTitle":"Social exclusion"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Amelia Gentleman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ameliagentleman"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#005689","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#005689","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#63717a","colourPalette":"analysis"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/03/kids-company-charities-austerity-camila-batmanghelidjh-government-cuts","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ac7k","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jul/03/kids-company-charities-austerity-camila-batmanghelidjh-government-cuts","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/03/kids-company-charities-austerity-camila-batmanghelidjh-government-cuts"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435943119336/1f2c92cc-40c6-4f8b-8100-7174fa004e59-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kids Company founder Camila Batmanghelidjh  attends a ‘big society’ chaired by David Cameron at Downing Street in 2010.

The next day the competitors will do the same again.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73cc56732d2f459bdf2bccc543070b43b3db1bd8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435930822956/cf5ded13-ed90-4c35-aff8-7b7e50a76e80-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A still from X+Y.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">2014 film X+Y tells the story of a maths prodigy falling in love at the International Maths Olympiad</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“The time flies,” says Joe. “You sit there and you think. You have an idea and you try it and you work from there. There’s some anxiety, but that comes mostly after you’ve sat the exams and you’re waiting for the results.”</p> \n<p>Joe’s state primary school worked hard to keep up with his appetite for maths; his secondary, St Paul’s independent school in Barnes, south-east London, has an established tradition of entering pupils in maths competitions. </p> \n<p>His gift was soon spotted by the <a href=\"http://www.ukmt.org.uk/\">UK Mathematics Trust</a>, which runs contests in schools to scout for talent, and when Joe was 14 he enrolled in a summer camp for exceptionally talented young mathematicians.<br /></p> \n<p>Since then he has attended training camps and last year he was chosen to represent the UK at the IMO in Cape Town, where he won a silver medal as part of a team that came 20th overall (the top three was China, USA and Taiwan).</p> \n<p>“There are obviously countries that are stronger – China, America, Russia,” Joe says philosophically. “It’s natural because of the population size and they put a lot more effort into it as nations.”</p> \n<p>This year Joe, whose father works for IBM and whose mother is a geneticist, is hoping for gold. “It always works best when you’re enjoying it,” he says. In the runup he’s been doing one or two problems a day, gradually building up as the competition approaches.</p> \n<p>“Sometimes I sit at my desk. Sometimes I lie on my bed and stare at the ceiling, trying to think. Sometimes I watch the TV and I’m thinking.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ff22a29aa169f6ad6f6c7de857aea4e4a3f578e9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435932711929/f6194e02-69e2-4d88-8264-ed01c3cb012b-265x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Joe Benton\" width=\"265\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benton’s primary school worked hard to keep up with his appetite for maths.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Last year, the little-known world of the IMO was the backdrop for a well-reviewed feature film, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/mar/12/x-plus-y-charming-story-of-mathletes-in-love\">X+Y</a>, starring Asa Butterfield as a mathematics prodigy who has difficulty understanding people but is very good with numbers. He represents the UK at the IMO, during which there’s a romantic encounter with a fellow competitor, a Chinese girl called Zhang Mei.</p> \n<p>The film triggered much debate among the world’s best young mathematicians, both for its portrayal of a gifted young “mathlete” on the autistic spectrum and its love interest. In reality “there’s not much romance”, says Joe’s teammate Warren Li, 17, an IMO veteran with two competitions under his belt.</p> \n<p>Indeed, there aren’t many girls. Only 10% of all competitors are female, a situation that organisers are trying to address with the launch of girls-only international contests such as the <a href=\"https://www.egmo.org/\">European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad</a>.</p> \n<p>It’s not because of a lack of female talent, says the UK team leader Dr Geoff Smith, of Bath University (played by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/02/eddie-marsan-interview\">Eddie Marsan</a> in the film). “Girls can do this. Sometimes the best young mathematician in the world is a girl.”</p> \n<p>Lisa Sauermann, from Germany, was the most successful participant in the 2011 IMO and currently ranked second in the <a href=\"https://www.imo-official.org/hall.aspx\">IMO hall of fame</a>; last year <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2014/aug/13/fields-medal-mathematics-prize-woman-maryam-mirzakhani\">Maryam Mirzakhani</a>, an Iranian former IMO gold medal winner and now a maths professor, became the first woman to win the world’s most prestigious mathematics prize, the Fields Medal.</p> \n<p>On the film’s portrayal of maths prodigies, Smith says: “There has been a natural concern in the maths community that portraying some mathematicians as being less than socially fluent is dangerous, because it could lead to the misapprehension that mathematicians are all strange.</p> \n<p>“My personal view is that the prefix ‘mis’ in the previous sentence can be deleted. All mathematicians are strange because they place such an exceptional value on thought, ideas and understanding. I think that the maths community should be proud of the way it embraces people on the basis of their enthusiasm for, and interest in, mathematics.</p> \n<p>“Most students are relaxed and outgoing, with the full set of skills that allow them to prosper in the teenage social maelstrom. Some others are not, but everyone gets along almost all of the time, united by a passion for ideas and ingenuity.”</p> \n<p>Each year the UK team is made up of students from a mix of state and independent schools, selective and non-selective. Despite concern among politicians about the overall maths performance of UK pupils in international <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2013/dec/03/uk-students-education-oecd-pisa-report\">Pisa tests</a> (Britain ranked 26th in maths out of 65 countries most recently), we hold our own in the IMO.</p> \n<p>“For our population, we do reasonably well,” says Smith. “The south-east Asian teams tend to dominate. In the last 10 years China, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Taiwan have been very strong. Kids there are expected to put a lot more effort into their school work and academic achievement is more highly prized. Europeans have made a cultural decision that they don’t want to do that. Their idea of childhood is much less driven.”</p> \n<p>Smith says the diligence required to master a GCSE or A-level syllabus in maths bears little relation to the sort of creativity and brilliant insight required to excel in an IMO competition. “You can’t teach that,” he says.<br /></p> \n<p>“The kids who eventually make the IMO team, they are so smart they stand out like a sore thumb when they are 12, 13 or 14. It’s like the difference between being an Olympic swimmer and being able to do a width.”</p> \n<p>Warren Li is definitely an “Olympic swimmer” and among the UK’s best hopes for a gold this year. He aimed for gold last year but just missed out. The other team members are Lawrence Hollom, Samuel Kittle, Neel Nanda and Harvey Yau.<br /></p> \n<p>“I was probably not as well prepared as I could have been,” says Warren, who studied at a York comprehensive before moving to Eton for sixth form. “This year, I’m aiming for gold again, and this time I’m the most experienced member of the UK team. Maybe I feel a little pressure to be the best. But I really enjoy the whole process. It’s actually fun.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3c7026b29425bc83710691876e652f489ca1296e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435933637657/22cfbd54-eccf-4499-b0e0-dfa54456d5bc-460x426.jpeg\" alt=\"Maths\" width=\"460\" height=\"426\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Are you a maths genius?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Two IMO sample problems</h2> \n<p>The first was used at the IMO in 2001 and is free of the maths jargon that can hinder non-mathematicians (on the IMO website <a href=\"http://imof.co/mathematics/sample-problems/\">here</a>):</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><em>21 girls and 21 boys took part in a mathematical contest.<br /></em><em>(i) Each contestant solved at most six problems.<br /></em><em>(ii) For each girl and each boy, at least one problem was solved by both of them.<br /></em><em>Prove that there was a problem that was solved by at least three girls and at least </em><em>three boys.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>And another from 2014 that uses more technical terms (on the IMO website <a href=\"http://imof.co/mathematics/sample-problems/\">here</a>):<br /></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><em>Let <strong>n&sup2;</strong> be an integer.

He also signalled his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/03/patients-charged-missed-nhs-appointments-jeremy-hunt\">potential interest in charging for missed appointments</a>.</p> \n<p>“We are very stretched for resources,” he said. “Doctors and nurses work incredibly hard and we are going to have a million more over-70s by the end of this parliament.
