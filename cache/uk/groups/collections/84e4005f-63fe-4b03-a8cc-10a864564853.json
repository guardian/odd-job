He will also warn that threats are likely to come from cyberspace.</p> \n<p>The prime minister discussed his views with the defence chiefs last week after the budget, and on Monday he will visit RAF Waddington, from where Reaper drone missions are flown over Iraq and Syria.</p> \n<p>On the visit, Cameron will say: “Now we know how much we will spend, what matters next is how we spend it. I have tasked the defence and security chiefs to look specifically at how we do more to counter the threat posed by Isil [Islamic State] and Islamist extremism.</p> \n<p>“This could include more spy planes, drones and special forces. In the last five years, I have seen just how vital these assets are in keeping us safe.” </p> \n<p>The visit will underline his determination to show that, although Britain is not yet involved in the air strikes under way in Syria due to the Commons vote to reject British involvement in 2013, the RAF is still active over the skies of Syria, providing air-to-air refuelling and surveillance assistance.</p> \n<p>Cameron has also signalled he is asking the interim Labour leader, Harriet Harman, and the shadow defence secretary, Vernon Coaker, to attend a meeting of the National Security Council to be briefed about the military position in Syria. </p> \n<p>The invitation is a further sign that Cameron wants to ask the Commons again to allow British air strikes in Syria. Labour, which already supports UK air strikes in Iraq, is shifting its thinking but is still doubtful that Cameron has a clear strategy. Britain opposes both chief protagonists in Syria – the president, Bashar al-Assad, and Isis, based in Raqqa. No government request to Labour will come at least until after the Labour leadership election is over in mid-September.</p> \n<p>Downing Street believes Russia is open to persuasion that Assad is no longer worth protecting, and could yet back a peaceful transition to a broad-based coalition. However, the UK has proved wrongly optimistic about Vladimir Putin’s willingness to abandon Assad in the past.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fc3d98869fec1e78785bfbb2c500d683aea66d43/0_96_5616_3366/5616.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3366,"width":5616,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Sillitoe for the Guardian","altText":"David Cameron will visit RAF Waddington, from where Reaper drone missions are flown over Iraq and Syria, on Monday.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-13T06:57:21Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T06:57:23Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":284,"contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Wintour","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/4/1423058528318/Patrick-Wintour-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patrickwintour"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["David Cameron","Defence policy","Syria","Islamic State","UK news","Politics"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"politics/defence","webTitle":"Defence policy"},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria"},{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Patrick Wintour","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/patrickwintour"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jul/13/david-cameron-drones-special-forces-top-defence-shopping-list","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4atb3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jul/13/david-cameron-drones-special-forces-top-defence-shopping-list","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/13/david-cameron-drones-special-forces-top-defence-shopping-list"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fc3d98869fec1e78785bfbb2c500d683aea66d43/0_96_5616_3366/5616.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3366,"width":5616,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"David Cameron will visit RAF Waddington, from where Reaper drone missions are flown over Iraq and Syria, on Monday.

Faced with a productivity puzzle that has seen the UK’s output per hour fail to match economic growth, he also announced a productivity plan to put the recovery on a firmer footing. </p> \n<p>But the CBI says skills shortages have already started to bite and warns that sectors seen as key by ministers are particularly hard-pressed, according to its annual skills survey. </p> \n<p>“The government has set out its stall to create a high-skilled economy, but firms are facing a skills emergency now, threatening to starve economic growth,” said the CBI deputy director general, Katja Hall.</p> \n<p>“Worryingly, it’s those high-growth, high-value sectors with the most potential which are the ones under most pressure. That includes construction, manufacturing, science, engineering and technology.”<br /></p> \n<p>Two in three businesses expect to need more staff with higher level skills in the years ahead, but more than half of those surveyed, or 55%, fear that they will not be able to find them, according to the CBI’s poll, which was carried out with the publisher Pearson. <br /></p> \n<h2>Rising skills demand in key sectors</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"026d93f2eaf4e89858ca6aa852f01c43644ce7ea\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436705396482/31aa10d1-8be2-4bac-8a1e-b05523a2d85e-393x420.png\" alt=\"Rising demand\" width=\"393\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The CBI says its survey shows rising demand for higher skilled workers in sectors key to rebalancing the UK economy.

A net balance of 73% of construction companies and 69% of manufacturers said their demand for high-skilled staff was rising.</p> \n<p>Business groups have repeatedly warned that tackling the UK’s skills shortage is key to kickstarting productivity growth in the UK after years of lagging behind most other big economies. The CBI believes more apprenticeships will help but it criticises a plan in Osborne’s budget for a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/08/chancellor-hands-businesses-66bn-in-tax-cuts-and-giveaways\">levy on large firms to pay for training and create 3m apprenticeships by 2020</a>.</p> \n<p> “The new levy announced in the budget may guarantee funding for more apprenticeships, but it’s unlikely to equate to higher quality or deliver the skills that industry needs,” said Hall.</p> \n<p>Renewed evidence of skills shortages will provide more food for thought for Bank of England policymakers as they assess the pressure on inflation from wages. The nine members of the Bank’s monetary policy committee appear divided over the likely path of pay growth and the implications for when they should raise interest rates from the current record low of 0.5%.<br /></p> \n<p>The Bank’s chief economist, Andy Haldane, has said he needs more evidence of pay growth picking up before worrying about inflation. He warned last month that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/29/interest-rates-rise-could-derail-recovery-bank-of-england-economist-warns\">raising interest rates too soon could tip the UK back into recession</a>.</p> \n<p>But his fellow policymaker Martin Weale believes <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/24/uk-britain-boe-weale-idUKKBN0P40H320150624\">the labour market is “fizzing away nicely”</a> and wages have picked up faster than expected. Weale, who voted for rate rises last year, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/696ee142-19c2-11e5-8201-cbdb03d71480.html#axzz3fg2CnGCb\">suggested in an interview with the Financial Times</a> that the Bank should be ready to raise rates as soon as August.</p> \n<p>For now, economists expect inflation to remain well below the Bank’s target and so there will be little pressure to end the period of ultra-low borrowing costs ushered in by the financial crisis more than six years ago. Markets are not pricing in a rate rise until well into 2016.</p> \n<h2>Zero inflation</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc12ef7391976df6486363656f0e909bc5a3025d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436705599534/e3e26db1-241d-4c6b-b41d-a7105bbb3751-460x317.png\" alt=\"Economists expect inflation at zero in June\" width=\"460\" height=\"317\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inflation, shown here on the CPI measure, already fell below zero in April and economists say official figures this week may well show it headed back into negative territory in June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office for National Statistics</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Official figures on Tuesday are expected to show inflation on the consumer price index (CPI) measure dipping back to zero in June, from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/16/inflation-returns-to-uk-as-airline-tickets-and-petrol-prices-rise\">0.1% in May</a>.

Whittingdale believes the BBC is breaching its charter principles by claiming it needs to go after 90% of viewers. <br /></p> \n<p>Whittingdale will be advised by a panel of experts, including former Channel 5 chair and chief executive Dawn Airey, some of whom have been critical of the corporation in the past.</p> \n<p>The review comes after the BBC last week won a commitment in principle to retain the licence fee as the chief means of funding the corporation for at least another five years.</p> \n<p>However, as part of George Osborne’s summer budget, the broadcaster is to be forced to take on <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/06/bbc-pay-cost-free-tv-licences-over-75s-fee-deal\">the cost of free licences for the over-75s</a>. In return for the BBC taking on that cost, which is currently borne by the taxpayer, the government has confirmed that the licence fee funding mechanism would be retained until 2020 at least.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/06/bbc-pay-cost-free-tv-licences-over-75s-fee-deal\">BBC to take on &pound;750m cost of subsidy for over-75s in licence fee deal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Last week, Whittingdale also made a commitment to allow the licence fee – frozen at &pound;145.50 a year since 2010 – to rise in line with inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index. CPI rose by 0.1% in the year to May 2015.</p> \n<p>But a CPI-linked licence fee is dependent on whether the review of the BBC charter concludes that the corporation should broadly continue with its existing remit and scope and undertakes efficiency savings at least equivalent to those across the public sector.</p> \n<p>The BBC’s existing charter, which is negotiated with the government every 10 years, runs out at the end of 2016.</p> \n<p>Government sources said the issue of the licence fee had probably been broadly settled but that the future size of the BBC might have an impact on how fast the fee continued to rise, or indeed whether it should be scrapped after 2020 and funded through a household tax or charges for subscription services.</p> \n<p>The green paper will explore those alternative funding methods. It will also suggest that the BBC website should be scaled back, a point raised in the past by Osborne. The chancellor has been concerned that the breadth of the free-to-use BBC website destroys the competition in regional newspapers. The BBC is now offering to be a site for local news bloggers.</p> \n<p>The charter review will look at the political impartiality of the BBC news coverage and will question whether the corporation’s news fulfils its obligation to be impartial. It will also examine whether more of the broadcaster’s output should be independently produced and will consider the future of BBC Worldwide – the corporation’s commercial arm. The review is almost certain to recommend scrapping the BBC Trust, arguing that the oversight body should not be housed within the corporation.</p> \n<p>Sajid Javid, the business secretary and former culture secretary, told BBC 1’s Andrew Marr Show: “The reforms introduced last week were not dissimilar to the review in 2010 about how much the BBC could absorb within its own income.</p> \n<p>“The review would look at issues such as the BBC’s internet capabilities. The review will need to take into account feedback from all stakeholders.”</p> \n<p>Javid refused to be drawn on whether he wanted a smaller BBC, while Downing Street sources said the key was to drive up quality. </p> \n<p>The shadow education secretary, Tristam Hunt, speaking on the same show, described the review as an unpatriotic attack on what he said was a “great British institution”.</p> \n<p>A senior BBC source said: “Let’s see what the green paper says, but the BBC doesn’t nakedly chase viewers, but we do seek to make the good popular, and the popular good. Research has shown that an element of competition drives up quality across the industry. The voice of the public will be key and they will have their own view about the merits of BBC programmes like Strictly and Sherlock.</p> \n<p>“In a world where broadcasting is increasingly global, it is important for Britain that we have a strong, vibrant and successful creative sector and the BBC has been a key driver of delivering that. A key test for the green paper is whether it enhances or diminishes that status. The BBC is a British global success story. If we get this wrong, in 10 years’ time it will no longer be.”</p> \n<p>The expert panel is part of plans to deliver a transparent open and democratic BBC charter review, the government said. Those on the panel are to bring their personal experience and and expertise on policy debates to bear.</p> \n<p>As well as Airey, now senior vice-president of Yahoo business in Europe and the Middle East, the panel includes Dame Colette Bowe, the former chairwoman of the regulator Ofcom.</p> \n<p>Airey has previously called for the licence fee to be cut and for the BBC to consider charging for its online output. Charging for output was extended in principle when the broadcaster was granted the right to charge for use of its BBC iPlayer service via a licence fee as part of last week’s funding deal. The BBC has been losing income as more viewers use the iPlayer service to watch recorded output, freeing them from obligation to pay the licence fee.</p> \n<p>Bowe, in a speech before she stepped down from her Ofcom role this year, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2014/feb/14/ofcom-bbc-licence-fee-shared-other-broadcasters\">said she had sympathy with the idea of making some BBC licence fee money “contestable”</a>, with other media companies allowed to bid to make public service broadcasting programming.</p> \n<p>Whittingdale defended the composure of the panel: “Each member of the independent advisory group brings individual skills, experience and expertise. Together they will contribute to the oversight of the government’s review of the BBC royal charter. I look forward to working with them on this important issue.”</p> \n<p>The panel will meet at least six times and send advice to ministers, but will not take policy decisions on behalf of government.</p> \n<p>Its other members are: Andrew Fisher, chief executive of music service Shazam; Darren Henley, chief executive of Arts Council England and managing director of Classic FM; Ashley Highfield, chief executive of regional newspaper group Johnston Press and a former BBC director of new media and technology; Alex Mahon, former chief executive of MasterChef and Broadchurch producer Shine Group; digital entrepreneur Lopa Patel; and Stewart Purvis, a former chief executive and editor-in-chief of ITN.</p> \n<p>The former acting chair of the BBC Trust Diane Coyle said the government’s decision to appoint the panel before announcing plans to consult the public suggested it had already decided to mount a “fundamental attack on the scope of the BBC”.</p> \n<p>Seh added: “One of the really odd things about this is that nobody appears to be talking about how to involve the public. You wonder whether it’s because they’ve already announced their own minds before consultation has taken place.</p> \n<p>“It’s very hard to avoid the suspicion that this is a fundamental attack on the scope of the BBC. If not the government should move very quickly to allay that impression.”</p> \n<p>Coyle called on the government to make sure it consulted a wide variety of stakeholders from the creative sector, including the music industry and smaller independent producers. </p> \n<p>She added: “Anybody oversees finds it inexplicable that we have this amazing national assert and it seems to be constantly under attack from the government and the rest of the industry. </p> \n<p>“It’s absolutely gobsmacking to those who look with envy at the health and quality of the British sector and the amazing things the BBC does to the reputation of the UK as a whole. It seems public interest is the last thing to get a look in in this debate.”</p> \n<p>The BBC director general, Tony Hall, put a brave face on last week’s funding deal, saying it gave the corporation “financial stability and the ability to plan for the future”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/12/bbc-perfectly-set-up-future-challenges\">The BBC is perfectly set up for future challenges | Tony Hall</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/12/bbc-perfectly-set-up-future-challenges\">writing in the Observer on Sunday, he</a> said the negotiation process should not happen again.</p> \n<p>“Although the BBC used this pre-budget window of opportunity to reach a fair deal, it is not a process we would have chosen and it is not a process that should be repeated,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>Hall said he believed that the debate about the BBC’s scale and funding should be taken out of the political sphere during future negotiations.</p> \n<p>The BBC objected to the speed of the negotiations and the lack of warning before the reforms were announced.</p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0cb0abbafcad4acba5b888583d8846b4cbc4506b/0_90_2577_1549/2577.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1549,"width":2577,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"ANL/Rex","altText":"The BBC director general, Lord Hall.

On the basis of that, we said we couldn’t endorse the process but we could endorse the broad financial framework.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There has to be an open process with public consultation before any licence fee funding is used for government projects</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The trust will call for the length of the next charter period to be changed from the current 10 years to avoid the short time between the appointment of a new government and the end of charter review. The current BBC charter runs to the end of 2016, just 19 months after the election. “That’s another reform, the time period. We’ve had a 10-year charter this time but now that we have got fixed-term parliaments, 18 months too short.”</p> \n<p>Fairhead said the latest deal was “legitimate” four days after it was announced, partly because it followed a precedent of the government using the licence fee for political purposes such as paying for the over-75s in the first place. “The BBC needs to keep control of its funding. There is a risk of a chilling effect if the government can use licence fee payers’ money to fund government projects.”<br /></p> \n<p>Privately, BBC Trust officials suggest they felt their hands were tied when approached by the government to accept the financial cost of free licences as the precedent of using the licence fee for other government schemes had already been set.

There seems to be lack of accountability, transparency and a pig-headed attitude that they can do no wrong.”</p> \n<p>“They have been continually tested and continually failed when people have tried to hold them to account, whether it’s been the case of [police carrying] guns on the street, stop and search or simply being asked to answer questions in the case of Sheku Bayok, their kneejerk response is to circle the wagons.”</p> \n<p> Bayoh, a gas engineer and father of two, died of suspected asphyxia after he was detained by up to nine officers who were responding to reports he had brandished a knife and attacked cars in Kirkcaldy, Fife. </p> \n<p>Anwar said: “Police Scotland is the most powerful organisation in Scotland.

She says she fell in love with him after he invited her to stay on his canal boat in Nottingham the following month. She adds that Kennedy had to “go deliberately out of his way to make and sustain” his relationship with her as she lived some distance from Nottingham.

The spokesman said: “If he was not adequately dressed, you could infer that he would not have been let in, but we do not comment on our guests. If he came without a jacket, tie or shoes, he would have had two choices – not staying, or going to get some extra stuff.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/12/novak-djokovic-roger-federer-wimbledon-2015-final\">Novak Djokovic beats Roger Federer in four sets in Wimbledon final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Hollywood stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Bradley Cooper and Hugh Grant were in the royal box to watch the highly anticipated men’s final, which Djokovic won in four sets.
