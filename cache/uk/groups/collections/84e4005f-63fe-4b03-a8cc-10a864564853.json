Thomas Cook have not contacted them about this,” she said, adding that the family have been supporting a particular children’s charity to which relatives and friends have been donating in Bobby and Christi’s memory.</p> \n<p>Thomas Cook’s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, said on Monday his company had handed over the full amount of compensation they received to Unicef. “Thomas Cook has not in any way profited from our claim against the hotel owner. In late 2012 we brought a claim against the hotelier for breaching their contract to provide safe accommodation to our customers and to comply with all applicable laws, which was decided in our favour.</p> \n<p> “Today I have made arrangements for the full amount – &pound;1.5m – to be donated in full to Unicef, the world’s leading children’s organisation. I believe this is the right thing to do and I apologise to the family for all they have gone through.”</p> \n<p>Fankhauser confirmed that his firm received the &pound;1.5m, mainly in respect of legal fees, as part of a &pound;3m settlement with Louis Group, the South African family-owned multinational that controls the Louis Corcyra hotel. The other &pound;1.5m went to Thomas Cook’s insurers.<br /></p> \n<p>Wood said the family was “incensed” and they had received only about a tenth of the &pound;3m payout. “It seems our children’s lives are worth only a fraction of Thomas Cook’s reputation,” she said.</p> \n<p>Bobby and Christi, from Horbury, Wakefield, were found dead in a bungalow in the grounds of the hotel where they were staying with their father and his partner, now wife, Ruth, in October 2006. The couple were with Christi and Bobby when the incident took place and were found unconscious next to the children.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Their feeling is that this once more is not about them, it’s about Thomas Cook.

The issue of safety is absolutely paramount, especially when the base is so close to a major centre of population.”</p> \n<p>The newly elected MP added that he would write to Fallon to demand an investigation into the allegations, which he said “appear to confirm many concerns that have already been reported”, including those raised by the SNP Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, in a number of written questions in the Commons. </p> \n<p>The MP spoke as a second Royal Navy whistleblower came forward to warn of security lapses in the service, saying that he found the allegations made by McNeilly to be persuasive. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a88199848d7429a063e9ed47be506258c3b1571\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431968210780/fdb6e1b3-6689-40c4-90fa-27a3e0837a06-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Able Seaman William McNeilly.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Able Seaman William McNeilly.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The police and the navy launched a hunt for McNeilly, 25, when he went absent without leave from the Faslane naval base last week after publishing his report, The Nuclear Secrets, online.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://wikileaks.org/trident-safety/\">In the 18-page dossier</a>, McNeilly claimed that it was more difficult to get into some nightclubs than to gain access to Britain’s nuclear programme facility. Referring to a chronic shortage of personnel, he suggested that it was “a matter of time before we’re infiltrated by a psychopath or a terrorist”.</p> \n<p> McNeilly said he was preparing to hand himself in to police on Monday afternoon after being on the run since last week. In a Facebook statement posted on Monday morning he told supporters: “There’s nothing I can do from prison; whatever happens now is up to you and the government.”</p> \n<p>On Monday a former Royal Navy communications and information technology specialist said that McNeilly’s actions inspired him to speak out for the first time about the security lapses he saw while serving.</p> \n<p>Euan Bryson, 25, told the Guardian that McNeilly’s concerns about security breaches “rang true from my experience”. He described how a shipmate routinely used a blue bank card to get past security into his base after losing his Royal Navy identity card on a night out.</p> \n<p>Bryson, who served on HMS Ark Royal and HMS Illustrious and was based at Faslane before leaving the service in 2013, said there were “manning issues” across the board meaning that relatively junior employees were often tasked to do jobs they did not have the security training or clearance to carry out.</p> \n<p>“I made my thoughts clear when I served, including when I handed in my resignation notice. The chain of command system has failed. If McNeilly felt ignored what other option did he have? You join to serve the country but if you feel your job is not serving it then you have an option to speak out.”</p> \n<p>But, as the Ministry of Defence launched its own investigation into the allegations, senior members of the Royal Navy community sought to cast doubt on McNeilly’s claims. Peter Roberts, a former Royal Navy warfare officer who retired last year after 23 years’ service, said the report contained a number of basic factual errors, from McNeilly’s use of jargon to the safe diving level for submarines.</p> \n<p>“Most of his claims about on board the submarines are factually incorrect and there’s a degree of sensationalism. For that reason I can’t place too much weight on it,” he said.</p> \n<p>Roberts, who is now a senior researcher at the Royal United Services Institute thinktank, said he did not think the allegations warranted a high-level Ministry of Defence investigation but that a local inquiry into security at Faslane may be necessary.</p> \n<p>McNeilly, a newly qualified engineer from Newtonabbey near Belfast, now faces a substantial jail term if he is prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act 1989.</p> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/ministry-of-defence-crown-office-don-t-prosecute-the-trident-whistle-blower\">online petition</a> against his prosecution has amassed more than 1,500 signatories since it was launched on Sunday.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/18/trident-submarine-whistleblower-william-mcneilly-to-turn-himself-in\">Trident submarine whistleblower to turn himself in to police</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Dee McLoughlin, who grew up with McNeilly in Newtonabbey, insisted that his friend was “not the type to make things up”. McLoughlin told the Guardian: “He’s a pretty leval-headed person and I know how much he loved his job in the navy. I honestly couldn’t see him throwing it away unless it was for a good reason.”</p> \n<p>McNeilly, who said he was on patrol with HMS Victorious from January to April, accused navy bosses of covering up a collision between HMS Vanguard and a French submarine in the Atlantic Ocean in February 2009.<br /></p> \n<p>At the time, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2009/feb/16/nuclear-submarines-collide\">MoD officials played down the incident</a> and said the Vanguard had sustained only “scrapes”. But McNeilly said in his report that a navy chief who was on board at the time told him afterwards: “We thought, this is it – we’re all going to die.”</p> \n<p>The more senior submariner allegedly told McNeilly that the French vessel “took a massive chunk out of the front of HMS Vanguard” and grazed the side of the boat. Bottles of high-pressured air came loose in the collision, he claimed, and the British submarine had to return slowly to Faslane to prevent them from exploding.</p> \n<p>McNeilly went on to describe how HMS Vanguard’s missile compartment doubled up as a gym, leading to potentially disastrous mishaps when seamen dropped weights near the boat’s missile firing system.</p> \n<p>He said he raised these and other concerns through the chain of command on multiple occasions, but that “not once did someone even attempt to make a change”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/18/trident-whistleblower-needs-to-be-listened-to-nuclear-submarine\">Trident whistleblower needs to be listened to, even if he is exaggerating</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>MoD officials sought to downplay the allegations on Monday. A Royal Navy spokeswoman said the service disagreed with McNeilly’s assessment and described the report as containing “a number of subjective and unsubstantiated personal views”.</p> \n<p>But in his Facebook statement, McNeilly countered: “Responding by downplaying a report because there’s lack of seniority, acting like your security system is impenetrable and your aged system is still in excellent condition for sailing, is not an adequate response.”</p> \n<p>He explained that he had moved between countries and changed location every day since going on the run, but that he now “lacks the resources to remain undercover”.</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/1f81d47731b89eddd40f2ba454d8361d59aa552b/0_2394_2703_1621/2703.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1621,"width":2703,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Royal Navy submariners on HMS Victorious off the west coast of Scotland.

People knew how we wanted to stop exploitation in the workplace, but not how we’d grow our workplaces to create more jobs and stronger growth. They knew we wanted to stop consumers being ripped off, but weren’t convinced we also wanted businesses to grow and flourish. We can’t let that happen again.<br /></p> \n<p>“There will be dialogue and discussions about what works, rather than rude surprises that backfire.</p> \n<p>“We can’t be set against the government’s recent cut in corporation tax for the future.

He said he expected the inflation rate to hit its 2% target in a couple of years.</p> \n<p>Fifty years ago the retail prices index plummeted in response to commodity price falls, giving brief respite to British workers familiar with inflationary pressures that were largely absent from the continent and the US. Later in the 1960s, after several years of full employment, inflation became entrenched. In the 1970s it reached 25% before falling back during a period of austerity and was only tamed in the 1980s.</p> \n<p>Currently inflationary pressures are once again largely absent across the world, with both the US and eurozone reporting zero inflation rates.</p> \n<p>Tombs said the figure for April would be the best chance of a negative figure for UK inflation and was likely to mark the low point.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"inflation graphic\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1431972219145/CPI-chart-WEB.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>“The ONS figures this year will not capture Easter spending in the way they did last year. It’s a timing effect that means April is the best chance for a negative figure. </p> \n<p>“But there won’t be a sudden rise in inflation. It will rise steadily for the rest of the year and into 2016.”</p> \n<p>Tombs expects wages to continue rising this year, maintaining the differential with inflation and protecting real wage growth. He said he expected wage growth to plateau at around 3% in 2016, severely limiting real-terms rises in living standards if price inflation has reached 2%.</p> \n<p>But several surveys have shown that Britain’s workers expect employers to block big pay rises. The most recent household survey by financial data provider Markit found that households on average expected no more than a 1% pay rise this year. </p> \n<p>If this forecast is borne out, the rise in household incomes would go into reverse once inflation tops 1%, and some economists expect that threshold to be reached this year. </p> \n<p>Answering questions about the Bank’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/may/13/mark-carney-depart-bank-2018-interest-rates\">quarterly Inflation Report last week</a>, Carney stressed that a temporary period of falling prices should not be mistaken for a damaging spiral of “deflation”.</p> \n<p>He said “persistent headwinds” continued to hold back the British economy in the wake of the financial crisis, including weak global demand, the austerity squeeze on government spending and private firms cutting back their debts. <br /></p> \n<p>He reiterated the view of the rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) that inflation was likely to remain subdued and this would mean a more gradual pace of rate rises than in the past, as well as rates remaining “below historical levels for some time to come”. <br /></p> \n<p>Rates would rise to just 1.4% by the middle of 2018 according to market expectations, which the Bank said were in line with it meeting its 2% inflation target. <br /></p> \n<p>Addressing concerns that rising inflation would eat into real wages, Carney said: “Wages have grown by around 2% in the past year – less than half the average rate before the global financial crisis – and the key risk is that these subdued growth rates continue.” <br /></p> \n<p>Guy Foster, head of research at stockbroker Brewin Dolphin said flat or negative inflation would be largely ignored by consumers already seeing higher petrol prices at the pumps.</p> \n<p>“Consumers are noticing that petrol, whilst still cheaper than a year ago, is not as cheap as it was in January,” said.</p> \n<p>He warned that the feelgood factor of the last six months could wane as consumers feel the pinch from higher weekly costs</p> \n<p>Average shop prices on the other hand are still falling.

In all other jails, category A prisoners are dispersed among the rest of the population so they can have a near normal regime.</p> \n<p>The facility in Belmarsh was opened to hold the most dangerous prisoners in Britain. In the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, it was used to hold suspects in indefinite detention under a regime that was subsequently declared illegal.</p> \n<p>An official inspection in 2013 described the conditions within the unit as bleak and oppressive with a highly restrictive regime. In his report on the latest inspection, which was carried out in February, Hardwick said the environment in the high secure unit remained limited and the regime poor, which meant prisoners had few opportunities to interact with others and was inferior to what was available in the rest of the prison.</p> \n<p>Hardwick said this was having a negative impact on the health and wellbeing of the 10 prisoners being held in the unit at the time of the inspection in February and those held for the longest periods had been particularly affected. One man has been held there for more than four years.</p> \n<p>“No evidence was offered to us as to why the men who were held in the high secure unit at the time of this inspection could not be managed safely on the main wings as similar men are managed in other prisons,” said Hardwick. “The role and function of the high secure unit needs fundamental review.”</p> \n<p>The report says that the unit had recently been refurbished, but the overall environment, especially the shower areas, remained poor: “The upper spurs had sufficient natural light, but lower spurs were much darker. Outside exercise areas remained caged and austere … Since our previous visit, prisoners from the unit had been allowed to play football outside on one occasion and it was unclear why they could not do so more regularly.”</p> \n<p>The chief inspector said the rest of Belmarsh was much improved since his previous inspection and the changes had been achieved without compromising security: “The prison needed to do more to understand levels of violence and fears about safety, especially among minority groups,” adds the report.</p> \n<p>It notes that violence linked to gangs and terror-related offences meant that Muslim prisoners and those from black and ethnic minority backgrounds felt less safe than other inmates.</p> \n<p>Michael Spurr, the chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, said: “The prison holds some very dangerous individuals but the governor and his team have worked hard to improve outcomes for prisoners whilst maintaining the security levels necessary to prevent escape and keep the public safe.”</p> \n<p>A report on probation privatisation from the new chief inspector of probation, Paul Wilson, presents a mixed picture of the government’s “transforming rehabilitation” programme.</p> \n<p>It says that many of the challenges identified in a previous report remain with particular unresolved problems about the IT system and staff doubts about the value of a tool used to identify those offenders at risk of serious recidivism.</p> \n<p>But Wilson said most probation supervision cases were being allocated between the private and public sectors in a timely way and swift action was being taken in cases where it was considered the risk to the public had escalated.</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/be2dacbd5d5f3f3b512ec52db80e1df3eb9e38e7/0_139_3328_1998/3328.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1998,"width":3328,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ireland//Rex_Shutterstock","altText":"Prison dog handler guards patrol the perimeter HM Prison Belmarsh category A high security jail.
