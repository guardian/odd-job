The truth is, a strong Labour party occupying the centre ground operates a gravitational pull from both left and right.”<br /></p> \n<p>Blair’s comments came as his former director of communications and strategy, Alastair Campbell, pledged to “happily lead the charge” to oust Labour’s next leader if they failed to perform.</p> \n<p>He told the Times: “I’m not going to back anybody publicly … But if in three years’ time they’re not winning and they’re not cutting it, and it is obvious we are not going to get close to winning an election, I will not bite my tongue and I will encourage others not to bite their tongues. </p> \n<p>Campbell, who became increasingly involved in the final weeks of the general election campaign and attended meetings with Ed Miliband’s inner circle, called on the winner of the Labour leadership contest to hold a confidence vote before 2020 to prove they still had the party’s backing.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4a3a13dff1e0937d9eb49c7dcb70056630464d9b/0_206_4256_2554/4256.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2554,"width":4256,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lucy Young/REX Shutterstock/Lucy Young/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Mandatory Credit: Photo by Lucy Young/REX Shutterstock (1774594j)\r\nTony Blair\r\nTony Blair in London, Britain - 27 Jun 2012","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Lucy Young/REX Shutterstock/Lucy Young/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-10T23:48:31Z","lastModified":"2015-06-11T00:43:12Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":653,"contributors":[{"name":"Ben Quinn","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/benquinn"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Labour party leadership","Labour","Tony Blair","Alastair Campbell","Politics","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/labourleadership","webTitle":"Labour party leadership"},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour"},{"id":"politics/tonyblair","webTitle":"Tony Blair"},{"id":"politics/alastaircampbell","webTitle":"Alastair Campbell"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ben Quinn","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/benquinn"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/11/tony-blair-warns-against-labour-move-to-the-left","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49y2x","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jun/11/tony-blair-warns-against-labour-move-to-the-left","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/11/tony-blair-warns-against-labour-move-to-the-left"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4a3a13dff1e0937d9eb49c7dcb70056630464d9b/0_206_4256_2554/4256.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2554,"width":4256,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tony Blair says: ‘The public always looks for a leader who is going to lead the country and can rise above their party’.

She added, however, that more detail was needed on what precisely the chancellor was proposing.</p> \n<p>She said: “Labour should never be in favour of budget deficits for the sake of it. I have no problem aiming for a surplus. We must learn the lessons of what happened after the 2010 election and make sure our economic policy is defined by us and not by the Conservatives. </p> \n<p>“We lost the last election because we were not trusted with the economy or with taxes and this time we have to be crystal clear what our deficit policy is as early as possible.”</p> \n<p>She questioned whether Osborne’s new fiscal mandate would require a surplus in every year and also asked how Osborne planned to define the requirement to be in surplus in normal times.</p> \n<p>Osborne has said the Office of Budget Responsibility will be asked to define whether the economy is in a normal or exceptional state. Kendall pointed out that it had been Labour that had been pressing for the OBR to be given a greater role.</p> \n<p>Osborne’s plans, which are due to be set out in the emergency budget on 8 July, is designed to ensure governments must aim for a surplus on the current and capital accounts, so it goes further than the current mandate that is focused on current, or day-to-day, spending, as opposed to investment spending.</p> \n<p>The shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, tried to sidestep the issue by saying the proposed new fiscal mandate was a distraction from the main issue of raising productivity.</p> \n<p>The new mandate, due to be voted on by MPs in the autumn after Labour has elected its new leader, replaces the existing fiscal mandate, prompting speculation that Osborne might try to smooth the pace of deficit reduction.<br /></p> \n<p>But the Treasury minister, David Gauke, said the new more ambitious mandate on surpluses covering both capital and current spending did not mean the government was abandoning its previous pre-election pledge to cut &pound;30bn in the two years 2016-17 and 2017-18.</p> \n<p>In the Labour leadership contest, Kendall now has 36 nominations, one more than the number needed to make it on to the ballot paper. Andy Burnham, 60 nominations, and Yvette Cooper, 43, have also secured their places but Jeremy Corbyn and Mary Creagh are struggling to secure nominations from Labour MPs. Corbyn has attracted 12 supporters, while Creagh has seven. More than 70 MPs have not yet nominated any candidate.</p> \n<p>The rail union TSSA said Labour MPs “should have the guts” to let Corbyn on to the ballot paper in the interests of debate. <br /></p> \n<p>It will be a calculation for the Burnham and Cooper camps whether to lend Corbyn some of their nominations if he is just a few short of the 35 threshold. It might suit Burnham politically to have Corbyn, an anti-austerity leftwinger, on the ballot, since it prevents him being portrayed as the most leftwing candidate, making it more difficult for Cooper to come through the middle as the compromise centrist choice.</p> \n<p>The preferential voting system should benefit the centrist candidate as long as they are not knocked out in the first round of voting.</p> \n<p>It is widely thought Osborne is trying to keep Labour on the back foot over the deficit, the issue that caused the party serious political damage in 2015 election. <br /></p> \n<p>During the previous Labour leadership election in 2010, the contestants were largely distracted while the Conservatives skilfully laid out the message that Labour overspending in the middle of the last decade helped prompt the financial crash – or at least make it harder for the British economy to withstand its impact.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, David Miliband, brother of the defeated Labour leader Ed Miliband, said: “What I think is important for all the candidates is to reflect on the very clear lessons of two devastating electoral defeats for the Labour party in the last five years, which have come for a very clear reason.</p> \n<p>“And the reason is that the public have concluded that instead of building on the strengths and remedying the weaknesses of the Blair years, the party has turned the page backwards rather than turning the page forwards.” </p> \n<p>Osborne’s fiscal rule has been challenged by the independent Social Market Foundation thinktank. It says the rule is very ambitious since the occasions on which borrowing has been below zero (when the government has been taking in more than it spends) are few and far between.</p> \n<p>It adds: “Borrowing for infrastructure investment – if done well – increases economic growth, in turn meaning that debt as a proportion of GDP can be kept down. Eliminating the ability to borrow for investment means that funds must come from current revenues. But capital projects don’t have nice, smooth cost profiles – they often involve a couple of years where costs are very high.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/416326c6a8de1a34716772d79fd7a8d7630b5f4e/0_246_4256_2553/4256.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2553,"width":4256,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Clodagh Kilcoyne/Getty Images","altText":"DUBLIN, IRELAND - JUNE 09:  Labour leadership candidate Liz Kendall speaks on stage at the Labour leadership hustings in Citywest hotel on June 9, 2015 in Dublin, Ireland.

Just 15% of the councils that issue permits do so for free. Overall, the cost of a parking permit now averages almost &pound;60 in the UK.</p> \n<p>Car parking permits are relatively inexpensive in London boroughs. At &pound;434 a year, Islington charges some drivers the highest fees in the capital. Car owners in the London boroughs of Hackney, Lambeth and Brent all pay between &pound;218 and &pound;265 – which is less than the amount paid by residents of Mole Valley, the area around Leatherhead, Surrey, who have to fork out &pound;350 a year. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/parking-zip/giv-21277ViNZJeoE9TkY\" data-alt=\"parking table\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/parking-zip/giv-21277ViNZJeoE9TkY\">parking table</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Churchill found that 38% of councils do not parking permits.

Councils have increasingly looked at charging diesel cars higher fees because of the damage they do to air quality. Islington imposes a &pound;96 surcharge on diesel models.</p> \n<p>The figures also suggest some councils are increasingly trying to cut down on the number of two-car households. Daventry district council charges &pound;17 for the first parking permit, but &pound;288 for each additional one. Hammersmith and Fulham charges &pound;60 for the first car with a “greener vehicle” discount, but &pound;497 for a second.</p> \n<p>Steve Barrett, head of Churchill Car Insurance, said: “Parking controls and permits play a huge part in keeping roads safe and clear, as well as ensuring residents have priority over spaces surrounding their property.

They are incredibly needy. Some have lost their jobs, dropped out of university or seen their marriages break down as a result [of narcolepsy],” said Peter Todd, the solicitor for the family of the 12-year-old, a partner with the London firm Hodge Jones &amp; Allen. </p> \n<p>The youngster, whose parents have asked he remain anonymous, has become disruptive at school due to extreme tiredness brought about by the illness, triggered after he took the vaccine in 2009, the court heard. He has only one friend because the sleep disorder makes socialising difficult.<br /></p> \n<p> The upper tribunal court that heard the case, also heard that the boy is unable to shower unattended or take a bus alone and needs to take several naps during the school day. He is unlikely to be allowed to drive as an adult.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>To say that it’s not impactful just makes me mad.

While the swine flu outbreak never reached the proportions that had been feared, scientists now believe the vaccine caused narcolepsy in a small number of patients. </p> \n<p>The government now acknowledges the link, but had previously argued those affected by narcolepsy do not meet the threshold for the Department for Work and Pensions’s compensation scheme, which automatically awards a &pound;120,000 lump sum to anyone with “severe” and permanent disabilities as a result of certain vaccines.</p> \n<p>Anthony O’Mahony, whose 17-year-old daughter, Ciara, developed narcolepsy after being given the vaccine in 2009, said that the government’s suggestion that illness was not “severe” was offensive to victims. “To say that it’s not that impactful just makes me mad,” he said. “Narcolepsy affects everything that Ciara does and always will do.”</p> \n<p>His daughter received the vaccine in 2009 and in the months afterwards began showing symptoms of the sleep disorder, such as lethargy and sudden loss of muscle control. Twice, her mother has found her asleep in the bath and on several occasions she has fallen suddenly after losing consciousness.<br /></p> \n<p>The family only became aware of the link with Pandemrix last year and O’Mahony stresses he is not “anti-vaccine”, despite what happened. “There’s always going to be someone who has some kind of reaction to vaccines,” he said. “We just want an acknowledgement.” </p> \n<p>Ciara is one of 74 others represented by Todd who are seeking to challenge similar compensation rejections by the DWP, and the group is pursuing a separate civil action against GSK. The costs of any financial settlement are likely to be met by the taxpayer because of an indemnity signed between the government and the pharmaceutical giant.</p> \n<p>Narcolepsy is a rare but serious neurological disorder that affects about 31,000 people in Britain. It can cause sleep disruptions, including night terrors and hallucinations, and extreme drowsiness during the daytime. Some narcoleptics also suffer from cataplexy, where a sudden burst of emotion such as shock or happiness causes total loss of muscle control.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2013/sep/19/swine-flu-vaccine-narcolepsy-uk\">Swine flu vaccine can trigger narcolepsy, UK government concedes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In 2013, a major study by the Health Protection Agency found that around one in every 55,000 swine flu jabs led to narcolepsy, but the exact biological causes for the link are not clear.</p> \n<p>To qualify for the DWP’s Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme, a victim has to be classed as at least 60% disabled, which is described as equivalent to the loss of one hand.</p> \n<p>Matt O’Neill, chairman of the charity Narcolepsy UK, said: “The problem is that it is often hidden condition, but there are so many things that people with narcolepsy can’t do that you would be able to do with a physical disability. To suggest that narcolepsy is not severe is absolutely ridiculous.”</p> \n<p> The government now has 21 days to appeal the ruling. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said the government would not comment on individual cases, adding: “The Vaccine Damage Payments Scheme provides support in very rare cases where someone has become severely disabled as a result of immunisation against certain diseases. Decisions on claims take into account the individual circumstances of each case and the latest available medical evidence.”</p> \n<p> A GSK spokesman said: “We are actively researching the observed association between Pandemrix and narcolepsy and the interaction this vaccine might have had with other risk factors in those affected. </p> \n<p>“We’re also continuing to support ongoing work from other experts and organisations investigating reported cases of this condition and we hope these efforts will enable us to provide more answers in the future.

When it’s a tax-efficient financial instrument | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Several economists have already suggested that prices will start to rise again now that a majority Conservative government is in place. Earlier this month, Steven Bell, chief economist at City fund manager F&amp;C Investments, said boom conditions had returned to the housing market.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Halifax’s housing economist, Martin Ellis, last week warned that housing supply “remains extremely tight”. “The imbalance between supply and demand is likely to continue to push up house prices over the coming months.” The Halifax and Nationwide building society both put the average price of a UK home at &pound;195,000-&pound;196,000.</p> \n<p>Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Rics, said: “There had been some hope that the removal of political uncertainty would encourage more properties on to the market, but the initial indications are that this is not proving to be the case. As a result, it is hardly surprising that prices across much of the country are continuing to be squeezed higher, with property set to become ever more unaffordable.”<br /></p> \n<p>He added that the feedback Rics was receiving from its members “points to prices at a headline level rising by another 25% over the next five years”. He said that suggested there was no real confidence among its members that effective measures to provide a major boost to new supply would be delivered by the government any time soon.<br /></p> \n<p>One chartered surveyor, the Frost Partnership in Ashford, Surrey, told Rics: “Listings are in very short supply, which is pushing up asking prices to unrealistic levels in some cases.”<br /></p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Christopher Green at Curzon Land in central London, which specialises in “prime property investments”, was clearly cheered by the election result, telling Rics that “the market has gained an immense amount of optimism now that the socialist spectre has been removed for the next five years”.</p> \n<p>The bad news for tenants – on top of many people being unable to buy because of high prices – is that Rics members are also predicting rent rises averaging almost 3% over the next 12 months. The body said this reflected the fact that demand for rental properties was continuing to increase. “Contributors [to the survey] anticipate that rents will rise across all parts of the UK over the next three months, with expectations most elevated in the East Midlands and the south-west,” it added. </p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433970729715/ebc175f2-0df5-4f76-9c6f-cb175b8e00ed-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christopher Thomond/for the Guardian","altText":"For sale signs","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Christopher Thomond/for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-10T23:01:06Z","lastModified":"2015-06-10T23:54:52Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":188,"contributors":[{"name":"Rupert Jones","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rupertjones"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["House prices","Housing","Conservatives","Property","Business","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"money/houseprices","webTitle":"House prices"},{"id":"society/housing","webTitle":"Housing"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"money/property","webTitle":"Property"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"money"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rupert Jones","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rupertjones"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"money"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/jun/11/uk-house-prices-rise-quarter-five-years","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49kyj","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/money/2015/jun/11/uk-house-prices-rise-quarter-five-years","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jun/11/uk-house-prices-rise-quarter-five-years"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433970729715/ebc175f2-0df5-4f76-9c6f-cb175b8e00ed-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An anticipated post-general election ‘supply bounce’ had failed to materialise.

MPs will vote on who gets the job next Wednesday.</p> \n<p>The job is likely to be busy over the next two years with negotiations over the renewal of the BBC charter to take place later this year, the future of Channel 4 and the ongoing battles around press regulation.</p> \n<p>They are also expected to take an interest in the future of Fifa following the recent corruption scandal, and the continuing broadband rollout across the UK.</p> \n<h2>Damian Collins</h2> \n<p>Collins announced his bid to become chair in a YouTube video released last week, which starts by highlighting the campaign for reform of scandal hit Fifa which he helped start called New Fifa Now.</p> \n<p>The video also references Collins’s involvement in the phone-hacking inquiry in which he says: “We cannot forget the mistakes that were made and the systemic failure of the governance of the press we saw in the last parliament.”</p> \n<p>He served on the culture select committee between 2012 and 2013 and unlike his competitors, he has experience of the ad industry, having spent more than 10 years working at agency M&amp;C Saatchi.</p> \n<p>He is also chairman of the Conservative Arts and Creative Industries Network, which he founded alongside serving culture minister Ed Vaizey.</p> \n<h2>Damian Green</h2> \n<p>Green is best known for being subjected to a police raid on his office in the Commons over leaks from the Home Office, a move which was widely condemned.</p> \n<p>He has the most extensive media experience of any of the other nominees, with more than a decade working across the BBC, the Times and Channel 4.</p> \n<p>In his statement, he put BBC charter renewal and “the future of the licence fee” at the top of his list of issues the committee will have to address. Believed to be more pro-BBC than some in his party, he is chair of the all-party parliamentary group on the corporation.</p> \n<p>He is the only one of the candidates with ministerial experience, having served as immigration and policing minister in the last parliament, and the only one to be backed by a member of last parliament’s select committee, Labour’s Paul Farrelly.</p> \n<h2>Jason McCartney</h2> \n<p>McCartney was chair of the all-party parliamentary group on ITV, and vice-chair on the same BBC group chaired by Green.</p> \n<p>A former air force officer, he has also worked in BBC local radio and ITV’s Yorkshire current affairs programme, Calendar.</p> \n<p>Promising to bring some “Yorkshire common sense” to the job, he has talked up his commitment to sports, arts funding and super-fast broadband rollout. Elected in 2010, he says he would bring “something a bit different” and a “fresh approach to the role.</p> \n<h2>Jesse Norman</h2> \n<p>A last-minute entry to the ballot, Norman served on the Treasury committee during the last parliament. He is a director of the Hay festival and a trustee of performance arts space the Roundhouse, which was founded by his father.</p> \n<p>Norman is known for having a combative relationship with the Conservative leadership, and was sacked from a job on the No 10 policy boardafter rebelling over the government’s plans for military action in Syria.<br /></p> \n<p>As well as the key issues common to other nominees such as the BBC charter and licence fee, press freedom, broadband and football governance, Norman also says the committee should look at mobile services and that it is “important to look at the case for fairer local arts and broadcast media funding”.</p> \n<h2>Graham Stuart</h2> \n<p>Stuart was chair of the of the education select committee in the last parliament, where he gained a reputation for directness in challenging Michael Gove on issues such as the English baccalaureate and free schools.</p> \n<p>His political career has not touched on media issues as much as his competitors, but he has a background in magazines and is currently a director of CSL Publishing, which produces titles such as Boating Business.</p> \n<p>He lists BBC Charter renewal, press freedom and football governance as the issues likely to take up the committee’s time, but says “members will form their own views about future inquiries”. He also has a “personal” interest in trying to spread cultural and sporting events across the UK.</p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434003632644/2967dac7-b024-4fb2-8398-f76c1e2fb387-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":351,"width":585,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"BBC","altText":"Damian Collins: running against Damian Green and others","cleanCredit":"Photograph: BBC"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-11T06:24:44Z","lastModified":"2015-06-11T06:27:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Jasper Jackson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jasper-jackson"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Media","BBC","Conservatives","Politics","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"media"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jasper Jackson","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jasper-jackson"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"media"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/11/culture-select-committee-damiam-green-jason-mccartney","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49kk2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/media/2015/jun/11/culture-select-committee-damiam-green-jason-mccartney","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/11/culture-select-committee-damiam-green-jason-mccartney"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434003632644/2967dac7-b024-4fb2-8398-f76c1e2fb387-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":351,"width":585,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Damian Collins: running against Damian Green and others for chair of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee.
