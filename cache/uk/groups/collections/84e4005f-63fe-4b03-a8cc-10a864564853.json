It is a crying shame that Labour members want to go out every day scaring and frightening people. It is no wonder they lost the election.”</p> \n<p>After a freedom of information request for the figures to be released was rejected, a complaint was lodged with the Information Commissioner’s Office, which ruled on 30 April that the DWP should disclose data that would show the number of benefits claimants who had died after being found fit to work. </p> \n<p>The body gave the DWP 35 days to make the information public, but the department appealed the decision. <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/hm-courts-and-tribunal-service-publish-stats-showing-how-many-people-have-died-after-their-benefits-stopped\">A petition</a> calling for DWP to release the statistics had been signed by over 200,000 people by the time Cameron spoke to the House of Commons on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Raising a point of order after prime minister’s questions, Abrahams asked the Speaker John Bercow why Duncan Smith had claimed that the figures didn’t exist, contradicting what the prime minister had said and the information his own department supplied to the information commissioner. </p> \n<p>“I’d be grateful for your guidance on how to correct the record and seek an explanation for this error. Frankly this happens too much and puts this House into disrepute,” she said. </p> \n<p>Bercow replied: “If there is an inconsistency between what you have been told in the chamber and what has been said elsewhere by the government and that is a matter of fact, then it will be apparent to ministers who are responsible for the accuracy of what they say and in the event of inaccuracy for ensuring correction.” <br /></p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5773a02c5b95880b2711472ececcb8a2bb842430/388_31_1386_832/1386.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":832,"width":1386,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PA/PA","altText":"Prime Minister David Cameron speaks during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, London.PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo.

However, its British-based Amazon.co.uk Limited subsidiary recorded a profit of just &pound;34.4m and tax of &pound;11.9m, according to results filed at Companies House this week. </p> \n<p>As in previous years, the UK accounts make clear Amazon.co.uk Limited claims not to sell to British online shoppers: instead the group’s Luxembourg arm fulfils that role. Amazon.co.uk Limited’s much more modest turnover of &pound;679m comes from providing “fulfilment and corporate support services” to Luxembourg.</p> \n<p>The Amazon group’s total UK sales of &pound;5.3bn – representing 9.4% of its global sales – were taken through its Luxembourg company Amazon EU Sarl, which has a much smaller number of employees. Amazon EU Sarl also took billions from Germany, France and other major European economies. It was not subject to tax on any resulting profits in those markets.</p> \n<p> This controversial structure which allows technology companies to divert sales out of major economies – avoiding tax on any consequent profits as a result – has led to a string of tax reform initiatives.</p> \n<p> The G20-led reform programme, being carried out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, signalled its <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2013/jul/19/oecd-tax-reform-proposals-amazon\" draggable=\"true\">determination to end the practice two years ago</a>. These wide-reaching reforms are still being fine-tuned, with further developments expected later this year. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Meanwhile, George Osborne has pre-empted the G20 project on the single issue of diverted sales and profits as exploited by Amazon. In April the chancellor introduced a punitive 25% rate for those <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/mar/18/osborne-targets-multinationals-and-tax-evaders-in-budget-crackdown\" draggable=\"true\">companies artificially shifting sales and profits overseas</a>.</p> \n<p> Last month Amazon <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/23/amazon-to-begin-paying-corporation-tax-on-uk-retail-sales\">quietly abandoned its practice</a> of pooling European sales in Luxembourg. Instead the sales hub business opened taxable branches in its main European markets, including the UK. As a result, for the first time since 2004, all Amazon sales with British online shoppers are going through a business that will file a UK tax return.</p> \n<p> That development is unlikely to lead to a leap in Amazon’s UK tax bill, however, as the company continues to use further controversial structures to shift profits out of Amazon EU Sarl – which reported a loss last year – and back to the US. Competition officials in Brussels are <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jan/16/amazon-eu-sarl-paid-too-little-tax-says-brussels\">examining this arrangement</a>, which was sanctioned by the grand duchy in 2003. They believe tax treatments agreed by the Luxembourg authorities may have been so generous as to constitute illegal state aid.</p> \n<p>Amazon’s former head of tax, Bob Comfort, last year gave an interview recalling how in 2003 the then prime minister of Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker, had <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/dec/10/juncker-amazon-luxembourg-eased-tax-expert-comfort\">behaved as “business partner”</a> to the online retailer. Juncker is now the president of the European Union’s executive arm, the European commission. </p> \n<p> Three years ago Comfort was appointed Luxembourg’s “honorary consul for the Seattle region” because of his close relationship with the grand duchy and tasked with extolling the benefits of the country to other US tech firms.</p> \n<p>The accounts for Amazon.co.uk Limited show the UK business is continuing its rapid expansion. The document shows that 7,722 staff in warehouse, procurement, software and other roles were employed during the year, up from 5,912 in 2013.</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435167916120/a6cd692d-5d3e-43b9-84de-84ca3935d70d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sarah Lee/Guardian","altText":"Amazon quietly abandoned its practice of pooling European sales in Luxembourg last month and opened taxable branches in its main European markets, including the UK.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sarah Lee/Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-24T17:29:41Z","lastModified":"2015-06-24T23:00:45Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Simon Bowers","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/simonbowers"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Amazon.com","E-commerce","Internet","Technology","Retail industry","Business","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"technology/amazon","webTitle":"Amazon.com"},{"id":"technology/efinance","webTitle":"E-commerce"},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"},{"id":"business/retail","webTitle":"Retail industry"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"technology"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Simon Bowers","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/simonbowers"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"technology"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jun/24/amazons-uk-business-paid-119m-tax-last-year","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a4fn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/technology/2015/jun/24/amazons-uk-business-paid-119m-tax-last-year","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/24/amazons-uk-business-paid-119m-tax-last-year"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435167916120/a6cd692d-5d3e-43b9-84de-84ca3935d70d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Amazon quietly abandoned its practice of pooling European sales in Luxembourg last month and opened taxable branches in its main European markets, including the UK.

[But] It has to adapt more in a more millennial world.”</p> \n<p>Sorrell said that, from personal experience with the BBC, he felt that there appeared to be obvious room for it to tighten costs.</p> \n<p>“The basic thing is about organisation,” he said. “Sometimes when I walk into a BBC building and I see the cells, the silos, or when I go to events and I see multiple film crews or presenters or interviewers ... the answer is I’d like there to be more horizontality at the BBC.”</p> \n<p>When asked if “horizontality” was a euphemsim for expecting cuts when the new licence fee deal is agreed with the government in the coming months, Sorrell demurred.</p> \n<p>“It means being more efficient,” he said. “What you do with that investment, or saving, whether invest in more product or take from the bottom line, that is another question for the powers that be. But do I think, given the size of the organisation and its complexity, there must be efficiencies in there? It’s definitely [a] yes. Can WPP be more efficient, certainly”.</p> \n<p>He also welcomed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/16/james-murdoch-21st-century-fox-chief-executive\">the appointment of James Murdoch as chief executive of 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fox</a> and his elder brother Lachlan as co-executive chairman alongside their father Rupert.</p> \n<p>However, he was coy about making a call on which of the brother’s is effectively the managerial heir apparent to Rupert.</p> \n<p>“They both got good promotions didn’t they,” he said. “They both have done excellent jobs. Speaking in a personal capacity, I’m delighted that Lachlan has now come back into the fold – and I think James has done a stellar job. He obviously understands digital, a big investor and proponent of Vice too.”</p> \n<p>Sorrell also said that he was supportive of the Fox ownership structure, which gives the Murdoch family control of almost 40% of voting rights with a share holding of just 12%, because the recession had proven these businesses to perform the best.</p> \n<p>“My own view is that companies where there is no separation between ownership and control have an in-built advantage,” he said. “Post-Lehman, those companies [were] most willing to take educated risks and make bold moves more than companies with that separation.”</p> \n<p>On James Murdoch’s re-invention of his corporate profile after leaving the UK in the wake of the phone hacking scandal, he said: “I think he handled himself, and obviously what was a difficult situation, in an exemplary way and all credit to him and the family as well”.</p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435161691699/d4d260db-51f3-4c27-9fab-e66fc5bb0834-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ruben Sprich/Reuters","altText":"Sir Martin Sorrell","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ruben Sprich/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-25T06:00:12Z","lastModified":"2015-06-25T06:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":99,"contributors":[{"name":"Mark Sweney","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/marksweney"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cannes Lions 2015","Cannes Lions","Advertising","Media","Sir Martin Sorrell","BBC","BBC licence fee","James Murdoch","Lachlan Murdoch","21st Century Fox"],"tags":[{"id":"media/cannes-lions-2015","webTitle":"Cannes Lions 2015"},{"id":"media/cannes-lions","webTitle":"Cannes Lions"},{"id":"media/advertising","webTitle":"Advertising"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"media/sir-martin-sorrell","webTitle":"Sir Martin Sorrell"},{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC"},{"id":"media/bbc-licence-fee","webTitle":"BBC licence fee"},{"id":"media/jamesmurdoch","webTitle":"James Murdoch"},{"id":"media/lachlan-murdoch","webTitle":"Lachlan Murdoch"},{"id":"media/21st-century-fox","webTitle":"21st Century Fox"}],"section":{"id":"media"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Mark Sweney","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/marksweney"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"media"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/25/sir-martin-sorrell-bbc-licence-fee","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a4kg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/media/2015/jun/25/sir-martin-sorrell-bbc-licence-fee","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/25/sir-martin-sorrell-bbc-licence-fee"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435161691699/d4d260db-51f3-4c27-9fab-e66fc5bb0834-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sir Martin Sorrell said that if WPP got £3.5bn upfront in cash every year, like the BBC does, it would build a strong brand.
