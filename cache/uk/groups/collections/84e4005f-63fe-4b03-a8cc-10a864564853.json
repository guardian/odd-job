As a consequence, governments had to provide the tax policies that international corporations wanted. </p> \n<p>Speaking to an audience of tax planners, academics and HMRC officials at the <a href=\"http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/ideas-impact/tax/about\">Centre for Business Taxation</a>, part of Oxford University’s Said Business School, Baker said: “I don’t think in the last 20 years or so one can say that governments have driven corporation tax policy. It’s the large companies that have driven the direction of corporate tax policy.” </p> \n<p>His comments add to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2013/jan/02/martin-sorrell-starbucks-tax-arrangements\">claims two years ago</a> from WPP chief executive Sir Martin Sorrell, who said corporation tax payments were “a question of judgment” for multinational companies, weighed against corporate reputation as much as the risk of challenge in the tax courts. </p> \n<p>In 2008, Sorrell had switched the advertising group’s headquarter functions from London to Dublin to escape a tightening of UK tax rules for offshore subsidiaries. When, four years later, this crackdown was reversed, Sorrell promptly returned WPP’s HQ activities to the UK.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2e9ac2751369bc4dd20b2dd07d5ae5b0cf7783b0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435509606839/5671ef47-7206-400e-b76d-e46470def0cb-460x304.jpeg\" alt=\"Martin Sorrell of WPP.\" width=\"460\" height=\"304\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Sorrell described corporation tax payments as a question of judgment.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francois G. Durand/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Baker, who is one of Europe’s leading authorities on international tax law and advised the government on its “Google tax”, said the influence corporations exert over tax policy was inevitable unless there was more coordination between EU member states on tax, such as measures proposed by the European commission last week. </p> \n<p>Known as the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), these new proposals were set out by commissioner for tax Pierre Moscovici in answer to the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/dec/23/luxleaks-tax-source-should-not-be-charged\">LuxLeaks scandal</a>, which last year laid bare the extent to which some smaller EU countries had set their tax policy to routinely facilitate tax avoidance by multinationals, eroding tax receipts beyond their borders.</p> \n<p>Baker told the tax conference he thought it regrettable that the UK appeared to have immediately rejected such plans out of hand. “I understand why the UK will not join in implementing CCCTB, but it’s a great pity because until you’ve tried something you don’t know if it might actually work,” he said. “It is conceivable that perhaps with the enhanced cooperation of a number of countries it works and we do have a genuine alternative.”</p> \n<p>Commenting on George Osborne’s diverted profits tax — commonly known as the “Google tax” — Baker said it was no different in effect from the tax reforms being developed by a G20 initiative, of which the UK was part. He said the chancellor had moved ahead of that process, introducing the measure early for political reasons.</p> \n<p>“The impending election meant that the UK couldn’t wait,” he explained, though he stressed he was speaking personally and not for ministers. “The government would have been criticised for not doing anything about corporate tax avoidance.” More broadly, however, he insisted companies were driving corporate tax policy, not ministers — though he accepted this was a controversial claim some would dispute.</p> \n<p>The Centre for Business Taxation is funded by donations from <a href=\"http://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/ideas-impact/tax/about/funding\">many of Britain’s largest corporations</a> including Diageo, GlaxoSmithKline, Alliance Boots, SABMiller and Pearson. Past donors have included Vodafone, WPP Group, Shire Pharmaceuticals and ICAP. Many of these companies have been involved in high-profile controversies about tax in the past.</p> \n<p>Also speaking at the conference, Edward Troup, HMRC’s tax assurance commissioner, said he too felt recent decades of globalisation had brought a shift away from the “high-water mark of what you might call statism” in terms of tax treatment of multinationals.</p> \n<p>The conference was organised by Michael Devereux, an economist who heads the Centre for Business Taxation at the Said Business School and who is also an adviser to the treasury, sitting on the department’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/business-forum-on-tax-and-competitiveness\">business forum for tax and competitiveness</a>.</p> \n<p>As long ago as 1999, Devereux had told the House of Lords he believed corporation tax collection was doomed. “If I can make a bold prediction, I would say that corporate taxes will eventually just wither — there will be no corporate tax at all, partly because of the process of competition between states and partly as companies can organise their affairs effectively to reduce their corporation tax,” he told peers.</p> \n<p>Devereux told the conference, which marked 50 years of corporation tax in the UK, that he stood by his long-held belief that countries would eventually compete this tax out of existence. He said that with its ambition to become the most competitive tax regime in the G20 the UK had made strides in that direction – including the lowering of the statutory tax rate for large businesses from 28% to 20% in the last parliament – but there was more that he would like to see done.</p>","section":"Global","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d110c1e2bc06dfb10ac574820d0c91076f522abe/164_20_2749_1650/2749.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1650,"width":2749,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images","altText":"The UK treasury building.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435509604504/5671ef47-7206-400e-b76d-e46470def0cb-2060x1360.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1360,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Martin Sorrell described corporation tax payments as a question of judgment.

He said that while Manchester did have a <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/number-people-sleeping-rough-greater-8745312\">growing rough-sleeping problem</a>, he had noticed “a great improvement” in the council’s attitude towards homelessness. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"15cd128039485adaff5898dfd5b1bc3bd63d6d32\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435517009914/bc84bb43-5ac5-4b60-992f-1587ae18b7a7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tents at the camp.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The camp has been moved on two times already.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For many weeks, a dozen tents, tied together to stop them being blown away by the wind, have been clustered at the centre of St Ann’s Square, a pedestrianised street which is home to the Royal Exchange theatre and a number of high-street shops. </p> \n<p>Sitting on a deckchair as shoppers filed past last week, one of the campers, Paddy Reilly, 55, explained why the group was there. ‘’People cannot live off fresh air. Homeless people are going out committing offences and shoplifting to survive. Instead of spending thousands sending the homeless to prisons, why don’t they give them the keys to their own homes,” he said.</p> \n<p>Admitting he is an alcoholic, Reilly said since he’s been at the camp he has declined accommodation at hostels offered by the council. “What they’re doing is sending them back into hostels and they’re there for a week before they’re back on the streets,” he went on. “The same type of people are mixing together in hostels, so they’re all going to do the same type of thing, like taking drugs and drinking. The council is keeping hostels in business, we want the keys to our own homes.”</p> \n<p>The camp has shrunk in the last few weeks since a small group of campers left St Ann’s Square to pitch tents in a small field beside a railway bridge in Castlefield, by the canal. Ryan Walker,19, who started sleeping rough after leaving home age 16, said he moved to the new site having got fed up with punters leaving clubs and bars late at night “shaking tents and causing trouble”. Asked why he chose to join the homeless camp, he said: “Homeless people need to stick together.”</p> \n<p>Shoppers at lunch time seem oblivious to the camp in St Ann’s Square. Greg Ingham, 27, a graphic designer picking up some lunch, said he doesn’t mind the camp. “They’re not causing any problems ... I don’t think they should be evicted.”</p> \n<p>Others disagreed. “It makes the place look a mess,” said one man, while an employee from the McDonald’s opposite complained the camp attracted fights and street drinkers at night.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Cllr Nigel Murphy Manchester City Council’s executive member for neighbourhoods, said: “We have served a notice on both camps, but the protestors are still camped out so we are applying for an injunction which will stop them setting up further camps within the city centre.</p> \n<p>‘We hope this will end 10 weeks of disruption to residents and businesses, as well as anti social behaviour which has included the burning of bonfires, vandalism, street drinking and the intimidation of members of the public.”</p> \n<p>But how a broad injunction would be policed is unclear, should one be granted to the council.</p> \n<p>Dr Rhetta Moran of RAPAR, a Manchester-based human rights organisation, said: “An injunction preventing someone from entering an area is, by its very nature, an interference of one’s civil liberties and should only be granted sparingly.</p> \n<p>“It is unclear what type of injunction the council will seek. Any such injunction will restrict the movements of the person injuncted and is a very serious matter.” </p> \n<p>A magistrate is set to decide on Monday whether to grant the injunction banning any further camps in the city. </p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435333961481/26af1fb1-acc7-4f4e-8b4d-ac7bbb3a0114-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"André Rhoden-Paul/André Rhoden-Paul","altText":"Paddy Reilly in St Ann's Square.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: André Rhoden-Paul/André Rhoden-Paul"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435517011566/bc84bb43-5ac5-4b60-992f-1587ae18b7a7-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The camp has been moved on two times already.

But critics say that timetables are already overwhelmed thanks to academic pressures and the need to teach subjects such as British values, leaving little time for horse riding.</p> \n<p>The survey also found more enthusiasm for the Scout movement among pupils on free school meals than among their better-off peers. Some 39% said they would like to be part of the Scouts, compared with just 23% of those not receiving free school meals. </p>","section":"Education","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f7e9fd6db6a1ee0c8c2f6048fe10778e7a958ecf/0_408_3390_2030/3390.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2030,"width":3390,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Stefan Rousseau/PA","altText":"Private school children debate in the House of Lords.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-28T23:01:11Z","lastModified":"2015-06-28T23:23:30Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Richard Adams","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/richardadams"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Schools","Education","Scouts and scouting","Children","Society","Private schools","Nicky Morgan","UK news","Politics"],"tags":[{"id":"education/schools","webTitle":"Schools"},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education"},{"id":"society/scouts-and-scouting","webTitle":"Scouts and scouting"},{"id":"society/children","webTitle":"Children"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"education/private-schools","webTitle":"Private schools"},{"id":"politics/nicky-morgan","webTitle":"Nicky Morgan"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"}],"section":{"id":"education"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Richard Adams","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/richardadams"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"education"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/jun/29/state-school-children-want-more-middle-class-activities-private-schools","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a7cm","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/education/2015/jun/29/state-school-children-want-more-middle-class-activities-private-schools","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jun/29/state-school-children-want-more-middle-class-activities-private-schools"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f7e9fd6db6a1ee0c8c2f6048fe10778e7a958ecf/0_408_3390_2030/3390.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2030,"width":3390,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Students from private schools Haberdashers’ Aske’s Boys’ and Howell’s in the English-Speaking Union schools debating final in the House of Lords.
