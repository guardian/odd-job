It was the message that was plastered all over the Olympic Park in Stratford during that glorious period in July and August 2012. It was a proud boast that the London Olympics could do something no other previous Games had achieved. But it has become a millstone for all involved.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/olympic-legacy-failure-sporting-numbers-plummet\">Olympic legacy failure: sporting numbers plummet amid confusion and blame</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What resonated most with the International Olympic Committee and the country was the “Singapore promise” of leaving behind a legacy of a fitter, healthier nation and transforming the lives of young people, together with regenerating a patch of east London and underlining the value of public investment in elite sport.</p> \n<p>There were plenty of people, even then, who argued that investing &pound;9.3bn in a major sporting event was not the most effective way to transform the fabric of grassroots sport in the UK. But the seductive vision from Lord Coe and the then prime minister, Tony Blair, was that hosting the Games could provide a glorious one-off corrective that in addition to regeneration in London and economic benefits for Britain could transform the attitude to sport in Whitehall and beyond.</p> \n<p>No longer an afterthought, it would become baked into health, transport, Home Office and education policy. At a valedictory press conference in Westminster the day after the Games, the then culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, became visibly annoyed at a suggestion from reporters that his government would fail to do just that. But 10 years on from Singapore the chief executive of the London 2012 bid, Sir Keith Mills, is clear that it is the government’s commitment to a co-ordinated strategy that is still sorely lacking.</p> \n<p>“We urged that government should have a national strategy for sport and inactivity; that hasn’t happened,” says Mills, who has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/may/21/sir-keith-mills-olympic-legacy\" title=\"\">put &pound;10m into an organisation called Sported</a> that seeks to support grassroots sports clubs across the country. “It’s very frustrating because it’s not rocket science. The problem in government generally is that it’s not very joined up. Government has historically been quite good at plans but not very good at executing them.”</p> \n<p>Mills, who emphasises that other elements of the legacy have been a success, contrasts the cross-party consensus required to deliver the Games with the lack of joined-up thinking over the sports participation legacy. Blair told the IOC members on 6 July 2005: “Our vision is to see millions more young people in Britain and across the world participating in sport and improving their lives as a result of that participation. And London has the power to make that happen.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>By any measure, the figures for sports participation since the Games do not make pretty reading</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Coe talked movingly about his epiphany watching the 1968 Mexico Olympics and vowed that the London Games would “show a new generation why sport matters”.</p> \n<p>For all the ill-defined rhetoric around the ambitions for a legacy, a word that has become almost meaningless given the regularity with which it is now attached to major events, the Olympics minister who persuaded Blair to bid in the first place is clear what the two overriding aims were. “We had two reasons for doing the Olympics,” says Tessa Jowell, who is standing to be Labour’s candidate for London mayor. “To regenerate this part of east London and to transform a generation of young people through sport. It was that pure and simple.”</p> \n<p>By any measure, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/11/olympic-legacy-sport-participation-plummets\" title=\"\">the figures for sports participation</a> since the Games do not make pretty reading. Longstanding issues remain from a lack of coordination between schools, local authorities and sports clubs to a lack of recognition and remuneration for age-specific coaches and PE teachers. Exacerbated by a lack of a clear overarching plan across Whitehall departments, cuts and confusion in school sport and local authority cuts that have hit facilities budgets, adult participation numbers have fallen since the Games. More worrying, they suggest that increasingly we are becoming a two-tier sporting nation, with least progress being made among those in the lowest socioeconomic groups.</p> \n<p>Sport England, the quango that invests &pound;325m of exchequer and lottery funding in grassroots sport per year, last month published participation figures among adults that were <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/15/britain-olympic-legacy-london-2012\" title=\"\">damned as very disappointing</a> by the new sports minister, Tracey Crouch. Her Labour opposite number, Clive Efford, called them disastrous. The figures showed that the number of people playing sport at least once a week had declined by 222,000 in six months. Meanwhile, the percentage of those on the lowest incomes participating in sport has hit the lowest level since records began in&nbsp;2005-06.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/olympic-legacy-failure-school-sport-postcode-lottery-michael-gove\">Olympic legacy failure: access to school sport is now a postcode lottery</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In school sport, the decision by the then education secretary, Michael Gove, to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2012/aug/06/michael-gove-own-goal-school-sports\" title=\"\">cut &pound;162m in ringfenced funding for school sports partnerships</a> had far‑reaching consequences. The effects are still being played out, though the more optimistic hope that rearguard action to replace it with &pound;150m a year for primary schools has mitigated the worst of the impact.

She pointed the finger at the coalition for axing ringfenced funding for school sport in 2010 and continuing to fund policies that were not working.</p> \n<p>“It wasn’t the wrong thing to promise,” said Jowell, now on the shortlist to be Labour’s candidate for the 2016 London mayoral election. “We were on track. It was absolutely, wholly and solely their fault. It was going to be delivered. We were on course to deliver it as the figures make absolutely clear.</p> \n<p>“Whenever I think about it, it makes me furious that this opportunity was squandered. My sense of fury is on behalf of all those kids who were starting secondary school five years ago.”</p> \n<p>Jowell said she believed Michael Gove, education secretary from 2010-14, acted for ideological reasons <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2012/aug/06/michael-gove-own-goal-school-sports\">in cutting &pound;162m in ringfenced funding for school sport</a> and that the decision had led to catastrophic knock-on effects. “It was a small decision with huge consequences,” she said. “I hope this is a huge stain on their consciences. When we get to Tokyo [in 2020] I think it likely we’ll be back to half of our medallists being from independent schools. It doesn’t mean they’re not great athletes but we challenged that by unlocking talent that might not otherwise have developed.”</p> \n<p>Sport England figures show there are now more than 1.2m more people taking part in no sport at all and that the decline has been especially marked among those from lower socioeconomic groups. “There are fewer people now playing sport,” Jowell said. “It is on the conscience of those ministers.”</p> \n<p>But she also highlighted the successful regeneration of the Olympic Park as an example that the Games had delivered on those terms. “Here is the legacy – East Village, the best place in London to live – 3,000 homes there and more coming. But the fact is that the coalition government allowed our very tight, deliberately targeted definition of legacy to become diffuse. I always knew that was a risk,” said Jowell, who was part of the delegation that narrowly defeated Paris in Singapore in the final round to win the right to host the Games.</p> \n<p>“We had two reasons for doing the Olympics. To regenerate this part of east London and to transform a generation of young people through sport. It was that pure and simple. The mechanism was school sports partnerships and targets for physical activity and sports participation. It was very clear. When they went everything melted away because there was no structure through which to explain it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/olympic-legacy-failure-school-sport-postcode-lottery-michael-gove\">Olympic legacy failure: access to school sport is now a postcode lottery</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Her successor as culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/mar/28/jeremy-hunt-london-2012-legacy\">axed the Sport England participation targets</a>, although there was also concern over whether they were the right way to measure progress. Sport England funnels &pound;325m a year in lottery and exchequer funding into grassroots sport, while the government in 2013 agreed to ringfence &pound;150m a year for primary school sport.</p> \n<p>“It was a once in a lifetime opportunity that was squandered,” said Jowell, who also accused her successors of failing to take sport seriously in terms of health and education policy. “And the most wicked and negligent part of it was winding up school sport partnerships.

NHS figures show that 656 surgeries have been merged, taken over or closed completely since 2010.</p> \n<p>The trend has sparked concern that patients will lose their longstanding relationships with their GP and have to find a new surgery and travel further for an appointment.</p> \n<p> Of 431 surgeries polled, 43 (10%) said they were considering handing back their contract to NHS England within the next three years because a GP colleague was due to retire during that time. If the same proportion was replicated across the 909 other surgeries that did not respond, almost 140 could shut.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/05/islington-gp-imogen-bloor-why-she-shut-surgery\">'We've done all we could': Islington GP tells why she has to shut her surgery</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In all, 302 of the 431 practices said that at least one of their doctors is due to retire by 2018 and 53% are already trying to recruit a GP or practice nurse. </p> \n<p>Increasing workload, financial problems, the growing complexity of patients’ illnesses and the pressure to work ever longer hours are also prompting more GPs to retire. That raises serious doubt about David Cameron’s key post-election pledges to hire <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/24/doubt-lingers-over-jeremy-hunts-pledge-5000-new-gps\">5,000 more family doctors</a> and let patients see a GP between 8am and 8pm seven days a week by 2020. </p> \n<p>“This is a three-year timebomb. In the next three years London could lose as many as 10% of its GP practices. For patients that is an unsustainable rate of loss,” said Michelle Drage, chief executive of Londonwide LMCs – which represents more than 7,000 GPs and 1,300 surgeries in 27 of London’s 32 boroughs. </p> \n<p>If all 43 practices considering terminating their contract ended up doing so, an estimated 337,979 patients would lose their GP. </p> \n<p>“Patients will definitely miss these surgeries when they go. They are at risk of losing their GP services and relationships with family doctors built up over many decades in some cases. In London there’s going to be fewer and fewer surgeries trying to cope with more and more patients at a time when the population is growing,” said Drage. </p> \n<p>“Patients will get new GPs who they have to start to get to know, and they’ll see practices that are even more stretched than they already are. And there will be added stress on GPs and practice nurses who have to deal with patients who have been displaced – refugee patients. They end up moving around local surgeries and having to tell their stories all over again because a practice they have been with for many years has suddenly shut because the doctor has gone.” </p> \n<p>The Royal College of GPs, meanwhile, warned that the closures could affect millions of patients, with some denied a GP of their own altogether. </p> \n<p>“It is shocking that we have reached a situation where so many GP practices – the lifeblood of local communities – have closed or are under threat of closure,” said Maureen Baker, the RCGP chair. “Unless drastic action is taken, thousands, if not millions, of patients could be forced to travel miles to their nearest GP practice or be left stranded with no family doctor at all.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/24/doubt-lingers-over-jeremy-hunts-pledge-5000-new-gps\">Doubts linger over Jeremy Hunt's pledge for 5,000 new GPs</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Surgeries faced with an influx when a nearby practice closes may struggle to cope, warned Baker. “We know that in many areas practices are closing because there are not enough GPs to run them and this can cause a domino effect of piling the pressure on neighbouring surgeries, particularly in remote and rural areas and areas of high deprivation.” </p> \n<p>In London, 117 surgeries closed while only 40 opened between January 2010 and the end of August 2014. Another 18 shut and just one opened in the nine months between last August and the end of May this year, according to data from the NHS’s Health and Social Care Information Centre. </p> \n<p>Closures, which include mergers and new operators taking over practices where the GPs have given it up, have far outstripped the creation of new premises each year since 2011. </p> \n<p>NHS England and the Department of Health refused to respond directly to the escalating closures and impact on patients’ access to GP services. A spokeswoman said: “All NHS patients wanting to register with a GP practice are guaranteed to be able to do so. As GPs move to create wider networks of care, like the RCGP, we fully expect more practices to come together to offer a wider range of services. However there is also no doubt that we also need to increase the investment in general practice, boost GP numbers and expand team working.”</p> \n<p>The DH reiterated that health secretary Jeremy Hunt’s “new deal for GPs” would see extra investment in general practice during this parliament. </p> \n<p>“But in exchange we need doctors to improve continuity of care and surgeries to offer seven-day appointments,” the spokeswoman added. “We recognise that GPs are already working hard, so we will increase capacity by 5,000 GPs over the next five years, including helping with flexible working.”</p> \n<p>Baker wants George Osborne, the chancellor, to establish a stabilisation fund to help surgeries at greatest risk of closure because of financial or staffing problems and ministers to pledge that no surgery will close because it lacks resources. </p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e8e99a478954ac5e4a8b4298fb29f9a91fbd19ba/0_453_4614_2769/4614.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2769,"width":4614,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"A woman waits at a GP surgery’s reception desk.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-05T13:56:07Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T23:00:27Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Denis Campbell","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/deniscampbell"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["GPs","Doctors","Health","NHS","Society","UK news","London"],"tags":[{"id":"society/gps","webTitle":"GPs"},{"id":"society/doctors","webTitle":"Doctors"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"society/nhs","webTitle":"NHS"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Denis Campbell","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/deniscampbell"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/05/gp-surgery-closures-london-crisis-refugee-patients","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4acp2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jul/05/gp-surgery-closures-london-crisis-refugee-patients","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/05/gp-surgery-closures-london-crisis-refugee-patients"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e8e99a478954ac5e4a8b4298fb29f9a91fbd19ba/0_453_4614_2769/4614.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2769,"width":4614,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A woman waits at a GP surgery’s reception desk.

One is former Green party deputy mayor of London, Jenny Jones, and the other three defected from the Conservative party to Ukip in January 2007. </p> \n<p>“There’s no doubt that the House of Lords is in desperate need of a radical overhaul, but until the upper chamber is elected it should at least see appointment according to national vote share,” said Bennett, who added that “no matter how deeply we disagree with Ukip’s politics, they should also be far better represented in the House of Lords”.</p> \n<p>“If the Lords is to retain legitimacy, then it has to have at least a pretence of some sort of proportionality,” said Carswell, the MP for Clacton. “The total number of people who voted Green or Ukip in the general election is greater than the total number of people who voted Liberal Democrat by a long chalk and yet there is a vast number of Lib Dem peers.”</p> \n<p>Despite only winning eight seats and 7.9% of the vote in May’s general election, the Liberal Democrats have 102 peers, making up 21% of the party-affiliated membership of the House of Lords. 93% of the Lib Dem parliamentary party is currently made up of peers.</p> \n<p>The leader of the House of Lords, Lady Stowell, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/25/house-of-lords-to-see-increase-in-liberal-democrats\">admitted last month</a> that the Lib Dems could expect to see their numbers in the Lords swell when the new list of peers is published in the coming weeks, saying it would reflect the fact that it was one of two parties to make up the last government. </p> \n<p>The dissolution honours list is usually published in the months following a general election and compiled by the prime minister in the last parliament. It often includes peerages for former MPs who retired or failed to get re-elected.</p> \n<p>Carswell said that awarding the Lib Dems more peers would be the Westminster system rewarding rejection at the ballot box. “Don’t get me wrong, I happen to like quite a lot of ex-Lib Dem MPs,” he said. “They’re thoroughly nice people, many of them. But the voters said no to them.”</p> \n<p>“The Green party has only one peer, though a proportional system would give us 21,” said Bennett. “The Liberal Democrats, by contrast, would be entitled to 44, rather than their 102 and rising. Appointing yet more Lib Dem lords, and ignoring the Greens, would be deeply undemocratic.”</p> \n<p>Since the general election, in which the Greens won 3.8% of the vote and Ukip 12.6%, the two parties have <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/18/green-party-ukip-electoral-reform-first-past-post-elections\">shared a platform</a> on a number of occasions to campaign for constitutional reform and both have been outspoken about what they see as the injustices of the first-past-the-post electoral system.</p> \n<p>According to analysis from <a href=\"http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/blog/system-crisis\">the Electoral Reform Society</a>, had the election been conducted with a system of proportional representation, Ukip might have won 80 seats in the Commons and the Greens 20. The Liberal Democrats would have won around 47 MPs, compared with their current eight, and the SNP would have picked up only about 30 seats, compared with their current 56.</p> \n<p>It is the first time in modern political history that a Conservative government has not also dominated the second chamber, as the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the majority of hereditary peers, many of whom were Conservative supporters.</p> \n<p>The Lords is therefore likely to be a battleground for the government as Conservative peers are heavily reliant on the support of crossbenchers to outnumber the opposition. The Conservative party has 228 members, Labour has 212 and there are 178 crossbenchers. </p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/069095409848b8b90c50653f970fabd952d2fac3/0_13_3500_2101/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2101,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Oli Scarff/Getty Images","altText":"Queen Elizabeth II Attends The State Opening Of Parliament<br>LONDON, ENGLAND - MAY 09:  Peers leave the House of Lords following the State Opening of Parliament on May 9, 2012 in London, England.

The annual accounts said the business had “taken further measures to ensure that its cost base is minimised.”</p> \n<p> Despite its woes, the business said it was on track to halve its losses in the current financial year. London Live’s chief operating officer Tim Kirkman said: “We planned to lose money, we will again this year, and next year too.
