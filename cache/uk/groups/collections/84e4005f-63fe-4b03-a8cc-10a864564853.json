Khomami","body":"<p>Britain’s public transport system is failing older people, according to a new study.</p> \n<p>A third of British pensioners never use public transport despite being eligible for a free bus pass, and half use it less than once a month.</p> \n<p>The most common complaint from those aged 65 and over was that public transport is “not convenient and does not go where you want”, <a href=\"http://www.ilcuk.org.uk/images/uploads/publication-pdfs/The_Future_of_Transport_in_an_Ageing_Society_FINAL.pdf\">the report</a> (pdf) by the International Longevity Centre thinktank and charity Age UK found.</p> \n<p>It revealed that 1.45 million over-65s in England struggled to get to a hospital, while 630,000 had difficulty getting to their GP’s surgery. Those in the worst health and with the lowest incomes struggled the most to travel to health services.</p> \n<p>The report follows a general election in which universal pensioner benefits were a key issue. David Cameron pledged that a Conservative government would protect benefits including bus passes, winter fuel allowance, prescriptions and free eye tests because Britain’s pensioners deserve “comfort, independence, companionship and health”. The Tories were the only party to commit to a rise in state pensions by at least 2.5% in their manifesto.</p> \n<p>But Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said the report should be “a wake-up call” to the government because it showed the transport system was not meeting the needs of the growing ageing population. She added: “It is crucial that older people are able to get out and about, especially as the evidence shows this helps them retain their health and independence for longer. Against this context it is worrying that so many older people are struggling to reach hospital, or sometimes even their local GP.</p> \n<p>“The bus pass is an absolute lifeline for many who would otherwise be stranded at home and is utterly essential, but the truth is it’s not enough on its own to enable older people to stay mobile. For example, better transport planning and more imaginative use of volunteers could make a big difference today; and in the medium term ‘driverless cars’ and other technological innovations could be real game changers.”</p> \n<p>The report found that only one in 100 people over 60 said they would stop driving because of their age, but 43% said a health problem would make them stop getting behind the wheel.</p> \n<p>It also found that those in rural areas had worse access to public transport, with 20% of people in their early 70s using it weekly, compared with 38% of city and town dwellers. Of over-65s in the countryside, 18% did not use public transport because there was none, compared with 2% of urban pensioners.</p> \n<p>ILC-UK’s Helen Creighton said: “Travel is essential for independent living and has been shown to benefit physical health and mental wellbeing in later life. Furthermore there is evidence that maintaining older people’s mobility has substantial economic benefits, with analysis by ILC-UK estimating that concessionary fares will provide a net benefit to the wider community of 19.4 billion in the years up to 2037.</p> \n<p>“This report, which highlights the travel difficulties facing older people, emphasises the need to adapt our transport system to meet the demands of our ageing society.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434700665138/78e6f574-b71c-4766-9c57-cb3d11810295-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter Titmuss / Alamy/Alamy","altText":"Rural bus","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter Titmuss / Alamy/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T08:07:25Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T08:09:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Nadia Khomami","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/8/1428480381597/Nadia-Khomami-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nadia-khomami"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Transport policy","Transport","Politics","UK news","Older people","Society","Rural affairs"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/transport","webTitle":"Transport policy"},{"id":"uk/transport","webTitle":"Transport"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"society/older-people","webTitle":"Older people"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"uk/ruralaffairs","webTitle":"Rural affairs"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Nadia Khomami","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/nadia-khomami"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/19/public-transport-failing-older-people","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avyp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jun/19/public-transport-failing-older-people","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/19/public-transport-failing-older-people"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434700665138/78e6f574-b71c-4766-9c57-cb3d11810295-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A rural bus service in Hampshire.

The committee was set up in response to the LuxLeaks revelations of tax avoidance in Luxembourg and its members strongly support the reform plans announced on Wednesday by European commissioner for tax Pierre Moscovici. </p> \n<p>Moscovici’s proposals seek to resurrect a longstanding tax harmonisation policy, which has been blocked by hostile member states since 2011. </p> \n<p>Known as the common consolidated corporate tax base, or CCCTB, the policy would see countries adopt a common set of rules on where company profits arise – removing many of the national differences that multinationals have been able to exploit to lower their tax bill.</p> \n<p>Aware of previous resistance, Moscovici has in recent weeks taken extensive soundings from EU members, prompting him to water down key elements of the CCCTB in an effort to make it more palatable. His calculations, however, appeared to have been wide of the mark as the UK Treasury signalled an emphatic rebuff.</p> \n<p>In the first phase of the European commission’s plan at least, the common framework would not allow companies to consolidate profits across Europe and file a single tax return. Moscovici had hoped removing the “consolidation” element of the CCCTB would make it acceptable to the likes of the UK and Ireland.</p> \n<p>Last month Gauke told the FT: “The CCCTB has been around a very long time. It is a proposal still looking for a justification.” </p> \n<p>His opposition does not seem to have softened, though it is understood that the Treasury might not object to other EU member states developing a CCCTB alone.</p> \n<p>George Osborne has set great store by Britain’s tax competitiveness, slashing the headline corporate tax rate from 28% to 20%. But it is not just on the rate that Osborne has competed hard: new favourable tax regimes for multinationals with offshore financing subsidiaries as well as new tax breaks for patent-owning companies have also been central to aggressive tax competition policy.</p> \n<p>These and other measures have seen a wave of companies shifting their European headquarters or research and development arms to the UK – much to the anger of other member states. The UK has seen an influx of multinationals – among them Aon, Fiat Industrial, and Starbucks’s European operations – looking to gain tax advantages through the optimal location of the often small number of headquarters staff.</p> \n<p>Last month the US seed and agrochemicals group Monsanto announced that, should it succeed in taking over Swiss firm Syngenta, it planned to move its headquarters to the UK.</p> \n<p>A mandatory common approach to setting the tax base for companies, as proposed by Moscovici, would remove many of these central elements to Osborne’s tax competition strategy. “The current rules for corporate taxation no longer fit the modern context,” Moscovici’s <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/documents/taxation/company_tax/fairer_corporate_taxation/com_2015_302.pdf\">plan claims</a>, “as corporate tax planning has become more sophisticated and competitive forces between member states have increased, the tools for ensuring fair tax competition within the EU have reached their limits.”</p> \n<p>The Treasury declined to comment on reasons for the UK’s prompt rejection of Moscovici’s tax reform proposals. It said: “Direct taxation is a matter for EU countries, and any direct taxation matters require unanimity across all EU countries. We’re fully involved in international discussions on tax issues and have consistently supported global measures, through the EU, G20 and OECD, which will strengthen international rules to prevent corporate tax avoidance.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d8fe3a629406802a732b62221e0a4dd0c55dcdd1/0_0_4473_2683/4473.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2683,"width":4473,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"POOL/Reuters","altText":"European commissioner for tax Pierre Moscovici","cleanCredit":"Photograph: POOL/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T20:19:03Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T00:10:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":339,"contributors":[{"name":"Simon Bowers","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/simonbowers"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["European Union","Tax avoidance","George Osborne","UK news","Politics","Business","Corporate governance","Europe","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"business/taxavoidance","webTitle":"Tax avoidance"},{"id":"politics/georgeosborne","webTitle":"George Osborne"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/corporate-governance","webTitle":"Corporate governance"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Simon Bowers","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/simonbowers"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/18/uk-reject-eu-plans-combat-multinational-tax-avoidance","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avgx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/18/uk-reject-eu-plans-combat-multinational-tax-avoidance","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/uk-reject-eu-plans-combat-multinational-tax-avoidance"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d8fe3a629406802a732b62221e0a4dd0c55dcdd1/0_0_4473_2683/4473.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2683,"width":4473,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"European commissioner for tax Pierre Moscovici had hoped he could water down key elements to win over hostile states.

The men, aged 19 and 16, were arrested on Thursday evening, while police were granted a further 36 hours to interview an <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/17/man-18-arrested-suspicion-murder-jordan-watson-carlisle\">18-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder on Wednesday</a>. </p> \n<p>Jordan Watson, 14, was discovered in a secluded part of Upperby cemetery, next to St John the Baptist church in Manor Road, Carlisle, Cumbria, by a member of the public at about 7.45am on Tuesday, police said. A postmortem examination revealed that the teenager, from Ridley Road in the city, died from multiple wounds to the head and neck caused by a sharp implement.<br /></p> \n<p>Jordan was described by friends and family as a cheeky, good-humoured boy. In a statement released on Wednesday night, they said: “Jordan’s favourite expression was yolo – you only live once. Jordan lived by this motto – he had a strong personality and a love of the outdoors. Jordan could not be talked out of doing something he really wanted to do.”</p> \n<p>“Jordan was very loyal, he stuck up for his brothers and sisters, he was scared of nothing. Jordan adored his girlfriend, Justine, and they spent many happy times together. Jordan loved Liverpool football club and, like his favourite team, he will never walk alone.”</p> \n<p>Cumbria police have appealed for help from the public, particularly anyone who saw or heard anything unusual in the area, or saw Jordan on Monday or the early hours of Tuesday morning. He is described as 5ft tall, of slim build and with brown hair. He was wearing a grey and blue hooded top, black Adidas T-shirt, grey tracksuit bottoms and grey Nike trainers. </p> \n<p>Det Supt Andy Slattery said: “We remain open-minded and are pursuing various lines of inquiry, so would still like to hear from anyone with information about Jordan’s whereabouts leading up to his death. We still also want to speak to anyone who noticed anything suspicious in the area on Monday evening or the early hours of Tuesday morning. <br /></p> \n<p>“The cemetery will remain closed while searches and investigations continue and we apologise for any inconvenience this may cause. We thank the community for their patience and understanding.”</p> \n<p>Jordan was last seen at approximately 11pm by a friend, at an address near the cemetery, police said.</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434668859783/4c5e94ad-8f21-4014-8b91-cf197242c4c9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Owen Humphreys/PA","altText":"Floral tributes","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T23:08:04Z","lastModified":"2015-06-18T23:45:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Rebecca Ratcliffe","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rebecca-ratcliffe"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rebecca Ratcliffe","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rebecca-ratcliffe"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/19/jordan-watson-two-more-teenagers-arrested","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avgg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jun/19/jordan-watson-two-more-teenagers-arrested","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/19/jordan-watson-two-more-teenagers-arrested"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434668859783/4c5e94ad-8f21-4014-8b91-cf197242c4c9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Floral tributes left near Upperby cemetery in Carlisle.
