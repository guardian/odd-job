He will be remembered as a role model for us all.”<br /></p> \n<p>Osman, who was of Somali heritage, had started training for Tough Mudder, a 10- to 12-mile long endurance challenge, aiming <a href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/ThirstRelief2015\">to raise &pound;165,000 for charity</a> to build wells in east Africa. </p> \n<p>Friends on social media said that Osman had been religious and had memorised the entire Qur’an.

They are synthetic chemical compounds often manufactured in the laboratories of south-east Asia and imitate the effects of more traditional illicit drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy.</p> \n<p>A Home Office bill currently going through parliament is expected to lead to a blanket ban on legal highs being introduced in England and Wales from next April.</p> \n<p>The results of the ombudsman’s investigation published on Tuesday focus on synthetic cannabinoids, including Black Mamba and Spice. They are generally odourless and are sold in hundreds of variations in chemical structure making their use “difficult to detect and to manage”.</p> \n<p>Newcomen says the use of these untested substances had led to examples of “erratic, violent and out-of-character” behaviour by some prisoners, while others were left incoherent and unable to stand up properly. There have been reports of prisoners using legal highs needing emergency hospital treatment for heart problems, high blood pressure and psychosis.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/05/theresa-may-legal-highs-ban-unenforceable-government-advisers\">Theresa May's legal highs ban is unenforceable, say government advisers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Our investigations found that some prisoners showed similar symptoms, including raised pulse rates, sweating and vomiting. There were also cases where the prisoner collapsed, or experienced something like a psychotic episode. Mr A became very unwell at work after smoking a new psychoactive substance. He was physically sick and behaving very strangely, and then died of a heart attack later that day,” reports the ombudsman.</p> \n<p>His report says that the use of legal highs appeared to be a possible trigger for self-harming by some prisoners, although it was impossible to establish a direct causal link. Many of the 19 who died were taking other drugs, including prescribed medication or other illegal substances.</p> \n<p>The ombudsman in particular cites the case of a “bubbly” and “fun-loving” woman who died after making a deep cut in her arm. Fellow inmates said she had been using legal highs and cocaine. A clinical review of her death concluded that the drugs may have triggered a psychotic episode in someone for whom such actions were entirely out of character.</p> \n<p> “I hope that by sharing the lessons from the few deaths where we know that use of such drugs was a factor, this will further support efforts in prison to address the supply of these substances, respond better to the threats they pose and help educate prisoners so as to reduce demand,” said the ombudsman.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/national-offender-management-service\">National Offender Management Service</a> has introduced a new communications strategy warning of the dangers of legal highs, targeted at prisoners, staff and visitors. More drug dogs have been trained to detect legal highs and stronger penalties introduced for those inmates found to be using them.</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436196635608/88302186-696e-4e0e-99fa-bdd928409221-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Paul Faith/PA","altText":"Legal highs fuel problems of debt and violence behind bars, a report says.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Paul Faith/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T23:01:02Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T23:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":24,"contributors":[{"name":"Alan Travis","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/alantravis"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Prisons and probation","Legal highs","UK criminal justice","Drugs policy","Drugs","Law","Politics","Society","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"society/prisons-and-probation","webTitle":"Prisons and probation"},{"id":"society/legal-highs","webTitle":"Legal highs"},{"id":"law/criminal-justice","webTitle":"UK criminal justice"},{"id":"politics/drugspolicy","webTitle":"Drugs policy"},{"id":"society/drugs","webTitle":"Drugs"},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Alan Travis","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/alantravis"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/07/legal-highs-factor-prison-deaths-ombudsman-psychoactive-substances","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4adeq","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jul/07/legal-highs-factor-prison-deaths-ombudsman-psychoactive-substances","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/07/legal-highs-factor-prison-deaths-ombudsman-psychoactive-substances"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436196635608/88302186-696e-4e0e-99fa-bdd928409221-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Legal highs fuel problems of debt and violence behind bars, a report says.

The research pulled together results from several studies carried out in different ways in the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. They found that as much as 80% of more than 17,000 women may have drank during the first trimester of pregnancy.</p> \n<p>“It is possible that some of these women were drinking before they knew they were pregnant and that could be contributing to the high rates,” said Dr Linda O’Keeffe of the cardiovascular epidemiology unit at Cambridge University. But, she said, women of childbearing age should be given better information about the risks of alcohol to the foetus. </p> \n<p>Most guidance says women should abstain from alcohol if they are, or hope to become, pregnant, she pointed out, adding that they were not blaming women. “That is not what we are trying to do here,” she said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Many women may have an episode of binge drinking before they realise they are pregnant</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>British Pregnancy Advisory Service</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The different studies also had different results for the amount of alcohol women drink. The highest rates of drinking were in Ireland, where 90% of women said they drank before pregnancy and 82% afterwards. The women who were questioned also admitted to the highest rates of binge drinking – 59% before they were pregnant and 45% during pregnancy. However, other studies showed far lower rates of drinking in Ireland – from 20-46%, with only 3% of women saying they binge drink.<br /></p> \n<p>In all countries, drinking dropped dramatically in the second trimester (between three and six months pregnant).</p> \n<p>A higher level of education, having other children, and being overweight/obese were also associated with a lower risk of drinking while pregnant, but being a smoker made it more likely that a woman would drink while pregnant.</p> \n<p>The authors write that alcohol exposure may occur in over 75% of pregnancies in the UK and Ireland. Since women drink in the first three months, when the development of the foetus is less well understood, they say, “the widespread consumption of even low levels of alcohol during pregnancy is a significant public health concern”.</p> \n<p>But the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) said this was overstated. “The prevalence of unplanned pregnancy in this country means many women may have an episode of binge drinking before they realise they are pregnant, but the monumental drop in reported binges by the second trimester suggests women alter their behaviour very quickly,” said Clare Murphy, director of external affairs.</p> \n<p>“Bpas regularly sees women so concerned about the damage caused by an episode of binge drinking before they recognised they were pregnant they consider ending what would otherwise be a wanted pregnancy. We would like to see greater reassurance to these women that they are extremely unlikely to have caused their baby harm.”</p> \n<p>They said they were concerned by a suggestion from the authors that tests to measure women’s alcohol intake in pregnancy needed to be developed. “We would be extremely wary of any measures which sought to further police pregnant women’s behaviour, and undermine the important relationship between a pregnant woman and her healthcare provider,” said Murphy.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/6e2244ec33381c84cd9456d5c650ad8eb55fb3dc/0_932_2367_1420/2367.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1420,"width":2367,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Anthony Devlin/PA","altText":"Alcohol use during pregnancy concern","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T22:30:00Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T23:35:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":97,"contributors":[{"name":"Sarah Boseley","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sarahboseley"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Pregnancy","Parents and parenting","Life and style","Health & wellbeing","Family","Society","Women","Health"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/pregnancy","webTitle":"Pregnancy"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sarah Boseley","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sarahboseley"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/concern-over-levels-of-drinking-during-pregnancy-raised-by-studies","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4adkf","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/concern-over-levels-of-drinking-during-pregnancy-raised-by-studies","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/concern-over-levels-of-drinking-during-pregnancy-raised-by-studies"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/6e2244ec33381c84cd9456d5c650ad8eb55fb3dc/0_932_2367_1420/2367.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1420,"width":2367,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alcohol use during pregnancy is ‘prevalent and socially pervasive’ in the UK and Ireland, health experts have warned, after carrying out a large-scale study.

We monitor calls, carry out undercover spot checks and work with the industry watchdog to make sure our strict guidelines are followed,” he said. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79cfe4b72bb54d7706facc36525d581345c0b628\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/79cfe4b72bb54d7706facc36525d581345c0b628/0_416_2503_1502/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olive Cooke, 92\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olive Cooke, 92, killed herself after feeling overwhelmed by fundraising requests. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A Macmillan spokeswoman said the charity do not wish to contact people if they are aware it is unwarranted. “We take the requests of our supporters very seriously and all supporters can choose to unsubscribe from communications at any time,” she said. </p> \n<p>“We would not hesitate to take robust action if we found our agencies were not acting with utmost integrity on our behalf.” </p> \n<p>An NSPCC spokesman said: “We have clear contractual arrangements in place with those that fundraise on our behalf, including strict guidance on vulnerable people, and expect the highest standards of behaviour from everyone who operates under the NSPCC banner. </p> \n<p>“We regularly review the companies we use and will take breaches of those standards extremely seriously. </p> \n<p>“Any suggestion of inappropriate activity is deeply worrying and we would want any concerns to be raised with us immediately so that they can be quickly addressed.” </p> \n<p>A British Red Cross spokeswoman said: “The British Red Cross will not tolerate lapses in maintaining the highest standards to protect vulnerable people. </p> \n<p>“We would never knowingly ask for donations from someone with Alzheimer’s or dementia, and further measures are being put in place to ensure best practice is followed at all times.”</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, the government announced <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/feb/24/companies-nuisance-calls-texts-fined-500000-ico-ofcom\">a crackdown on companies</a> that plague households with nuisance calls, allowing for fines of up to &pound;500,000.
