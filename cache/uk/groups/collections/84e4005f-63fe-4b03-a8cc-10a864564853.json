Its team of undercover researchers found that of the 500 dental surgeries advertised as accepting new patients on NHS Choices, 37% said they did not have availability, while of those that could offer an appointment, 36% said they would have to wait two weeks. One surgery said it would be eight to nine months before an appointment would be available.</p> \n<p>Which? said it was asking the Competition and Markets Authority to step in over the problem, which it said was part of a wider issue of poor information and communication in dentistry. Its investigation found that some researchers were asked to pay deposits for NHS appointments, and in one case were told this was non-refundable if the appointment was missed - even though neither of these practices is permitted under government legislation.</p> \n<p>Which? said the issues were previously identified by the Office of Fair Trading in its dentistry report in 2012, yet three years on the sector has failed to deliver on the recommendations made.</p> \n<p>Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: “We found it’s frustratingly difficult to get an NHS appointment with a dentist as information about availability doesn’t reflect reality. This is a kick in the teeth for patients and yet more evidence of poor communication from the dental sector.</p> \n<p>“We want the Competition and Markets Authority to step in and ensure that dentists put the existing rules into practice so that people can easily find out where they can get NHS dentistry.”</p> \n<p>The British Dental Association (BDA) said a “comprehensively flawed payments system at the heart of NHS dentistry” was a big factor.</p> \n<p>Since April 2006, NHS dentists in England and Wales have been paid according to how many Units of Dental Activity (UDA) they do in a year, rewarding dentists for completed treatment on the basis of a “points” system, which the BDA said has fuelled waiting lists.</p> \n<p>BDA chairman Mick Armstrong said: “The government remains committed to a byzantine system that has failed both dentists and their patients. From day one, these arbitrary targets have proved a real obstacle for new NHS patients. Dentists often have more patients lining up than they have UDAs, but the UDA must come first.</p> \n<p>“Many would like to see more patients, but this is impossible within rigid contracts. For far too long oral health has been left out of the health debate, and this new evidence provides fresh impetus for government to reassess its agenda.”</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434408065432/828454ab-a0a1-4288-b05f-e6a7492287a7-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Hermes Morrison 2 / Alamy/Alamy","altText":"Dentist","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Hermes Morrison 2 / Alamy/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T23:23:03Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T23:46:10Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Dentists","NHS","Health policy","Health","Public services policy","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"society/dentists","webTitle":"Dentists"},{"id":"society/nhs","webTitle":"NHS"},{"id":"politics/health","webTitle":"Health policy"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"society/policy","webTitle":"Public services policy"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/16/which-watchdog-dentists-waiting-lists-patients","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49zga","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jun/16/which-watchdog-dentists-waiting-lists-patients","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/16/which-watchdog-dentists-waiting-lists-patients"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434408065432/828454ab-a0a1-4288-b05f-e6a7492287a7-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A team of researchers found that of the 500 dental surgeries advertised as accepting new patients, over a third said they did not have availability.

We cannot comment any further at this time and request the press respect our privacy.”</p> \n<p>Evans, an electrician, attempted to fly to <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/kenya\">Kenya</a> in February 2011, when he was 21, but was stopped by counter-terrorism police at Heathrow. He flew to Egypt a few months later in June, telling his family he was going to learn Arabic and funding his travel through a car-boot sale.</p> \n<p>He contacted his mother in January 2012 to reveal he had travelled on to Somalia to join al-Shabaab, the jihadi group behind atrocities in Kenya, including the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/westgate-mall-attacks\">Westgate shopping mall </a>attack in which nearly 70 people were killed and 175 injured.</p> \n<p>Evan’s mother and brother told MPs on the home affairs select committee in February that she felt let down by the authorities for failing to stop him travelling to Somalia. </p> \n<p>Ms Evans, who is divorced, described her son as a “normal teenager” who enjoyed visiting the pub on a Saturday night. She said she was initially happy with his decision to convert to Islam as he had “done one or two things that I was not proud of”.</p> \n<p>But Evans’s behaviour soon changed after he changed mosques in High Wycombe and it started to concern his mother. </p> \n<p>He attempted to convert his mother and brother to Islam and refused to use the same crockery as the rest of his family, resented music being played in her home and would not enter the front room during Christmas.</p> \n<p>Evans brought a friend, Donald Stewart-Whyte, a fellow Muslim convert, to the family home, Ms Evans said. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2009/sep/07/plane-bomb-plot-trial-verdicts\">Stewart-Whyte was arrested in 2006 in connection with the liquid bomb plot to blow up planes</a> but was later cleared of any involvement.</p> \n<p>Despite being prevented from travelling to Kenya by police, authorities failed to contact Ms Evans.<br /></p> \n<p>“I wish that they had contacted us,” she told MPs. “I know he was 21, but as his mother and his brother, we could have helped them maybe, or if they had told us their concerns, we could have acted on it. We could have worked with them to help save Thomas.”</p> \n<p>Ms Evans said she would rather her son was in prison in Britain than overseas at risk of dying for “some warped ideology”.</p> \n<p>His brother said a “tipping point” came when Evans went on a charity trip in 2010 to Palestine called Road to Hope, from which he returned angry with strong views against the UK and US’s presence in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>Ms Evans phoned a helpline for people with concerns that their relatives or friends were being radicalised but felt ignored because she was not a Muslim.</p> \n<p>Evans’s brother expressed concerns that his sibling was able to travel to Egypt. “For him to go to the airport a few months later and get on a plane to Egypt, no questions asked, it just seems like there is a failure somewhere,” he said.</p> \n<p>Colonel David Obonyo, a Kenyan military spokesman, told reporters that tests were being carried out to confirm the identity of the deceased.<br /></p> \n<p>“All the available data, including photographs, points to it being Thomas Evans. There is an investigation going on with forensics and DNA to confirm his identity,” he said.</p> \n<p>A Foreign Office spokesman said: “We’re aware of reports of the death of a British national.

Hours earlier, as news of the teenager’s death filtered through, some had been crying in the street in what the local MP, Paula Sherriff, described as an open outpouring of grief.</p> \n<p>She said: “People are in a state of shock and devastation. It’s a tragedy for so many people.” Huddled in small groups outside the Mullaco mini-market, around the corner from Asmal’s house, local people tried to come to terms with how a football-loving A-level student could fall into the clutches of Islamic State (Isis) with barely anyone noticing. It is a question that is bewildering Britain’s intelligence services, as well as those who grew up with Asmal. </p> \n<p>One childhood friend, Anees Mahmood, 24, said he had seen Asmal only a week before he disappeared. He had been walking down the street with Hassan Munshi, Asmal’s next-door neighbour with whom he travelled to Iraq. As ever, he looked like an ordinary lad enjoying his teenage years, Mahmood added. </p> \n<p>He said: “It’s just really sad what happened. It feels so unimaginable for something like this to have happened, it’s like he’s just going to turn up – I know it might be mad but I don’t believe what has happened. </p> \n<p>“I’ve known his family all my life and they’re from a British cultural background as well so you wouldn’t expect anything like that,” he said.</p> \n<p>It is not the first time Savile Town has been in the headlines for its links to Islamist extremism. Hassan’s brother, Hammaad Munshi, was 16 when he was arrested by counter-terrorism police in 2006 and later became <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/07/brother-of-hassan-munshi-uk-youngest-convicted-terrorist-feared-joined-isis\">Britain’s youngest convicted Islamist extremist</a>. This West Yorkshire town was also home to Mohammad Sidique Khan, the leader of the 7/7 attacks on London in July 2005.</p> \n<p>The narrow streets where Asmal grew up also some of the most segregated in Britain. The vast majority, 98.7%, of the close-knit local population are of south Asian descent and there are only 14 white people, according to the 2011 national census. Most of the local mosques follow the ultra-conservative Deobandi tradition, including the Zakaria mosque, which is a short walk from Asmal’s home. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/15/dewsbury-in-utter-shock-at-over-talha-asmals-death-in-iraq-suicide-bombing\">Dewsbury in 'utter shock' over Talha Asmal's death in Iraq suicide bombing</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Worshippers at the mosque, where the Munshi and Asmal families pray, were reluctant to talk to the media on Monday. One man, asked whether he was surprised that anyone would want to join Isis, said only: “Yeah, it’s a shock. It’s not peaceful.” Two teenagers, who looked about Asmal’s age, flatly refused to talk to reporters. One said: “I’m not speaking to you.”</p> \n<p>Amid the anger directed at Isis, there is a simmering resentment among some in the local Muslim community that they are being wrongly linked to jihadi militants in Syria and Iraq. </p> \n<p>“These people, Isis, who call themselves Muslim, shouldn’t be allowed to call themselves Muslims. They’re no religion at all. They are terrorists,” said a local councillor, Mumtaz Hussain, who called on the media to stop describing Isis as Islamist terrorists and instead refer to them as terrorists. He added: “People are very, very upset. They will tell you we don’t want anything to do with these people because they are not Muslim.”</p> \n<p>Hussain said he had encouraged worshippers in local mosques to keep an eye on what their children were doing online following concerns raised by Asmal’s parents that their son was radicalised through social media. </p> \n<p>Both Hussain and Sherriff insist Savile Town does not have an Islamist extremism problem. Yet both agree that much more needs to be done to protect impressionable young people from being radicalised online by Isis recruiters.</p> \n<p>Sherriff said: “Obviously Savile Town has a large Asian population so there will be the inevitable suggestions that it is just in Savile Town, but if anyone looks they will see there are thousands of people who have gone to fight for Isis and as far as we are aware only two are from Savile Town.</p> \n<p>“There is some anger that this young man had been manipulated and groomed to the extent that he’s gone out there and done this. I don’t think anyone would condone what he’d done in terms of going to Iraq and blowing himself up and killing other people, but he’s been indoctrinated, he’s been brainwashed.</p> \n<p>“Everybody is accountable: schools, community leaders, politicians, mosques, churches, the councillors – anybody who comes into contact with young people who may be susceptible to radicalisation. I don’t want to lose any more people to this.”</p> \n<p>Once the television cameras have disappeared, Dewsbury will once again be left to come to terms with a local tragedy that made global headlines.</p> \n<p>“We’ve had so many issues – with Shannon Matthews, the 7/7 guy – but the community is very, very strong and we have come out of things like that,” Hussain said. “It’s unfortunate it’s happened again in Dewsbury – it shouldn’t have – but we will pull through.”</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434387568291/73eb7f3f-3f7e-47f5-af7e-ea1e42b0edb4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"John Giles/PA","altText":"A street in Savile Town, Dewsbury","cleanCredit":"Photograph: John Giles/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T17:57:01Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T23:01:26Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Josh Halliday","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/josh-halliday"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["UK news","Yorkshire","Islamic State","World news","Iraq","Middle East and North Africa"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk-news/yorkshire","webTitle":"Yorkshire"},{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/iraq","webTitle":"Iraq"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Josh Halliday","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/josh-halliday"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/15/talha-asmal-britains-youngest-suicide-bomber-savile-town-iraq-isis","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49zcv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jun/15/talha-asmal-britains-youngest-suicide-bomber-savile-town-iraq-isis","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/15/talha-asmal-britains-youngest-suicide-bomber-savile-town-iraq-isis"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434387568291/73eb7f3f-3f7e-47f5-af7e-ea1e42b0edb4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Savile Town, Dewsbury.
