The blaze broke out at the property in Langley Mill at around 4am on Sunday .</p> \n<p>Eyewitnesses said a car became engulfed in flames before it spread to the three-storey building.

He said: “There were about 20 of us fetching ladders trying to get people out. It’s a huge shock to find out people have died.”<br /></p> \n<p>A woman who lives on nearby Thompson Street also described people making frantic efforts to rescue occupants. She said: “My husband works early shifts so we were up and had the window open. I saw a glow through the window and heard deafening screaming.</p> \n<p>“We went outside for a look and there were lots of people panicking, a few came back with ladders to help save people.

He will promise a “higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare society” and<br /> attack the “tolerance of failure and complacency that has infected our<br /> national life”.</p> \n<p>On Saturday the leftwing Islington North MP <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/live/2015/jun/20/anti-austerity-demonstrations-live\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> was the only Labour leadership candidate to attend a rally of tens of thousands of people against austerity in Parliament Square. </p> \n<p>So far in the contest the frontrunners have not been very specific about which of Osborne’s potential welfare cuts they would oppose. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has backed “strong rules on contribution, expecting people to work if they can” but made clear she would “never slag off people on benefits because they can’t work as ‘workshy’ or ‘scroungers’”. </p> \n<p>Cooper has also defended the principle of tax credits for working-age people on low income, while <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/07/liz-kendall-warns-labour-break-habit-hoarding-power-centralisation\">Liz Kendall</a>, the shadow care minister, has said she wants to wait and see the details of the proposed Conservative cuts before passing judgement.</p> \n<p>Previously, Burnham has appeared to adopt a harsher tone on welfare, saying the party had left “an impression on the doorstep, a feeling, some people say, that Labour want to be soft on people who want something for nothing”.</p> \n<p>Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, the shadow health secretary appeared to sharpen his rhetoric about the way the Conservatives plan to carry out the cuts. He said he was not against all reductions in the benefits bill to help cut the deficit but he would not “go along with brutal plans that would hurt many vulnerable people”. </p> \n<p>Burnham said his “Labour way forward” would include tax incentives for companies that pay the living wage and tackling the dysfunctional housing market that leads so much housing benefit being paid to private landlords.</p> \n<p>“If this chancellor thinks it is acceptable to take benefits off disabled people who can’t replace that income, or if he is coming after the tax credits of people on low incomes in work, then he is going to have a fight on his hands,” Burnham told the Murnaghan programme. </p> \n<p>“It is questionable whether he has a mandate for cuts on this scale because he didn’t spell out before the election where these cuts were going to fall. That is wrong.”</p> \n<p>During the election campaign, Osborne and David Cameron repeatedly refused to outline exactly how they would reach the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/21/osborne-to-proceed-with-12bn-welfare-cuts-despite-anti-austerity-protests\">&pound;12bn figure</a>, apart from saying they would reduce the benefit cap, freeze most working-age benefits for two years and take away housing benefit for under-21s.</p> \n<p>Cameron has ruled out touching benefits for elderly people and child benefit, meaning the bulk of the savings will have to come from other working-age welfare payments. The most likely cuts are restrictions on <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/14/tory-welfare-cuts-would-hit-poorest-third-of-uk-families-research-shows\">child tax credits</a> and housing benefit.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/21/anti-austerity-protest-passes-off-peacefully-five-arrests\">Anti-austerity protest passes off peacefully with just five arrests</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There have been reports of disquiet among some of Osborne’s Tory colleagues about the scale of the proposed reductions. Duncan Smith is said to have been concerned to make sure the changes are designed to encourage people into work and are not just “salami slicing” the budget.</p> \n<p>Having thrashed out a deal, the two cabinet ministers issued a challenge to Labour, saying: “Even after the comprehensive rejection of their position by the British people in last month’s general election, Labour seems determined to go on as before. But even now, we appeal to their leadership candidates to engage constructively with us and to support the further savings we must make to make welfare fairer and more affordable, while protecting pensioners and the vulnerable.”</p> \n<p>This week Burnham will set out plans to back more “rent-to-own” housing and pledge to appoint a cabinet-rank housing minister. “For about a decade or more we’ve looked like a party that didn’t want to help people to get on in life,” starting with the scrapping of the 10p rate of tax, he said. This impression was “pretty toxic for any political party,” Burnham said.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434892528488/22875660-72d5-4f95-92ac-8a8b319b9797-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jeff Overs/BBC/PA","altText":"Andy Burnham, right, with fellow Labour leadership candidates Yvette Cooper, Jeremy Corbyn and Liz Kendall during a debate broadcast on Newsnight.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-21T18:11:16Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T00:00:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":795,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowena Mason","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899403654/Rowena-Mason-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rowena-mason"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Andy Burnham","Welfare","George Osborne","Labour","Economic policy","Politics","UK news","Labour party leadership"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/andyburnham","webTitle":"Andy Burnham"},{"id":"politics/welfare","webTitle":"Welfare"},{"id":"politics/georgeosborne","webTitle":"George Osborne"},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour"},{"id":"politics/economy","webTitle":"Economic policy"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/labourleadership","webTitle":"Labour party leadership"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rowena Mason","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rowena-mason"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/21/andy-burnham-rejects-osborne-call-labour-support-12bn-welfare-cuts","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a2x9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jun/21/andy-burnham-rejects-osborne-call-labour-support-12bn-welfare-cuts","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/21/andy-burnham-rejects-osborne-call-labour-support-12bn-welfare-cuts"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434892528488/22875660-72d5-4f95-92ac-8a8b319b9797-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Burnham, right, with fellow Labour leadership contenders Yvette Cooper, Jeremy Corbyn and Liz Kendall.

The British banks are not about to fail, nor are British pensioners about to suffer the plight of millions of their Greek counterparts, but some pretty severe belt-tightening is coming here too. On Saturday, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/live/2015/jun/20/anti-austerity-demonstrations-live\" title=\"\">tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through British cities,</a> including a quarter of a million in London and Glasgow, in a show of support for the other side of the argument: that austerity should be ended now. Meanwhile, Labour has been fumbling for a response for five long years. The construction of a coherent, persuasive narrative on welfare reform, and what part it should play in deficit reduction, must be at the top of the in-tray for&nbsp;the party’s next leader.</p> \n<p>The Conservative attack on Labour’s opposition to the coalition government’s cuts played a big part in reinforcing their claim that the longest and deepest recession in modern times was all down to excessive state spending. And barely had the anti-austerity protesters got home on Saturday than Mr Osborne and the work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, were declaring their commitment to go full throttle with more austerity measures. In a <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/Politics/article1571740.ece\" title=\"\">joint article</a> in the Sunday Times, they declared that they had reached agreement on the &pound;12bn cuts pledged before the election, despite <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/11/george-osborne-pressure-slow-welfare-cuts\" title=\"\">speculation that Mr Osborne was under pressure</a> from other senior Tories, including Mr Duncan Smith, to&nbsp;back off for fear of the reputational harm that more cuts might bring.</p> \n<p>This is a debate mired in misleading statistics, and there were more of them on Sunday. Take, for example, the fundamental argument Conservatives make about welfare spending, that there is too much of it. Mr Osborne repeated the assertion that he made at prime minister’s questions last week, that Britain had 1% of the world’s population and 7% of the world’s welfare spending. It is not untrue, but it is not the whole story either. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/reality-check/2015/jun/17/reality-check-uk-global-welfare-spend-george-osborne\" title=\"\">Spending on benefits both globally and as a percentage of GDP is in line with spending</a> in similar countries, including Germany and France. Most of the countries that spend less are not places many Britons would care to live. The two ministers also repeated the familiar point that the impact of cutting another &pound;12bn should be contrasted with the &pound;21bn already made. Except they cautiously used the word “legislated” for, rather than made: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11607883/Welfare-spending-How-will-the-Conservatives-handle-it.html\" title=\"\">cuts announced are far from the same as cuts delivered</a>. <a href=\"http://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/welfare-savings-and-incapacity-benefits#.VYa8L2STB3o\" title=\"\">The number on incapacity benefits stopped falling</a>, for example, after the reforms, because of administrative incompetence.</p> \n<p>But making the case in detail is an uphill task. In particular, capping household benefits to non-working households at &pound;26,000, around the level of average earnings, sounds fair and reasonable to the millions of people struggling to get on the housing ladder and stretch static pay packets across rising household bills. It is also the case that as it was introduced, the numbers getting into work began to rise. But that may well have been because of a general pick-up in the economy, rather than the incentivising impact of a reform that hit <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06294#fullreport\" title=\"\">nearly 60,000 families</a>. According to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/29/household-benefit-cap-plunge-40000-kids-poverty-memo\" title=\"\">a leak just after the election</a>, a further cut to &pound;23,000 would pitch another 40,000 children into poverty, on top of the 50,000 affected by the existing cap. It is already warping provision of new social housing, as housing associations worry that larger homes will be unaffordable.</p> \n<p>So far, the Tory cuts have been broadly popular. They have been perceived as being all about fairness and ending unintended disincentives to work. But another &pound;12bn of cuts will almost certainly be agonisingly hard to find. With pensioner benefits excluded and many other payments already frozen, savings are most likely to come at the expense of working-age young people, families with children, and people on housing benefit. The pain is likely to be felt more widely and go deeper than it did over the last five years. There will be more losers, more people experiencing real cuts in household incomes. There could, at last, be a real sense of public anger. It could provoke a real popular revolt. But Labour, as the leadership contenders recognise, would be unwise to count on it.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434909532062/Peoples-Assembly-Against--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A protester dressed as George Osborne poses during a demonstration against austerity and spending cuts on 20 June 2015 in London.

The research did not find an executive director of Chinese or east Asian heritage.</p> \n<p>In the 2011 census, 87% of the population described themselves as white. </p> \n<p>Raj Tulsiani, chief executive of Green Park, said: “Despite all the focus on increasing diversity within the FTSE 100 to help business operate more competitively around the world, our research shows that UK companies are getting less ethnically diverse rather than more over the past year. It’s particularly concerning to see that at pipeline level, we’ve lost such a large number of potential ethnic minority leaders, suggesting that the situation is likely to continue to worsen rather than improve in the future.”</p> \n<p>Of the lack of Chinese and east Asian people, Tulsiani said: “We know that this group forms the single most successful educational demographic in the UK, and has done for quite some while, so big companies need to ask themselves, why are they not drawing on this group’s talent and insights to help provide a competitive edge in targeting important markets for growth?”</p> \n<p>At boardroom level there has been an increase in the number of non-white chairs as a result of the elevation of Hikma Pharmaceuticals into the FTSE 100 in March.

The relevant budgets and human resources would also be decentralised from the Department for Education to the combined authority.</p> \n<p>It is likely that the combined authority will become the dominant form of local government in metropolitan areas over the next five years. </p> \n<p>Hunt is one of many shadow cabinet members aghast that Ed Miliband allowed the city devolution agenda to be snatched from Labour by Osborne, notably in Greater Manchester, before the election. Lord O’Neill, once seen as an ally of Labour on this issue, is now working as a Tory minister as he became disillusioned by Labour’s inability to run with the devolution agenda. </p> \n<p>Hunt will argue during the second reading of the education bill that the Conservative party has failed to understand the components that underpinned the success of the Labour sponsor academy programme, under which the management of bad schools was transferred from negligent local authority education departments to high-quality academy sponsors or trusts. </p> \n<p>Ofsted has singled out Labour’s sponsor academy programme for delivering faster progress in those academies relative to all other schools.</p> \n<p>Hunt argues that the failure of the Conservative party to retain quality assurance in selecting new sponsors, combined with the rapid acceleration of the number of schools becoming academies, has led to schools being passed from one poor provider to another. Handing responsibility for raising standards to a combined authority would fill the gap between Ofsted inspection and Whitehall oversight, Hunt believes.</p> \n<p>He said: “It is beyond the capacity of ministers to provide operational oversight for so many schools – and only an unprecedented devolution of power, capital and resource will create the conditions for a transformation in school improvement across all parts of the English education system.”</p> \n<p>Hunt points out that Conservative ministers have already faced criticism from the head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, who has concluded that for academy schools in underperforming chains, “the neglect you suffer at the hands of your local authority is indistinguishable from the neglect you endure from your new trust”.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7b9d0cca2345e43ab7a5aaf3ed963104ea9d72e9/1096_217_2498_1499/2498.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1499,"width":2498,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"DAVID HARTLEY/REX Shutterstock/DAVID HARTLEY/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Tristram Hunt","cleanCredit":"Photograph: DAVID HARTLEY/REX Shutterstock/DAVID HARTLEY/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-21T23:01:21Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T00:05:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":22,"contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Wintour","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/4/1423058528318/Patrick-Wintour-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patrickwintour"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Labour","Devolution","Education policy","Local government","Schools","UK news","Politics","Education","Society"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour"},{"id":"politics/devolution","webTitle":"Devolution"},{"id":"politics/education","webTitle":"Education policy"},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government"},{"id":"education/schools","webTitle":"Schools"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Patrick Wintour","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/patrickwintour"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/22/labour-education-oversight-city-regions","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a225","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jun/22/labour-education-oversight-city-regions","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/22/labour-education-oversight-city-regions"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7b9d0cca2345e43ab7a5aaf3ed963104ea9d72e9/1096_217_2498_1499/2498.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1499,"width":2498,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary.

However Karsten believes the baby may have been illegitimate and destined for burial in unsanctified ground, and that somebody took advantage of the bishop’s burial to give it a Christian resting place.</p> \n<p>Winstrup was a scholar, scientist, collector and theologian, and one of the founders of <a href=\"http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/\">Lund University</a> in 1666, now ranked among the top 100 in the world. He was appointed Bishop of Lund in 1638, holding the title as the diocese and the region transferred from Danish to Swedish control, and died in 1679 – probably, the research has revealed, of pneumonia after several long and painful illnesses including gout, arthritis, gallstones, plaque which would have affected his heart, and possibly tuberculosis.<br /></p> \n<p>One consequence of his wealth was that he had access to sugar, denied to most people in his day, which cost him the loss of many teeth and decay in several remaining ones.</p> \n<p> “The gall bladder also has several gallstones, which could indicate a high consumption of fatty food,” Caroline Ahlstr&ouml;m Arcini, an osteologist working on the project, said. He had also injured a tendon in his shoulder, which she said meant he would have had difficulty even with simple tasks, such as combing his hair or putting on a shirt.</p> \n<p> The coffin was opened in order to apply modern scientific techniques to a body known to be in remarkable condition. The other surprise for the scientists was that the body was not embalmed; it was naturally dried out with all its internal organs. The bishop was buried on a mattress stuffed with herbs including juniper and wormwood, and a pillow of hops, which the scientists believe would not just have masked the smell but helped preserve the remains.<br /></p> \n<p>Although the colours have faded, his clothes were also perfectly preserved, including a velvet cape and leather gloves. </p> \n<p>More tests are planned, but the two bodies will eventually be reburied – together. <br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434887965836/b48bc443-376b-42ce-b171-82c6dc1c9698-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Gunnar Menander","altText":"The mummified body of Bishop Peder Winstrup.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Gunnar Menander"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434889076168/8e56280b-a442-498c-9482-d031870776de-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Scans revealed the remains of a baby tucked under the feet of Swedish bishop Peder Winstrup.
