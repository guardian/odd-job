London Underground said it would remain available for last-ditch talks on Wednesday but union negotiators said they saw no point returning before the strike.</p> \n<p>Staff voted overwhelmingly for action in separate ballots, with train drivers particularly incensed at demands to work new night and weekend shifts for little extra compensation. The last, improved offer was for an average 2% pay rise this year with &pound;2,000 for drivers on the new all-night service. But it was rejected by the RMT, Aslef, TSSA and Unite unions.</p> \n<p>Tube services will wind down from 6pm Wednesday evening and none will run throughout Thursday, but the Docklands light railway, London overground and other rail services into the capital will still operate. </p> \n<p>Transport for London said it would run extra bus and river services in the event of a strike and roadworks would be suspended wherever possible. It warned that all public transport and roads would be much busier than usual. </p> \n<p>Tfl will deploy travel ambassadors and volunteers to hand out maps at central London transport hubs and to assist in giving directions, as well as putting marshals at rail station taxi ranks to manage demand. The congestion charge will still apply. </p> \n<p>It is encouraging people to cycle, using their own bike wherever possible because demand is expected to be intense for the cycle hire scheme. TfL will focus extra resources replenishing central docking bays.</p> \n<p>London Underground’s chief operating officer, Steve Griffiths, said: “Our customers are advised to <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/tube/tube-strike?cid=tube-strike\">check the TfL website</a> for the latest information as we seek to resolve the dispute and to keep London moving should the unions go ahead with their action. We are available for talks at Acas all day.”</p> \n<p>The gap between the unions and the Tube management became clear as both sides bitterly denounced the other’s negotiating stance at Acas. Aslef accused London Underground of “playing foolish games of brinkmanship” and misleading staff and the public, while the RMT’s general secretary Mick Cash said that the company had “come up with nothing in the talks this afternoon” despite strenuous efforts by union negotiators.</p> \n<p>But London Underground boss Mike Brown said: “It’s very disappointing and amazing to me that the strike is going ahead. We haven’t had any response. We think it’s a very fair, reasonable offer. They haven’t given us any feedback. I’ve never seen a negotiating approach like it in 28 years.” </p> \n<p>Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef said the dispute was entirely the fault of TfL, which announced plans for the night tube services “without proper negotiation, on the same day as nearly 1,000 redundancies on the London Underground”.</p> \n<p>He added: “The suspicion is that TfL don’t really want to run the night tube, which is why, after months of not talking to us, they only improved their offer yesterday. We believe in the night tube because we believe that London deserves a 24-hour public transport service. But we also believe in a proper work-life balance for the drivers who are delivering that service.”</p> \n<p>In a separate dispute, RMT staff on First Great Western trains will be striking for 48 hours from 6.30pm on Wednesday, affecting commuter services into the capital as well as trains across the rail network to south-west England and Wales.</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/572aa11827fd7de02dfaca41b62cd474727dc7f7/0_233_3500_2102/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2102,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chris Radburn/PA","altText":"London Underground","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T13:35:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T23:01:15Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":120,"contributors":[{"name":"Gwyn Topham","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/gwyntopham"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["London Underground","Trade unions","Rail transport","London","UK news","RMT","Unite","Transport","TfL","Politics"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/london-underground","webTitle":"London Underground"},{"id":"politics/tradeunions","webTitle":"Trade unions"},{"id":"uk/rail-transport","webTitle":"Rail transport"},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk-news/rmt","webTitle":"RMT"},{"id":"politics/unite","webTitle":"Unite"},{"id":"uk/transport","webTitle":"Transport"},{"id":"uk/tfl","webTitle":"TfL"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Gwyn Topham","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/gwyntopham"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/07/london-underground-tube-strike-talks-resume","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aec6","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jul/07/london-underground-tube-strike-talks-resume","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/07/london-underground-tube-strike-talks-resume"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/572aa11827fd7de02dfaca41b62cd474727dc7f7/0_233_3500_2102/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2102,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Train drivers are angry at demands to work new night and weekend shifts when tube services are expanded in September.

He said the &pound;750m cost of taking on free licence fees for over-75s was more than matched by the deal he had struck with with the Treasury. Other estimates have suggested the BBC’s funding will be cut by as much as 12%.<br /></p> \n<p>Appearing on Radio 4’s Today, Hall pointed to George Osborne’s vow to allow the licence fee to increase in line with inflation, the “modernisation” of the &pound;145.50 fee structure to incorporate online viewing and an end to top-slicing of money to fund rural broadband.</p> \n<p>Bragg, the presenter of Radio 4’s In Our Time, told the Guardian: “The BBC being asked to be part of the social services and look after [Welsh language channel] S4C and the World Service, and now the over-75s, is completely and utterly mistaken and wrong.<br /></p> \n<p>“The BBC is there to make programmes for domestic licence fee payers; paying for the licence fees of over-75s is the government’s responsibility.

There are lots of opinions from all sides worth listening to.</p> \n<p>“Cutting corners has always struck me as a bit dodgy. Tony Hall obviously thinks it’s a good deal and I hope they have got a good a deal as they think. Like all friends of the BBC, I am anxious about this settlement.”</p> \n<p>Iannucci, the acclaimed writer, producer and director, said the government was intent on diminishing and belittling the BBC.</p> \n<p>“Why does everyone, government included, seem so insistent on diminishing and belittling one of our greatest British success stories?” he said.</p> \n<p>“From my time out in the US working with HBO I got a real sense of how admired the BBC was for its consistent quality and extraordinary output. If we want to make more money to give back to licence-payers, we should be out there championing the BBC around the world, not playing petty point-scoring with it at home.”</p> \n<p>Iannucci later said on Twitter: “So sad to see the government’s demonising of the BBC. Best in the world at what it does, the BBC is a British success story.”</p> \n<p>BBC executives have <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2014/mar/06/bbc3-no-guarantee-future-bbc4-danny-cohen\">previously failed to guarantee the future of another of its channels, BBC4</a>, saying last year it would depend on any future licence fee settlement.</p> \n<p>The shadow culture secretary, Labour MP Chris Bryant, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/07/full-details-of-bbc-deal-should-be-published-says-labour-mp\">called for full details of the government’s deal with the BBC to be published</a> in order for the public to decide whether it represents a “good use of money”.<br /></p> \n<p>In a letter to culture secretary John Whittingdale, Bryant has demanded to see the correspondence sent between the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Treasury and Hall formalising a deal bashed out in just a few days.</p> \n<p>“This really doesn’t look like a good deal for the BBC,” said Bryant. “It feels as if the BBC had a gun to their head and chose to get shot in the leg instead. It is bound to lead to cuts in jobs, services and quality.

But the benefits of screening have been questioned, with critics pointing out that it can also cause harm. Some women undergo biopsies only to be given the all-clear, while others may be treated for a small growth that would not trouble them in their lifetime. </p> \n<p>A major review in 2012, commissioned by the then cancer tsar, Prof Sir Mike Richards, concluded that the harm was greater than women had been told but that the screening programme still saved lives.</p> \n<p>The latest salvo in the war over breast cancer screening, however, threatens to reopen the debate. Leading cancer epidemiologists have gone back to the original trials carried out in Sweden in the 1960s and 1970s, which provided the evidence on which the UK and other screening programmes were based. Those trials found that screening could prevent 20-25% of breast cancer deaths. In a paper in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, the experts say the methodology of the study was wrong and that figure is far too high. They believe that any reduction of deaths is probably less than 10%.</p> \n<p>They point out that advanced cancers most likely to cause death have not dropped dramatically in areas that have had screening programmes for many years. “Contrary to expectations, numerous studies in North America, Europe and Australia have shown that the rates of advanced breast cancer have not declined in countries where most women regularly attend mammography screening,” said the lead author, Prof Philippe Autier, from the Institute of Global Public Health, a joint health research initiative of Strathclyde University and the Lyon-based International Prevention Research Institute (iPRI). </p> \n<p>That is in contrast to cervical and bowel cancer screening, they say. Deaths have halved in the past couple of decades but the drop is to do with better treatment, rather than mammograms.</p> \n<p>Prof Richard Sullivan from the Institute of Cancer Policy, King’s College London, said the study was carried out because India, Brazil, China and other developing countries are being pressed to set up expensive screening programmes that may or may not be the best use of limited money to fight cancer. “We are working in India, where there is enormous pressure from interested groups to put in breast screening,” he said.</p> \n<p>To try to bring useful new evidence to bear, Autier and Prof Peter Boyle, director of the University of Strathclyde Institute of Global Public Health at iPRI, who are both highly skilled epidemiologists, looked at the original trials. They found “major fundamental errors in the statistical analysis”, said Sullivan. “We have tried to be very pure about this. Actually there is a real intrinsic problem with the statistical methodology used. It was not correct. There was a very small benefit.”</p> \n<p>The paper is important for countries that already have screening programmes, he said. “At some point Britain will have to re-review its policy and this will be one of the pieces. My feeling is, give it another two years and Britain may need to constitute another group in 2017. The screening debate is far from over.”</p> \n<p>But Prof Julietta Patnick, director of the NHS cancer screening programmes, managed by Public Health England, fell back on the conclusions of the review set up by Richards. </p> \n<p>“A 2012 independent UK review of breast screening looked at the evidence from these trials and estimated that inviting women aged 50-70 for screening reduces mortality from breast cancer in the population invited by 20% and saves an estimated 1,300 lives a year in the UK,” she said.</p> \n<p>“However, there are potential risks as well as benefits associated with breast screening, including over-diagnosis, and it is important that women are given information that is clear and accessible before they go for a mammogram.” Women should make “an informed choice” as to whether or not to attend screening, she said.</p> \n<p><em> <br /></em><br /></p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/cc9ae29672538f63464985cec8eabe387e275e9a/43_29_3308_1985/3308.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1985,"width":3308,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Rui Vieira/PA","altText":"A consultant studying a mammogram.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Rui Vieira/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T23:05:01Z","lastModified":"2015-07-08T00:10:23Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":46,"contributors":[{"name":"Sarah Boseley","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sarahboseley"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Breast cancer","Health","Medical research","Science","Society","NHS","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"society/breast-cancer","webTitle":"Breast cancer"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"science/medical-research","webTitle":"Medical research"},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"society/nhs","webTitle":"NHS"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sarah Boseley","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sarahboseley"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/08/breast-screening-does-not-reduce-cancer-deaths-international-study-warns","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aey2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jul/08/breast-screening-does-not-reduce-cancer-deaths-international-study-warns","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/08/breast-screening-does-not-reduce-cancer-deaths-international-study-warns"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/cc9ae29672538f63464985cec8eabe387e275e9a/43_29_3308_1985/3308.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1985,"width":3308,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A consultant studying a mammogram.

What pains me to say today though is that English nationalism is to be found on the Treasury bench.”</p> \n<p>The debate motion was defeated by a majority of 291 to 2 after the government abstained. While opposition MPs seized on this as a symbolic victory, perhaps more significant was the point of order then raised by Conservative MP David Davis. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/blog/live/2015/jul/07/consumers-paying-12bn-a-year-too-much-for-energy-competition-watchdog-says-politics-live\">MPs hold emergency debate on English votes for English laws (Evel) - Politics live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He said that some Tory MPs had abstained because they agreed with opposition members that more time should be set aside to consider the Evel (English votes for English law) proposals, and requested advice on how best to “communicate that to the government”.</p> \n<p>Carmichael, the former Lib Dem Scottish secretary, requested the debate after opposition to the government’s plans from Labour, the SNP and his own party, in particular in relation to whether they should be introduced through standing orders or primary legislation.<br /></p> \n<p>Describing the government as exhibiting “disrespect” for the Commons, the SNP MP and chair of the Scottish affairs committee, Pete Wishart, said: “What they are creating is a quasi-English parliament in the unitary parliament of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.”</p> \n<p>The proposals brought forward by Chris Grayling, the leader of the Commons, would give English MPs two chances to veto legislation and clauses relating to devolved matters, including some tax measures.</p> \n<p>Denouncing the proposals as a “constitutional outrage”, the shadow leader of the Commons, Angela Eagle, argued that the government was “more interested in pursuing a partisan procedural fix rather than working to keep the union together”.</p> \n<p>She went on to accuse the Tories of putting narrow party interests first. “It is the case that the government’s changes will turn their slim majority of 12 into something over three figures if Scottish and Welsh MPs are to be prevented from voting.</p> \n<p>“I believe this is the real driver for these changes and it makes the outrageous procedural fix of using standing orders rather than legislation to produce the change even more unacceptable. The unintended consequences of what they are doing could be very large indeed and the precedents they are setting are dire.”</p> \n<p>Conservative Sir Gerald Howarth responded that Labour must take responsibility for the situation that parliament found itself in, arguing that Evel “addresses a longstanding sense of grievance in England”.</p> \n<p>Challenged by Eagle on whether MPs would be able to amend the proposed new standing orders, Grayling promised to allow amendments to be put to a vote when MPs debate and vote on the plans next week. </p> \n<p>He insisted that the best way to introduce these changes was via standing orders but assured MPs that when the government reviews the process next year, it would be open to the idea of introducing primary legislation on the issue.</p> \n<p>Under the proposals, if a law relates to matters that have been devolved to the other countries in the UK, English MPs will take part in two new stages of consideration of legislation.</p> \n<p>The first would take the form of a grand committee in which only English MPs – or English and Welsh MPs – would be able to vote on legislation relating to their nations before the third reading of a bill. The second stage would come after the bill has passed through the Lords, when it would have to be approved by a double majority of all MPs as well as English MPs, or English and Welsh MPs.</p> \n<p>During the fierce debate on Tuesday afternoon, opposition MPs also raised concerns about the position of the Speaker, John Bercow, who would ultimately determine whether laws relate to citizens across the UK, English constituencies, or English and Welsh constituencies. Wishart warned Bercow: “You will have possibly the most political role in the House.”</p> \n<p>There was also argument around how Evel would cater for “Barnett consequentials”, the fact that decisions about English matters may have a knock-on effect in Scotland because of the Barnett formula, which governs the allocation of spending in the four nations that make up the UK.</p> \n<p>The former SNP leader Alex Salmond said that Scottish voters would be affected by legislation on schools and NHS budgets in England through that formula. </p> \n<p>The former Labour leader Ed Miliband described the proposals as “an act of constitutional vandalism”, adding: “It is not true to the great traditions of Conservatism and unionism.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/21ffd47a5fdebb93922afe2bcdb63bda2db0ee55/0_6_3500_2100/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2100,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Stefan Rousseau/PA","altText":"Ex-MPS given passes<br>File photo dated 07/08/13 of The Palace of Westminster.
