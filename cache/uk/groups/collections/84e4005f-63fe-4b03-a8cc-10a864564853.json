We have made a very fair and reasonable offer to our staff, but the unions have so far refused to respond or put it to their members. The offer remains on the table and we are ready for talks.</p> \n<p>“We have contacted Acas and asked them to assist us in getting back around the table. If the unions are serious about resolving this, we trust they will be ready to engage in meaningful talks to deliver night tube for London.</p> \n<p>“We have put forward a very, very fair offer, which consists of an average salary increase of 2%, 1% or RPI (whichever is greater) for next year and the one after, plus a &pound;500 night tube launch bonus and an additional &pound;2,000 bonus for night Tube train drivers.</p> \n<p>“No one will have to work more hours than they do now, and we have a longer term plan, which will mean no one will need to work nights if they don’t want to.”</p> \n<p>The London mayor, Boris Johnson, cast doubt over the date for the introduction of the night tube, refusing to rule out that the service would not be launched on 12 September as previously announced by TfL.</p> \n<p>“We have got to get on with the night tube. The unions don’t like it, they don’t think that we should be able to do this. I think it is essential for the city, they want to show that you can’t do a huge change like this without them expressing their views.</p> \n<p>“Unfortunately what has happened is that the union leadership has basically been spoiling for a big fight on this. I think they were very disappointed by the election result in May.”</p> \n<p>Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union said: “Bulldozing through the new rosters without discussion and outside of the long-standing agreements was always a disaster waiting to happen.</p> \n<p>“Of course staff feel angry that they are being bullied into accepting new patterns that would wreck work/life balance. LU have to wake up and understand that grievance instead of pretending that it doesn’t exist.</p> \n<p>“The company also need to remember that we remain in dispute with them over the parallel issue of 850 station staff jobs losses – job losses that would make a mockery of delivering passenger and staff safety on the night tube.

IFS director Paul Johnson said: “Unequivocally, tax credit recipients in work will be made worse off by the measures in the budget on average.”</p> \n<p>The IFS said there were bound to be more losers than winners, as higher wages from the increase in the minimum wage would amount to &pound;4bn in income, while the welfare changes will save the government &pound;12bn. </p> \n<p>The IFS said that 13m families would lose an average of &pound;5 a week as a result of extending the freeze in working-age benefits, tax credits and the local housing allowance, until 2020.</p> \n<p>Changes to Universal Credit, which affect the amount people can earn before benefits start to be withdrawn, will cost 3m families an average of &pound;1,000 a year.</p> \n<p>Johnson said: “Significant allowances were an integral part of the design of Universal Credit, intended to give claimants an incentive to move into work.

Johnson said that the budget would lead to a “lower welfare country”, as the chancellor promised, but “was not quite consistent with the boast that it was aimed at a lower tax country”.</p> \n<p>Johnson described Osborne’s decision to increase the minimum wage for over-25s to &pound;9 an hour by 2020 as “a gamble”, saying that the only guaranteed way of securing higher wages was to boost productivity. He added: “We still await details of how that is to be tackled. Simply forcing wage increases by government fiat, by hiking the minimum wage, is more of a gamble.”</p> \n<p>It was, he said, “a deeply disappointing budget for those of us who hoped the chancellor might take the chance to improve, simplify and reform our creaking tax system.

Some other countries pay considerably higher wage rates than the UK.” </p> \n<p>The Treasury said “it was confident the increase in the minimum wage will not have any impact on migration flows”. </p> \n<p>A Ukip spokesman said the chancellor faced a Hobson’s choice; if he does something to make life life easier for low-paid workers in this country inevitably in so doing, given the relatively low wage rates in the rest of Europe, he makes this country an even more attractive place to work. </p> \n<p>“Ukip has always thought the in-work tax credits are marginal in decisions about whether to come here. We have a deeper philosophical disagreement that we cannot decide who comes to his country,” the spokesman said.</p> \n<p>A table produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility alongside the budget shows the government plan to lift the national living wage for those aged over 25 to 60% of median earnings would put the minimum wage right at the top of table in terms of relative generosity – well ahead of most eastern EU nations including Poland and Romania.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"782dc43f8e5e3051c98e250605027e29f8c72668\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/782dc43f8e5e3051c98e250605027e29f8c72668/0_0_2360_1258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adult minimum wage relative to full-time median earnings in 2013.

We had been pressing the DH and NHS England about where this work was going because we had to look at how services were staffed and not just one profession within those services.”</p> \n<p>Baker told the HSJ: “That potentially wider staffing guidance could well have had profound effects on the organisation of healthcare and almost certainly more profound than would be comfortable for either commissioners of services or their political masters.</p> \n<p>“With the exception of general acute ward staffing, there isn’t any reliable evidence of the relationship between nursing staff numbers and patient safety. Because of that, it is difficult for the guidance to have any real credibility, whoever produces it.</p> \n<p>“We were asked the wrong question in restricting it to nursing and, even if it had been broader, I’m not sure the guidance would have deserved any greater credence because it is not a well-researched area.”</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e42cb7a850766a45b60c3729f996e1050990230f/47_98_1771_1063/1771.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1063,"width":1771,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Stefan Wermuth/REUTERS","altText":"Jeremy Hunt NHS safe staffing levels","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/REUTERS"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T23:01:06Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T23:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"James Meikle","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jamesmeikle"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["NHS","Jeremy Hunt","The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice)","UK news","Health","Politics","Society"],"tags":[{"id":"society/nhs","webTitle":"NHS"},{"id":"politics/jeremy-hunt","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt"},{"id":"society/the-national-institute-for-health-and-care-excellence-nice","webTitle":"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice)"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"James Meikle","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jamesmeikle"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/10/nice-publish-report-safe-nhs-staffing-levels-told-stop-work","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aght","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jul/10/nice-publish-report-safe-nhs-staffing-levels-told-stop-work","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/10/nice-publish-report-safe-nhs-staffing-levels-told-stop-work"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e42cb7a850766a45b60c3729f996e1050990230f/47_98_1771_1063/1771.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1063,"width":1771,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, has said expensive staffing agencies are ‘ripping off the NHS’.

In line with protocol, the doctor then called the police to tell them there was a newborn and the woman had left hospital. “The priority of health authorities is the protection and the health of the child. This was a child that still had the umbilical cord attached.”<br /></p> \n<p>Asked if doctors were worried about the health of the child, or about whether this was the child’s mother, the spokesman replied: “It was both. There was a health risk because it was a newborn baby. And, given the reaction of the woman, the professional called the national police, who brought the case to the judicial authorities.” Police returned Cottle and the baby to hospital pending the DNA tests.<br /></p> \n<p>Cottle has claimed that the doctors maintained their scepticism even after an examination showed that she had recently given birth. She said she stayed in the maternity ward while Anzelika was held in the neonatal unit, and that she was allowed only limited – and supervised – access to her infant for feeding. Her older daughter, Annabella, had to be looked after by her mother.<br /></p> \n<p>The DNA results, proving she was the mother, arrived on Tuesday, three weeks after the birth on 16 June. Only then was she allowed to claim her new daughter from the neonatal ward.<br /></p> \n<p>The spokesman said the restrictions on Cottle seeing her daughter in hospital were “because of schedules”, which had been ordered by the judge who also ordered the DNA test. “The DNA test results came back to us on 7 July. Then we had to wait for the judicial order, which established the maternal relation and archived the case. Immediately the hospital proceeded to release the newborn baby with her birth certificate and with her schedule of follow-up appointments for her family doctor as is normal.<br /></p> \n<p>“We don’t know this woman, or if she’s here or not, or if she’s going to her country or not. But as it is a newborn born in Spain and in Malaga, we’re responsible for giving her a series of follow-up appointments so the baby is taken care of. All we did was follow a protocol that we have, in which the priority is the protection and assistance of that minor, in this case a newborn baby. <br /></p> \n<p>“This newborn was taken from the hospital by the mother. As soon as that happened, we couldn’t be sure that the baby was being cared for. I don’t know how it works in England, if it’s very common to have babies at home and come to the hospital so that they can be registered. But we have to confirm that she is the mother. <br /></p> \n<p>“And on top of it, her reaction was to leave the hospital. It wasn’t a very normal reaction. She should have stayed at the hospital with her baby.”<br /></p> \n<p>Asked if there were worries that Cottle had stolen the baby, or that the child was trafficked, the spokesman said: “I don’t know. The only thing I can tell you is that in the face of the reaction of the woman to leave the hospital, the personnel activated the protocol. It was a newborn with its umbilical cord on the streets. The situation wasn’t very normal.”</p> \n<p>Cottle has said she had received no apology from the hospital and that the situation was never satisfactorily explained to her. She has told the Guardian: “Repeatedly, during my stay in the hospital, I was called a criminal by staff and patients, from the day we were admitted to practically the day we left.” She now plans to return to London with both her daughters as soon as possible.<br /></p> \n<p>Cottle has said she believes race might have played a part in the hospital’s actions, and told the Guardian: “One of the doctors said she believed I may have been from Kenya or Senegal. I have no proof race was involved, but I heard that from a doctor. It made no sense, because by this time they’d taken photocopies of my British passport.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4049759c42f40b824d44ecabbdf853eda19e267c/0_658_960_576/960.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":576,"width":960,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"The Olive Press Spain","altText":"Stacie Cottle","cleanCredit":"Photograph: The Olive Press Spain"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T17:40:41Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T17:56:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ashifa Kassam","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ashifa-kassam"},{"name":"Caroline Davies","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/5/26/1432636572595/Caroline-Davies-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/carolinedavies"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Spain","Europe","World news","Childbirth","Health & wellbeing","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"world/spain","webTitle":"Spain"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/childbirth","webTitle":"Childbirth"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/09/spanish-hospital-that-took-uk-womans-baby-did-so-in-best-interests-of-the-child","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agk7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/09/spanish-hospital-that-took-uk-womans-baby-did-so-in-best-interests-of-the-child","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/09/spanish-hospital-that-took-uk-womans-baby-did-so-in-best-interests-of-the-child"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4049759c42f40b824d44ecabbdf853eda19e267c/0_658_960_576/960.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":576,"width":960,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Stacie Cottle with her newborn daughter in Malaga.

It said: “The chief constable faced 10 charges of gross misconduct, three charges of misconduct and has been found guilty of eight at a level of misconduct.”<br /></p> \n<p>The statement said the chair of the panel, Dorian Lovell-Pank QC, will write a report on the panel’s findings and will recommend any sanctions the chief constable should face under police regulations.</p> \n<p>It said: “Police and crime commissioner Sue Mountstevens will hold a sanction hearing with the chief constable following receipt of the panel’s report.</p> \n<p>“On the basis of the panel’s findings, Chief Constable Nick Gargan’s suspension has today been lifted. A phased return to work is being prepared for after the sanction hearing.” </p> \n<p>It is believed the sanctions hearing will be held within weeks – until which time Gargan is expected to stay away from the office. Mountstevens does not have to accept the panel’s conclusions nor their recommendations on any sanctions, but it is thought likely she will do so. <br /></p> \n<p>Kevin Phillips, chairman of Avon and Somerset Police Federation, said: “From my point of view, it puts the organisation in a tricky situation if you have somebody from within who has been found guilty of eight counts of misconduct, whatever those charges are.</p> \n<p>“Obviously, that will be down to Sue Mountstevens to make a decision as to how serious she feels that is.”</p> \n<p>Details of exactly what Gargan has been found guilty of will only be made public after the sanctions hearing. </p> \n<p>The police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, was initially <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/ipcc-begins-independent-investigation-chief-constable-avon-and-somerset-police\">asked by Mountstevens</a> to investigate when the complaints about inappropriate behaviour surfaced.<a href=\"http://%20https//www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/ipcc-begins-independent-investigation-chief-constable-avon-and-somerset-police\"> </a></p> \n<p>In July last year the IPCC said that, as part of its inquiry, it had allegedly <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/avon-and-somerset-chief-constable-be-interviewed-under-criminal-caution\">uncovered evidence</a> that Gargan may have breached the Data Protection Act “by sending emails concerning police business, some of which contained personal data, to individuals unconnected to the force”. It said Gargan had been served with a notice informing him that this aspect of his conduct was subject to a criminal investigation. </p> \n<p>Gargan was interviewed under criminal caution but the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/investigation-avon-and-somerset-chief-constable-concluded\">IPCC decided</a> that it was a matter for Mountstevens to consider under the disciplinary process – along with the allegations relating to inappropriate behaviour towards female colleagues. </p> \n<p>The IPCC later also decided that the misconduct hearing should take place behind closed doors – partly because of concerns that vulnerable witnesses could not be protected if it was held in public. <br /></p> \n<p>Speaking through the Chief Police Officers’ Staff Association, Gargan said: “I accept the findings of the panel and apologise that my actions have fallen below the standards expected of a chief constable. I am pleased that the more serious gross misconduct allegations were found not to be proven including any allegation of inappropriate advances towards female colleagues. I am relieved and very pleased that my suspension is at an end. <br /></p> \n<p>“I await the panel chair’s report and my meeting with the police and crime commissioner, and will have no further comment to make until then.”</p> \n<p>Gargan took over as chief in March 2013 from Colin Port, who left after being told by Mountstevens – then newly elected as crime commissioner – that he would have to reapply for his job.<br /></p> \n<p>One of Gargan’s first tasks was to oversee policing of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2013/aug/27/badger-cull-gloucestershire-somerset-nfu\">badger cull</a> in Somerset. He has also found his force in the national spotlight for the wrong reasons over the case of Iraqi refugee <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2013/oct/29/vigilante-murder-paedophile-bristol-bijan-ebrahimi\">Bijan Ebrahimi</a>, who was murdered by vigilantes after reporting his concerns to the police. His force also helped out with the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/gallery/2014/mar/16/somerset-flooding-aftermath-its-total-devastation-in-pictures\">floods in Somerset</a>.</p> \n<p>Gargan is a fitness fanatic and a supporter of Leicester City football club. Shortly before his suspension he told the Guardian that crime writers should <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/apr/29/crime-fiction-clean-living-cops-police-chief\">depict more detectives as clean-living</a> and balanced rather than damaged and hard-drinking, like Inspector Rebus in Ian Rankin’s novels. </p> \n<p>Mountstevens is a former director of a Bristol family bakery chain and was a surprise winner when she stood as police commissioner as an independent and beat the Conservative favourite. One of her priorities has been to tackle violence against and sexual abuse of women.</p> \n<p>Gargan has denied wrongdoing. He has the right to appeal against both the decision of the panel and any sanctions. If he does appeal the process could go on for several more months.</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d2b2b4fe1129a6cb8d90347adf95aeff792f10f7/0_142_1560_935/1560.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":935,"width":1560,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andrew Parsons/PA","altText":"Nick Gargan, chief constable of Avon and Somerset police","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andrew Parsons/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T17:01:29Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T23:01:49Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Steven Morris","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stevenmorris"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["UK news","Police"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk/police","webTitle":"Police"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Steven Morris","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stevenmorris"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/09/nick-gargan-avon-somerset-police-chief-constable-guilty-misconduct","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agkd","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jul/09/nick-gargan-avon-somerset-police-chief-constable-guilty-misconduct","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/09/nick-gargan-avon-somerset-police-chief-constable-guilty-misconduct"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d2b2b4fe1129a6cb8d90347adf95aeff792f10f7/0_142_1560_935/1560.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":935,"width":1560,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nick Gargan, chief constable of Avon and Somerset police, will now face a sanction hearing.

More than 3,000 pupils in 48 state primary schools across England took part in a year-long trial as part of a study named “philosophy for children”, and found that their maths and reading levels benefited by the equivalent of two months’ worth of teaching.</p> \n<p>A Durham University evaluation said the results showed faster rates of progress for pupils eligible for free school meals, suggesting that the technique could “be used to reduce the attainment gap in terms of poverty in the short term”.</p> \n<p>In the trial, key stage two classes of pupils aged between 8 and 11 were given regular classroom sessions featuring pupil-led discussions on topics such as fairness or bullying. Teachers received special training to act as moderators, while the children sat in a discussion circle.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.dur.ac.uk/education/staff/profile/?id=11539\">Stephen Gorard</a>, professor of education at Durham and author of the evaluation, said: “I think this study is interesting. All of the indicators are positive, even if they are small, and it’s a relatively small cost.”</p> \n<p>Gorard said he couldn’t explain the success of the debates in improving an unrelated subject such as maths, but suggested that such open-ended discussions were unusual in primary classrooms, and meant children were more engaged and found school more enjoyable. “This is one particular approach and it’s shown to have a positive effect on attainment, but we need to wait for replication [of the outcome] before drawing stronger conclusions,” he said.</p> \n<p>Durham University has received funding from the Nuffield Foundation to conduct further research.</p> \n<p>Both teachers and pupils also reported improved classroom behaviour and relationships, as well as a boost to pupils’ confidence in speaking, patience when listening to others, and self-esteem. Some teachers said the discussions had a positive impact on classroom engagement and may have resulted in some pupils asking more questions across all lessons.</p> \n<p>The philosophy for children movement originated in the US in the 1970s. The version used in the trial, funded by the <a href=\"https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/\">Education Endowment Fund</a>, was supported by a British charity, the <a href=\"http://www.sapere.org.uk/\">Society for the Advancement of Philosophical Enquiry and Reflection in Education</a> (Sapere).</p> \n<p>“We’re delighted to see such positive results for the students after only just over a year of philosophy for children – particularly for those facing disadvantage – and we anticipate that these benefits will continue to be built on in subsequent years,” said Bob House, Sapere’s chief executive.</p> \n<p>But <a href=\"http://www.martinrobinson.net/writing.html\">Martin Robinson</a>, a teacher and author who espouses an updated classical education based on grammar, dialectic and rhetoric, said that the use of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/apr/14/force-majeure-films-philosophy-memento-ida-its-a-wonderful-life\">philosophical discussion</a> would be improved if schools adopted it in other subjects. “It’s got to be about more than just the opportunity to speak,” said Robinson. “These techniques should be part of how we approach teaching, and that would be much more powerful.”</p> \n<p>Another piece of new research funded by the EEF found little positive effect from a project designed to improve the reading and literacy skills of children from low-income families. The study aimed to address the “knowledge gap” between disadvantaged and affluent children by building up their background knowledge and understanding, a cause espoused by the US academic ED Hirsch.</p> \n<p>However, the report found that “teachers’ subject knowledge did not appear to be sufficient to support a deep and engaging discussion of the material included in the curriculum”. </p>","section":"Education","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bb11833e5797bd59d3c57ee330d2e6337986acb0/0_47_2440_1464/2440.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1464,"width":2440,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dave Thompson/PA","altText":"Children in class","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dave Thompson/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T23:01:06Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T23:21:22Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":40,"contributors":[{"name":"Richard Adams","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/richardadams"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Schools","Education","Philosophy","Mathematics","Literacy","Science","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"education/schools","webTitle":"Schools"},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education"},{"id":"education/philosophy","webTitle":"Philosophy"},{"id":"education/mathematics","webTitle":"Mathematics"},{"id":"education/literacy","webTitle":"Literacy"},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"education"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Richard Adams","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/richardadams"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"education"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/jul/10/philosophy-for-children-pupils-maths-literacy","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agn8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/education/2015/jul/10/philosophy-for-children-pupils-maths-literacy","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/10/philosophy-for-children-pupils-maths-literacy"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bb11833e5797bd59d3c57ee330d2e6337986acb0/0_47_2440_1464/2440.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1464,"width":2440,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"In the trial, key stage two classes of pupils were given regular classroom sessions featuring pupil-led discussions on topics such as fairness or bullying.
