There was no evidence to connect Sardar to the bomb that killed Johnson, a father of two who lived in Germany, but his fingerprints were on a different type of device that was found in the same suburb of Iraq’s capital city.</p> \n<p>Sardar’s account was that he had indeed picked up a homemade bomb when he went to the country with an Iraqi friend, and wrapped tape around it. He said neither he nor the bomb-makers were targeting Americans. At that time, Iraq was engulfed in a sectarian war between Sunni and Shia and the bomb-making Sardar witnessed was by a group of Sunni citizens planning to put them in the path of marauding Shia militias who had been coming into their neighbourhood to abduct and kill civilians. In court, the US army accepted both that its vehicle had been in an area soldiers had not been in for six months, and that it was on a dirt area, not the hard road surface where armoured vehicles travelled, when it hit the IED, making it unlikely Americans were the target.</p> \n<p>Peirce said that “extremely powerful potential witnesses”, who would have helped the jury understand the Iraqi conflict, were not allowed anonymity, leaving them afraid to give evidence for fear of reprisals on families still in Iraq.</p> \n<p>Sardar is in Belmarsh prison. His wife and two-year-old daughter are in a small terraced house in Wembley, north London, where the living room is his library, wall-to-floor shelves of books of Islamic learning and history, their titles picked out in golden ornate Arabic letters. “He loves his books,” said his wife Sadia with a smile. “He knows a lot about marriage laws, and as far as war is concerned, he believes it is a last resort and innocent people should never be involved.”</p> \n<p>His father was a civil servant who had left India for England as a child, so when Sardar decided he wanted to study Arabic he went abroad, to Damascus, in 1997. His eventual mastering of the language was a love-hate struggle of his younger years, but he completed the final year of his degree in England and returned to the UK for good in 2007, marrying, becoming a London cabby and well known in his community for his deep knowledge of Islam, which made him a popular unpaid adviser. “He’s a learned man, an intellect, he wanted to better himself – they are not the characteristics of a terrorist,” said his wife, who believes that the horrors he saw in Iraq traumatised him and made him a quieter, more thoughtful man.</p> \n<p>His family are launching a legal appeal and a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Justice4Anis/814606205284112\" title=\"\">campaign</a> to clear his name. “We’ve all been so shocked at the conviction, we couldn’t understand how it could happen. Everyone who knows Anis is shocked. I know this is not who he is, he’s a good guy,” said Sadia, adding that their daughter will be 40 by his release.</p> \n<p>Peirce said the case should never have been brought to court, and especially to a British court. “We are in a similar place to the IRA trials. If you look at them, it was English juries, English prosecutors and English police proceeding with complete ignorance of culture or religion. If you look at the Birmingham Six, they were seized when they were going to a funeral of an IRA sympathiser, and there was incomprehension that you could have a friend but not be in the IRA yourself, that you might have no money, that you could be Catholic and not be in the IRA, that incomprehension of how a different community worked,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Now juries have to be educated about Islam. Anis was in Damascus because that’s where you went to study pure Arabic then. He saw the refugees coming in from Iraq and he went with a friend to try to get his family out. He talks about the situation there, how he saw the dead bodies lying in the street, in the canal, he described people coming out to the morgue at night looking for family members. Those IEDs were found in the exact spot where Shia militia came sweeping into the Sunni villages. He said, ‘I was present.’ It was an honest defence, but without context how could a jury in Woolwich grasp it? This all took place during one of the most disturbing periods of world history, in effect the aftermath of years of illegality and ambiguity where even the Iraqi army itself was a militia under another name.</p> \n<p>“This trial proceeded amid complete ignorance, and it was utterly wrong to prosecute and wrong to convict him.”</p>","section":"Law","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436557893890/Anis-Sardar-with-his-daug-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Anis Sardar with his daughter.

If you are among the 90% of tourists there on a package holiday you will need to contact your tour operator to arrange a flight back. If you are travelling independently you need to contact your airline. </p> \n<p>Two thousand of the 3,000 tourists in Tunisia are there with Thomas Cook. The company is flying its customers back as soon as it can using third-party carriers and on its 10 scheduled flights over the weekend. </p> \n<p>It has also put on extra flights on Friday. </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.thomascook.com/tunisia-customer-information/\">More on its website here.</a><br /></p> \n<p>Airlines that fly to Tunisia from the UK include BA, Tunis, Easyjet, Monarch and Jet2. If you are travelling independently you will need to check their arrangements. </p> \n<p><strong>Can I claim the money back for the part of the holiday I didn’t use?</strong></p> \n<p>More than likely yes. Thomas Cook has said it will refund for the days not used. However, if you have only taken seven days out of your 14-day holiday, for example, don’t expect to get 50% of your holiday cost back. “Your holiday costs also include the cost of your flights, so you will get back a proportionate amount,” says Bob Atkinson of Travelsupermarket.com. </p> \n<p><strong>I am due to travel to Tunisia in the next couple of weeks. What should I do?</strong></p> \n<p>If you have a holiday booked and have not already cancelled or rearranged it (many tour operators have been allowing this following the terrorist attack in June), you will be entitled to a refund or alternative holiday.</p> \n<p>If you are set to fly independently you need to contact your airline who should offer you a refund or an alternative flight elsewhere. You will need to contact the company that booked your hotel (such as Expedia or Booking.com) or the hotel directly, if this is how you booked, to find out whether you can get a refund.</p> \n<p>“Although booking companies [such as Expedia] might not be obliged to offer you a refund, I would imagine the vast majority of them will be looking to help,” says Atkinson.</p> \n<p><strong>I am travelling later this year. Can I cancel and get a refund?</strong><br /></p> \n<p>Travel companies are refunding or offering alternative travel arrangements on any bookings up to 31 October 2015 – the end of the summer season. If you are travelling between 1 November and 31 October (the winter season) or between 1 May and 31 October 2016 (the next summer season) you will need to contact your travel operator closer to your time of travel.</p> \n<p>“Those people with bookings beyond the summer are advised to wait until closer to the departure date to contact their travel company as the situation is fluid,” said a spokesperson from the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta).</p> \n<p><strong>If I choose to take an alternative holiday with my tour operator rather than getting a refund, will I have to pay any extra?</strong></p> \n<p>Yes, probably. Both TUI and Thomas Cook have said they are waiving the admin fees for any alternative holiday booked. However, you will have to pay any other extra cost of an alternative holiday.</p> \n<p><strong>I have booked car hire in Tunisia. What should I do?</strong></p> \n<p>If you booked this as part of a package you should be able to claim it back, but if you booked it separately you will need to contact the company you booked through and ask about its cancellation policy.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>I have other expenses associated with my holiday such as airport parking/train tickets and dog kennels. Is there any chance I can get my money back from these?</strong><br /></p> \n<p>Any of these not included in the cost of a holiday package will need to be dealt with separately. Check the cancellation terms with each relevant company and if no refund is available then contact them to discuss the situation. Many companies – especially the bigger ones – are expected to show some leniency under the current circumstances. But they are not obliged to. </p> \n<p><strong>Can’t I just claim everything through my travel insurance?</strong><br /></p> \n<p>No, that’s unlikely. Whether you can claim anything at all is dependent on the type of policy you have, but in any case you should claim back as much as you can through your tour operator/airline/hotel/booking website first. This also applies to extra expenses such as those listed above.</p> \n<p>“Once you have done all this and then added up your losses you should then check your existing travel insurance policy,” says Atkinson. “You need to check whether you have the ability to claim irrecoverable losses as a result of cancelling or curtailing your holiday.”</p> \n<p>Cheap travel insurance will almost certainly not allow you to do this, he says. Many of the more expensive policies will. </p> \n<p>InsureandGo, a major travel insurance company, has announced it is changing its policy with regard to Tunisia. “If you have chosen to end your holiday, whether because you’ve been directly involved in the incident or not, and no refund is available from your holiday company, then we will refund up to &pound;1,000 per person for the cost of your lost holiday,” it says. This cover will be extended to include those returning home earlier than planned following the advice provided on Thursday.</p> \n<p>If you’re cancelling a future holiday to Tunisia and a full refund/change of destination is not available to you InsureandGo will consider a refund “on a case-by-case basis.” </p> \n<p>Similarly, Nationwide has announced it is temporarily extending the standard travel insurance cover attached to its FlexAccount current account to include cancellation. “This would normally require an upgrade to the account,” it said. “For FlexPlus packaged account customers, this is covered as standard.”</p> \n<p>The change means Nationwide will consider all cases where FlexAccount customers are unable to apply for a refund or alternative holiday from their travel provider, regardless of whether they are travelling on a package holiday or as an independent traveller.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Can I claim back the extra costs of any alternative holiday I’ve booked from my travel insurance?</strong><br /></p> \n<p>No. This is because you should been offered the option of a refund from your travel operator and to pay to book another holiday instead.</p> \n<p><strong>Will my existing travel insurance policy still be valid if I travel elsewhere?</strong></p> \n<p>Yes, travel insurance policies can usually be transferred to cover the new destination. However, depending on your new destination, you may have to pay extra on your premium.</p> \n<p><strong>Can I claim back the premium I paid for my insurance if I haven’t travelled yet?</strong><br /></p> \n<p>Some insurers are allowing you to claim back the premium paid for a single trip (rather than annual) policy, according to the British Insurance Brokers’ Association. However, Atkinson of travelsupermarket points out you shouldn’t claim a refund unless you are absolutely sure you don’t need or can’t use the policy to make a claim.</p> \n<p><strong>What happens if I decide to travel to Tunisia regardless?</strong></p> \n<p>Don’t expect to be able to use your travel insurance. “If you travel against government advice, or do not return home as requested, you could be in breach of your travel insurance policy,” says the Association of British Insurers.</p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436527716812/6b798b37-c70c-4993-a697-34cc4d20ecc3-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andreas Gebert/Andreas Gebert/dpa/Corbis","altText":"If you have a holiday booked to Tunisia and have not already cancelled or rearranged it, you will be entitled to a refund or alternative holiday.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andreas Gebert/Andreas Gebert/dpa/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-10T11:38:50Z","lastModified":"2015-07-10T23:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Lisa Bachelor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/lisabachelor"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Travel insurance","Tunisia","UK news","Insurance","Money","Air transport","Middle East and North Africa"],"tags":[{"id":"money/travelinsurance","webTitle":"Travel insurance"},{"id":"world/tunisia","webTitle":"Tunisia"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"money/insurance","webTitle":"Insurance"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"},{"id":"world/air-transport","webTitle":"Air transport"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"}],"section":{"id":"money"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Lisa Bachelor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/lisabachelor"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"money"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/jul/10/tunisia-tourists-rights-refunds-cancellations-qanda","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ah5p","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/money/2015/jul/10/tunisia-tourists-rights-refunds-cancellations-qanda","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/10/tunisia-tourists-rights-refunds-cancellations-qanda"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436527716812/6b798b37-c70c-4993-a697-34cc4d20ecc3-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"If you have a holiday booked to Tunisia and have not already cancelled or rearranged it, you will be entitled to a refund or alternative holiday.

An alternative, now the British parliament has fixed terms, would be to schedule talks at a distance from election campaigns. Hall is thought to want such ideas considered during charter renewal deliberations.</p> \n<p>Reacting to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/07/bbc-supporters-say-funding-deal-will-cause-cuts-to-jobs-and-services\">a widespread view</a> that the surprise government agreement has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/07/tony-hall-licence-fee-deal-bbc-dwp-george-osborne\">undermined the independence of the BBC</a> and made it vulnerable to further cuts, Hall said he wanted to reassure the public. “There has been no fundamental change in the relationship between government and corporation. Nor will there ever be under my watch,” he writes, adding: “Our independence is precious and will never be negotiated away.”</p> \n<p>His words are intended to answer criticism from those who agree with the former Labour culture secretary Ben Bradshaw, who argued last week that the BBC is now in effect “a branch of the Department for Work and Pensions”.</p> \n<p>The director general also issues a loud rallying cry to supporters of the BBC. “We should be under no illusion that this is a period of high risk for the BBC. While no one wants to abolish the BBC, there will be some who want to diminish us for their own narrow interests. We must remind them that the British public does not share their views,” he says.</p> \n<p>His words echo a speech he gave to BBC Radio 4 contributors and presenters at the end of last month calling on them to speak up for their employer.</p> \n<p>This weekend he sets out the stakes more clearly still: “This charter review matters much more than most. It’s about something bigger than the BBC – it’s about the future of public service broadcasting.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/12/bbc-perfectly-set-up-future-challenges\">The BBC is perfectly set up for future challenges | Tony Hall</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Hall agreed to take responsibility for the &pound;750m licence-fee funding before last week’s budget, and has insisted he got a good deal in the circumstances. He told Radio 4’s <em>Today</em> programme: “The government’s decision here to put the cost of the over-75s on us has been more than matched by the deal coming back for the BBC. My bottom line was, if I can use this as an opportunity to get back for the BBC things I think are really important – an inflation-set licence fee and an end to top-slicing – then I think that is really important. And that is exactly what we have done.”</p> \n<p>Since then the argument that the BBC achieved a “cash neutral” settlement, articulated by both Hall and his director of television, Danny Cohen, has been questioned.
