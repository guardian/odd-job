It is the highest figure ever recorded against a single supplier, ending a year in which the total number of complaints about the big six provider increased by 488%, the figures show. </p> \n<p>The Spanish-owned company was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/mar/04/scottish-power-banned-sales-calls-ofgem\">banned from proactive sales</a> for 12 days in March after failing to meet customer service targets set by Ofgem. The regulator found the firm had not made necessary improvements to respond to customer complaints. </p> \n<p>Citizens Advice said its latest figures suggested complaints about Scottish Power were the result of its new billing system, which left some people not receiving a bill and others struggling to have their problems resolved.</p> \n<p>The charity said it had worked with Scottish Power to help resolve the problems, and the company had taken steps to deal with its backlog of complaints such as hiring new staff, extending call centre hours and setting up a special phoneline for vulnerable customers. </p> \n<p>SSE retained the top spot as the least complained-about energy company. The figures also show that the number of complaints about SSE, British Gas, EDF Energy and Npower decreased. </p> \n<p> n power had been the most complained-about member of the big six for the first two quarters of 2014 but was overtaken in the final half of the year by Scottish Power. However, while npower had made improvements, it still received 599 complaints per 100,000 customers in the last quarter of last year, making it the second most complained-about company, the charity said.</p> \n<p>The chief executive of Citizens Advice, Gillian Guy, said: “New billing systems are routinely failing energy customers. In the last few years, four of the largest firms have introduced new billing systems, and their implementation has caused chaos for consumers. Thousands of customers have been hit by delayed and incorrect bills which have resulted in extreme frustration and significant debts. </p> \n<p>“It’s encouraging that npower is now turning the corner, but Scottish Power still has a very long way to go.”</p> \n<p>Neil Clitheroe, the chief executive of Scottish Power retail and generation, said: “We apologise unreservedly to any customers who have experienced account issues. </p> \n<p>“These statistics reflect service problems in the last six months of 2014, when we had our most challenging period following the introduction of a new 200 million customer IT system.</p> \n<p>“To make improvements we have added 700 new customer service advisers and we worked closely with Ofgem on call waiting times, outstanding bills and ombudsman complaints.

Claims were up 10% on the last quarter, but at 42,226 they remained below a six-year high of 47,208 in the first quarter of 2014.</p> \n<p>Claims by both private and social landlords were up, the figures showed, although most of the rise was explained by claims by the latter. Social landlords were behind nearly five times as many attempts to recover properties than private landlords, the figures showed. These landlords are typically housing associations providing homes at lower rents than the market rate, often to tenants who receive housing benefit.</p> \n<p>In the first three months of the year, 64% of possession claims were made by social landlords. These 27,204 court actions came alongside 5,551 made by private landlords and 9,741 accelerated claims, which could have been by either social or private landlords. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"This graph shows the number of repossession claims granted by the courts by quarter since 2009\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L3OcAglqNt9X11fBfZMJVzRJkwce39ApdRTcHi-RLpU/pubchart?oid=1055691564&amp;format=interactive\" width=\"100%\" height=\"380\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  This graph shows the number of repossession claims granted by the courts by quarter since 2009.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In May 2014, when the threat of evictions reached its highest level for a decade, the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations across England, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2014/may/08/threat-tenant-evictions-highest-10-years-repossessions\">told the Guardian the bedroom tax was causing problems for social landlords</a>. The policy cuts the amount of housing benefit paid to social housing tenants whose homes are deemed too large for their requirements. Benefit sanctions were also thought to be causing problems.</p> \n<p>But many housing associations, particularly in London and the south-east, have turned out tenants as they have sought to redevelop generations-old estates to take advantage of the big rise in property values. This has in turn led to an increase in the number of grassroots campaigns to oppose evictions, such as the Focus E15 mothers.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"https://housingactionsouthwarkandlambeth.wordpress.com/2015/05/05/eviction-resistance-success-in-camberwell/ https://housingactionsouthwarkandlambeth.wordpress.com/2015/05/05/eviction-resistance-success-in-camberwell/\">one case of eviction resistance last week</a>, activists from Housing Action Southwark and Lambeth in London answered a call from a 14-year-old girl to successfully resist her family’s eviction from a flat in an estate that Southwark council had marked for demolition.

Londoners were the worst affected, with 26,636 families facing a cut in benefits over the period to February 2015, followed by 5,953 in the rest of the south-east.<br /></p> \n<p>DWP proposals to meet the Conservatives’ pledge to cut &pound;12bn from the welfare budget, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/05/revealed-coalition-plans-to-slash-welfare-for-sick-poor-young-and-disabled\">in documents leaked to the Guardian last week</a>, included barring under-25s from claiming housing benefit, increasing the bedroom tax on certain categories of tenants, limiting welfare payments by family size and freezing welfare benefits at current levels.</p> \n<p>Responding to the eviction statistics, Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: “Today’s figures are a glaring reminder that sky-high housing costs and welfare cuts are leaving thousands of people battling to keep a roof over their heads.</p> \n<p>“Every day at Shelter we see the devastating impact of a housing market at boiling point, with the cost of renting so high that many families are living in fear that just one thing like losing their job or becoming ill could leave them with the bailiffs knocking at the door. </p> \n<p>“The new government must make sure people aren’t left to fall through the cracks and hurtling towards homelessness by preserving, if not strengthening, the frayed housing safety net to protect ordinary families desperately struggling to make ends meet.”</p> \n<p>Betsy Dillner, director of the campaign group Generation Rent, said: “These record eviction figures and signs that they are accelerating are a stark reminder of the housing crisis that the government must urgently start taking seriously now they’re back in power. </p> \n<p>“Whether it’s an inability to pay expensive rents or a landlord’s desire to take back their property, the fact that more than 40,000 families were forced out of their homes last year is a symptom of the government’s failure to create a sustainable housing market.”</p> \n<p>The housing minister, Brandon Lewis, defended the government’s performance, pointing out that mortgage repossessions had fallen drastically, keeping owner-occupiers in their “hard-earned homes”. </p> \n<p>He said: “Mortgage repossessions continue to fall at 56% lower than this time last year, and the lowest annual figure since the series began in 1987. Meanwhile, numbers of county court mortgage possession claims continue to fall to the lowest quarterly number since records began. This is thanks to our work to tackle the deficit and keep interest rates low, helping more families to stay in their hard earned homes.</p> \n<p>“There are strong protections in place to guard families against the threat of homelessness. We increased spending to prevent homelessness, with over &pound;500m made available to help the most vulnerable in society and ensure we don’t return to the bad old days when homelessness in England was nearly double what it is today.”</p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431609848008/24c5ce25-83d2-4c52-b398-2ca061639d3d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Thabo Jaiyesimi/Demotix/Corbis","altText":"Police walk past as activists from Housing Action Southwark and Lambeth resist a family’s eviction from a flat in an estate had been marked for demolition.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Thabo Jaiyesimi/Demotix/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-14T13:29:55Z","lastModified":"2015-05-14T23:00:44Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1837,"contributors":[{"name":"Damien Gayle","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/damien-gayle"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Repossessions","Renting property","Borrowing & debt","Property","Housing","Housing market","Communities","Welfare","Money","Society","UK news","Politics","Business","Real estate","Benefits"],"tags":[{"id":"money/repossessions","webTitle":"Repossessions"},{"id":"money/renting","webTitle":"Renting property"},{"id":"money/debt","webTitle":"Borrowing & debt"},{"id":"money/property","webTitle":"Property"},{"id":"society/housing","webTitle":"Housing"},{"id":"business/housingmarket","webTitle":"Housing market"},{"id":"society/communities","webTitle":"Communities"},{"id":"politics/welfare","webTitle":"Welfare"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/realestate","webTitle":"Real estate"},{"id":"society/benefits","webTitle":"Benefits"}],"section":{"id":"money"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Damien Gayle","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/damien-gayle"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"money"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/may/14/tenant-evictions-reach-six-year-high-rising-rents-benefit-cuts","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48qdt","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/money/2015/may/14/tenant-evictions-reach-six-year-high-rising-rents-benefit-cuts","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/may/14/tenant-evictions-reach-six-year-high-rising-rents-benefit-cuts"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431609848008/24c5ce25-83d2-4c52-b398-2ca061639d3d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Police walk past as activists from Housing Action Southwark and Lambeth resist a family’s eviction from a flat in an estate in south London that had been marked for demolition.

The driver, described as “insistently lawless”, has been jailed for three-and-a-half years for causing his death by careless driving. Barry Meyer, 53, of Walthamstow, east London, was sentenced at Blackfriars crown court. He was also disqualified from driving for 10 years.</p> \n<p>Meyer pleaded guilty last month to causing death by careless driving, while two offences of driving while uninsured and unlicensed were allowed to lie on file. <br /></p> \n<p>In his sentencing remarks, Judge Daniel Worsley said Meyer – who has previous driving convictions including drink-driving – “crushed” 54-year-old Neve with both the front and back wheels of the lorry, resulting in “almost instant death”. </p> \n<p>“Mr Neve had lived almost or just over half his life,” Worsley said. “He was the finest husband, father and family man, and plainly, as you have heard, in every way the finest and most decent of men.” </p> \n<p>Worsley said the harm caused by Meyer is “devastating beyond all measure” and told him: “Nothing I can do or say can bring back Mr Neve or undo the horror your carelessness caused.”</p> \n<p>Handing down the sentence, the judge referred to Meyer’s previous driving offences and said his history showed a “wretched disregard for the safety of road users”.
