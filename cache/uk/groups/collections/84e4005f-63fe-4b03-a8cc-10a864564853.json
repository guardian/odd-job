Or the consequences will be dire | Paul Burstow</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Paul Burstow, care services minister in the coalition, suggests in an article online for the <em>Observer</em> that “Gove’s education ministry was just not interested in mental health and wellbeing”, despite the long-term costs to pupils and the exchequer. Gove, now justice secretary, was education secretary from 2010 to 2014.</p> \n<p>While there has not been a national study of children’s mental health since 2004, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2014/jul/29/chilld-and-adolescent-mental-health-service-failing-children\">there is evidence that the problem has been growing</a>, adding to pressures on the NHS. Emergency admissions for teenagers with psychiatric conditions rose to 17,278 last year, almost double the number four years ago. According to data from the <a href=\"http://www.hscic.gov.uk/catalogue/PUB17772\">Health and Social Care Information Centre</a>, there were 15,668 admissions of women aged 15 to 19 for cutting, burning or harming themselves, compared with 9,255 admissions in 2004.</p> \n<p>Yet figures released under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that between 2009-10 and 2013-14, the number of educational psychologists employed by local authorities dropped by 7%, with a loss of 80 educational psychologists across the country. Under Gove’s reforms of the education system, which saw the growth of academies and free schools, local authorities lost a role in providing expertise to thousands of schools across the country.</p> \n<p>Burstow, a Liberal Democrat who lost his seat at the general election, claims that, at the same time as those reforms, Gove also disbanded a team of officials examining how to improve mental health in the country’s schools.</p> \n<p>He writes: “One of my abiding frustrations when I was minister for mental health was the lack of engagement from the Department for Education. Despite the wealth of evidence on the vital importance of children’s mental health across a range of measures, from academic performance to behaviour and adult life chances, as education secretary Michael Gove chose to downgrade the importance given to the emotional wellbeing of young people.</p> \n<p>“The team of officials leading on mental health in education was disbanded, absorbed into other programmes. Gove’s education ministry was just not interested in mental health and wellbeing; doing anything that might better equip teachers and schools to identify those in need was off the agenda. It was not seen as the core business of schools.</p> \n<p>“Yet across public services it is schools that bear the greatest cost of poorly treated mental health.”</p> \n<p>Burstow says he believes that Nicky Morgan, who has replaced Gove, “really cares about it”, although he writes of his concerns as further spending cuts are announced in the emergency budget this week. He writes: “Before the dissolution of parliament, together with [Liberal Democrat education minister] David Laws, she announced a package of measures to dramatically improve support for children’s mental health in and out of the classroom.</p> \n<p>“This included new support for schools to broach mental health issues from eating disorders and self-harm to anxiety and depression, a new vision for counselling in schools, and funding for the voluntary sector to do more. All good stuff.</p> \n<p>“But with a raft of further departmental cuts promised by the chancellor over the next five years, it will not be easy to build on the foundations that have been set, invest, and embed a focus on mental health when tough choices inevitably have to be made.”</p> \n<p>Luciana Berger, shadow minister for public health, said: “The appalling neglect of children’s mental health services by this government has gone on for far too long.”</p> \n<p>A Department for Education spokesman said: “We have invested millions across the board in improving mental health provision for young people and recognise the vital role of educational psychologists. That is why, during the last parliament we stepped in to provide support when numbers being trained fell. In 2014/15 we provided &pound;5m per year to support 132 new training positions, up from 120 the previous year.”</p>","section":"Education","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435952876460/Former-education-secretar-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mental health care in schools was cut under Michael Gove, above, despite the NHS reporting a big rise in cases among young people.

It is also right that the nation recognises the scale of this appalling event.”</p> \n<p>Ellwood, who has led a long campaign for a single memorial to all victims of terrorism overseas, said it was important that there was a place to mourn for everyone touched by such atrocities. <br /></p> \n<p>He said: “Sadly, we live in very difficult and dangerous times.

A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) has now confirmed that the money is not just for rail.</p> \n<p>Before the general election, the chancellor made much of his intention to “make the cities of the north a powerhouse for our economy again – with new transport and science and powerful city governance”, in what was seen as an attempt to steal votes from Labour in its strongholds and in tight marginals such as Crewe.</p> \n<p>In a press release <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-showcases-northern-powerhouse-to-us-delegation\" title=\"\"> in March</a>, the Treasury claimed: “To make the northern powerhouse a reality, the government has already committed to … &pound;13bn of investment in transport in the north of England”. In parliament last week, communities minister James Wharton said: “This government is investing &pound;13bn in rail in the north. There will be more trains, newer trains and more regular journeys.”</p> \n<p>It has now emerged, however, that only &pound;3bn of that money is for rail schemes – of which &pound;1.35bn had already been allocated, mainly to upgrades in and around Manchester.</p> \n<p>Only &pound;5bn of the remaining &pound;10bn is for major road schemes, including the improvements to the A1. And the remaining &pound;5bn is made up of the standard allocations to local councils through the “Integrated Transport Block Capital Grant” for projects such as bus lanes, cycle lanes, and traffic-calming and “local highways maintenance”, including filling in potholes.</p> \n<p>The outstanding &pound;1.65bn for rail works out at &pound;330m a year until 2020, for all of the north-east, Yorkshire and the north-west. Local politicians claim such amounts will prove too little to make any major infrastructure improvements.</p> \n<p>Andy Burnham, the MP for Leigh in Greater Manchester and the frontrunner in the Labour leadership contest, called for an apology from the DCLG for misleading MPs. He said: “David Cameron must look at whether ministers have knowingly misled the Commons. George Osborne’s much-vaunted northern powerhouse has been exposed for what it is: cynical, pre-election spin. It is getting the same from the Tories that it’s always had: a northern powercut.</p> \n<p>“If Osborne’s commitment to the north is to have any credibility, he must put his money where his mouth is and listen to long-suffering rail passengers. As Labour leader, I will devolve power to local communities and put them in the driving seat of transport planning.”</p> \n<p>The latest embarrassment over the northern powerhouse claim follows the announcement that the government had shelved promised and vital upgrades to major rail lines in the Midlands and the north of England, just weeks after the election in which the Conservatives campaigned on rebalancing the country. Critics claimed that the government knew that those plans, central to the northern powerhouse vision, would have to be shelved a long time before the general election but had avoided announcing it for fear of losing votes.</p> \n<p>A DCLG spokesman said: “The northern powerhouse is part of the government’s long-term economic plan to rebalance growth across the regions and nations of the UK.</p> \n<p>“The northern powerhouse is more than transport investment. Government has committed to invest in science and technology, transport, digital and innovation, culture and tourism across the region. Alongside devolving power, this gives the north a powerful new voice.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436015640479/Car-driving-past-a-large--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"£5bn of the claimed £13bn fund is made up of the standard allocations to local councils for road maintenance and traffic schemes.

And, according to a damning analysis by an independent government advisory body, the UK’s upland peat bogs are facing a sustained threat from the shooting classes’ desire to bag grouse.</p> \n<p>The Committee on Climate Change’s <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/reducing-emissions-and-preparing-for-climate-change-2015-progress-report-to-parliament/\" title=\"\">2015 progress report</a> to parliament notes: “Wetland habitats, including the majority of upland areas with carbon-rich peat soils, are in poor condition. The damaging practice of burning peat to increase grouse yields continues, including on internationally protected sites.”</p> \n<p>Burning creates different heather habitats. Young heather is nutritious while more established heather provides a place for nesting grouse. Creating a patchwork comprising heather of different lengths is a land management tool that experienced gamekeepers can use to increase grouse yields.</p> \n<p>This is an attractive prospect for the new wave of grouse moor owners bringing market forces to the once fusty world of shooting. In the past couple of decades, City financiers such as the multimillionaire hedge fund manager Jeremy Herrmann, and businessmen such as David Ross, co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, have been buying up estates and raising the profile of their shoots.</p> \n<p>With clients paying more than &pound;150 to bag only a single brace of grouse, estate owners know that delivering a plentiful supply of targets makes sound business sense. It also adds to their considerable net worth because the capital value of a grouse moor is based on its grouse population. The birds are valued at anything between &pound;2,500 and &pound;5,000 a brace.</p> \n<p>“It probably is fair to say there has been more burning in recent years compared to the preceding decade, and a lot of that is to do with reinvestment in estates because new entrepreneurs are coming in,” said Amanda Anderson, director of the <a href=\"http://www.moorlandassociation.org\" title=\"\">Moorland Association</a>. “A lot of the estates are getting back to their prewar potential. They’re possibly at their optimal level now [in terms of burning].”</p> \n<p>Estate owners insist they are true conservationists, spending millions of pounds maintaining the moors. But the use of fire is deeply controversial. Burning vegetation leaves peat exposed. This is a concern for conservationists. Not only does peatland provide a home for many different types of wildlife, including dragonflies and other insects, help clean water and prevent floods, it is also rich in carbon. If it is disturbed and exposed to the air, the carbon stored in its soil decomposes and releases carbon dioxide, contributing to climate change.</p> \n<p>According to the RSPB, some 76,000 hectares, or 27% of the UK’s blanket bog, have already lost peat-forming vegetation due to regular burning. In a briefing produced last year, the society claimed: “If we don’t restore upland peatlands, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from degraded peatlands are likely to increase by 30% for every 1C rise in average global temperature. Peatlands with healthy ecosystems are by contrast expected to be relatively robust to climate change.”</p> \n<p>Work by scientists at Durham University’s Department of Earth Sciences, funded by the pro-shooting <a href=\"https://www.gwct.org.uk\" title=\"\">Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust</a>, has been cited to counter some of these claims. One paper concluded that “prescribed burning of moorland vegetation had no significant effect on DOC [dissolved organic carbon] concentrations in soil water or surface runoff water in the years following burning”. Another concluded: “It is clear that burn management represents a technique for avoiding losses of carbon in Calluna [heather] dominated peatlands.”</p> \n<p>However, Pat Thompson, senior uplands policy officer at the RSPB, said there was no doubt that burning damaged peatland. “The research that has been done to date suggests to us that, when you burn that vegetation off, whether it’s dwarf shrubs like heather or mossy vegetation, you are left with a bare peat surface that is really vulnerable to drying out. The peat blows away or washes away as sediment. Over a period of time, big areas of our peatland have fallen into a really poor state. They are carbon rich, they are often at the heart of some of our key drinking water catchment areas, and these are nationally and internationally important wildlife sites.”</p> \n<p>The row between the RSPB and the grouse moor owners has been joined by <a href=\"http://www.youforgotthebirds.com\" title=\"\">You Forgot the Birds (YFTB)</a>, a new campaign group fronted by the former England cricketer Sir Ian Botham. It claims the RSPB is focusing on issues such as climate change at the expense of bird protection. But it is unclear who is funding YFTB. On its website, it claims to represent gamekeepers, bird lovers and farmers. However, its spokesman, Ian Gregory, who works for PR company Centaurus Communications, declined to name its funders. This refusal has prompted claims, denied by the YFTB, that it is a front organisation for some of Britain’s wealthiest landowners keen to repel the environmental lobby.</p> \n<p>With grouse moors becoming a battleground in the global warming debate, there are now calls for gamekeepers to use alternatives to burning, such as grazing. “It’s a question of what’s possible,” Anderson said. “There are places you wouldn’t want to drive a tractor or a mower. These are heavy machines on fragile surfaces.”</p> \n<p>But Thompson said it was time to rethink the burning of Britain’s countryside: “It is utterly perverse to me that we are degrading our uplands in a way that benefits the minority rather than society as a whole.”</p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/4/1436047105053/Grouse-moor-Scotland-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Shooting estate owners say they invest heavily in moorland conservation.

TV vet, author and animal welfare campaigner <a href=\"http://www.marcthevet.com\" title=\"\">Marc Abraham</a> said impulse buying of dogs, fuelled by unscrupulous internet dealers and bad practices in puppy farming, is leading to a rapid rise in cruelty cases while legislation to protect animals is “a total mess”.</p> \n<p>“We’re getting worse as a nation of supposed animal lovers. Puppies are so easy to get hold of that they have become disposable. You can just dump them when you have had enough, and rescue centres up and down the country are bursting at the seams. We have seen a massive increase in demand for whatever breed is fashionable, whether it’s a husky from <em>Twilight</em> or <em>Game of Thrones</em>, or Lady Gaga and YouTubers like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__dtoZ0UzlI\" title=\"\">DanTDM</a> with their French bulldogs and pugs. They see a cute dog on <em>EastEnders</em>, google it, find out they can order one and have it delivered the next day.”</p> \n<p>Such hapless owners have no idea how to train or socialise their dogs and end up selling them on or dumping them, he said. Mistreatment, and poor care and diet, leave dogs with behavioural problems, and rescue centres then struggle to find new homes for them. “So we have this huge demand that the breeders can’t cope with, rescue centres overwhelmed and these big battery farms spewing out more,” said Abraham, who has set up <a href=\"http://pupaid.org\" title=\"\">PupAid</a>, a campaign for better controls and licensing in the puppy trade.</p> \n<p>His comments came after the People’s Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) said last week that increasing ignorance among people buying dogs – five million did no research before taking on an animal and were largely unaware of the specific needs of the breed – was leading to more aggressive dogs. The number of court cases involving attacks has risen by 62% year on year after a toughening of laws making owners directly responsible, but with eight postal workers attacked each day and more than 7,000 hospital admissions last year from dog bites, the problem is serious. The charity believes that the level of canine aggression is down to the owners and caused by poor dog socialisation and training, as well as animals not being properly exercised. The PDSA Animal Wellbeing (PAW) report found nearly 250,000 dogs are acting viciously towards people each week, and more than 600,000 dogs are showing aggression towards other pets.</p> \n<p>Vicki Larkham of the PDSA said: “Millions of dogs aren’t getting off-the-lead exercise outside their home or garden for 10 minutes or more on a daily basis. Close to a quarter of a million never go for walks on their lead for 10 minutes or more at all. Boredom and inactivity often contribute to anxiety and destructive behaviour. A properly trained and socialised puppy is less likely to act aggressively as it grows up. It’s up to every owner to make sure this happens.”</p> \n<p>The annual report found that a quarter of people said that they would consider getting a puppy from a puppy farm, where animal welfare needs are unlikely to have been met.</p> \n<p>“Despite rescue centres bursting with healthy dogs and puppies, people are spending God knows how much on sick and even dying puppies they’re ordering online,” said Abrahams.</p> \n<p>He admits that some animal charities have not helped by being too rigorous in who they will allow to adopt their dogs. An <a href=\"http://www.pupaid.org/puppy-farming/sign-the-e-petition-now.html\" title=\"\">e-petition</a> set up by Abrahams, which attracted 100,000 signatures, succeeded in forcing through a recent debate in parliament on the regulation of pet sales, and he believes that there is a growing tide of political will to tackle the problem.</p> \n<p>“The current legislation on the welfare of animals is from 1951,” he said, “before we had any notion of the setting up of online puppy supermarkets, of sellers shipping in puppies from Lithuania, Romania, and other eastern European countries, bringing in disease as well as miserable and often sick animals who have been taken away from their mothers far too early.</p> \n<p>“A poorly socialised puppy grows into a nervous aggressive animal. There are all sorts of scams to get these animals into the country because there is so much money to be made as dog ownership becomes an impulse purchase.We’re way off where we should be with our animal welfare. People look at these videos of people butchering dogs and eating them in China – well, at least the animal is dead and feeling no pain. Many of our dogs are having a terrible time of it and the owners don’t even notice.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436003561415/TV-vet-Marc-Abraham-exami-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"TV vet Marc Abraham examines a bichon frise/westie cross from a Welsh puppy farm.
