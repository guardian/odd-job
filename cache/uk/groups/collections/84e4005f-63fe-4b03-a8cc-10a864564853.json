Lord Smith of Finsbury, better known as former Labour MP Chris Smith, said the industry had not been transparent enough and that it would take time to reassure the public about the technology. </p> \n<p>But Smith said that fracking would be acceptable if certain conditions were met, including a tightening of regulations and monitoring set out in a report from the taskforce on Wednesday. The report found that fracking was safe, for human health and the environment, but only if properly regulated.</p> \n<p>Smith maintained that big hurdles still remained before he could give fracking a clean bill of health, chief among these the question of its effect on <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/climate-change\">climate change</a>. “We have not yet concluded that fracking is a good idea for the UK. We still have to look at climate change, and the economics. It would be premature to make conclusions yet on whether it is a good or bad thing. If someone demonstrated that developing this industry in the UK would mean a substantial raising of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/carbon-emissions\">greenhouse gas emissions</a>, that would be a showstopper.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b4f5369338564c5a02ad9766a1aa2de886b231c2\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b4f5369338564c5a02ad9766a1aa2de886b231c2/0_88_1755_1250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Chris Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"712\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Chris Smith, chief of the task force on shale gas. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA Archive/Press Association Ima</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Smith added that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jul/03/people-power-has-shut-the-doors-on-fracking-in-the-uk\" draggable=\"true\">public opinion was still divided on the issue</a>, in part because of a lack of transparency and public engagement from fracking companies until recently. “In the early days, mistakes were made, especially in transparency. That has coloured what has happened since, and people’s views. It will take time for people to be reassured.”</p> \n<p>Fracking is the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2012/apr/17/shale-gas-fracking-uk\">practice of blasting dense shale rock</a> with a mixture of sand, water and chemicals, opening up tiny fissures in the rock to release the microscopic bubbles of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/gas\">methane gas</a> trapped within, which can then be gathered at the surface. It is controversial because some fracking operations in the US have been associated with pollution, and in the UK it has caused minor earth tremors, but proponents argue that it will create a new indigenous gas source for the UK.</p> \n<p>The report from the taskforce, a body that is independent but funded by the industry, set out several measures necessary to ensure fracking would not cause pollution, or other adverse environmental impacts, and protect public health. These included mandatory “green completion” on fracking wells, which means collecting more than 90% of the methane that can leak from wells. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with an effect on the climate many times more than that of carbon dioxide.</p> \n<p>The regulator, which the report advocates should be a unified body rather than the fragmented system at present, should also ensure that “the very highest standards” are adhered to in the construction of wells. The only well yet to have been fracked in the UK, in Lancaster by Cuadrilla, was later <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2013/mar/13/fracking-cuadrilla-halts-operations-lancashire\">found to have a slightly deformed casing</a>, perhaps as a result of the small earthquake it caused.</p> \n<p>All the chemicals used by any fracking company must also be disclosed to the public, not just to the Environment Agency as happens at present, according to the report. The injection underground of flowback water should not be used, as this has caused small earthquakes in the US.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2012/apr/17/shale-gas-fracking-uk\">Q&amp;amp;A: shale gas and fracking</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A national committee should also be set up, independent from the regulator, to monitor data from shale gas fracking operations and assess any public health impacts. The taskforce also recommended making it easier to carry out monitoring of fracking activities from the very first stages, after a potential site is identified, in part by loosening planning regulations so that the drilling of monitoring wells would not need specific planning permission, as it does at present.</p> \n<p>Lord Smith, former chairman of the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency\">Environment Agency</a>, said the object of the report, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/mar/25/lord-smith-hugely-sceptical-of-fracking-for-shale-oil-in-the-uk\">the second of four parts</a>, was to clarify some of the main issues around fracking so that members of the public could make up their own minds. “Some people are very clearly against, and some people are very clearly for, but most of the public are probably feeling they don’t have sufficient information to make a reasoned judgement.”</p> \n<p>Ken Cronin, chief executive of UK Onshore Oil and Gas, which represents the industry, said: “The report highlighted a number of areas we have already considered and taken action on. I was particularly pleased to note the taskforce is satisfied that the risk levels associated with public health hazards are acceptable provided the well is properly drilled, protected, monitored and regulated.”</p> \n<p>The next section of the taskforce’s study, which will deal with the effects on climate change, is to be published in September.</p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/9a79b536fbd36a18cc72864be4c2bc63c3efce9f/0_0_5616_3370/5616.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3370,"width":5616,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Matthew Lloyd/Getty Images","altText":"Cuadrilla shale fracking plant","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Matthew Lloyd/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b4f5369338564c5a02ad9766a1aa2de886b231c2/0_88_1755_1250/1755.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1250,"width":1755,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lord Chris Smith, chief of the task force on shale gas.

As well as the psychological impact, they also cost lives as most people die within five years of having one.”</p> \n<p>The statistics are a grim reminder of the gradual but relentless increase in the number of people with diabetes. An estimated 3.9 million people in the UK have the condition. About 90% have Type 2 diabetes, which is linked to people’s lifestyles and obesity. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition unrelated to bodyweight. </p> \n<p>Diabetes UK claims that too many diabetics received inadequate care from the NHS. “We have seen some areas making real efforts to improve the poor state of diabetes footcare, but these figures are a stark reminder that there is still so much more to be done,” Young said.</p> \n<p>“For example, not enough people are receiving their annual foot check and those who do often tell us their check was not very thorough.

For anyone wanting take pictures or carry out a Q&amp;A on its beach, the city council has decreed that there is a &pound;200 fee.

The council’s press office passed the matter on to the city’s events office. An official there said it would charge &pound;200 for a licence allowing the interview to be recorded and Ware to be photographed next to the water. <br /></p> \n<p>The official said in an email: “This is a chargeable activity. We would charge &pound;200 for audio recording and photographs. If you wish to go ahead with this booking, please let me know and I will get you the consent form.”<br /></p> \n<p>When the Guardian expressed surprise that the council’s policy was to charge for newsgathering, the official replied: “News to us is ‘current affairs’, and we define current affairs as something that is spontaneous, such as filming for the weather programme. Your proposal is a planned article, and is therefore is a chargeable activity. I hope that this answers your question.”<br /></p> \n<p>The official added that the beach stretched to Rottingdean around four miles to the east of Brighton city centre, and Portslade, three miles west. When he was asked if there were any restrictions in other parts of Brighton – for example, the street – he said: “Anywhere in Brighton, including the highways, there would be a charge to you, except for private property. I can suggest contacting the pier, which is privately owned.”<br /></p> \n<p>Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.indexoncensorship.org/\">Index on Censorship</a>, said: “Journalists should not be charged in order to carry out their jobs. This runs counter to all the principles that should underpin a free and independent media.”<br /></p> \n<p>Bob Satchwell, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.societyofeditors.co.uk/\">Society of Editors</a>, branded the move outrageous. He said: “Beaches and streets are public places. If local councils are to start charging for reporting the news, it is time someone reminded them that we are supposed to live in a free society.”<br /></p> \n<p>Michael Bromley, interim head of journalism at City University London, said: “Well, it would be funny if it weren’t so pathetic. The irony, of course, is that the council is compelled to provide, at its own cost, press facilities for its own meetings. Maybe Brighton council should meet on the beach and charge an entry fee?”<br /></p> \n<p>It is understood that a charity was also told it would have to pay if it wished to take images on the beach.<br /></p> \n<p>The Guardian went ahead and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/22/shoot-em-ups-crashing-waves-human-league-martyn-ware-seaside-sound-brighton\">photographed Ware</a> on the pier and carried out the audio interview on the beach without paying the charge. Later, when the Guardian asked the council again about the policy, its press office said it stemmed from a decision made by the economic development and culture committee in June last year, at which point the council was run by the Green party.<br /></p> \n<p>The council approved <a href=\"http://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/Published/C00000705/M00005164/AI00040101/$FilmingFeesCharges3.doc.pdf\">new fees and charges</a> payable for filming in the city. In 2013-14 the council was paid more than &pound;33,000 for 135 pieces of filming. It agreed to introduce a new structure from 2014-15 that would include an increase in charges and the introduction of a &pound;50 administration charge and hourly rates.</p> \n<p>Councillors agreed that makers of “documentaries/music videos/pieces to camera” would be charged at &pound;300 a day or &pound;100 an hour. Producers of “television drama/advert/feature film” would pay &pound;400 a day or &pound;100 an hour. But they also agreed that “news, weather, tourism” pieces should not be charged for after considering a report from a senior officer stating: “They are items of public information or directly promote the city as a destination.”<br /></p> \n<p>Geoffrey Bowden, who was a Green councillor and chair of the committee but lost his seat in the spring, said the charges had been aimed at organisations such as commercial film-makers and agencies making advertisements. “I was given a democratic boot up the rear by the electorate in May. However, I can only apologise that an officer has, in my opinion, misinterpreted the filming-fees regime in this way.”<br /></p> \n<p>Bowden, himself a journalist and PR man, said Brighton would open itself up to accusations of acting like a totalitarian regime such as North Korea if it did try to charge for genuine newsgathering.<br /></p> \n<p>Lucas was prepared to be more forgiving. “A council officer has clearly made a mistake on this occasion. The policy should never have been extended to newsgathering. It’s right that the council has apologised and I trust that similar incidents won’t occur in the future.”<br /></p> \n<p>The council said it was in discussion about how to make sure that such a situation did not arise again. It said it would investigate the circumstances of a charity being charged. It has stressed that it certainly did not charge visitors to take pictures on its beaches or public places.<br /></p> \n<p>A council spokesperson said: “Fees for filming and commercial photo shoots were agreed in the economic and culture committee in June 2014, in common with many other local authorities. </p> \n<p>“Fees are not charged for current affairs, weather reports or press photography in the city. Unfortunately, the policy was incorrectly applied in this case, and the journalist was wrongly advised. We are sorry for the confusion caused.”</p> \n<p><br /></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436898610455/d846cc65-853c-4ec3-8847-533384fa460f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Gareth Fuller/PA","altText":"A crowded Brighton beach","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-14T19:14:51Z","lastModified":"2015-07-14T23:01:34Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Steven Morris","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stevenmorris"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Brighton","Newspapers","Media","Local government","UK news","Freedom of speech","Politics","Newspapers & magazines","Society","World news","Caroline Lucas","Green party"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/brighton","webTitle":"Brighton"},{"id":"media/newspapers","webTitle":"Newspapers"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/freedom-of-speech","webTitle":"Freedom of speech"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"media/pressandpublishing","webTitle":"Newspapers & magazines"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"politics/caroline-lucas","webTitle":"Caroline Lucas"},{"id":"politics/green-party","webTitle":"Green party"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Steven Morris","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stevenmorris"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/14/brighton-council-try-charge-200-recording-fee-interview","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ak7z","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jul/14/brighton-council-try-charge-200-recording-fee-interview","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/14/brighton-council-try-charge-200-recording-fee-interview"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436898610455/d846cc65-853c-4ec3-8847-533384fa460f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A crowded Brighton beach in early July 2015.

She faces trial later this year. </p> \n<p>Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the 1967 Abortion Act does not apply. The case has outraged pro-choice campaigners in Northern Ireland. </p> \n<p>Sh&aacute; Gillespie, of Alliance for Choice, said: “Our basic message to the police and the Public Prosecution Service on Wednesday is this: either prosecute all of us or drop the charges against this individual woman.”</p> \n<p>The protesters will in effect own up to having broken the same law as the unnamed mother. A letter containing 205 signatures has been sent to the prosecution service urging it to drop the case. </p> \n<p>“We are challenging the police and the PPS to stop turning this individual – a mother who was doing right by her child – into a scapegoat,” Gillespie said. </p> \n<p>“This move is a really nasty one against this woman and has to be opposed. The women, and even some men, who have signed the letter will be calling on the police at these protests to take us all on rather than pick on one single person.”</p> \n<p>Gillespie said a number of pro-choice campaigners were prepared to enter police stations and challenge the PSNI to arrest them for obtaining abortion pills for women and girls who sought to terminate their pregnancies. Between 12 to 15 women were consulting lawyers, she said.</p> \n<p>Abortion is only legal in Northern Ireland if a woman’s life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent or serious damage to her mental or physical health. About 2,000 women a year travel to English hospitals and clinics from Northern Ireland to have terminations. There is strong opposition in the Northern Ireland Assembly to liberalising the abortion laws.</p> \n<p> </p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bdae3f52a5ada7877d650a37ef15b4e9b1ca63e4/0_292_3072_1843/3072.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1843,"width":3072,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graeme Robertson for the Guardian","altText":"Alliance for Choice","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-15T06:00:04Z","lastModified":"2015-07-15T06:00:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":19,"contributors":[{"name":"Henry McDonald","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/henrymcdonald"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Abortion","Northern Ireland","UK news","Health","Society","Women","Life and style","World news","Law"],"tags":[{"id":"world/abortion","webTitle":"Abortion"},{"id":"uk/northernireland","webTitle":"Northern Ireland"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Henry McDonald","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/henrymcdonald"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/15/northern-ireland-pro-choice-protest-police-stations","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ak53","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/15/northern-ireland-pro-choice-protest-police-stations","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/15/northern-ireland-pro-choice-protest-police-stations"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bdae3f52a5ada7877d650a37ef15b4e9b1ca63e4/0_292_3072_1843/3072.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1843,"width":3072,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An Alliance for Choice rally in 2008.
