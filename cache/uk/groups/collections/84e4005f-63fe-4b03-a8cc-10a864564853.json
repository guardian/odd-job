Pressures on the benefit system and the way it washes through will have a great impact on these families, many of whom were struggling in the first place.”</p> \n<p>The data were compiled by <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1152176/massive-rise-in-number-of-children-in-care-under-coalition\">Children &amp; Young People Now</a> magazine, using official statistics for the years 2010 to 2014 years, and comparing them with extrapolated 2014-15 figures obtained from 109 of 150 English local authority children’s services departments.</p> \n<p>It found that the provisional figures for 2014-15 showed rises in looked-after children, children on child protection registers and section 47 inquiries.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “There has been a long-running growth in demand for children’s social care in recent years as the population has increased.</p> \n<p>“However, we know that councils are working hard to meet this demand – and more children are getting the targeted help they need.”</p> \n<p>But Enver Solomon, director of evidence and impact at National Children’s Bureau, said the increase in demand was not surprising. “Given the increasing number of families facing hardship there is no doubt that children’s social care remains under considerable strain as demand increases from families who are struggling to cope and children who are in need of care and protection.”</p> \n<p>David Cameron promised in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-on-opportunity\">a speech on Monday</a> that child protection would be a “big focus” of his next five years of government.

They could be reformed in a way which encourages full-time work. But simply salami-slicing the value of tax credits will hit certain households hard without creating this positive dynamic.”</p> \n<p>Ministers have refused to spell out exactly how they plan to save &pound;12bn in the welfare bill, but previous statements made by Cameron to rule out cuts to pensioner benefits and child benefit have shifted the focus of expected cuts onto child tax credits for those in work as well as housing benefit and some disability benefits.</p> \n<p>One of the options that has been mooted is cutting child tax credit back to its 2003 level, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated would reduce entitlements for about 3.7 million low-income families with children by an average of &pound;1,400 a year, and overall spending by about &pound;5bn.<br /></p> \n<p>Questioned about his plans for tax credits, Cameron said: “We have a system at the moment where basically we give people the minimum wage, we have tax taken from people on minimum wage and then we recycle it back to them.<br /></p> \n<p>“What I want to see is this move towards an economy with higher pay, lower welfare and lower taxes rather than low pay, high taxes and high welfare. That’s what we should be aiming for. We did well in the last parliament: more than two million people in work, we lifted many people out of income tax altogether, but we need to continue with that approach.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457237235__\n</div> \n<p>However, the prime minister made no commitments to asking companies to introduce the living wage, simply pointing out the minimum wage was predicted to rise to &pound;8 by 2020.<br /></p> \n<p>Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, later told the Commons: “We want companies to pay better salaries, which means less tax credits from us.” </p> \n<p>In a sign the government is planning to dismantle the system put in place by Gordon Brown, the cabinet minister also accused Labour of having repeatedly increased tax credits “as a way of trying to buy votes”.</p> \n<p>Labour warned before the last election that tax credits would be in the line of fire if Cameron returned to power. Following the prime minister’s speech, Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader, used Twitter to point out that he looks set to have been proved right, saying: “The PM’s one-nation speech feels like a weak attempt to explain why it is OK to cut tax credits and say you stand for working people.”</p> \n<p>Andrew Harrop, general secretary of the left-leaning Fabian Society, also pointed out that tax credits were often there to compensate low earners who had more responsibilities than the average worker. “This isn’t ‘one nation’, it is nasty politics and terrible policy,” he said. “The prime minister ... hopes to improve life chances for all, but singles out children as the main targets for cuts, once again.”</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>As well as having inflamed the left, Cameron’s suggestion that tax credits should be replaced by higher wages could set him on a collision course with employers. The prime minister is unlikely to force companies to pay the living wage but has not yet set out how he would encourage companies to pay higher salaries to replace lost tax credits, beyond modest expected increases in the minimum wage. </p> \n<p>It is possible he could adopt an idea from Labour, who have previously floated the idea of offering tax breaks to those who pay the living wage.<br /></p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e91d59292643dabe0c11543999afde9ee2c14451/340_4_4468_2683/4468.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2683,"width":4468,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Mother with her daughter on council estate","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-22T19:08:27Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T00:05:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowena Mason","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899403654/Rowena-Mason-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rowena-mason"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Welfare","David Cameron","Austerity","Economics","Tax and spending","Living wage","Society","Politics","UK news","Conservatives","Thinktanks","Child benefit","Benefits"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/welfare","webTitle":"Welfare"},{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"business/austerity","webTitle":"Austerity"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"politics/taxandspending","webTitle":"Tax and spending"},{"id":"society/living-wage","webTitle":"Living wage"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"politics/thinktanks","webTitle":"Thinktanks"},{"id":"society/child-benefit","webTitle":"Child benefit"},{"id":"society/benefits","webTitle":"Benefits"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rowena Mason","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rowena-mason"}}],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-457237235","source":"ITN","durationInSeconds":156,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/22/150622Cameron.m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/22/150622Cameron_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/22/1434980252352/KP_305913_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Cameron promises to end welfare merry-go-round - video","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Cameron promises to end welfare merry-go-round - video","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Cameron promises to end welfare merry-go-round - video"}}],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/22/poor-families-hit-unfairly-welfare-cuts-institute-economic-affairs","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3xq","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jun/22/poor-families-hit-unfairly-welfare-cuts-institute-economic-affairs","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/22/poor-families-hit-unfairly-welfare-cuts-institute-economic-affairs"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e91d59292643dabe0c11543999afde9ee2c14451/340_4_4468_2683/4468.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2683,"width":4468,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"One of the options proposed by the government is cutting child tax credit back to its 2003 level.

It was brought by <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/privacy\">Privacy</a> International, Liberty, Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union and a number of other international human rights groups.</p> \n<p>Welcoming the ruling, Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, said: “If spying on human rights NGOs isn’t off limits for GCHQ, then what is? Clearly our spy agencies have lost their way. For too long they’ve been trusted with too much power, and too few rules for them to protect against abuse. How many more problems with GCHQ’s secret procedures have to be revealed for them to be brought under control?”</p> \n<p>He added: “Trying to pass off such failings as technical, or significant changes in law as mere clarifications, has become a tiring defence for those who know the jig is up. The courts are begrudgingly helping to ensure that the sun is slowly setting on GCHQ’s wild west ways. Now we need parliament to step in to fix what should have been fixed a long time ago.”</p> \n<p>In relation to the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, the IPT found that “email communications ... were lawfully and proportionately intercepted and accessed ... However, the time limit for retention permitted under the internal policies of GCHQ, the intercepting agency, was overlooked in regard to the product of that interception, such that it was retained for materially longer than permitted under those policies.”</p> \n<p>In respect of the Legal Resources Centre, the IPT said: “Communications from an [associated] email address ... were intercepted and selected for examination ... The tribunal is satisfied that the interception was lawful and proportionate and that the selection for examination was proportionate, but that the procedure laid down by GCHQ’s internal policies for selection of the communications for examination was in error not followed in this case.”</p> \n<p>Janet Love, national director of the Legal Resources Centre, said it was “deeply concerned to learn that communications of our organisation have been subject to unlawful interception by GCHQ. As a public interest law firm, our communications are self-evidently confidential, and we consider this to be a serious breach of the rights of our organisation and the individuals concerned. </p> \n<p>“We can no longer accept the conduct of the intelligence services acting under such a pernicious veil of secrecy, and we will be taking immediate action to try to establish more information. We urge the South African and British governments to cooperate with us in this regard. We are particularly grateful for Liberty’s efforts in spearheading this litigation and making it possible for this information to be brought to light.”</p> \n<p>James Welch, legal director for Liberty, said: “Last year it was revealed that GCHQ were eavesdropping on sacrosanct lawyer-client conversations. Now we learn they’ve been spying on human rights groups. What kind of signal are British authorities sending to despotic regimes and those who risk their lives to challenge them all over the world? Who is being casual with human life now?”</p> \n<p>Rachel Logan, UK legal programme director for Amnesty International, said: “[This] raises the wider question as to why the UK intelligence services were intercepting the communications of these two highly regarded human rights NGOs at all. <br /> <br />“Knowing that your mail has been read, or your calls have been listened to can stifle people into silence, leading to self-censorship. It is a clear interference with basic rights such as free expression and right to privacy.<br /> <br />“Today’s ruling in relation to Amnesty tells us nothing. We still don’t know if we’ve been spied on at all, if we have been the subject of any targeted spying, if the tribunal thought any spying – if it did happen – was necessary and proportionate, or even if they had an entirely different reason for telling us nothing.”</p> \n<p>The legal challenge was the first of many GCHQ-related claims to be examined in detail by the IPT, which hears complaints against British intelligence agencies and government bodies that carry out surveillance under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa).<br /></p> \n<p>The civil liberties organisations are concerned that their private communications may have been monitored under <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2013/jun/21/gchq-cables-secret-world-communications-nsa\">GCHQ’s electronic surveillance programme, Tempora</a>, the existence of which was revealed by Snowden. They also complain that information obtained through the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data\">US National Security Agency’s Prism</a> and Upstream programmes may have been shared with British intelligence services, sidestepping protections provided by the UK legal system.</p> \n<p>During the hearing last summer, Matthew Ryder QC alleged that the intelligence services are constructing “vast databases” out of accumulated interceptions of emails. </p> \n<p>“If two out of 10 organisations who applied to the IPT found their emails were being illegally monitored, human rights fear, how many others are being targeted?

In reality, the rulings are less damning than they may first appear. Both of the earlier ones centred on the publication of minimal information about oversight and regulation of the affected activities. Once that scant information was made public (as it now has been), the underlying activity was legal. GCHQ was once again free to collect in bulk and, on occasion, intercept attorney/client communications.</p> \n<p>The latest ruling is much the same. A consortium of NGOs challenged potential GCHQ operations, and the IPT made “no determination” against most of the parties – unless it determines that surveillance was unlawful, the tribunal does not reveal whether or not a claimant was under surveillance – and made findings on two.</p> \n<p>In the case of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, communications were found to have been retained for longer than GCHQ policies allowed. In the case of South Africa’s Legal Resources Centre, procedure for selection of communications for examination was “in error not followed”.</p> \n<p>Both were relatively narrow technical violations, and the ruling vindicated GCHQ’s broader policies and legal framework and allowed in principal for the agency to monitor internal NGOs. </p> \n<p>It is important to note that just because rulings are based on errors, it does not mean they are trivial. A recent report from the interceptions of communications commissioner noted six cases in a year where errors in intercepts under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act had led to misguided action from law enforcement agencies. In this world, mistakes have consequences.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the broadest consequence of the IPT ruling is not in what it finds unlawful but what it permits. One of the UK’s intelligence oversight bodies has accepted that GCHQ can monitor human rights NGOs across the world – an activity the UK government often condemns when it is carried out in Russia or China, or in the Middle East. </p> \n<p>Such regimes now have an easy retort: they can point at the UK’s rules and ask why we are holding them to a higher standard than that to which we hold ourselves.</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434983267885/ba1e03cb-fa88-4b30-bbb2-dad7f9a570a1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"EPA","altText":"GCHQ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-22T14:40:18Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T14:55:55Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"James Ball","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/13/1423837353885/James-Ball-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jamesball"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["GCHQ","Surveillance","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/gchq","webTitle":"GCHQ"},{"id":"world/surveillance","webTitle":"Surveillance"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"James Ball","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jamesball"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#005689","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#005689","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#63717a","colourPalette":"analysis"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/22/ipt-gchq-ruling-permits-monitoring-human-rights-ngos","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a2jh","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jun/22/ipt-gchq-ruling-permits-monitoring-human-rights-ngos","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/22/ipt-gchq-ruling-permits-monitoring-human-rights-ngos"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434983267885/ba1e03cb-fa88-4b30-bbb2-dad7f9a570a1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham.

The civil service is not wired to negotiate the best possible deal.</p> \n<p>“The balance of competences review [the review of the impact of EU laws on the UK in the last parliament] was a damp squib. Civil servants go for the lowest common denominator.”</p> \n<p>Earlier Downing Street had said officials from the EU’s council secretariat in Brussels would embark on several months of negotiations with British officials led by Cameron’s senior EU adviser Tom Scholar. <br /></p> \n<p>The negotiations will be launched after the prime minister outlines his reform plans to the European Council – the EU’s 28 heads of state or government – at its annual June gathering in Brussels on Thursday and Friday this week. </p> \n<p>This timetable could allow the negotiations to return to EU leaders at their final European Council of the year, held in Brussels in December, paving the way for a possible referendum in the second half of 2016.</p> \n<p>The prime minister will have another meeting with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor who is seen in Downing Street as the key figure in the EU negotiations, before this week’s Brussels summit. Cameron is travelling to Berlin on Wednesday for a state banquet in honour of the Queen who is embarking on a state visit to Germany.</p> \n<p>The prime minister will then travel to Brussels to hold bilateral talks with the final set of EU leaders he has yet to brief in person on his reform plans. They are the leaders of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/greece\">Greece</a>, Austria, Portugal, Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania and Malta. </p> \n<p>Cameron will either speak to them by phone or hold talks in Brussels before the formal opening of the summit on Thursday afternoon.</p> \n<p>The conversations with the remaining leaders could prove tough. The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is likely to be preoccupied with his country’s financial crisis, while the <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/15/us-britain-politics-eu-austria-idUSKBN0O01II20150515\">Austrian chancellor, Werner Faymann</a>, was quoted by the German magazine Der Spiegel in May as suggesting that Cameron was not acting responsibly on the EU by planning an in/out referendum for the UK.</p> \n<p>The prime minister’s official spokeswoman said Cameron wanted technical discussions at official levels to begin soon after the June summit and to be concluded within several months. “On renegotiation, we would like to maintain momentum on the discussions we’ve had so far and pave the way for technical talks following the European council. One would expect them to take several months … The Germans have already indicated they are open to having official-level discussions,” she said.</p> \n<p>Government sources said Downing Street was keeping open the option of holding major negotiations on the prime minister’s EU reform plans. But sources said No 10 did not want to tie itself down and may wait until next year to embark on the full negotiations.</p> \n<p>The officials from the council secretariat, who will be joined by officials from the European commission, will be told by British officials that UK government lawyers believe treaty change will be required for at least two of Cameron’s demands. These are a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits and UK exemption from the EU’s historic commitment to forge an “ever closer union” of the peoples of Europe. <br /></p> \n<p>The prime minister’s other key demands include giving non-eurozone members, such as the UK, protections to ensure they cannot be outvoted on the single market by eurozone members. Cameron also wants national parliaments to have the right to club together to block EU legislation.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434998756633/e8422db2-5af6-4c2d-b5f7-040f50636f31-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter Byrne/PA","altText":"David Cameron","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-22T18:50:50Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T00:30:09Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":60,"contributors":[{"name":"Nicholas Watt","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nicholaswatt"},{"name":"Rowena Mason","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899403654/Rowena-Mason-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rowena-mason"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["David Cameron","Foreign policy","European Union","Europe","EU referendum","Politics","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"politics/foreignpolicy","webTitle":"Foreign policy"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"politics/eu-referendum","webTitle":"EU referendum"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/22/eu-reforms-mush-tory-rebels-david-cameron","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3xh","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jun/22/eu-reforms-mush-tory-rebels-david-cameron","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/22/eu-reforms-mush-tory-rebels-david-cameron"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434998756633/e8422db2-5af6-4c2d-b5f7-040f50636f31-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The negotiations will be launched after the prime minister outlines his reform plans to the European Council.
