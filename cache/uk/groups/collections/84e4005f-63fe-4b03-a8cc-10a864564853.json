One concern is believed to have been that ratification might leave the country open to renewed pressure to return the Elgin marbles to Greece, although there is nothing in the convention that would bind the UK to do so.</p> \n<p>Whittingdale also announced that ministers would set up a “cultural protection fund” to help preserve cultural heritage in potential or existing conflict zones, and help with the recovery of artefacts. He is to convene a summit of senior government figures and cultural leaders from the British Museum, the V&amp;A, the British Council and other key organisations – such as Unesco and the Red Cross – to advise on how to proceed.</p> \n<p>In April one of the country’s foremost archaeologists, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/apr/18/lord-renfrew-iraq-nimrud-hague-isis-islamic-state\" title=\"\">Lord Renfrew of Kaimsthorn, a Cambridge academic, said it was outrageous that the government was “dithering” over ratification</a> at a time when Isis was threatening some of the world’s top cultural treasures.</p> \n<p>The moves were welcomed by the director of the British Museum, Neil MacGregor, as “an important step towards safeguarding the world’s cultural property at risk in conflict zones”.</p> \n<p>He added that the museum was developing, with colleagues in Iraq, a programme to establish a specialist corps of rescue archaeologists in the country.</p> \n<p>“It is important to start this training now, as rescue archaeology will be essential as soon as it is once again possible to visit the key sites we believe have been damaged and to plan their recovery.”</p> \n<p>While Isis has claimed responsibility for the destruction of artefacts in Mosul museum, and reports indicate that they were responsible for the bulldozing and looting of the historic sites of Nimrud and Hatra, the full extent of the destruction is not yet known, as archaeologists have not been granted access to the sites.</p> \n<p>Last month, Islamic State group fighters <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/14/isis-syria-palmyra-iraq\" title=\"\">advanced on the ancient ruins at Palmyra</a>, raising fears that the Syrian world heritage site could face destruction of the kind already wreaked in Iraq.</p> \n<p>Whittingdale said last night: “While the UK’s priority will continue to be the human cost of these horrific conflicts, the UK must also do what we can to prevent any further cultural destruction.The loss of a country’s heritage threatens its very identity. The knowledge and expertise of the experts in our cultural institutions makes us uniquely qualified to help. I believe that the UK therefore has a vital responsibility to support cultural protection overseas.”The Department for Culture Media and Sport said countries that were party to the convention were “required to respect cultural property situated within the territory of other parties by not attacking it, and to respect cultural property within their own territory by not using it for purposes which are likely to expose it to destruction or damage during armed conflict.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2015/6/20/1434810844089/39989406marb_20020121_005-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"It's though that one reason why Britain has not so far signed the convention is fear of being asked to return the so-called Elgin marbles to Greece.

The organisation Veterans For Peace (VFP) is demanding change, but the MoD says it depends on 16-year-olds for a quarter of the intake needed to sustain UK forces.</p> \n<p>After a six-month trial, 16-year-olds are locked in to the forces until they reach 22, meaning a life-changing decision is made at a brutally young age, says VFP co-ordinator Ben Griffin, 37, who served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan in the SAS and the Parachute Regiment. He said his experiences gave him an “obligation” to tell teenagers the truth.</p> \n<p>There is provision for “unhappy juniors” to be discharged at the discretion of their commanding officer but no guarantee it will happen.</p> \n<p>“There’s no clear, uniformed enemy any more,” he said. “Basically,in war, you’re fighting a civilian population: you’re breaking down doors in the middle of the night. That can be a terrible shock. But by then you’re locked in. The clock doesn’t even start ticking on your four years until you’re 18. It’s a sinister thing, pulling in people who are less critical and easier to mould.”</p> \n<p>VFP is releasing several darkly satirical short films ahead of Saturday’s Armed Forces Day to highlight the cost of war, featuring Action Man dolls with accessories including antidepressants, wheelchairs, “benefits cancelled” letters and body bags – inspired, said artist Darren Cullen and film-maker Price James, by official Armed Forces toys, which include a Predator drone playset for five-year-olds.</p> \n<p>“Joining the military should be an informed decision,” said Cullen. “Armed Forces Day will be full of the glory of soldiering, the flag-waving and glamour, parachutists and the Red Arrows, all deliberately focused at children. We want to unpick the propaganda.”</p> \n<p>David Cameron, who attended Eton’s Combined Cadet Force, has set a target of creating 100 new units in state schools to build “character, grit and determination”. Currently the majority of units are in private schools.</p> \n<p>“We’re not a pacifist organisation but among the flag-waving on Armed Forces Day, spare a thought for the unquantifiable cost of war: not just those who have lost a limb, but those living with chronic pain, with facial or abdominal injuries, with PTSD, with anger and psychological damage, the effect on families,” said Griffin. “It’s OK to question these things. It’s not OK that people with a vested interested are pushing the notion of a noble military career to children.”</p> \n<p>An MoD spokesman said: “We recruit across all age groups and as part of our duty of care to recruits no young person under the age of 18 may join our armed forces without the formal written consent of their parent or guardian.”</p> \n<p>Recruitment of people under 18 makes a “significant contribution” to the forces’ annual intake, he said, without which it could not sustain personnel levels.</p> \n<p>The MoD said that the armed forces do not recruit in schools and only attend by invitation in support of school activities.</p> \n<p><em>An exhibition of the films and props will show at the </em><a href=\"https://www.list.co.uk/place/55075-red-gallery/\" title=\"\"><em>Red Gallery</em></a><em>, 1-3 Rivington Street, London EC2A 3DT from 23 June to 2 July.

I think we found each other and certain people need to realise that she did have other addictions before she met me,” he told the Times Magazine. “She wasn’t a happy, well-adjusted young woman … and I find it disrespectful to imply I was some machiavellian puppet master.”</p> \n<p>Winehouse and Fielder-Civil were married in 2007 and continued an on-off relationship after their marriage broke down two years later. They were both lost and damaged people, Fielder-Civil said. The 33-year-old also claimed he was still in love with Winehouse, four years after her death.</p> \n<p>“I’m in love with someone who is not here. I think about her every day,” he said. “I’m a bit stuck now, thinking, ‘How do I move on?’”</p> \n<p>The long-awaited documentary, Amy, made by Senna director Asif Kapadia, will be released on 3 July.

He is expected to make a recommendation to develop either Heathrow or Gatwick, but may insist on tough environmental conditions being met by the “winner”. These could allow ministers room to judge which option they believe would achieve the best balance between the economic benefits and environmental impact.</p> \n<p>The decision is one of the most controversial and politically difficult facing the new Tory government. Expansion of Heathrow <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2014/nov/01/third-runway-heathrow-gatwick-expansion\" title=\"\">is being resisted by several Tory cabinet ministers</a> – including international development secretary Justine Greening and foreign secretary Philip Hammond –whose constituencies would be affected, as well as by London mayor Boris Johnson. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/05/gatwick-mps-warn-political-stitch-up-boris-johnson-anti-heathrow\" title=\"\">A group of Tory MPs is also campaigning against an expansion of Gatwick.</a></p> \n<p>With debate intensifying, green campaigners, transport groups, economists and tax experts have joined to propose the radical plan, which they say would reduce costs for once-a-year holiday travellers, while hitting those who choose to fly regularly. They say it would also ensure the UK could comply with its obligations under the <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/tackling-climate-change/the-legal-landscape/global-action-on-climate-change/\" title=\"Committee on climate change\">Climate Change Act</a>.</p> \n<p>Under the plan, backed by the Campaign for Better Transport, the New Economics Foundation, the Tax Justice Network, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth among others, air passenger duty would be scrapped and replaced by a new frequent flyers levy. Everyone would be able to take one flight a year without paying any levy, but for subsequent journeys the levy would rise each time.</p> \n<p>Using accepted methods to calculate the effect of price on demand, experts say the number of flights taken by the better-off for leisure purposes – which account for much of recent growth – would be cut to a level that would make extra airport capacity unnecessary.</p> \n<p>In their letter they say: “Britain’s skies are already some of the busiest in the world, and Howard Davies knows that these expansion plans cannot be made to fit with the UK’s long-term commitments under the Climate Change Act. Contrary to aviation lobby rhetoric, a new runway is not needed to allow more international business flights, which have been declining steadily since the turn of the century.</p> \n<p>“The hub airport argument is a smokescreen. In reality, growing demand for air travel is concentrated in the short-haul leisure sector and among a small, wealthy minority of the population. It is more of these flights that a new runway will in practice service.</p> \n<p>“This growth in flights is driven by air fares that are kept artificially low through generous tax subsidies; aviation is exempt from fuel duty by international treaty and zero rated for VAT, alongside wheelchairs and baby clothes. Yet these tax breaks almost exclusively benefit the richest section of British society. Our analysis of passenger survey data shows that 15% of the UK population are taking 70% of all our flights, while half of us don’t fly at all in any given year.”</p> \n<p>They argue the new levy would shift the burden “away from families flying to their annual holiday and on to the frequent fliers who are driving expansion. Our research shows that this would let the UK meet our climate targets without making flying the preserve of the rich – and without needing to build any new runways.”</p> \n<p>Stephen Joseph, director of the <a href=\"http://www.bettertransport.org.uk\" title=\"\">Campaign for Better Transport</a>, said: “Replacing air passenger duty with a frequent flyers levy could, on the evidence so far, make it unnecessary to build any new runways. As the politics of airport expansion get more difficult, we think the government should look seriously at the levy proposal, to ensure that the richest who take the most flights pay the most tax.”</p> \n<p>John Stewart, chair of <a href=\"http://hacan.org.uk\" title=\"\">Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise</a>, which campaigns against expansion of Heathrow, added: “The beauty of this proposal is that it ticks both the equity and green boxes. It is a way of controlling the growth of aviation but still allowing ordinary families a holiday in the sun.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/dec/14/heathrow-runway-decision-airports-lord-adonis\" title=\"\">With business leaders impatient for a decision,</a> the government has said it will not comment on airport expansion until Davies has reported. Sources have indicated that a decision on which option to back is unlikely until the end of the year.
