Sturgeon and the French diplomat involved in the conversation have both made clear that the memo was inaccurate.<br /></p> \n<p>A Police Scotland spokesperson said: “We can confirm that a complaint has been received and inquiries are ongoing to establish whether there is any criminality.”</p> \n<p>The day after the story was first published in the Daily Telegraph in April, Carmichael flatly denied having had any role in leaking the memo. He told Channel 4 News: “I’ve told you the first I became aware of this, and this is already on the public record, was when I received a phone call on Friday afternoon from a journalist making me aware of it.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/23/alistair-carmichael-nicola-sturgeon-leaked-election-memo-snp\">Among those calling for him to consider his position over the weekend</a>, including Sturgeon herself, the point has been made that his sanctioning of the leak was compounded by the fact that he lied about his knowledge of it at the time and he was thus re-elected as the only Liberal Democrat MP in Scotland on a false prospectus.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Carmichael denied that he initially lied about his knowledge of the memo. Speaking on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radioscotland/programmes/schedules/orkney\">BBC Radio Orkney’s</a> Around Orkney programme he insisted: “What was true was that the first time I had seen that document in its detail, in its text, was when I saw it published in the pages of the Daily Telegraph.” </p> \n<p>“The proposal came to me by my staff, who said this is what was in this document, we think it should be put in the public domain, we believe it is in the public interest that it should be put out there that there’s something different being said in public compared to what is being said in private.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-people-versus-carmichael#/story\">A crowdfunding campaign</a> to raise money to pay for a legal challenge to Carmichael election, which saw his majority in the Orkney and Shetland seat slashed from more than 10,000 to 817 in the face of a strong SNP challenge, has raised more than &pound;20,000 in less than 24 hours.</p> \n<p>Nearly 1,300 people have donated to the campaign, launched by Kirkwall-based pro-independence and SNP supporter Fiona MacInnes. She aims to raise &pound;60,000 to make an election petition through the courts under the Representation of the People Act 1983, which allows for voters or disappointed candidates to lodge a petition questioning the result of a parliamentary election if they believe corruption or illegality has occurred.</p> \n<p>The campaign’s Indiegogo pages states: “This campaign is not supported by any political party but by residents of Orkney and Shetland who are disappointed in the behaviour of their MP and want our politics conducted honestly and without smears.”</p> \n<p>The SNP’s leader of the Commons, Pete Wishart, has reiterated his party’s calls for Carmichael to stand down and for a full investigation by the parliamentary commissioner for standards.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Comments have been

of the UK to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2002/feb/14/scotland.hunting\">ban traditional foxhunting and hare coursing</a> in 2002, it has been illegal to hunt a wild mammal with a dog. </p> \n<p>Hunts in Scotland can continue to kill foxes by practising an exemption to the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act called ‘<a

Cruel Sports</a> over a three month period apparently shows no practice of ‘flushing to guns’. The surveillance of five of Scotland’s 10 hunts suggests that they are routinely behaving as they did before the ban, with a complete absence of shotguns.</p> \n<p>The footage, which will be presented to MSPs in Holyrood on Wednesday, shows dogs in full cry apparently following a scent and appearing to be encouraged to do so by members of the hunt.

We are calling on the Scottish government to lead the way once more and make two simple amendments to the law [to reduce the number of dogs used in flushing to guns to two and to add a clause outlawing reckless behaviour].</p> \n<p>“These changes would make it extremely difficult for Scottish hunts to use cynical subterfuge to mask packs of hounds being encouraged to chase foxes and eventually kill them.”<br /></p> \n<p>But Jamie Stewart, Scotland director for the Countryside Alliance, disputed the nature of the footage, telling the Guardian: “Having viewed the footage, I am appalled that the League Against Cruel Sports is wasting the Scottish government’s time with what is at best subjective and at worst contrived.” </p> \n<p>He insisted that there was no illegal activity shown in the filming, and that anti-hunting legislation worked well in Scotland. “The Act is robust and we have had 13 years of monitoring by animal welfare groups and Police Scotland without seeing the Scottish court system backed up with cases.”</p> \n<p>Polling commissioned by the League from IPSOS Mori in March found that 84% of the Scottish public supported the foxhunting ban.

These 9mm bullets are unusual in as much as they will not work in most types of western handgun.

We are also issuing a photo of a similar type of jacket in the hope this may jog someone’s memory.</p> \n<p>“We also believe the gunman may have been in the area some time before the shooting.

The result has been a decrease in the number of Neets, although the problem remains because young people <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/know-when-you-can-leave-school\">can still leave school after the age of 16</a>, while the legislation lacks teeth.</p> \n<p>Currently, more than 130,000 16- to 18-year-olds are not in education, employment or training. Overall, one in eight young people in England are classified as Neets, the lowest proportion in a decade.</p> \n<p>“Many of the Neets are far from the labour market not only due to their low skills but also because they have withdrawn from the labour force,” the OECD noted.</p> \n<p>A Department for Education spokesman said: “Following years of stagnation in international education league tables, this government’s relentless focus on standards is ensuring that thousands more young people are able to read, write and add up properly.</p> \n<p>“We will continue to build on this success by ensuring all young people leave school with the knowledge and skills they need to compete with their peers from across the globe.”</p> \n<p>The gap in scores from tests of literacy between the Neets and those in employment of the same age was nearly double the average gap found elsewhere in the OECD.

If passed, London would have allowed in return the regional government in Belfast to set its own low corporation to attract foreign direct investment. </p> \n<p>The DUP minister Mervyn Storey accused Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP of reneging on the cross-party Stormont house agreement made in December when it appeared there was a consensus on tackling welfare. </p> \n<p>Storey said: “They want, like Pontius Pilate, to wring their hands, to almost cleanse their consciences that somehow they had not signed the dotted line.</p> \n<p>“It was a five-party agreement. I believe that we have now obtained the balance between what in an ideal world we would like to do and what we can afford to do.” </p> \n<p>But the Sinn F&eacute;in deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, blamed “Tory cuts” for the problem.</p> \n<p>He said: “The current crisis has come about solely through the actions of the British government; it could only be resolved by the actions of the British government.</p> \n<p>“They have attacked the most vulnerable in society, slashed the budget for public services and undermined the credibility of these institutions. There is still time for the parties and the British government to deliver a new budget that delivers.”</p> \n<p>Unionists have predicted that the &pound;600m hole in the finances would cause the local administration to run out of money within the next few months. </p> \n<p>Before the vote, the Irish Republic’s foreign minister, Charlie Flanagan, appealed for the parties to reach an agreement on welfare changes. Flanagan said failure would have serious implications for political stability.</p> \n<p>“The government agreed that every possible effort must be made to encourage and support the Northern Ireland executive parties to reach an agreement on welfare reform that is both politically acceptable and financially viable,” Flanagan said. </p> \n<p>“As well as providing a template for financial stability in Northern Ireland, the Stormont house agreement represents an agreed way forward for addressing the contentious legacy of the past.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fc20ce14a317a04f86615290e0633d9b2cf20398/0_225_4011_2407/4011.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2407,"width":4011,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Mark Winter/Demotix/Corbis","altText":"26 May 2015, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK --- Belfast, United Kingdom. 26th May 2015 -- The DUP MP Nigel Dodds speaks to the press at Stormont during the Welfare stormont debate. -- DUP MP Nigel Dodds, Arlene Foster and Sammy Wilson speak of their disbelief after a petition of concern has been formally lodged by Sinn Féin and the SDLP on the Welfare Reform Bill. --- Image by © Mark Winter/Demotix/Corbis","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Mark Winter/Demotix/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-26T21:54:03Z","lastModified":"2015-05-26T23:01:29Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":112,"contributors":[{"name":"Henry McDonald","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/henrymcdonald"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Northern Irish politics","Northern Ireland","UK news","Politics","Democratic Unionist party (DUP)","Sinn Féin","Welfare"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/northernireland","webTitle":"Northern Irish politics"},{"id":"uk/northernireland","webTitle":"Northern Ireland"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"politics/dup","webTitle":"Democratic Unionist party (DUP)"},{"id":"politics/sinn-fein","webTitle":"Sinn Féin"},{"id":"politics/welfare","webTitle":"Welfare"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Henry McDonald","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/henrymcdonald"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/26/northern-ireland-power-sharing-in-crisis-as-welfare-bill-fails","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/498zt","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/may/26/northern-ireland-power-sharing-in-crisis-as-welfare-bill-fails","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/26/northern-ireland-power-sharing-in-crisis-as-welfare-bill-fails"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fc20ce14a317a04f86615290e0633d9b2cf20398/0_225_4011_2407/4011.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2407,"width":4011,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Democratic Unionist members Nigel Dodds, Arlene Foster and Sammy Wilson express their anger about the Sinn Féin and SDLP action.

More than 100,000 people are living with MS in the UK, making it the most common disabling neurological condition in young adults, but the MS Society says awareness remains low. </p> \n<p>The charity’s chief executive, Michelle Mitchell, said: “Being misdiagnosed or experiencing symptoms that can’t be explained can put a considerable strain on people’s emotions and health. A fast, accurate diagnosis enables people to take steps to begin to manage their condition, access treatment and take greater control of their lives again.”</p> \n<p>Just over 1,500 people took part in the survey. One in four said they visited their GP over four times before they were referred to a neurologist for further examination. Other misdiagnoses included depression, anxiety or stress (14%) and stroke (11%).</p> \n<p>Many people with MS can appear to be fine on the outside while struggling with hidden symptoms such as numbness, tingling, problems with mobility and balance, vision and dizziness, fatigue, bladder problems, muscle stiffness or pain.</p> \n<p>Acknowledging that the disease can be difficult to diagnose, the MS Society said that it is important for GPs to recognise the warning signs. It warns that delays can be harmful by preventing people from taking the necessary steps to manage their condition effectively and said there is evidence that early treatment has long-term benefits.</p> \n<p>Prof Alan Thompson, consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and director of the UCL Institute of Neurology, said: “We’ve moved on so much in terms of the treatments that are available to slow the long-term damage that relapsing forms of MS cause, so a prompt and accurate diagnosis of MS can make an enormous difference. It is only once someone is diagnosed that they can begin to understand and manage their condition.”</p> \n<p>The survey results suggest a failure to correctly diagnose can be compounded in many cases by people Googling their symptoms. Two in five respondents said they searched the web for information while in limbo, with one saying: “I scared myself to death.” </p> \n<p>Prof Maureen Baker, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “MS is incredibly difficult to diagnose in primary care as many of the symptoms are similar to those of other, more common conditions – and some less obvious symptoms may not be disclosed by patients during consultation.</p> \n<p>“It is also a relatively rare condition – 5,000 new cases are diagnosed every year, but to put this into context, GPs make over one million patient consultations every day across the UK. Furthermore, the constraints of the standard 10-minute consultation make identification of such a complex and uncommon condition problematic at initial presentation.<br /></p> \n<p>“The RCGP has developed resources to support GPs and their teams – including an e-learning module in collaboration with the MS Society – to identify, diagnose and treat patients with MS as effectively as possible.”</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432666357597/bee2c9c5-6ec0-48a2-93c4-60e98ca3a62b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Daisy-Daisy / Alamy/Alamy","altText":"MRI scan of human brain","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Daisy-Daisy / Alamy/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-27T06:35:14Z","lastModified":"2015-05-27T06:35:30Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Haroon Siddique","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/haroonsiddique"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Multiple sclerosis","UK news","Society","Health"],"tags":[{"id":"society/multiple-sclerosis","webTitle":"Multiple sclerosis"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Haroon Siddique","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/haroonsiddique"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/may/27/four-in-five-multiple-sclerosis-sufferers-in-uk-are-misdiagnosed","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/498bb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/may/27/four-in-five-multiple-sclerosis-sufferers-in-uk-are-misdiagnosed","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/27/four-in-five-multiple-sclerosis-sufferers-in-uk-are-misdiagnosed"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432666357597/bee2c9c5-6ec0-48a2-93c4-60e98ca3a62b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"MRI scan of human brain.
