Trusts will also be banned from using agencies that are not on a new approved list. </p> \n<p>“Expensive staffing agencies are quite simply ripping off the NHS. It’s outrageous that taxpayers are being taken for a ride by companies charging up to &pound;3,500 a shift for a doctor”, said Hunt. </p> \n<p>“The NHS is bigger than all of these companies, so we’ll use our bargaining power to drive down rates and beat them at their own game.” </p> \n<p>Hunt’s move was widely welcomed as a way of tackling the NHS’s growing financial problems and helping it deliver &pound;22bn of efficiency savings by 2020. Hospital bosses have become increasingly frustrated by what they see as agencies exploiting the NHS’s staffing problems. </p> \n<p>Some trusts have as many as 25% fewer nurses than the number they believe they need to deliver safe, high-quality care. </p> \n<p>However, some experts raised doubts about how Hunt’s initiative would work, given the health service’s chronic lack of many types of staff, including nurses, GPs, A&amp;E doctors and radiologists. </p> \n<p>Candace Imison, director of healthcare systems at the Nuffield Trust health thinktank, said: “There’s no doubt that the rising agency bill is an issue for hospitals up and down the country. But a cap on individual hospital trusts’ agency staff spending could put them between a rock and a hard place if they cannot meet minimum safe staffing levels without these workers.”</p> \n<p>Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: “Patient safety must always come first, so any plans for a cap on spending must ensure that it does not prevent trusts from providing safe staffing levels when there are no alternatives.” Reducing nurse training places was a “reckless and short-sighted” attempt to save money, he added. </p> \n<p>Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association, said the NHS’s greater reliance on agency staff “is a sign of stress on the system and the result of poor workforce planning by government”. </p> \n<p>Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said mistakes by the Conservatives had led to the expanded use of agency staff. <br /></p> \n<p>“Jeremy Hunt is trying to pull the wool over people’s eyes by acting as if the &pound;3.3bn agency bill is a problem he has suddenly discovered,” he said. <br /></p> \n<p>“The decision to cut 6,000 nursing posts in the early years of the last parliament, alongside big reductions in nurse training places, has left the NHS in the grip of private staffing agencies.” </p> \n<p>NHS Employers said that hospitals would continue to need to recruit permanent staff from abroad to fill vacancies. </p> \n<p> </p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a1d8770a754b4150f9d4e89c6fa2b31d9ed83ea8/0_0_3367_2021/3367.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2021,"width":3367,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter Byrne/PA","altText":"Embargoed to 0001 Thursday November 13\nFile photo 03/10/14 of a ward at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital as the NHS will have to use new technology to slash costs.

They don’t want somebody waddling down the road who’s never going to arrive, and when they get there they’re out of breath.”</p> \n<p>Figures published weeks before the tests became mandatory last year showed hundreds of officers failed. </p> \n<p>Hogan-Howe, who rose through the ranks in South Yorkshire and Merseyside before landing the top job at Scotland Yard in 2011, said he missed the hands-on side of being an officer. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2014/aug/15/police-yorkshire\">Two per cent of police officers fail new fitness tests</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He said: “I joined as a policeman, I didn’t intend to be commissioner. It’s not exciting to chair meetings. There are some exciting outcomes … but it’s never quite as joyful as finding somebody who has raped or done a burglary.”</p> \n<p>Asked about whether a surveillance culture was present in the UK, Hogan-Howe appeared to suggest taxi companies had more powers than the police. <br /></p> \n<p>He said: “They will know where your phone is and where the taxi is and then put you together. But when people ring the police, we haven’t got a clue where that phone is. You may have been stabbed and expect us to come and help.” He said police could not use location data in “real time”, adding: “We have to make an emergency application; there’s a process to go through.” </p> \n<p>The commissioner, who was raised by his mother in Sheffield in the 1960s and rarely saw his father, rejected the description of his early life as tough, insisting: “I think I had a good childhood. We weren’t financially well off … we didn’t get holidays and things like that, but I don’t regard that as tough. But I think you understand the problems people have who are in those circumstances.” </p> \n<p>He said he did not know if his father followed his career: “The last time I saw him I was around 18. I remember seeing him walking through a subway in Sheffield.” Asked what he would say to his father if he was still alive, he said: “As you get older, you want to hear a little more about someone’s reasoning. I’d probably want to hear his side.” </p> \n<p>Hogan-Howe, whose favourite music is opera, revealed he enjoyed the crime drama Prime Suspect. “I liked the thoroughness of it,” he said. “The people are passionate but they know it’s complex and they don’t let go. </p> \n<p>“People sometimes think detectives are big extroverts with loud ties. But the best detectives listen carefully, speak less, pay attention to detail and are patient.” </p> \n<p>The Radio Times interview ties in with the start of The Met, a five-part BBC1 documentary series about the UK’s largest police force. </p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/527838bb5324f9ae1768f9ec521c4719e6663801/8_0_2909_1745/2909.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1745,"width":2909,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lewis Whyld/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Bernard Hogan-Howe","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Lewis Whyld/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-01T23:01:02Z","lastModified":"2015-06-01T23:01:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":265,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Police","Bernard Hogan-Howe","UK news","Police and crime commissioners","BBC1","Factual TV","BBC"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/police","webTitle":"Police"},{"id":"world/bernard-hogan-howe","webTitle":"Bernard Hogan-Howe"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk/police-and-crime-commissioners","webTitle":"Police and crime commissioners"},{"id":"media/bbc1","webTitle":"BBC1"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/factual-tv","webTitle":"Factual TV"},{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/01/bernard-hogan-howe-unfit-officers-shape-up-metropolitan-police","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49dxd","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jun/01/bernard-hogan-howe-unfit-officers-shape-up-metropolitan-police","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/01/bernard-hogan-howe-unfit-officers-shape-up-metropolitan-police"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/527838bb5324f9ae1768f9ec521c4719e6663801/8_0_2909_1745/2909.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1745,"width":2909,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bernard Hogan-Howe says police officers need fit colleagues, not ‘somebody waddling down the road who’s never going to arrive’.

Matthew Pointon, property economist at City consultancy Capital Economics, said that with the stock of homes for sale at a historic low, “the conditions are in place for further price gains this year.” He added: “The low point for the annual rate of house price inflation is now in sight.” </p> \n<p>Steven Bell, chief economist at City fund manager F&amp;C Investments, said competition between mortgage lenders, together with rising incomes and falling arrears, were all boosting the supply of home loans and pushing up prices. “In the UK housing market, the global financial crisis seems a long time ago,” he said.</p> \n<p>The Land Registry figures – which are regarded as the most accurate because they reflect completed transactions rather than asking prices or mortgage loans – showed that prices rose by 0.9% in April across England and Wales, following a 0.8% dip in March. </p> \n<p>In the weeks before the general election, the average price of a home hit &pound;179,817: almost &pound;9,000 higher than a year earlier and approaching the pre-crisis high of &pound;181,014 reached in November 2007. In London, the average price was up &pound;47,000 in 12 months, and prices grew by more than 10% in 28 of the capital’s 33 boroughs. </p> \n<p>Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders, an agent for wealthy clients, said it was “encouraging to see how well prices held up in April”, when it was unclear if a new government would bring new property taxes. </p> \n<p>The prospect of a Labour mansion tax on properties costing more than &pound;2m hit the top end of the market: the Land Registry reported a 30% slump in the number of sales in February, compared with the previous year. But Hopper said: “In the weeks since the election the market has quickly become much more free-flowing, with energised buyers and supply improving dramatically. Buyer demand and confidence are robust – both bode well for a strong summer moving season.”</p> \n<p>Trevor Abrahmsohn, whose Glentree estate agency sells luxury homes in north London, said political uncertainty had deterred buyers in his part of the market: “The mansion tax, the threat to non-doms and the anti-business rhetoric from Labour made it very difficult. Since the election, people feel there’s no restrictions again. That’s good for everyone in the UK.”</p> \n<p>In a note put out before the Land Registry figures were published, Bell said he believed the Bank of England would prefer to wait until the end of the year to see the impact of the July budget before raising interest rates, but it was likely to be confronted with surging prices in the next few months. <br /></p> \n<p>“This will confront the Bank of England with a dilemma: whether to raise base rates early ... or risk yet another house price boom,” he said. “A strong housing market is both an indicator that financial conditions are too loose and a mechanism by which those loose conditions feed through into the rest of the economy.”</p> \n<p>The Land Registry’s data, which is based on repeat sales and so does not include new-build homes, showed large leaps in prices in several parts of the country. The biggest monthly price increase in April was in Yorkshire and the Humber, where prices increased 2.7% over the month to an average of &pound;123,471. In London, prices rose by 2.3% to &pound;474,544 and annual growth across the capital was 10.9%.</p> \n<p>There was also strong growth in the north-west of England, which registered a 2.1% rise during the month. However, prices fell in Wales and the north-east of England, by 1.1% and 0.5% respectively.</p> \n<p>Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, increased his forecast for growth in 2015 from 5% to 6% “partly due to the increased upward impact on prices coming from a lack of properties on the market”. He added: “We also suspect that the housing market will benefit from reduced uncertainty following the decisive general election result.” </p> \n<p>Pointon said that it was possible that more sellers would come forward now the election was out of the way, but he said that would not ease upward pressure on prices because “any new supply is likely to be matched by demand”. </p> \n<p>Fionnuala Earley, residential research director at property firm Hamptons International, said a post-election bounce was not unusual: “Our research over the last eight elections shows that there is always a bounce in activity after the vote, making up for a slowdown in the previous six months and some of this will feed into price growth.” But Earley insisted it was “overblown to say that there is another dangerous house price boom on the way. </p> \n<p>Housing charity Shelter said the &pound;9,000 increase in prices since April 2014 meant goalposts had moved “yet again” for those saving for a home. Its chief executive, Campbell Robb, said: “With over 80% of homes on the market in England unaffordable for a typical family – even if they have a deposit – for many, a home of their own has gone from possibility to pipe-dream.”</p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433202111523/8f43b0dd-bd17-4b31-8f4d-d60ed8c268f9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Matt Cardy/Getty Images","altText":"SALCOMBE, ENGLAND - JUNE 01:  A estate agents for sale board is displayed outside a property in the seaside town of Salcombe on June 1, 2015 in Devon, England.

The Sunday Times reported at the weekend that he had ordered his civil servants to model the effects of imposing such a limit, which showed that it would save &pound;1bn a year. A further &pound;2.5bn a year could be saved, according to figures compiled by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, by cutting the amount of child benefit for a first child from &pound;20.70 a week to &pound;13.70, the same as the amount paid for subsequent children.</p> \n<p>A source told the Sunday Times: “Iain is not going to do this in a cheese-paring kind of way. This will be about achieving behaviour change. With two children, you send a message where people have to think: can I afford another child? If you are on benefits and know the state will support you for the next child and the next, you are not facing the same decisions.”</p> \n<p>Downing Street made clear that Duncan Smith’s proposals would be given short shrift. The prime minister’s spokeswoman said: “The PM’s view on this is that, as he said during the election campaign, we keep child benefit. We don’t cut child benefit.”</p> \n<p>But No 10 confirmed that child benefit would be frozen for the next two years in line with a freeze on working age benefits. “As part of the plans [of freezing working age benefits], we will go on freezing child benefit for the first two years of this parliament.”</p> \n<p>Downing Street reinforced the message by distributing remarks made by the prime minister in an ITV News interview in the closing stages of the general election campaign.

We can. We can win that argument by being relentlessly positive and of course by making it clear that what we are advocating is not simply in the interests of Britain but in the entire EU. </p> \n<p>“I congratulate the prime minister and the elan and the success with which he has begun his pan-European schmooze-athon in the chancelleries of Europe. I believe his efforts will be crowned with success.”</p> \n<p>The London mayor, who first made his name as the Daily Telegraph’s Brussels correspondent by baiting the former European commission president Jacques Delors in the early 1990s, has been keen in recent months to quash speculation that in private he is strongly pro-EU. Johnson knows that he will need to emphasise his Eurosceptic credentials if he is to succeed Cameron as Tory leader.</p> \n<p>But Johnson’s remarks suggest that he might even be prepared to take a leading role in his party’s no campaign, which will be launched after the prime minister concludes his EU negotiations. The ranks of this group will swell if Cameron is seen to have secured a weak deal.</p> \n<p>Johnson has been made a member of Cameron’s political cabinet and is due to be given a full cabinet post when his term at City Hall ends next May, by which point the prime minister hopes to have completed his EU negotiations.</p> \n<p>Johnson, who has recently had a biography of Winston Churchill published, warned both sides in the EU debate to be careful about claiming the mantle of Britain’s wartime leader. Churchill argued in favour of a “United States of Europe” but said that Britain should not be a member.</p> \n<p>The London mayor said: “I notice, in the course of trying to settle this argument over the last few days, assorted speakers have invoked the memory of Winston Churchill in one way or another. I have tell you Churchill was absolutely useless on this subject. He is biblical on this matter. You can find a text to justify almost any proposition about our relations with Europe that you choose. But one thing he believed in passionately – and that was in parliament as the expression of the will of the British people. He would want to see that democratic principle upheld today.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433188913487/5852373c-ae1e-4f28-a454-eac94b140992-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dan Kitwood/PA","altText":"‘We should be prepared to forge an alternative future that could be just as glorious and just as prosperous with a free trading arrangement’ sad Boris Johnson in his first speech to parliament in seen years.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dan Kitwood/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-01T20:05:10Z","lastModified":"2015-06-01T21:07:24Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Nicholas Watt","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nicholaswatt"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["European Union","Boris Johnson","Politics","UK news","Conservatives","European commission","Europe","David Cameron","EU referendum"],"tags":[{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"politics/boris","webTitle":"Boris Johnson"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"world/european-commission","webTitle":"European commission"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"politics/eu-referendum","webTitle":"EU referendum"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Nicholas Watt","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/nicholaswatt"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/01/cameron-eu-talks-boris-johnson","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49d5e","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/01/cameron-eu-talks-boris-johnson","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/01/cameron-eu-talks-boris-johnson"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433188913487/5852373c-ae1e-4f28-a454-eac94b140992-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘We should be prepared to forge an alternative future that could be just as glorious and just as prosperous with a free trading arrangement’ said the London mayor in his first speech to parliament in seven years.
