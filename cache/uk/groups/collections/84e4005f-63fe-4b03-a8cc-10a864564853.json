A letter to parents said that, from later this year, children driven to school by women would be turned away.</p> \n<p>Parents in the area defended the ban on Friday, saying it was part of the choice they made when they agreed to live within the Belz community. Women rejected the characterisation that they were oppressed, and the schools wrote to Morgan, saying the notice had been misrepresented.</p> \n<p>The group runs Talmud Torah Machzikei Hadass, a boys’ primary school, and Beis Malka, a primary school for girls. Both have been rated good by Ofsted.</p> \n<p>The schools had said that, from August, any child driven to school by their mother would be turned away at the school gates. The letter said the ban was based on the recommendations of Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach, the Belzer spiritual leader in Israel.</p> \n<p>It said that if a mother has no other choice but to drive her child to school – such as a medical reason – she should “submit a request to the special committee to this effect and the committee shall consider her request”.</p> \n<p>Morgan condemned the edict, which was <a href=\"http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/136878/stamford-hill-sect-bans-women-drivers\">first reported</a> by the Jewish Chronicle. In a statement provided to the Guardian, she said: “This is completely unacceptable in modern Britain. If schools do not actively promote the principle of respect for other people they are breaching the independent school standards. Where we are made aware of such breaches we will investigate and take any necessary action to address the situation.”<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b56fe6c6a73ccc1ff102409cc522e659c855a153\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b56fe6c6a73ccc1ff102409cc522e659c855a153/173_207_2740_1645/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Education secretary Nicky Morgan condemned the ban.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Education secretary Nicky Morgan condemned the ban.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Department for Education later confirmed that an investigation was under way.</p> \n<p>Outside the schools on Friday, the Guardian found parents were broadly supportive of the decree. Jacob – not his real name – who said he had sons at one of the schools, said he and his wife had actively chosen to be part of the Belz sect because of its strict regulations. “My mother drives, my mother-in-law drives, if my wife wanted to drive, she could drive tomorrow, we could take our children to another school. We’d have a discussion about it, as in any marriage. </p> \n<p>“It’s not forbidden in Jewish law. But this is our tradition, this is our choice to be a little more pious. So my wife doesn’t want to drive. This isn’t Saudi Arabia, no one’s going to be punished, or whipped or whatever, or even ostracised.”</p> \n<p>Jacob insisted the group did not want to impose its rules on others. “We’re not saying ‘all the women of London shouldn’t drive’, that would be ridiculous. We’re saying, let us get on living our lives how we want to live it – stop saying that we are oppressed.”</p> \n<p>Another Stamford Hill man, who said he was part of the Belz community, said: “I agree with the policy of women not driving. Hasidic women have never driven cars. No one is unhappy. Not one of my friends would let his wife drive.”</p> \n<p>Many women in the community expressed the same view. Outside the Beis Malka school, as schoolgirls left early on Friday to get home in time for the sabbath to start, several women drove large people-carriers close to the school, but parked some distance away. </p> \n<p>One woman, who was walking to collect her daughter, said the letter had not bothered her. “I walk everywhere, I don’t need to drive. I have five children: I would need to drive a very big car, and that’s not an option for me. There’s maybe a few occasions where it would have been more convenient to have a car, but I can’t think of many. Everything we need is here in Stamford Hill.”<br /></p> \n<p>Another Belz woman said: “I don’t drive, because I want to be part of this community.”</p> \n<p>She said the ban did not apply universally. “There’s no ban on driving in other parts of the Jewish community. I can choose to educate my children in a different schools, there are over 20 to choose from in Stamford Hill. But I believe that if you join a private school you have to abide by their rules.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"129897758716c9afedde626fa68217c4558e97ff\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/129897758716c9afedde626fa68217c4558e97ff/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pupils leave Beis Malka school in north London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pupils leave Beis Malka school in north London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another Stamford Hill mother, who gave her name as Judith, said not only was she happy with the ban, but had rejected the offer of dispensation from rabbis who said she would be permitted to drive because she was divorced and had a disabled child. “I choose to be part of this community, it’s my choice,” she said. “Family purity is exceptionally important to us, there’s no bigger priority for us than raising a pure Jewish family.”</p> \n<p>In a letter to Morgan on Friday, the school said it regretted the language used in its original decree. “We accept that the choice of words was unfortunate and if a negative impression was created by our letter then we unreservedly apologise for that,” it said.</p> \n<p>Ahron Klein, chief executive of the schools, said the Belz community was guided by “religious principles and strong traditional values” and that it was concerned by the erosion of these values, “caused by the proliferation of technology and the declining standards of visual and printed media”.</p> \n<p>He wrote: “We are proud of what we stand for and we do not feel the need to excuse ourselves for our deeply held beliefs and staunchly maintained way of life. It has withstood the test of time and is not prone to the vagaries of passing fads.”<br /></p> \n<p>But he said “the issue of women driving cars became conflated with broader issues which we intended to address” and that those women who chose to drove would be “respected within our community”. It was unclear whether that meant that women could continue to drive their children to school.</p> \n<p>Hackney council, which covers Stamford Hill, said it was “continuing to work with the Department of Education”, and confirmed that the Stamford Hill schools in question are independent.</p> \n<p>The Board of Deputies of British Jews distanced itself from the decree, saying the letter was from a marginal and unaffiliated group.</p> \n<p>A former member of another ultra-Orthodox sect said on Friday that she faced pressure from her family when she decided that she wanted to drive. The woman told Radio 4 that her husband was “very disturbed with the idea” as it was “unheard of in my immediate community, family and friends. None of the women drove.”</p> \n<p>The woman, who left the community just over two years ago when her marriage ended, said: “This is a very insular community with very little contact with the outside world. It’s actually incredible how that works: how you can have a world that exists within a world.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/8c8669aedd8e8591b11d1a70e1f0e1e20c738426/0_0_5760_3456/5760.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3456,"width":5760,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Teri Pengilley for the Guardian","altText":"Students leave Beis Malka school in north London, where women have been banned from driving children to school.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Teri Pengilley for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b56fe6c6a73ccc1ff102409cc522e659c855a153/173_207_2740_1645/2740.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1645,"width":2740,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Education secretary Nicky Morgan condemned the ban.

The capital’s transport authorities promise to transform the routes by integrating them with the tube service, revamping the stations and trains, staffing the network all the time the trains are running, and lowering some fares.</p> \n<p>Passenger numbers have more than trebled on the lines that formed the initial London Overground seven years ago. Now, services operated by Abellio Greater Anglia passing through some of the capital’s more deprived boroughs – via Bethnal Green to Enfield Town, Cheshunt and Chingford – will become part of the Overground network. Meanwhile, stopping trains to Shenfield in Essex will run as TfL Rail, a precursor to Crossrail before the full east-west line under central London opens in 2018.<br /></p> \n<p>“Some of these stations you really wouldn’t want to travel to after dark at the moment,” says Mike Brown, the managing director of London’s rail service. Many are not staffed after midday. The coming change, he says, will be “exciting in terms of the impact it will have on a swath of people who’ve had a mixed level of service in the past: people will see stations that are clean and spotless. </p> \n<p>“We’re doing refurbishment of the trains, we’re going to absolutely push the reliability of the service, we’re going to have staff on every single station while trains operate, no one will pay a higher fare and some will pay lower.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/05/overground-zip/giv-212779EXoFWD0pqZF/\" data-alt=\"Overground spending\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/05/overground-zip/giv-212779EXoFWD0pqZF/\">Overground spending</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Stations should become more accessible for disabled passengers, with a “turn-up-and-go” service meaning staff should be on hand to assist without the advance warning required by some rail operators.<br /></p> \n<p>The promise of transformation is credible given the record to date, insists Brown: “The north London line part of the route has had a 268% increase in ridership since we took over in 2008. This was a dreadful, desolate place with broken windows, plants growing on the platform, buddleia growing out of buildings.”<br /></p> \n<p>The old Silverlink service on the North London line was reincarnated as the Overground in 2008. A second phase of expansion saw rail routes in south London brought into the network, with the construction of a new line and stations between Islington and Whitechapel completing a loop running from Willesden via Clapham Junction.</p> \n<p>TfL will invest &pound;25m next year in overhauling the stations now coming under its control. Brown contends that service standards demanded under the concession, rather than the incentives of a traditional rail franchise, can drive change. Where it may make financial sense for national operators to prioritise longer distance trains to collect higher fares – cancelling a suburban stopping service first when problems emerge – TfL’s contracts are skewed towards rewarding punctual, running trains, as well as cleaner services. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48fd9a067aa048b55f57290b68a57bdf341e40fa\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432718213499/b9479839-fbaa-480a-93b5-2ea102c23f4f-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Some services currently operated by Abellio Greater Anglia will become part of the Overground network.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some services currently operated by Abellio Greater Anglia will become part of the Overground network.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There is an exacting list of performance measures handed down by TfL to the Overground’s train operators, LOROL (a joint venture between the German rail firm Arriva and Hong Kong metro operators MTR – the firm which will also run the TfL Rail and Crossrail trains alone). “It includes graffiti and even pigeons, believe it or not,” says Gareth Biggins, LOROL’s head of concession management, pointing to independent coffee stalls and cafes that have sprouted up in once unprepossessing stations. “Other operators take a share of ticket sales, but we generally have to take care of the station and look after the surroundings – they incentivise us to do things properly.”</p> \n<p>The operators say there has been a “cross-pollination of ideas” with Newcastle’s Metro and Liverpool’s Merseyrail, urban overground train networks with prescriptive franchises. Merseyrail in particular has regularly received an outstanding score for passenger satisfaction. Neither LOROL nor Brown believe, alas, that the formula can work on trains outside the M25 or other city boundaries: “Urban routes are different. But for Manchester” – which is set to gain new devolved powers over transport – “our model is worth exploring.”</p> \n<p>New, recently lengthened trains have also driven the Overground transformation, boosting the number of services per hour to a point where, according to Brown, most passengers will turn up without checking the timetable. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2015/mar/05/readers-assignment-railway-stations-around-the-world\">Readers' assignment: railway stations around the world</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>However, passengers on the Anglia-turned-Overground lines will have to wait three years for new trains and the number of services will not increase significantly in the short term. The trains that currently serve the routes were introduced in the early 1980s, and are showing their age. There are daily cancellations and trains run with fewer carriages because of failures with the ageing stock.</p> \n<p>Peter Austin, LOROL’s managing director, admits: “Change won’t happen overnight. But we’re determined to bring it up to the same standard. We’ll apply the same model to those lines: first to last staffing, new uniform, cleaner stations.</p> \n<p>Austin confesses to having had doubts about the Overground’s potential when it started: “When we first went to Shepherd’s Bush we couldn’t believe how big the station was, we thought it was overengineered – but now we’ve just helped TfL open up a second entrance there … the increase in passenger demand has been phenomenal.” </p> \n<p>Similarly, he says, on first visit he was sceptical of the immediate prospects for Imperial Wharf, a new station in west London built in 2009. “It has transformed beyond all recognition and a new [rail] hub has been part of driving that.<br /></p> \n<p>“Would urban regeneration have happened without the railway?

The campaign group also expressed concern that the help to quit provided by the NHS was being reduced.</p> \n<p>The figures – which were gathered from a range of sources and covered different periods – are intended to give a broad picture of health issues related to smoking.</p> \n<p>The report does not give any cause for rising hospital admissions, but reasons are likely to include population changes coupled with improving treatments and survival rates.</p> \n<p>In 2013, 78,200 deaths among people aged 35 or older in England were estimated to be caused by smoking compared with 95,300 in 2003. Smoking accounts for more than 70% of deaths from chronic obstructive lung disease, cancers of the trachea, larynx and lung, and from chronic airway obstruction.</p> \n<p>The report showed that an estimated 454,700 hospital admissions, 4% of the total for the age group, were attributable to smoking in 2013-14, compared with 447,300 (6%) in 2003-4l. Men outnumbered women in both deaths and hospital admissions.</p> \n<p>Fewer than one in five people over 16 smoked in 2013, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2014/oct/07/smoking-falls-lowest-level-uk-recording-started-1940s\">the lowest proportion since recording started in the 1940s</a>. More than a quarter smoked in 2003. Less than a quarter of 11- to 15-year-olds say they have tried smoking, the lowest level since recording of this age group started in 1982.</p> \n<p>Hazel Cheeseman, policy director at Ash, said: “Death and illness from smoking continue to remain unacceptably high despite falling smoking rates. It is worrying that a time when the NHS is facing real funding pressures smokers are getting less help to quit than they were five years ago.</p> \n<p>“Helping people to quit smoking is one of the most cost effective healthcare interventions and helps to save both lives and money.”<br /></p> \n<p>The number of prescriptions for treating smoking dependency dropped from a peak of 2.6m in 2010-11 to 1.8m in 2013-14.</p> \n<p>Cheeseman recognised rising use of e-cigarettes might be a factor, but said people who found quitting smoking most difficult would benefit from properly structured, evidence-based support from the NHS.</p> \n<p> The British Heart Foundation said tobacco products still killed about half the people who used them and doubled a person’s chance of having a heart attack or stroke. </p> \n<p>Mike Hobday, its director of policy, said: “These figures show current strategies to help people quit smoking aren’t going far enough … The government urgently needs a new strategy to help people stop smoking. With tobacco companies continually raising their prices, this needs to include an annual levy on these companies to fund tobacco control and stop smoking services to help support people to quit.”</p> \n<p>Chris Woodhall, senior policy adviser at Cancer Research UK, said: “We want to see a tobacco-free country within the next 20 years – where fewer than five per cent of adults smoke. Falling smoking rates among adults and children show that we’re moving in the right direction, but we must do more to realise this ambitious public health goal.”<br /></p> \n<p>The report came as research suggested that banning smoking in public places in England had <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/may/29/smoking-ban-children-reduce-rate-respiratory-problems\">cut hospital admissions for children by 11,000 a year</a>.<br /></p> \n<p>Smoking in work vehicles is already banned and the prohibition will be extended to private cars carrying children in October.</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432911086276/fc9444e3-12d1-4079-beae-354b80de6093-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andy Rain/EPA","altText":"A customer enters a pub that is enforcing a no smoking on its premises in London.

The additional material recently supplied by the IPCC has not changed the evidential position in relation to possible criminal charges.

The QC instructed by the CPS advised the IPCC on a number of points to be put to the police officers in interview but they invoked their right to silence (the right of every suspect) and did not answer questions, relying on prepared statements.”</p> \n<p>The CPS said that regarding a possible offence of actual bodily harm, there was insufficient evidence that strikes with a police baton, which left only superficial injury, and the handcuffing of Lewis, were unreasonable or unlawful in the circumstances and could not “be considered as amounting to the offence of assault occasioning ABH as defined by law”.</p> \n<p>It reached the same conclusion with regard to unlawful act manslaughter and gross negligence manslaughter.</p> \n<p>“It is important to remember that the law entitles officers to restrain an individual until they achieve control. Having carefully considered the evidence, including the views of a number of experts, we have concluded that there is insufficient evidence to show that the manner in which he was restrained was unlawful or unnecessary given the circumstances in which the officers found themselves. The evidence of the hospital staff does not, on the whole, criticise the methods as excessive and there is considerable evidence as to Lewis’ strength and violence.”</p> \n<p>As for misconduct in a public office, the CPS said: “Whilst it may well be said that Lewis’ restraint might have been handled better, there is insufficient evidence that the actions of the officers meet the high criminal threshold required for this offence.”</p> \n<p>It concluded: “We have advised the IPCC that no further criminal action should be taken in relation to this matter. The issue of whether to bring internal disciplinary proceedings, which do not require the same level of evidence, is a matter for the IPCC.</p> \n<p>“We understand that our decision will be hugely disappointing and frustrating for the family of Lewis who have acted with dignity throughout this process. However, the CPS can only prosecute where there is sufficient evidence of an offence as defined by the law.</p> \n<p>“We also understand that the time taken to reach this decision has only added to the disappointment and frustration. We want to reassure Lewis’ family that we have reached this decision as swiftly as possible since receiving the IPCC’s latest referral which was made in April of this year. We have written to Lewis’ family to explain our decision in detail and to offer a meeting should they want one.”</p> \n<p>Cindy Butts, an IPCC commissioner, said: “Having considered a full file of evidence, the CPS has decided there is insufficient evidence to charge any officer with any criminal offence in relation to Lewis’ tragic death.</p> \n<p>“Following the conclusion of our investigation I provided a report to the Metropolitan police service, detailing our findings as to whether or not any officers involved has a case to answer for either misconduct or gross misconduct and should face disciplinary proceedings. </p> \n<p>“Under police complaints procedure, it is now a matter for the force to respond to me with a decision on what action it proposes to take as a result of those findings.” </p> \n<p>About 10 serving police and one retired officer, all of whom were involved with restraining Lewis immediately before he died, were interviewed under criminal and gross misconduct caution.</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b001a873cbbe007cd668dcfeee4a544cced78cd5/0_127_2992_1795/2992.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1795,"width":2992,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Roger Askew/Rex","altText":"The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there was insufficient evidence","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Roger Askew/Rex"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-29T16:16:14Z","lastModified":"2015-05-29T19:02:48Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Police","Independent Police Complaints Commission","London","Mental health","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/police","webTitle":"Police"},{"id":"politics/ipcc","webTitle":"Independent Police Complaints Commission"},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London"},{"id":"society/mental-health","webTitle":"Mental health"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/29/no-prosecution-for-police-involved-in-death-of-man-in-psychiatric-care","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49bbk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/may/29/no-prosecution-for-police-involved-in-death-of-man-in-psychiatric-care","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/29/no-prosecution-for-police-involved-in-death-of-man-in-psychiatric-care"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b001a873cbbe007cd668dcfeee4a544cced78cd5/0_127_2992_1795/2992.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1795,"width":2992,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction against any officers.

He said: “For people who are born in the UK, with a British passport and who spend most of their time here, the rules should be the same.”</p> \n<p>The Labour party made it a manifesto pledge to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/apr/07/ed-miliband-non-dom-tax-status-labour\">abolish non-dom status</a> after it emerged that UK-born Stuart Gulliver, chief executive of HSBC bank, had <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/feb/22/swiss-account-secret-of-hsbc-chief-stuart-gulliver-revealed\">qualified for this tax treatment</a>.</p> \n<p>Under the arcane rules, an overseas “domicile of origin” can be claimed with reference to where the father was based at the time of an individual’s birth. Lord Rothermere, chairman of newspaper group Daily Mail and General Trust, for example, has been able to qualify as a non-dom thanks to his father spending the later years of his life in France.</p> \n<p>Similarly, Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith and his financier brother Ben Goldsmith were able to take non-dom status on account of the overseas tax status of their late father, investment tycoon Sir James Goldsmith. Zac Goldsmith relinquished the status in 2009.</p> \n<p>More controversial still, wealthy individuals are able to generate an overseas “domicile of choice” if they spend time abroad and sever ties with the UK for a period, declaring a clear intention of making that location their eventual home. In order to persuade HMRC of the sincerity of their plans, some individuals even buy burial plots overseas. <br /></p> \n<p>While it is not known if Gulliver went that far, it emerged in the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/series/hsbc-files\">HSBC tax leaks</a> this year that he had achieved non-dom status. Gulliver had spent many years working for the bank in Hong Kong and in February he confirmed: “I will return to Hong Kong after this posting. I expect to die there.” </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/feb/11/hsbc-files-reveal-how-uks-non-dom-tax-concession-is-being-exploited\">HSBC files reveal how UK's non-dom tax concession is being exploited</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>HMRC say there were approximately 115,100 individuals who claimed to be non-domiciled in 2012-13. Of that number, 67,000 paid tax on all their income and capital gains around the world. The remaining 48,000 elected to be taxed on the so-called “remittance basis”, under which HMRC taxes only the income and gains generated in Britain or remitted to the UK. Non-doms electing to be taxed on the remittance basis are also subject to an annual tax of &pound;30,000 or &pound;50,000.</p> \n<p>The concept of tax domicile can be traced back more than 200 years, but non-dom status was born in 1914, designed by David Lloyd George’s government to exempt from UK taxation “citizens of Empire who live in one of our colonies”.</p> \n<p>Today, non-dom status proves particularly attractive to the world’s super-rich who have spread their wealth internationally – including to low-tax offshore jurisdictions. Because non-doms are technically tax resident in the UK, many are able to use this to declare themselves non-resident in a country where they have declared as their ultimate home. This is a manoeuvre that can unlock huge tax benefits. </p> \n<p>In addition, non-dom status can be combined with offshore trusts to construct complex ownership structures above business investments in the UK, again generating big tax savings. </p> \n<p>The crown dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man have built up a substantial industry administering trusts associated with business empires created by UK-based non-doms. </p> \n<p>A spokesman for HMRC said: “A person’s domicile is determined by general law, not by tax law. Usually, domicile is inherited from a parent, so someone born in the UK may not be domiciled here if the parent from which they inherited their domicile is themselves non-domiciled in the UK.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432922699692/03642e3e-097d-40fe-9e74-40bf34f8a10e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Joe Giddens/PA","altText":"A freedom of information request to HMRC has discovered that about 800 individuals with non-dom tax status were born in Britain and are tax resident in the country.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-29T18:10:33Z","lastModified":"2015-05-29T23:01:12Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":111,"contributors":[{"name":"Simon Bowers","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/simonbowers"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Tax and spending","Tax","Economic policy","UK news","Politics"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/taxandspending","webTitle":"Tax and spending"},{"id":"money/tax","webTitle":"Tax"},{"id":"politics/economy","webTitle":"Economic policy"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Simon Bowers","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/simonbowers"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/29/non-dom-status-claimed-by-800-british-born-taxpayers-living-in-uk","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49bck","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/may/29/non-dom-status-claimed-by-800-british-born-taxpayers-living-in-uk","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/29/non-dom-status-claimed-by-800-british-born-taxpayers-living-in-uk"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432922699692/03642e3e-097d-40fe-9e74-40bf34f8a10e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A freedom of information request to HMRC has discovered that about 800 individuals with non-dom tax status were born in Britain and are tax resident in the country.

Bijan Ebrahimi, 44, was beaten to death and his body burned by Lee James in Brislington, Bristol. James falsely believed his neighbour was a paedophile.</p> \n<p>The four police officers, three constables and one community support officer, were present at Bristol crown court following allegations of misconduct in public office. The charges come as a result of an investigation into Avon and Somerset police by the Independent Police Complaints Commission following Ebrahimi’s murder.</p> \n<p>Police constables Helen Harris, 40, Leanne Winter, 37 and police community support officer Andrew Passmore, 55, all denied the charges. Passmore is alleged to have given different accounts of his dealings with Ebrahimi to police personnel, the Bristol police murder inquiry and the IPCC.</p> \n<p>A fourth officer, Kevin Duffy, 51, did not enter a plea on a charge of misconduct in public office.</p> \n<p>Misconduct in public office can carry sentences of up to life imprisonment, depending on the scope and seriousness of the offences.</p> \n<p>The officers face criminal charges of misconduct in public office after allegedly failing to respond to calls for help from Ebrahimi, giving false information to 999 emergency staff and presenting different accounts of the murder to the police investigation and to the IPCC. Ebrahimi had repeatedly complained to police about abuse from neighbours. The charges against the four officers relate to offences in the days leading up to his murder.</p> \n<p>The IPPC report from December 2014 also found cases of misconduct of 13 other police officers and staff. Future misconduct hearings will be arranged by Avon and Somerset police.</p> \n<p>Lee James was jailed for life for Ebrahimi’s murder on 14 June 2013. Stephen Norley, an accomplice, was imprisoned for four years for assisting an offender. During the attack, James, who believed Ebrahimi had been filming his children, repeatedly stamped on his victim’s head. Norley helped James drag the body from the scene of the crime and burned it with white spirit.</p> \n<p>Ebrahimi suffered multiple blows to the face and head causing his death. Ebrahimi, an Iranian national, suffered from a severe back condition which caused him to register as disabled. He suffered repeated incidents of racial abuse in the time leading up to his death. In the months after his murder, organisations for the disabled spoke out against such incidents of violence which target disabled people.</p> \n<p>The four police officers were granted bail in Bristol crown court by Judge Mark Horton. The trial is expected to start in November.<br /></p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/026c5492046a2a745a1c7419420365b1d24596fb/0_196_2506_1503/2506.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1503,"width":2506,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PA/PA","altText":"Family photo of Bijan Ebrahimi","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PA/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-29T18:09:14Z","lastModified":"2015-05-29T18:34:54Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/29/officers-deny-misconduct-in-case-of-man-killed-for-false-paedophilia-accusation","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49bfb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/may/29/officers-deny-misconduct-in-case-of-man-killed-for-false-paedophilia-accusation","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/may/29/officers-deny-misconduct-in-case-of-man-killed-for-false-paedophilia-accusation"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/026c5492046a2a745a1c7419420365b1d24596fb/0_196_2506_1503/2506.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1503,"width":2506,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Family photo of Bijan Ebrahimi, 44, who was killed by his neighbour after a false accusation of paedophilia.
