in London. The street light on Stewart Road would have looked like any other in 19th century Sheffield, but was actually correctly described as a “sewer gas destructor lamp” designed to burn off the dangerous methane and other gasses which accumulated in Victorian sewers. Now listed Grade II, it is a rare example of the lamps which were located where there was known to be a problem with pockets of gas.</p> \n<p>The oldest site on the list is a Neolithic henge at Northorpe in Yorkshire, completely ploughed out at ground level, but still visible from the air as crop marks in a field. The most recent include a 1965 concrete house in London and a 1975 former bus shelter in Milton Keynes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43957635ac1d5970d88ef2f21d351f122afb307f\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/43957635ac1d5970d88ef2f21d351f122afb307f/0_93_2500_1499/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traces of a neolithic henge in Northorpe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traces of a neolithic henge in Northorpe, East Riding of Yorkshire. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave MacLeod/Historic England/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A more sinister period of 20th century history is preserved in the former RAF force protection wing headquarters at Greenham Common, built in the Cold War era complete with decontamination unit and bomb-proof bunker.

A huge crowd, estimated at 40,000, turned out for the funeral after his body was recovered from the sea, together with his diamond ring, silver cigar case and cheap nickel watch on a gold chain.

It was presented in court and contradicted the foster carer’s own assertion that she had been rudely attacked by the mother and had responded in a mild fashion.</p> \n<p>The woman had no option but to live in the mother-and-baby placement provided by Medway council children’s services if she was to stand any chance of keeping her child. She had already protested to social workers that the foster carer was unsuitable. When nothing changed she began covertly recording the woman’s outbursts to in an attempt to prove the level of abuse she was facing. Judge Mary Lazarus said in her<a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWFC/OJ/2015/B66.html\"> published judgment</a> this month that “having listened to the recording, the mother was calmly and fairly meekly pointing out that the conversation was noisy for the baby”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/social-care-network/2015/may/06/social-work-pressure-children-child-protection-munro\">Children and vulnerable adults suffer when social workers are under pressure</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Commenting on the case, Andrew Pack, a local authority solicitor in the south-east of England and <a href=\"http://suesspiciousminds.com/2015/06/03/tape-recording-paying-off/\">a blogger on legal matters writes</a>, “not only had the foster carer shouted at the mother and racially abused her, but she lied about it in her notes and made up an allegation that it had been the mother who behaved badly towards her.”</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/2015/06/11/social-worker-suspended-dishonest-account-home-visit-suicide-threat/\">Health and Care Professions Council has just suspended a social worker in Derby</a> for lying to colleagues about a woman she falsely alleged had threatened to burn down her house with her children inside. The children were removed after an emergency hearing, with the mother given no opportunity to hear or challenge the evidence. In another case last year, an Essex county council social worker was <a href=\"http://www.hcpc-uk.org/mediaandevents/pressreleases/index.asp?id=796\">struck off for creating a false statutory assessment for a child’s grandmother to provide care, which was later presented in court</a>.</p> \n<p>Distortions, dishonesty and mistrust are leading to an increasing number of parents opting to film or record – either overtly or covertly – their meetings with foster carers or child protection social workers. Annie Johnson, who has extensive experience of care proceedings after suffering a mental breakdown, explains how things can go wrong. “You’ve perhaps asked for help, you’re struggling with a child’s behaviour or with an abusive partner, and then [social workers] come out and start asking you how often you wash your towels, they look in your fridge, and at any point during these interactions you can say something and it’s taken the wrong way, and you only find out later when it’s written in a report.”</p> \n<p>Because of her experience, Johnson (not her real name) will now only agree to see a social worker if another person is present. “That’s for my safety so that someone else can testify as to what did happen,” she says. The various meetings and reviews that parents attend as care proceedings progress should be formally and openly recorded, she believes “because in those interactions, as a parent, you’re in a state of terror.</p> \n<p>“There’s at least 20 other people there including police, social workers, teachers: half of them you know, half you don’t, there’s a lot of legalese and words you’ve never heard before, and lots of very overbearing professionals stating their case.”</p> \n<p>Minutes of meetings are taken but Johnson believes that parents cannot rely on their view being reflected. “What I’ve said in the past has been twisted to help the local authority’s case. You just cannot win,” she says.</p> \n<p>Rebecca Carr-Hopkins, an independent social worker, has some sympathy with this view. “I’ve been to meetings and had the minutes back and thought that bore no relation to the meeting I was in,” she concurs. And Lucy Reed, a barrister who recently co-founded the <a href=\"http://www.transparencyproject.org.uk/\">Transparency Project </a>to increase understanding of the family courts, says that while there can be challenges to the authenticity of a parent’s recordings which can be selectively edited to present a particular version of events, there can clearly also be evidential problems in social workers’ common practice of taking a handwritten note – that is sometimes later destroyed– and then entering a final version into a computer system perhaps a week later. “In truth, neither is a perfect record,” says Reed.</p> \n<p>So how do social workers react when a parent pulls out a smartphone and says that they’re now on candid camera?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This is exactly what a parent feels – awkward, disempowered, that things will be used in evidence against them ...</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Andrew Pack</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“There’s a great deal of suspicion,” says Pack. “A social worker will tend to get straight on the phone to their [council] lawyer saying a parent wants to [record], or a parent has done it, and I don’t want it.”</p> \n<p>Although there is nothing in law to say a parent can’t record their social worker or needs official permission, up until a couple of years ago a council solicitor would write to the parents’ lawyers and say “this is unreasonable, we are not able to go ahead with the assessment on this basis, and we are now regarding you the parents as being uncooperative,” says Pack. With the stakes so high, the parents’ lawyers would usually advise them to stop. But attitudes are changing. In a number of police forces in the UK, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/03/met-police-to-issue-body-cameras-to-majority-of-officers-by-next-year\">bodycams are now worn</a> as a matter of routine following smartphone footage taken of law enforcers assaulting citizens. Pack’s advice to his council social work teams today is phlegmatic: they need to understand that recording daily life is now normal in society, and get on with their job.</p> \n<p>It can be instructive for professionals to consider matters from the point of view of a parent, he suggests. “You don’t know at the start of the relationship whether you have a good social worker or a bad one, and you won’t know until you see the report they write.”</p> \n<p>Social workers have told him that they feel awkward speaking on camera, worry their words might be taken out of context and feel as if being recorded creates an imbalance of power. “One of the things I say in response is that this is exactly what a parent feels – awkward, disempowered, that things will be used in evidence against them, and for exactly those reasons, recording can be an equaliser,” says Pack. “If you’re not going to say anything in those meetings that you will be ashamed of a judge hearing, then you’ve got nothing to worry about.”</p> \n<p>Andrew Webb, former president of the Association of Directors of Children’s Services and the director of children’s services for Stockport council, agrees. “Professionals’ behaviour should be good enough to be filmed at any time,” he says. “We’ve known for a very long time that the best thing we can do to protect people in institutions is to be very, very open.</p> \n<p>“It does feel threatening; that’s the feedback I’ve had [from social workers]. But I think we should deal with the fact that [staff] feel threatened, not refuse to do it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We’ve known for a long time that the best thing we can do to protect people in institutions is to be very, very open</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Andrew Webb</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Webb’s main concern, which relates to covert recording, is less to do with exposing poor practice – “because I’d be very pleased if poor practice was exposed” – and more about parents posting material on hate websites that list social workers by name. “We’ve experienced that in this local authority on a number of occasions. It’s a worry.”</p> \n<p>Recording case conferences, assessments and visits as a matter of course can be viewed as helpful rather than threatening, suggests Carr-Hopkins. She has always recorded her meetings with parents, who tend to like the fact that there is a verifiable record of what was said. “It allows them to feel safer,” she explains – which means the relationship is more trusting from the off.</p> \n<p>There’s an important professional benefit too, she adds. “I know what people have said rather than what I think they’ve said. And you become a better interviewer if you listen to yourself.”</p> \n<p>Courts won’t want to plough through endless hours of fuzzy audio or film footage. But Reed says she has no objection in principle to trying to rely on such recordings if she thinks they provide valuable evidence in a client’s case.</p> \n<p>The problem highlighted by parents’ insistence on recording social workers goes far deeper, however, than simply the issue of whether professionals lie on oath in the family courts, says Reed. “It’s about a parent’s perception of the dynamic when they see social workers come into their lives on the one hand to support them, but who at the same time are busy assessing their parenting abilities and gathering evidence that’s used to apply for a child’s permanent removal into local authority care.</p> \n<p>“And the parents are right – that is what’s happening. So you have inbuilt mistrust of a system, and it comes out as ‘the social worker is lying.’”</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434388369927/Recording-on-mobile-phone-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Recording meetings and visits can address the imbalance of power that parents often feel in care proceedings.

Cameron has narrowly avoided his first defeat of this parliament at the hands of his Eurosceptic rebels after Labour abstained in a vote on the rules governing Whitehall activity during the EU referendum campaign.</p> \n<p>Twenty-seven backbench Conservatives voted against the government’s plans to scrap the traditional period known as “purdah” before the EU referendum – the time during which Whitehall machinery is meant to remain neutral in the runup to an election.</p> \n<p>Had Labour chosen to join the rebellion, Cameron – with his majority of just 12 – would have been defeated.</p> \n<p>Although the government won with 288 votes, the rebellion provided the first public taste of cross-party cooperation between Labour and Tory Eurosceptics – likely to intensify in the runup to the referendum.</p> \n<p>The effort to defeat the government was led by Bill Cash, a veteran Tory Eurosceptic, who joined forced with fellow Tories and Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins to table an amendment that would restore strict purdah rules set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act of 2000. These are designed to prevent the government machinery involving itself in the final 28 days of a referendum campaign.</p> \n<p>His amendment was also backed by 27 Tories, including four of Cameron’s own former cabinet ministers: Liam Fox, Cheryl Gillan, David Jones and Owen Paterson.</p> \n<p>They were joined in the no lobby by SNP members, Ukip’s single MP, a handful of Labour MPs and members of the DUP, taking the total number of rebels to 97.</p> \n<p>The SNP immediately seized on Labour’s refusal to vote against the government, with former first minister Alex Salmond accusing the party’s MPs of “sitting on their hands”.</p> \n<p>“Labour have yet again chosen to abstain on a key vote – they need to find a backbone and become an effective opposition in parliament,” he said.</p> \n<p>“The UK government has already caved on its proposal to have the EU referendum on the same day as the Scottish and other elections – but now because of Labour, we’ve missed the opportunity to defeat the government on purdah restrictions.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/blog/live/2015/jun/16/cameron-faces-tory-revolt-over-purdah-rules-in-eu-referendum-bill-politics-live\">Cameron hit by Commons revolt as 27 Tories defy whip over EU bill - Politics live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The result is likely to be seen as something of a hollow victory for Downing Street, as the government only won with the help of the opposition. </p> \n<p>During the afternoon, Cameron had personally spearheaded a major operation to reduce the number of Tory rebels. </p> \n<p>Downing Street first moved to reach out to Eurosceptics overnight by performing a small <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/15/no-10-will-pledge-no-eu-referendum-spending-if-it-averts-eurosceptic-revolt\">U-turn on the date</a> of the referendum. He said it will not be held on the same date as the Scottish and other devolved bodies in May next year.<br /></p> \n<p>David Lidington, the Europe minister, then wrote to every Tory MP to say the government was prepared to table amendments to the EU referendum bill in the autumn to offer assurances that the campaign would be conducted in a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/16/tory-minister-promises-mps-a-fair-fight-over-eu-referendum\">fair way</a>. Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, even held private meetings in his House of Commons office to win over wavering Tory MPs.</p> \n<p>However, the charm offensive failed to convince leading Eurosceptics such as former defence secretary Liam Fox and senior backbencher Bernard Jenkin. Fox told MPs: “I have not once, in 23 years in the House of Commons voted against my party on a whipped vote. I urge [Lidington] to not put those of us in that position tonight to be forced to take an alternative course.”</p> \n<p>Jenkin told MPs: “Unless we insist that these provisions for purdah remain in the bill then we are acquiescing in the dilution of a very important principle … What we want in the bill is purdah. If the government is not prepared to accept that principle now on the floor of the house then I fear we have to force it to a vote. It is a matter of principle.”</p> \n<p>The government also found itself under fire from pro-Europeans who were alarmed by the way in which ministers want to use the Whitehall machinery in the final days of the campaign. </p> \n<p>Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, was not one of the rebels, but earlier told MPs: “I think it is a reflection of the rather strange and cack-handed way in which from time to time government seems to behave when it comes to approaching legislation.

But his handling of Europe is a fumbling display that may undermine that new authority. His EU referendum bill, billed as the government’s top priority, appears hurriedly drafted. Partly for that reason, Mr&nbsp;Cameron has been making concessions to Conservative anti-Europeans and, lurking behind them, to Ukip and the Eurosceptic press. This is clumsy and dangerous. It is threatening the support for Britain in Europe that used to exist across the spectrum.</p> \n<p>The weakness was again evident today at Westminster, where the bill began its committee stage, and in Luxembourg, where EU interior ministers met to discuss the humanitarian crisis of refugees and migrants crossing to southern Europe from Africa. In both these different contexts, the government stance was to do what the anti-Europeans demanded and to avoid provoking the anti-European press. In both cases, the government put Tory party unity ahead of national and European interests.</p> \n<p>In the Commons <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/16/tory-minister-promises-mps-a-fair-fight-over-eu-referendum\" title=\"\">the government offered two concessions</a>. In some respects, these were innocent enough. Not holding the referendum on 5 May 2016 rules out a vote on the same day as next year’s elections to the Scottish and other devolved institutions. This is a sensible proposal, and there was cross-party support, as well as backing from the Electoral Commission, for avoiding such a clash. But it is a sign of weakness because it is a week since Mr Cameron said the public was capable of taking two decisions on one day. And the anti-Europeans think that holding the vote on a separate day will benefit their cause, not least by reducing turnout in Scotland.</p> \n<p>It is also possible to take a relaxed view of the government’s willingness to reinstate so-called purdah rules on government departments during the runup to the referendum. On the face of it, this also seems sensible and fair. But it means that departments must be super-cautious about what they say on European matters during the campaign, while no such constraint operates elsewhere in the political arena, especially in the press. This will be particularly difficult to sustain if parliament is sitting during the runup to the vote; it could even trigger legal actions to&nbsp;silence the government.</p> \n<p>The consequences are more serious than ministers admit or MPs acknowledge. This explains why the government fought hard today <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/blog/live/2015/jun/16/cameron-faces-tory-revolt-over-purdah-rules-in-eu-referendum-bill-politics-live\" title=\"\">to keep the purdah issue open until the report stage</a>, in spite of the revolt. If ministers can say nothing officially about Europe, the agenda may be set in the anti-European press, not by the official campaigns. Efforts to rebut press lies with official facts will be more difficult too. Purdah is a fair principle. But it does not create the mythical level playing field. It may help the anti-Europeans – which is presumably why they pressed for it.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile in Luxembourg, Britain remained uncooperative towards European commission efforts to organise a quota system to share the migration burden in the Mediterranean. Like Mr Cameron, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/16/uk-set-to-withdraw-hms-bulwark-migrant-rescue-missions-mediterranean\" title=\"\">Theresa May takes a hard line</a>, insisting rescued migrants should be returned to countries of origin, refusing to acknowledge them as asylum seekers and threatening an end to UK&nbsp;involvement in maritime rescue efforts.</p> \n<p>This implacability has several strands. One,&nbsp;however, is the refusal to cooperate with commission efforts to treat the migration crisis as an EU matter. In reality, it is obvious that the migration problem requires EU cooperation. But Mrs May always has more than one eye on politics back home. That is because any EU success in getting the UK to accept a quota would become a sovereignty issue that would infuriate anti-Europeans in parliament and the press, and threaten the government’s EU renegotiation strategy.</p> \n<p>Ministers must grasp the danger. Moves to the right on Europe make it harder for those on the centre-left to stay in line over the EU. Today <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e4a48434-1364-11e5-bd3c-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=uk#axzz3dEPc30EA\" title=\"\">the TUC warned</a> that social and employment rights must not be rolled back to appease Tory sceptics. That is a real concern. Its root cause is the modern Tory party’s refusal to see any point in the EU beyond the single market, which also manifests itself in the indifference towards a Greek crisis which in reality is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/16/angela-merkel-stands-firm-finding-resolution-greece-crisis\" title=\"\">a far more pressing issue</a> than the UK’s endless grievances.
