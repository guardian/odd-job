It followed the arrest of senior officials at a Zurich hotel and the announcement of a separate Swiss investigation into the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.</p> \n<p>The accusations of “rampant, systemic and deep-rooted” corruption have sent shockwaves through the football world, with many questioning whether Fifa can continue in its current form.</p> \n<p>Blatter has not been named as a suspect, but he faces questioning in the Swiss investigation. In a sign of the pressure he is facing, Blatter dodged an appearance at a Fifa medical conference in Zurich on Thursday morning. The European football governing body, Uefa, will meet on Thursday afternoon in the city and may threaten to boycott Fifa.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/live/2015/may/28/fifa-crisis-live-blatter-under-pressure-amid-arrests-and-world-cup-inquiry\">Fifa crisis live: Blatter under pressure amid arrests and World Cup inquiry</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Fifa sponsors, including Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola, are calling for the body to reform its practices. <a href=\"http://visacorporate.tumblr.com/post/120062181438/visas-updated-statement-on-fifa\">Visa issued a statement</a> on Wednesday expressing its “disappointment and concern with Fifa”. It said that unless football’s world governing body rebuilds a corporate culture with “strong ethical practices” at its heart, “we have informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship”.</p> \n<p>Coca-Cola said: “This lengthy controversy has tarnished the mission and ideals of the Fifa World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations.”</p> \n<p>South Korean firm Hyundai Motor Company, the sole Asian Fifa partner for the 2018 World Cup to be held in Russia, said it was extremely concerned. Anheuser-Busch InBev, whose Budweiser brand is a sponsor of the 2018 World Cup, said: “We expect all of our partners to maintain strong ethical standards and operate with transparency.” McDonald’s, meanwhile, said it was monitoring the situation.</p> \n<p>The crisis has also cast doubt over Blatter’s leadership of the body. He is seeking a fifth four-year term as president this week, but leading figures in world football have called for him to reconsider his position. </p> \n<p>The Argentinian footballer Diego Maradona told radio station Radio La Red in Buenos Aires that his complaints about Fifa corruption had been ignored for years. “I was treated like a crazy person,” he said. “Now the FBI has told the truth. There is no soccer. There is no transparency. Enough lying to people and dinner parties to re-elect Blatter.”</p> \n<p>Greg Dyke, chairman of the English Football Association, said that the 79-year-old should quit immediately. “Blatter has put out a statement saying now is the time to start rebuilding the trust in Fifa – there is no way of rebuilding trust in Fifa while Sepp Blatter is still there,” Dyke said.</p> \n<p>“Sepp Blatter has to go. He either has to go through a resignation, or he has to be out-voted or we have to find a third way. I think the time has come where the damage this has done to Fifa is so great that it can’t be rebuilt while Blatter is there so Uefa has got to try to force him out.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"372c6ef1dcc21c0aaffa42f1700833a9a514f716\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/372c6ef1dcc21c0aaffa42f1700833a9a514f716/0_100_2428_1457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diego Maradona has complained about the lack of transparency in Fifa in the wake of the arrests of senior officials.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diego Maradona has complained about the lack of transparency in Fifa in the wake of the arrests of senior officials.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leonardo Munoz/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Blatter was, however, bolstered by the Asian Football Confederation, which said it would back his bid for another term as president.<br /></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.the-afc.com/media-releases/afc-opposes-any-move-to-delay-fifa-elections\">In a statement on its website</a>, the AFC expressed its “disappointment and sadness” at Wednesday’s events but also said it “reiterates its decision taken at the AFC Congress in Sao Paulo in 2014 … to support Fifa president Joseph S Blatter”.</p> \n<p>The European federation, Uefa, had called for Friday’s elections in Zurich to be postponed, but the AFC said it was “opposing any delay”.</p> \n<p>The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said on Thursday it would make sense to delay Friday’s vote in light of the corruption investigation. </p> \n<p>“It’s been several years that there have been accusations of corruption. It would make sense to take a bit of time, see what is true and not and then the authorities can adjudicate, but for now, it’s giving a disastrous image,” Fabius told France Inter radio. <br /></p> \n<p>Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, has made a pointed call for the next president of Fifa to ensure any future World Cup hosts comply with fundamental human rights norms.

That was an apparent reference to Nike Inc, which sponsored the Brazil national team.</p> \n<p>Nike has said it is cooperating with authorities. In a statement, the company said: “Like fans everywhere, we care passionately about the game and are concerned by the very serious allegations.</p> \n<p>“Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery. We have been cooperating, and will continue to cooperate, with the authorities.”</p> \n<p>The indictment said the company agreed to financial terms not in the initial contract, which included paying an additional $40m to an affiliate of the team’s marketing agent with a Swiss bank account and referring to the amount as “marketing fees”.</p> \n<p>World Cup sponsors are in an awkward position, experts said, because they are under pressure from consumers to distance themselves from any corruption, but such sponsorships are lucrative in the long term.</p> \n<p>Rob Prazmark, president of 21 Sports &amp; Entertainment Marketing Group, a global sports and event sales agency, said companies were unlikely to pull their sponsorships altogether: “These sponsors put a lot of money into associating with the World Cup.

Blatter himself has said that the decision to go east wasn’t proper. I am sure the initiative will now be taken to make a new decision.</p> \n<p>“England haven’t had it since 1966 and it’s considered ’the motherland of football’, whatever we might think. They are worthy of the attention.”</p> \n<p>He added: “I’m not surprised at what is happening. Blatter will obviously ensure that he wins the election in his own way. I think it’s unfortunate that the world’s biggest sporting movement has such a leader at the top, I really do.”</p> \n<p>The Russia 2018 organising committee head, Alexey Sorokin, insisted he was not concerned about the criminal investigation into the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups and said there was no point in even discussing the idea of a re-vote for the tournaments – something Fifa has also ruled out.</p> \n<p>He told Sky Sports News: “We have repeatedly stated that we’re not afraid of any investigation. We cooperated with the investigation that was going on for about two years which was headed by Mr (Michael) Garcia. We submitted all the facts, all the papers, we submitted our testimonies – we did everything the process wanted us to do. We don’t know what else we can contribute to that.</p> \n<p>“We repeatedly said the process was transparent and that we’re not concerned with any investigations. It’s just strange there’s a chance to go through the same thing again, where everything was seemingly closed.”</p> \n<p>Asked if he was worried about a re-vote, he added: “No, because we are so deep in the preparation, we’ve done so much. Our government, our country, has done so much already for the preparation of an excellent World Cup, I don’t even want to discuss it with anyone.”</p> \n<p>On Blatter’s future, he said: “We wish the current president all the success in the elections.”</p> \n<p>Blatter will not attend this morning’s Fifa medical conference in Zurich and nor is he expected to attend the meeting of Uefa’s member association heads after that, a Fifa spokesman said.</p> \n<p>Fifa’s chief medical officer, Jiri Dvorak, said Blatter sent his apologies at being unable to attend the medical conference.</p> \n<p>Dvorak told delegates: “President Blatter apologises for not being able to come today because of the turbulence you have probably followed in the media.</p> \n<p>“He said he has to fulfil his duties in the management of the situation which is probably more important than to come to us, so he sends his sincere apologies.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/28/1432799157577/Lennart-Johansson-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The then-Uefa president Lennart Johansson, centre, pictured in 1998 shortly before Sepp Blatter, right, won his first election to become Fifa president.

His demand for and receipt of bribes, the authorities allege, was a key part of a 24-year racketeering and bribery conspiracy, dating from 1991 to 2015, which led to “endemic corruption” of Fifa itself.</p> \n<p>Most extraordinary in a 164-page indictment is an alleged $10m payment transferred by Fifa to Caribbean Football Union (CFU) accounts that Warner controlled, in return for Warner, Chuck Blazer and an unnamed third Fifa exco “conspirator” voting for South Africa to host the 2010 World Cup. The indictment alleges the South African government initially offered to make this payment to the CFU, with a stated purpose to “support the African diaspora”.</p> \n<p>From this $10m, Warner is alleged to have agreed to pay $1m to Blazer – who, according to the US Department of Justice, has pleaded guilty to this and a series of other financial frauds and crimes.</p> \n<p>Ultimately, the South African government is said to have been unable to pay the $10m, so in early 2008, four years after the offer was made, the money is alleged to have been paid by Fifa. Three payments are itemised: for $616,000, then $1.6m, then the balance, $7.784m, wired from a Fifa account in Switzerland to CFU and Concacaf Bank of America accounts controlled by Warner.</p> \n<p>The indictment alleges: “Soon after receiving these wire transfers, the defendant Jack Warner caused a substantial portion of the funds to be diverted for his personal use,” which included laundering the money through intermediaries.</p> \n<p>Warner is accused of agreeing to pay Blazer’s $1m share in instalments “as he had already spent it”. In the event, he paid Blazer $750,000, in three instalments between 2008 and 2011, allegations to which Blazer is said to have pleaded guilty.</p> \n<p>The indictment also charges Warner over the infamous payments of $40,000 packs of cash to Caribbean delegates in 2011 by Mohamed bin Hammam, who was challenging Sepp Blatter for the Fifa presidency. Warner, discovering that one official had called Blazer at Concacaf to tell him about the payments, is alleged to have become angry and said: “There are some people here who think they are more pious than thou. If you’re pious, open a church, friends. Our business is our business.”</p> \n<p>Warner, whose sons Daryll and Daryan have pleaded guilty to separate charges, has insisted he is innocent and has not been questioned in relation to the indictment.</p> \n<h2><strong>The case against Jeffrey Webb</strong></h2> \n<p>Webb, based in the Cayman Islands, became Concacaf president, a Fifa vice-president and exco member in May 2012, after Warner resigned following the scandal over the $40,000 payments.</p> \n<p>Webb has been seen as a clean-up figure and potential successor to Sepp Blatter for the Fifa presidency but the US indictment accuses him of brazen corruption, being paid bribes that went into building a swimming pool at his house. The bribes are alleged to have been paid by the sports marketing company Traffic USA, in return for being awarded TV and marketing rights for the Caribbean countries’ qualifying matches in the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Webb is said to have wanted a $3m bribe in return for ensuring the CFU did that deal with Traffic. The indictment alleges Aaron Davidson, the president of Traffic Sports USA, another of the 14 men charged, knew about the bribe.</p> \n<p>The $3m payment is alleged to have been arranged with another of the defendants, Costas Takkas, a UK citizen and the general secretary of the Cayman Islands Football Association, who is described as a close associate of Webb. Takkas is said to have been paid by instalments into various accounts, including in the Cayman Islands, intended it is alleged, “to conceal the fact the defendant Jeffrey Webb was the beneficiary of the payment”.</p> \n<p>Takkas is accused of wiring some of the money to an account of his in Miami. Then, the indictment alleges: “Takkas subsequently transferred the funds to an account in the name of a swimming pool builder at United Community Bank in Blairsville, Georgia [USA], for the benefit of the defendant Jeffrey Webb, who was having a pool built at his residence.”</p> \n<p>Webb is understood to have been arrested by Swiss authorities in Zurich for extradition to the US, where authorities have stressed defendants are innocent until proven guilty in court.</p> \n<h2><strong>The case against Chuck Blazer</strong></h2> \n<p>Blazer, the Concacaf general secretary for 21 years between 1990 and 2011, is said to have pleaded guilty in 2013 to 10 counts including racketeering conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, income tax evasion from 2005-2010, and failure to file reports of his foreign bank accounts. The Department of Justice said he faces a maximum 20 years’ incarceration in a US prison for the conspiracies, 10 for the failure to declare his foreign bank accounts, and five years for the tax evasion charges.</p> \n<p>Blazer was accused of soliciting a bribe for Warner as long ago as 1992, from the bid committee seeking to have Morocco selected as the host for the 1998 World Cup. Warner is said to have accepted the offer of a bribe in return for voting for Morocco, and Blazer chased it up for him. The payment was ultimately made, the indictment says, but in fact Fifa’s exco voted for France to host the 1998 tournament.</p> \n<p>Blazer is said to have also pleaded guilty to receiving $750,000 from Jack Warner, part of Blazer’s agreed $1m share of the $10m paid to Warner’s accounts by Fifa itself, after Warner agreed to vote for South Africa to host the 2010 World Cup.</p> \n<p>The charge of failing to declare a foreign bank account relates to money Blazer held during 2010 at First Caribbean International Bank, in the Bahamas. He has already forfeited $1.9m when he pleaded guilty, and is due to pay more to the authorities when he is sentenced.</p> \n<h2><strong>The case against Traffic and its owner, Jos&eacute; Hawilla</strong></h2> \n<p>Jos&eacute; Hawilla, who founded and owned the sports marketing company Traffic, based in S&atilde;o Paulo, is said to have pleaded guilty to paying bribes relating to the sponsorship of the Brazil national team by “a major US sportswear company”. The deal, under which the Brazil Football Federation (CBF) would be paid $160m over 10 years, is said to have been agreed in 1996. That was the year that <a href=\"http://www.trafficsports.com/EN/historia\" title=\"\">Traffic brokered the famous sponsorship by Nike of the CBF</a> but Nike is not actually named in the papers.</p> \n<p>The indictment alleges Hawilla was paid a percentage of the $160m, which bought the sportswear company exclusive rights to make Brazil shirts, clothing and other equipment. Hawilla is said to have pleaded guilty to paying a high-ranking, unnamed CBF official half his commission, totalling “in the millions”, by way of bribe and kickback for sealing the deal.</p> \n<p>Nike itself issued a statement in response to the revelations, saying: “Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport, and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery. We have been cooperating, and will continue to cooperate, with the authorities.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/59897f6a3b6c3dec7f71dc363e260cb61d700ba5/0_144_2500_1498/2500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1498,"width":2500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andrea de Silva/REUTERS","altText":"Jack Warner","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andrea de Silva/REUTERS"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-27T21:17:47Z","lastModified":"2015-05-28T08:17:39Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"David Conn","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733736896/DavidConn.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/davidconn"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Fifa","Trinidad and Tobago","Americas","World news","Football politics","Football"],"tags":[{"id":"football/fifa","webTitle":"Fifa"},{"id":"world/trinidad-and-tobago","webTitle":"Trinidad and Tobago"},{"id":"world/americas","webTitle":"Americas"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"football/footballpolitics","webTitle":"Football politics"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"David Conn","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/davidconn"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/27/fifa-executives-charges-jack-warner","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/499ny","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/may/27/fifa-executives-charges-jack-warner","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/fifa-executives-charges-jack-warner"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-456932370","source":"CCN-TV6","durationInSeconds":64,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10410920&format=video/m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/05/27/150527Warner_1_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/5/27/1432760120736/KP_247001_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Warner","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Warner","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Warner"}}},"importance":3,"kicker":{"title":"Bribe upon bribe"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[{"title":"'Old bastards!' / Latin America delights in roundup of old guard","rawTitle":"Latin America delights in roundup of old guard","item":{"type":"article","id":"football/2015/may/28/old-bastards-latin-america-delights-in-fifa-arrests-after-years-of-impunity","title":"'Old bastards!'

Former Paraguayan goalkeeper and captain Jos&eacute; Luis Chilavert accused him of cronyism in one radio interview that has subsequently been republished. The Rep&uacute;blica newspaper pointed out that he could face the harshest punishment among those arrested on Wednesday. As well as corruption charges, the US indictment says he could also be charged with naturalisation fraud, which carries a maximum 10-year penalty and the revoking of his US passport. </p> \n<p>While many commentators in the region cheered at the partial clearing out of the old guard – including Paraguay’s Nicol&aacute;s Leoz and Venezuela’s Rafael Esquivel – others lamented that it had taken foreign crime agencies to deal with a problem that had been well known for decades.</p> \n<p>In a column titled “Fifa Nostra”, the Chilean journalist <a href=\"http://www.theclinic.cl/2015/05/15/guarello-revienta-el-himno-oficial-de-copa-america-interpretado-por-noche-de-brujas/\">Juan Crist&oacute;bal Guarello</a> mockingly observed that those indicted had good reason to feel disgruntled. </p> \n<p>“Interpol has arrested them for doing what they always did without reproach: behaving as a bigwig in the world of professional football. All the allegations that they face [fraud and money laundering] are everyday elements of their activity.
