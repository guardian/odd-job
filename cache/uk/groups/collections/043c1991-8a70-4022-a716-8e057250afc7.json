The disappointment of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/03/heather-watson-serena-williams-wimbledon\" title=\"\">being so close to beating the great Serena Williams</a> will take a while to disappear but the 23-year-old will resolve to dig in, kick on and achieve her goal of being one of the world’s best players.</p> \n<p>The Briton’s run to the third round will take her back into the top 50 and the way she played against the world No1 has convinced her that she can go much higher. A top-25 place is her target by the end of the year and to do that she will need to show the same kind of focus and determination in the smaller events as she did on the biggest stage of all.</p> \n<p>That is not an easy task. Raising your game on Centre Court with the entire crowd lifting you is one thing, but doing it when one man and his dog are in the stands is another altogether.</p> \n<p>Williams’s coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, said she had every reason to hold her head high. “She played an incredible match,” he told the <em>Observer</em>. “I looked at her stats at one set all and 3-0 and she’d made four unforced errors. In two and a half sets against Serena, that’s not too bad. If she played like that against any player she would have a good chance to win against almost everybody because she doesn’t miss, she brings all the balls back. When Serena tried to slow down, she attacked and she did well.”</p> \n<p>Mouratoglou, who has helped Williams to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/serena-williams-french-open-champions-2015-patrick-mouratoglou\" title=\"\">seven grand slam titles in 12 events since they joined forces</a>, issued a word of caution to the chorus who say she can only take confidence from going so close against arguably the greatest player the women’s game has ever seen. “I don’t know how much confidence you get from a loss, whoever it is against,” the Frenchman said. “It’s still a loss. She was so close to winning it, probably one or two points would have made the difference, but she lost.”</p> \n<p>Britain’s Jo Durie, a former world No5 who made the semi-finals of the French and US Opens in 1983 and the Wimbledon quarter-finals a year later, told the <em>Observer</em> it was now that the really hard work would begin if Watson is to get to where she wants to be. “She should take a lot of confidence from it but in her next tournament, I presume in America somewhere, on court six or something with a few people watching, is it going to be the same?” she said. “That’s what you have to take with you and understand that the top players are doing it time and time again, consistently. It’s about moving on again.”</p> \n<p>Watson was beaten in the women’s doubles on Saturday, going down 7-6 (7-2), 3-6, 6-0 with Marina Erakovic of New Zealand to Spain’s Anabel Medina Garrigues and Arantxa Parra Santonja.</p> \n<p>Watson will play four tournaments this summer in the buildup to the US Open, starting in Washington in the first week of August. Good performances should propel her towards her ranking goal and Durie said she cannot let up. “She won’t ever have the weapons [of the bigger hitters] so she has to play her way, which is getting a lot of balls back and then counterattacking. Then she’s got to keep it going, because [the tour] is relentless.</p> \n<p>“If she wants to get [into the] top 20, then it has to be week after week after week. No first-round losses and being out of it, you have to keep that standard going. It’s not easy at all, but what do you want?”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436035311918/Heather-Watson-certainly--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Heather Watson certainly benefited from an intense partisan crowd on Centre Court but how she fares away from the spotlight will dictate her world ranking.

But these days, being a home fan at the championships requires a greater level of nuance.</p> \n<p>It was hard for the Centre Court crowd to know where they stood at 8pm on Saturday. Their hero, who had cruised so easily past Robin Haase in his previous match, was now proceeding equally smoothly against Andreas Seppi. There was no need for panic, or the mad encouragement they usually dish out to the home talent. A calm but earnest approval seemed the right tone to take.</p> \n<p>The hush of serious endeavour hung about the place. And when Murray got a challenge completely wrong in the second set, and the ball was shown on the big screen to be well within the line, they felt they could afford to laugh. He was 6-2 up, after all. For two sets, Centre Court was entirely devoid of the nerve-biting tension that has traditionally accompanied Murray’s Wimbledon appearances.</p> \n<p>A row of men in pink T-shirts spelling out “#MURY!” – the other “R” and “A” were presumably, still stuck in the queue – worked hard to start a Mexican wave, and were rewarded with the sight of the royal box joining in. Seppi took a medical time out. Then Murray lost the third set. In the royal box, Justin Rose looked concerned; Geoffrey Boycott looked as if he’d like to have words with someone. The crowd looked genuinely confused. Had they, like their hero, been guilty of complacency?</p> \n<p>Still, if there’s one thing the Wimbledon faithful thrive on, it’s jeopardy. An hour earlier, it had required James Ward to go a set down before the No1 Court crowd remembered its place and revved itself into the Englishman’s personal pep rally. Although, to be fair, the first set had been extremely dull. Murray has made great fun of his hitting partner’s love of Taylor Swift, and if you were picking one of her tracks to describe the opening of this match, it would have been Blank Space rather than Style.</p> \n<p>“C’mon James, just go for it,” yelled an avuncular voice, and Ward responded by winning the first three games of the second set in a row. The tennis was rarely scintillating – mostly, the pair bullied the ball back and forth from the baseline – but it made the odd unexpected thrill all the more enjoyable. There was a 20-stroke rally in which Ward launched a lob that threatened a passing Airbus; and a 30-stroke one that the crowd celebrated too early when he dispatched a forehand down the line. He took both points – each time, the crowd stood to applaud as if he’d just won the match itself.</p> \n<p>But there were plenty of mishits too, when Ward’s forehand went on the fritz. The crowd was obliged, by dint of its partisan nature, to respond sympathetically to these ugly shots, to “ooh” when they were hit thickly outside the lines, and to “aah” when they dribbled thinly into the net. The murmured sighs that escaped when a Ward return ballooned up in the air, with a rampant Vasek Pospisil primed to dispatch it, was the collective sound of parents watching their child trip over its shoelaces.</p> \n<p>Out on the hill the atmosphere remained relaxed rather than rapt, especially when Pospisil started taking control of the match. No one out there, among the scotch eggs and the cider, was living or dying with every point. It felt as if a Ward win was to be considered a bonus, rather than a desperate necessity. Poor Ward lost the fifth set 8-6. Mr Pospisil, why d’you have to be so mean?</p> \n<p>The hill gathered fresh interest when the screen switched to the Murray match. A few Scots pulled out the tartan caps they had been saving for the occasion. When things started going south, Murray double-faulted and kicked the ball away in anger. A Scottish voice yelled out in approval: “Get a bit sweary, Andy!”</p> \n<p>They knew what he needed. Back on Centre Court, it was as if someone had changed the battery – the place lit up with a new passion. Sudden bursts of noise now accompanied the close of every point and Murray responded with fire, his forehands whipping around the court with renewed speed. He opened his throat wide and roared, and the crowd roared back. He served an ace, and they roared again.</p> \n<p>The space itself seemed to warp and bend at the intensity. “I tried to use that positive energy on the court,” he said after his victory. “I finished the match how hopefully I can go on.” Murray was back to what he knew – and so was the crowd.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/4/1436044830285/Andy-Murray-fan-club-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"What Andy Murray's pink-clad fan club lacked in spelling prowess, they made up for in cheering him over the line.

The three-time champion suggested that the rules needed to be changed to make it more exciting. He’d start by removing line judges and have the players decide when the ball was in or out. An umpire and Hawk-Eye would settle the most contentious disagreements. Then McEnroe would ban on-court microphones so that opponents could yell at each other without fearing a fine.</p> \n<p>“The players need to be able to feel that they can express themselves,” McEnroe reasoned. “I’m sure on the soccer pitch, they’re not saying, ‘Hello, how are you?’ Or on the rugby field. Is it really different in tennis? Should it be treated differently?”</p> \n<p>McEnroe is correct that real characters have become an endangered species in tennis, but the first week at Wimbledon 2015 has been enlivened by some authentically offbeat performers. On the men’s side, the 20-year-old Australian wonderkid Nick Kyrgios is through to the fourth round and enthusiastically justifying his nickname, the Wild Thing. Dustin Brown, a German-Jamaican journeyman, provided some of the most intoxicating moments of the tournament <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/dustin-brown-rafael-nadal-wimbledon\">in beating Rafael Nadal </a>with a mix of old-school serve-and-volley and outrageous invented shots.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d349d48e6e98af8c91cd63eca9675b09934c0553\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436021642570/7d1b9fe8-42d3-4a84-aadf-62134a46c3ec-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nick Kyrgios \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Kyrgios has won John McEnroe’s seal of approval.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tang Shi/Xinhua Press/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the women’s draw, Bethanie Mattek-Sands, the world No 158, upset the seventh seed, Ana Ivanovic. Until now, Mattek-Sands has mostly been known for her novelty sartorial choices, which have included cowboy hats, pink knee socks and chandelier earrings. She also has an extravagant tattoo of lilies running down her right bicep. A yellow dress made from tennis balls that she wore to a pre-Wimbledon party in 2011 led to a description of her that has stuck: “the Lady Gaga of tennis”.</p> \n<p>These are certainly not the usual suspects, and they have lit up a phase of the tournament typically dominated by ceremonial drubbings for lower-ranked players. Of the breakout performers, the one with the greatest potential is Kyrgios, the 26th seed, perhaps the most eccentric player to reach the highest levels of tennis since the 1980s. McEnroe has anointed him as the current player most like himself and Kyrgios, perhaps accepting the mantle, has even taken to competing in a throwback towelling headband.</p> \n<p>At Wimbledon, Kyrgios, an Australian with Greek-Malaysian roots, has done McEnroe proud. In a perfunctory first-round victory, he shouted “dirty scum”, an insult that he insisted was self-admonishment and not directed at officials (the All England Club agreed). In the next round, he took umbrage when a line judge reported him to the umpire for swearing. When the umpire refused to be drawn on the exact nature of their conversation, Kyrgios barked, “Does it feel good to be in the chair up there? Do you feel strong up there?”</p> \n<p>So far, so charmless, but Kyrgios does have his winning moments. He plays explosive, high-wire tennis accompanied by a stream-of-consciousness commentary. In his third-round clash on Friday against Milos Raonic, the No 7 seed, Kyrgios had a prolonged back-and-forth with a stranger in the crowd wearing a Batman T-shirt, which he claimed was key to his victory. He tried impossible trick shots (didn’t work), stood next to a ballboy to receive serve (didn’t work either) and threw his racket down so violently that it bounced up and landed five rows back in the first tier of the stands. But, like McEnroe, every outburst and stunt made him more focused and, in turn, discombobulated the hapless Raonic.</p> \n<p>Asked afterwards if tennis had become too conformist, Kyrgios replied, “I guess so. I’m not the biggest believer in saying nothing out there or being a robot. I feel you should express yourself. You know, it’s a sport.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97ee434a592c8851bd9558aa2376799223943a1b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436021839702/0711142f-9a16-4de2-9d6e-decd1d3f37d3-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Bethanie Mattek-Sands arrives on court at Wimbledon in 2011 in a tasselled jacket covered with tennis balls\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bethanie Mattek-Sands arrives on court at Wimbledon in 2011 in an (all-white) tasselled jacket covered with tennis balls.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Dempsey/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>McEnroe’s also a fan of Brown, the world No 102, describing his win against Nadal as one of the all-time great performances by a lower-ranked player. (He was unable to rediscover the magic on Saturday and lost in four sets to Viktor Troicki.) A 30-year-old with thick cables of dreadlocks down his spine, Brown was born in Germany but played his formative tennis in Jamaica. When he returned to Europe, he travelled round tournaments in a VW campervan – though one with three rooms and a bathroom, he notes defensively – and strung other players’ rackets for pocket money.</p> \n<p>After tactically dismantling Nadal on Thursday, it was suggested to Brown that it must be a relief to talk about his tennis, not just his hair or his unusual backstory. “I am the way I am,” he replied. “Obviously it’s great that people appreciate it. But on the other side, if I would worry too much about what people think, then I wouldn’t have the hair and definitely wouldn’t look the way I look.”</p> \n<p>Brown looked out at the press corps: overwhelmingly white and middle-aged. “It’s difficult when people ask me that about myself because for me it’s normal,” he said. “I could be sitting here and saying, ‘Why are you guys all different?’”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/04/bbc-wimbledon-2day-clare-balding-gatsby-club\">Clare Balding and guests endure a wild week on BBC’s Wimbledon 2day | Emma John</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For Mattek-Sands, a 30-year-old American, the conversation – even at pristine, all-white Wimbledon – has again been dominated by clothing.

That’s a big plus for him.”</p> \n<p>Not only does Kyrgios believe he can go all the way and join Newcombe, Pat Cash and Lleyton Hewitt as only the fourth Australian man in the professional era to lift trophy, the 20-year-old is vowing to deliver in style.</p> \n<p>“I feel you should express yourself. You know, it’s a sport,” Kyrgios said of his flashy, sometimes abrasive, on-court conduct that has polarised fans and challenged officialdom.</p> \n<p>The Canberra ace has an unabashed fan in three-time Wimbledon champion and former tennis superbrat John McEnroe. “This guy is one of the greatest talents in a long time, bursting with personality. Reminds me of 35 years ago,” McEnroe told the BBC after watching Kyrgios’s breathtaking four-set second-round triumph over world No.8 Milos Raonic.</p> \n<p>Newcombe is not as critical of the flamboyant youngster’s behaviour as some other tennis greats. “He’s a free spirit out there and that’s how he performs at his best,” said Newcombe. “I think he was having trouble for a set and a half playing against Milos because Milos gives you nothing.</p> \n<p>“I had the feeling that Nick had to try to create some sort of flow to get into the match and in the end he did exceptionally well.</p> \n<p>“The antics are a very small part of the whole package. If you look at the positive side of it, this kid’s got enormous talent. I think he’s only touching the edges of how good he can be.”</p> \n<p>But the former world No.1 would like to see Kyrgios tone down the language.</p> \n<p>“You can say things on court and you can leave out one or two of the swear words,” Newcombe said. “You don’t need to have the swear words because if everyone went around doing that, it’d be a problem. So there’s a couple of things here and there that he doesn’t need to do and the rest is fine.”</p> \n<p>Kyrgios will be meeting Gasquet for the first time since fighting off a grand slam-record nine match points and recovering from two sets to love down in the second round last year to topple the Frenchman.</p> \n<p>The victory catapulted the Australian to stardom and he backed up to beat Rafael Nadal to make the last eight of a major for the first time.</p> \n<p>After repeating the run at Melbourne Park, Kyrgios has a huge chance to make the quarter-finals once again in his quest to become the youngest men’s winner at the All England Club since Boris Becker in 1986.</p> \n<p>And tennis’s great entertainer plans to do it his way.</p> \n<p>“When I’m in that state of mind, when I feel relaxed and I’m playing around, I think that’s when I play my best tennis,” Kyrgios said. “I’m focusing, but at the same time I’m having fun.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a06abc73ad9c09fdb0ee375137098c53b74b3c8e/0_84_2912_1748/2912.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1748,"width":2912,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ella Ling/BPI/REX Shutterstock/Ella Ling/BPI/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Nick Kyrgios","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ella Ling/BPI/REX Shutterstock/Ella Ling/BPI/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-05T05:43:56Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T05:43:57Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":11,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Wimbledon","Wimbledon 2015","Tennis","Sport","Australia sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/wimbledon-nick-kyrgios-title-threat-warns-former-champion-newcombe","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4acm5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/05/wimbledon-nick-kyrgios-title-threat-warns-former-champion-newcombe","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/05/wimbledon-nick-kyrgios-title-threat-warns-former-champion-newcombe"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a06abc73ad9c09fdb0ee375137098c53b74b3c8e/0_84_2912_1748/2912.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1748,"width":2912,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"If there’s one thing that can never be overlooked in sport, it’s momentum, says John Newcombe.

Jelena Jankovic, meanwhile, had been given a proper runaround in a pair of nail-biting three-setters. She had already played for three-times longer than her opponent. But Jankovic upset the form book – and all logic, really – to defeat the defending champion and No2 seed 3-6, 7-5, 6-4.</p> \n<p>This was a result that nobody saw coming and one that seemed impossible for most of the first two sets. Kvitova, twice a Wimbledon winner, has the most feared serve in the women’s game and, on grass at least, the most punishing ground strokes. Against Jankovic, the No28 seed, who has not been a serious contender in grand slams for almost five years, Kvitova was a set and a break up and looked like she would be back in the locker room within an hour.</p> \n<p>“Petra was playing so well for the first two sets, I just tried to hang in there,” said Jankovic, who smiled and jigged at the end almost as if she had won the tournament. “But this is what sport is about. I’m so happy.”</p> \n<p>Kvitova, for her part, was shell-shocked. “If I knew what happened, I would tell you,” she said, shaking her head. “But really I’m not sure what happened out there.”</p> \n<p>Jankovic could certainly have been forgiven for wondering if her finest days were behind her. The 30-year-old Serb is probably best remembered by British fans for her mixed-doubles partnership with Jamie Murray, which resulted in them winning the Wimbledon title in 2007. Much has changed since then: Jankovic was the world No1 for short spells in 2008 and 2009 but her ranking has been sliding inexorably for a while. She has not had a really strong grand slam result since reaching the semi-final at Roland Garros in 2010. She is coached by her older brother Marko, and many watchers felt that relationship had run its course.</p> \n<p>Kvitova, in contrast, has been serene this week and the 25-year-old was strongly favoured to win her third Wimbledon title. This led to a feeling of inevitability when the match began on Centre Court, the crowd appearing at first to consider it a comedown after King Roger and a warm-up for Andy Murray. The Royal Box had four people in it for most of the first set and there were large expanses of green leather, even in the cheap seats.</p> \n<p>On court, though, the atmosphere was more tense. Kvitova has lost twice to Jankovic in six matches and clearly considers her a dangerous opponent. When she broke the Serb’s serve or held on to a service game of her own, Kvitova let out a primal yelp. She took the first set with a single break and Centre Court wondered as one if there was time for a Pimm’s before Murray.</p> \n<p>But, in a nonsensical second set, it turned out Kvitova was right to be concerned. The Czech broke early and was serving brilliantly. When she strikes the ball as she was in those service games, it is hard to imagine how anyone could unpick it. At the top of the ball toss, her opponent is still none the wiser about where she is going to direct it. Add to that the power and swing she generates, plus the fact that – as with all lefties – she is naturally dominant serving to the “advantage” side of the court, where most game points and break points are contested.</p> \n<p>Against Jankovic, she ruthlessly targeted her forehand wing, knowing that the Serb’s double-fisted backhand is a much more reliable shot. And the plan was working perfectly. But then, with all the likelihood of a meteor shaped like Greg Rusedski’s head smashing into Henman Hill, Jankovic broke. Suddenly, Kvitova was serving to stay in the set. The pressure told and Jankovic broke again to take the match into a decider.</p> \n<p>In the third set – after disappearing for an eight-minute “comfort break” to change her clothes and to try to rationalise how she was playing – Kvitova continued to unravel. Jankovic said afterwards that, from this moment on, she was never in doubt that she would prevail. Kvitova’s first serve went to bits and Jankovic was boosted by the crowd, which she had succeeded in wooing while her opponent was in the bathroom. The set went with serve early on but Kvitova was on the brink.</p> \n<p>And – after perhaps the most idiotic challenge in history from Kvitova in the previous game: essentially, she questioned a line call on a point she had already won – she buckled when she served to stay in the match. The queen was dead, long live the old queen.</p> \n<p>Jankovic now faces Agnieska Radwanska in the next round and she is already wondering if this might be a genuine comeback. “God knows, anything can happen,” she said, beaming deliriously. “Beating her gives me a lot of confidence.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436030769504/Petra-Kvitova-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Defending Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, right, congratulates Jelena Jankovic after the Serb ended her defence of the title with a three-set victory in the third round.

On Saturday, at the grand age of 36, the Croat reminded everyone that he is still around as he beat France’s Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6 to reach the last 16, the oldest man to do it since the almost 37-year-old Niki Pilic in 1976.</p> \n<p>As he did here in 2009, in what was their only previous meeting on the main Tour, the 6ft 10in Karlovic edged out Tsonga in a match that predictably had some mighty serving, with Karlovic outnumbering the No13 seed by 41 aces to 13, taking his tally to 136 in three matches. His reward is a meeting with Andy Murray and, on current form, he might make the No3 seed’s life uncomfortable.</p> \n<p>It was a moment of luck in the fourth-set tie-break that got Karlovic over the line when, with Tsonga standing at set point, the umpire missed what seemed to be a clear double-hit from him on a full-stretch volley. Had he spotted it, the match would have gone to a decider. Instead, Karlovic clinched victory with a forehand into the open court for a winner.</p> \n<p>“I knew it [had happened] but it was one motion,” Karlovic said of his volley. “If it’s one motion, then it’s allowed.” Slow-motion replays suggested it had been two separate motions but Karlovic said it was a trick of the cameras. “That’s because it’s really slowed down,” he said. “I just stretched my arm out and then the ball hit down [low] on my racket. Because it hit there, then the racket went down and it hit again. It was like boom, boom, but it was one motion, so it’s legal. I thought I was extremely lucky, so I liked it.”</p> \n<p>Many players would have been furious at such bad luck but Tsonga, a semi-finalist here in 2011 and 2012, was impressively philosophical. “It’s the job of the umpire to see it,” he said. “If he can’t see it, I can’t do anything. Even if I saw it, I can’t say anything. I just looked at the umpire. He said no. I said OK, next point. It’s not important for me. What I can do? Nothing. Talk about it for one hour, two hours, four hours. It doesn’t change the result. I don’t care, to be honest, because it’s too late.”</p> \n<p>When John Isner and Marin Cilic stepped back on to court tied at 10-10 in the final set in a match held over from Friday evening, memories of 2010 and the 11-hour-five-minute epic between the American and France’s Nicolas Mahut drifted back. But there was to be no repeat, and not even close, as Cilic held serve and Isner then served two double-faults to go out 7-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-7, 12-10.</p> \n<p>It is the fifth time out of five the US Open champion, Cilic, has beaten Isner, and the 6ft 9in American said it was another tough loss to take. “It’s very, very disappointing, because I have lost a lot of matches like that in the last four years or whatever,” he said.</p> \n<p>“It sucks. Nothing to hang my head about in losing to him. It’s just disappointing in the fashion that of how I lost that match.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436036186927/Ivo-Karlovic-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The tallest player on the ATP tour at 6ft 10ins, Ivo Karlovic commiserates with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga after their match at Wimbledon.
