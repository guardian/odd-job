Anderson had his day of days, routinely firing down pinpoint serves of 130mph and sending Djokovic scurrying in the relative few rallies.</p> \n<p>The agony went on for two hours, until Djokovic, two down and staring into the abyss, galvanised himself. Simultaneously Anderson seemed to lose an inkling of energy and a modicum of belief. By the time bad light stopped play at 9pm, Djokovic had secured two quick sets and had his rescue mission on track. But he will have seen enough to have no certainty about what happens when the two men settle the matter on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>A pattern established itself early; Djokovic no match for Anderson’s ferocity; was forced to rely on instinct, agility and clever placement; grace under cannon fire. Anderson could just swing away. He hit more than 30 aces. Everything was going in.</p> \n<p>Anderson started the tie-break the stronger, secured the mini break from the first exchange but Djokovic levelled, leaping improbably to his left to parry a backhand for a winner. With a deft lob that brushed the back of the line Djokovic went 2-1 up. Anderson broke back and the two men swapped blows until 6-6 when a hesitant Djokovic, long in his preparation, double faulted. Anderson launched another Scud to take the tie-break 8-6 and with it, after an hour, the set.</p> \n<p>Anderson began the second in the same belligerent mood with deliveries Djokovic could only flail at. In the fourth game, attrition told and Anderson got the break to go 3-1 up. Djokovic, grimly focused, increased his intensity, diving, stretching, lunging. He pulled it back to make it 3-2, and energised by the chink of light, held his own serve to draw level at 3-3.</p> \n<p>But still the Anderson artillery rained down. Djokovic went 4-1 up in the tie-break but Anderson kept pressuring. Soon it was 5-5. Then 6-6. After two mighty forehands and a deft drop volley it was 8-6, and Anderson two sets to the good.</p> \n<p>The champion – desperate for a boost – got one at the start of the third set with a break of Anderson’s serve to go 3-0 up. Even now Anderson was hitting powerfully but less reliably. With another break for 5-1 the champion took the third set 6-1 in just 24 minutes.</p> \n<p>Galvanised now by the sight of Anderson tiring and perhaps fallible, Djokovic also started the fourth set brightly. It took him three games to break serve. Suddenly Djokovic was imposing his game on the South African, driving him into corners and cutting off any responses at the net. At just after 8pm, in dwindling light, Djokovic whipped an angled forehand across the court, raised his arms. Finally, after three gruelling hours, he gained parity.</p> \n<p>It was the last act of an intriguing As the two men sat down, play was halted. drama. The winner will meet Marin Cilic and it is to Anderson’s credit that Cilic still cannot know who that will be.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436215893254/Novak-Djokovic-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Play was suspended due to bad light with the score between Novak Djokovic and Kevin Anderson poised at two sets all, 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 6-4.

Unfortunately for Ivo Karlovic, if he was hoping to be known for his charity work or his love of kittens, it went out the window as soon as he walked on to Centre Court. He loomed behind Andy Murray like the kind of Bond villain you just know is going to turn up later to try to garotte Roger Moore. Karlovic’s real nickname is Dr Ivo – y’know, like ‘Evil’. Even Barbara Broccoli couldn’t make this stuff up.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/andy-murray-wimbledon-2015-ivo-karlovic\">Andy Murray into Wimbledon 2015 quarter-finals with defeat of Ivo Karlovic</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As if to ram home the point, the ballboy assigned to stand next to him in his chair was one of the smallest, wispiest kids on their roster. One of the organisers clearly had a sense of humour. The editor of the Wimbledon programme might as well have gone the whole hog and annotated the map of Centre Court in a nice calligraphic hand with the legend: Here Be Giants.</p> \n<p>Happily for Murray, literature has provided a lot of useful information about these fantastical creatures and how to deal with them. Karlovic may not have ridden on to court on a mammoth like the ones you find north of the wall in Westeros, but he can certainly wield his racket with the power of a club, something Murray soon discovered.</p> \n<p>And then there are Tolkien’s stone giants, known to hurl rocks at each other for fun. Karlovic was always going to throw down some boulders from the baseline. You didn’t need to be a data analyst to know what kind of threat Karlovic posed: Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, whom the Croat had defeated in the third round, described his serves as cannonballs. The first arrived in the third point of the game, tearing down Murray’s right side and ricocheting off the side of his racket. Afterwards Karlovic blew on his hand.</p> \n<p>It was all a bit John Wayne. When Karlovic’s serves made contact with the back netting, they did so with the sound of gunshot, and a couple had Murray pirouetting on the spot: ‘dance, British man, dance!’ It wasn’t just Murray in danger. Karlovic’s first ace hit the centre line, and, a nanosecond later, the lineswoman monitoring it. The ball bounced off her head, and she smiled gamely in response to the crowd’s loud “oof!” As the game wore on, registering several more near misses with line judges’ craniums, it became clear that whatever danger money they were getting for this gig, it wasn’t enough.</p> \n<p>The match was a far more electrifying affair than either of Murray’s previous encounters. Karlovic, with his long legs, seemed to take only a couple of strides to reach the net, where he could then wait at leisure for Murray’s returns. The first set saw Murray scramble and lunge around like a man attempting the first human-powered flight.</p> \n<p>Of all books it is probably the Bible that offers the best advice on how to dispatch a giant. Maybe Murray had consulted the first book of Samuel to be reminded how they can be killed by a much smaller man with a fearless spirit and a decent slingshot. Murray was in possession of both. He began to tease the tall guy mercilessly. He played cross-court shots with such immaculate timing that Karlovic was forced to watch as they whizzed back past him, using his own pace. Murray lured him into the net, then tormented the big man by dropping the ball around his ankles where he couldn’t reach it. As the ball hopped back and forth, Karlovic looked like Gulliver, irritatedly swatting at Lilliputians.</p> \n<p>But these were as nothing to the lobs that Murray launched above Karlovic’s head again and again with a cheeky swagger. One, which landed in the far back left corner of the court, was so outrageously flirty it got a wolf whistle from the crowd. At the start of the second set, he played three in a row, Karlovic hopping, futilely, to reach them. By the time Murray won the third point, the crowd was laughing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/06/andy-murray-v-ivo-karlovic-wimbledon-2015-live\">Andy Murray v Ivo Karlovic: Wimbledon 2015 – as it happened | Simon Burnton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>You had to start to feel sorry for his opponent, who spent much of the second set looking utterly bamboozled. If there’s one thing giants don’t like it’s people literally getting one over them. When a challenge went against him he had words with the umpire, who didn’t even need to bend in his chair to give him his ear. But Karlovic maintained his humour admirably. When the next line call went against Murray by the same margin, Karlovic raised his arms to the heavens in gratitude.

But what an evisceration. In 86 minutes of surgical brilliance, Roger Federer gutted and numbed Roberto Bautista Agut until he had nothing left but his spirit. That helped the Spaniard save five match points but the jagged edge to the match came swiftly enough as Federer won through 6-2, 6-2, 6-3.</p> \n<p>Forehand, backhand, serve, volley: all were scalpels in Federer’s hands. He won 92% of his first serve points. He hit 38 winners with just 12 unforced errors. And when he came to the net, as he did regularly, he won 30 of 40 points. It could have been 2001 again.</p> \n<p>The win saw Federer through to the quarter-finals here for the 13th time, which puts him only one behind the record of Jimmy Connors. He has still not dropped his serve all tournament. No wonder he was happy afterwards. “I was hoping to get out of the blocks early and I was able to do that,” he said. “My last few matches have been dominated by big servers, but against Roberto I could work on my finesse and power.”</p> \n<p>Next up for Federer is Gilles Simon, the No12 seed, who dispatched Tomas Berdych 6-3, 6-3, 6-2. Federer has won five of his seven matches against the Frenchman but most have been tight. As Federer admitted afterwards Simon is one of the best counter-punchers in the game. “I’m not going to look further than Gilles who has caused me difficulties in the past,” he conceded. “I played him tough in some of the majors – Australia and the French Open – and we played five sets both times there.”</p> \n<p>That match will take place Wednesday afternoon, but the No2 seed will be able to savour this victory. Initially Bautista Agut seemed to be hanging with him, as the pair shared the opening four games of he match. Quickly, though, Federer was able to sprint away.</p> \n<p>Two superb backhand volleys at the net helped him to his first break of serve. A peach of a forehand to his second. The foundations of Bautista Agut’s success at Wimbledon this year had been built on a high first serve percentage. After 19 minutes he had been broken twice and lost the first set.</p> \n<p>The gulf in experience was enormous: Federer was looking for his 45th quarter-final grand slam appearance, Bautista Agut his first. The gap in class appeared just as great.</p> \n<p>The second set started in much the same way as the first: with Federer on the attack. A punchy backhand volley put him 0-30 ahead and while the No20 seed was able to save a first break point, he was soon 2-0 down.</p> \n<p>You could make a case for Bautista Agut having the edge in speed and he was doing the best to cover every blade of the court, but with Federer finding every line and angle it was not doing much good.</p> \n<p>The Spaniard was able to stem the bleeding by holding his service game but shortly afterwards he slid to his right and injured his heel. The physiotherapist was called. Joints manipulated, he was able to carry on but as Federer powered another forehand past him and wrapped up the second set he might have had second thoughts.</p> \n<p>Before the start of the third set the Spaniard’s ankle was taped up with a bandage. But the pain Federer inflicted continued regardless. In one game it took less than a minute for him to hold serve.</p> \n<p>Federer has now – incredibly – not been broken for 105 service games, a run that extends all the way back to his first round match against Philipp Kohlschreiber in Halle. When asked about the startling run, he said to laughter: “The guys are returning terrible,” before admitting: “I don’t know but clearly having the extra week helped me be perfectly prepared for Wimbledon.</p> \n<p>“Then again, Gilles is one of the best return players we have in the game so I would think I’ll be tested a lot in the next round. So that streak is maybe coming to an end.”</p> \n<p>Batista Agut also kept fighting to the end but for all his stubborness and resistance Federer was way too good. Again.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436215001460/Roger-Federer--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Roger Federer won 92% of points on his first serve against Roberto Bautista Agut at Wimbledon.
