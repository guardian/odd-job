That may never change, no matter what he does, but on Saturday Jamie can at least make a bigger name for himself by winning the Wimbledon men’s doubles title with his partner John Peers.</p> \n<p>Jamie is already a Wimbledon champion, having won the mixed doubles with Jelena Jankovic in 2007. He has won 12 career titles, picked up $1.33m in prize money and has enjoyed plenty of success in the Davis Cup. For all his achievements, he would surely admit that if he and Peers can beat Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau, it would be by far the biggest victory of his career.</p> \n<p>“All the doubles players, this is what we’re playing for,” he said. “We want to play in a men’s doubles grand slam final. We’re getting the chance to do that. I think we’re going to try to make the most of it.”</p> \n<p>At times over the years, especially on the occasions when he has played with Andy in various doubles tournaments around the world, Jamie has been something of a spare wheel in press conferences, called in alongside his brother and answering only the odd question, while all the attention is on Andy. It cannot have been easy for someone who was a highly ranked singles player when he was 12 to spend much of his life in the shadow of his younger brother. He has handled it remarkably well but no one would begrudge him a bit of the limelight here.</p> \n<p>“I’ve spent most of my life that way,” he said. “People come and talk to me because they want to talk about Andy, which is fair enough. That’s how it goes. I accept that. But we’re doing a lot of great things ourselves. Things have been good for us the last two or three years since we started playing together. I think all the hard work we’ve put in is kind of paying off.</p> \n<p>“We get to play on Centre Court again in the Wimbledon final. I don’t know about John, maybe he was thinking about the Rod Laver Arena more, but I was thinking about the chance [to win Wimbledon]. It’d be real exciting to be Wimbledon champions.”</p> \n<p>Andy Murray said this week that he tries not to watch Jamie’s matches, even on television, for fear of jinxing his chances, and he will probably stay away from Saturday’s final, keeping an eye on the scores and keeping everything crossed. Jamie will not mind if he is there but he will not ban him if he does want to make an appearance. “The last time he came to watch me play was in the final of a tournament we won,” Jamie said.</p> \n<p>Jamie has a lot to thank Peers for. The Australian, a finance graduate, is a great returner and an all-round solid player, complimenting Murray’s skills at the net. But he also helped pull him out of a real slump. Having tasted success early in his career with the American Eric Butorac, Murray was ranked well outside the top 100 in 2009 and wondering if it was really worth it. When he and Peers hooked up in early 2013, it was his last chance. It’s worked a treat.</p> \n<p>“When me and John started playing together in January or February a few years ago, I think that was probably going to be close to my last kind of effort to really try to get back there,” he said. “The previous two years, I played a lot of Challenger tournaments, some Tour events, but mainly played with loads of different people. It wasn’t much fun for me, I wasn’t really enjoying it. The opportunity came up to try to make something happen with John. Thankfully it’s worked out and we’re here today.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/10/1436535630845/Jamie-Murray-Wimbledon-Me-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jamie Murray gets his chance to come out of brother Andy's shadow in the men's doubles final at Wimbledon Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images","credit":"Julian Finney/Getty Images","altText":"Jamie-Murray-Wimbledon-Men's-Doubles","cleanCaption":"Jamie Murray gets his chance to come out of brother Andy's shadow in the men's doubles final at Wimbledon Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-10T14:07:24Z","lastModified":"2015-07-10T23:03:10Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Simon Cambers","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/simon-cambers"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Jamie Murray","Wimbledon 2015","Andy Murray","Tennis","Wimbledon","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/jamie-murray","webTitle":"Jamie Murray"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/andymurray","webTitle":"Andy Murray"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Simon Cambers","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/simon-cambers"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/10/jamie-murray-andy-murray-wimbledon-mens-doubles-final","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ahcy","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/10/jamie-murray-andy-murray-wimbledon-mens-doubles-final","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/10/jamie-murray-andy-murray-wimbledon-mens-doubles-final"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/10/1436535630845/Jamie-Murray-Wimbledon-Me-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jamie Murray gets his chance to taste some family glory in the men’s doubles final at Wimbledon on Saturday.

Rule two: ignore rule one when he is playing Roger Federer.</p> \n<p>Up on the Hill and in living rooms around the country, things are different. But in the rarefied air of Centre Court it is still the appearance of the Fed Express, serving here like a train, that makes many of the pastel-clad masses go weak at the knees.</p> \n<p>Centre Court at Wimbledon, for all its maddening peculiarities, can usually be relied upon to fuel Murray with the self belief that allows him to play his best tennis. There is but one caveat. When he is playing Federer, all bets are off. Even during that tear-soaked 2012 final defeat, when the roof came over and Federer turned the screw, the vocal support was often fairly evenly matched.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/10/roger-federer-andy-murray-wimbledon-semi-final\">Roger Federer unbreakable against Andy Murray in Wimbledon semi-final | Andy Bull</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is perhaps no coincidence that it was instead at the Olympics here a month later, amid an orgy of flag waving, that Murray swept Federer aside in what the Scot this week called a huge turning point in his career. As Federer, ice cool in his white bandana, lined up to serve to his opponent, sporting a baseball cap, the crowd roared. But it was hard to tell who they were yelling for. Mainly, for once, they seemed excited to be there.</p> \n<p>The story of Murray’s relationship with middle England is well worn and does not need repeating. Suffice to say he won them over on his own terms and his 2013 victory has enshrined his immortality. Whoever they were backing, it was intense. And so very tense. t felt like a final. The woozy, boozy bonhomie and stifling heat of the first week had given way to a brittle, cool breeze and a huge sense of occasion.</p> \n<p>And no point more so than during that impossibly tense, epic 10th game of the second set. This was tennis on the edge, of impossibly high quality with zero margin for error. It went on for 17 heart-stopping minutes, both players went through two rackets and Murray saved five set points before finally prevailing.</p> \n<p>Concertinaed into that 17 minutes was a mini sporting epic all of its own. For the first time, Murray began to work the crowd, engaging them, shaking his fist, exhorting them. It was street fighting scrapping of which Sir Alex Ferguson, looking down from his perch in the Royal Box alongside Thierry Henry, would have heartily approved. The often reserved Centre Court crowd momentarily forgot their reverence for Federer and responded in kind, yelling him on, willing him back into the match.</p> \n<p>Yet when Federer went on to ultimately clinch the set two games later, they made plain their acclaim for him too, touched to be in the presence of his genius. There was a couple of Fed fanatics decked out all in red to the right of the scoreboard but most of those watching were metaphorically wearing both bandana and baseball cap. “It definitely also gave me a lift to see that the crowd was actually evenly split,” said Federer afterwards, speculating that their affection had grown as he had entered the latter stages of his career.</p> \n<p>There was also an all-prevailing sense in which even the entitled denizens of this famous sporting arena knew they were hugely privileged to be here, on this day, watching these two players. Following an incredible rally in the fifth game, where the pair exchanged half volleys on the approach before Federer won the point with the cutest of angled slices, the crowd audibly groaned at the quality of the banquet being spread before them.</p> \n<p>During the first set in particular the quality from both players was startlingly high. So accurately and aggressively was Federer serving that the tension was heightened rather than alleviated as Murray performed a high wire act. Eventually, he fell off and the Swiss was able to take the set 7-5. It felt like a hammer blow but seemed to rally support in Murray’s favour.</p> \n<p>The Scot, who had started so so positively, began to waiver. But as he did so, the volume of the support he received from the crowd grew. Yet he was still on that high wire, occasionally wobbling. And as the match drew to its inevitable conclusion, admiration for Federer trumped disappointment with Murray.</p> \n<p>Much had been made, before the match, of the fact that Federer would be fresher, having spent significantly less time on the court than his younger opponent. And so it proved.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/10/andy-murray-beaten-roger-federer-wimbledon-semi-finals\">Andy Murray beaten by Roger Federer in straight sets in Wimbledon semi-final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Murray was determined to be bold against an opponent who has never lost a Wimbledon semi-final and was looking to reach an incredible 26th grand slam final. Yet the 33-year-old Federer, now the oldest player to reach a final since 1974, looked lean, mean and effortless.</p> \n<p>It seems like a long time ago now that the first of those “end of an era” articles starting predicting his demise. Instead his quest to become the first man to win Wimbledon eight times remains firmly on track.</p> \n<p>At match point the crowd tried to rally Murray one last time to no avail. And as the players exited – Murray scurrying off with head bowed, Federer taking the acclaim of the crowd – the standing ovation was underpinned by a sense of murmuring pleasure at the wonder of Roger.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436553590671/Wimbledon-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Roger Federer takes the acclaim of Centre Court after his 7-5, 7-5, 6-4 win over Andy Murray.

Eight years ago two of the game’s brightest young stars reached their first Wimbledon semi-final and both were shown how far it was to the top of the mountain by players whose spots in the record books were already written in permanent ink. Richard Gasquet was still around on the second Friday after fighting back to beat Andy Roddick 4-6, 4-6, 7-6, 7-6, 8-6 in his quarter-final and he would not be the last man to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2007/jul/07/tennis.wimbledon10\" title=\"\">lose to Roger Federer in straight sets on Centre Court</a>. There was no panic. It was not a disgrace. Gasquet was 21 and most judges assumed that his promise would be rewarded with major titles sooner rather than later.</p> \n<p>As for Novak Djokovic, a year younger than Gasquet but already higher in the rankings, he won the first set of his match against Rafael Nadal, lost the second and retired when he was trailing 4-1 in the third <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/6280354.stm\" title=\"\">with an infected toe blister</a>. There was no question that the young Serbian was gifted but was he really tough enough to challenge the supremacy of Federer and Nadal? No need to answer that one. After Djokovic’s ruthless 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory over Gasquet in two hours and 21 minutes the odds are on the defending champion beating Roger Federer in Sunday’s final and winning Wimbledon for the third time.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/10/novak-djokovic-richard-gasquet-wimbledon-final\">Novak Djokovic overpowers Richard Gasquet to reach Wimbledon final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Djokovic and Gasquet have gone down different paths since that damp squib of an afternoon back in 2007. The former has transformed himself into the ultimate competitor, a tennis cyborg, a fighting machine with elastic limbs, a warrior spirit and all the shots, while the latter’s career is a story of disappointment and unfulfilled potential, of squandered leads and frittered match points and an object lesson in how natural talent on its own is not enough at the highest level.</p> \n<p>If Gasquet is not quite the washed-up high school football hero who sits on his sofa and bitterly rages about his lost youth, his latest defeat by Djokovic was a stinging reminder of why the 29-year-old’s stylish but brittle game has never brought him the grand slam titles that felt like his birthright when he was lauded as the most talented teenager in the game.</p> \n<p>Gasquet was on the front cover of a French tennis magazine when he was nine. Yet when the boy wonder grew up, he found the adult world large and intimidating. He suffered from injuries and illness, while his development was stunted when he was banned after testing positive for cocaine. He served a two-and-a-half-month suspension before he was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2009/dec/17/richard-gasquet-cocaine-cas-ban\" title=\"\">cleared by the court of arbitration for sport</a> at the end of 2009.</p> \n<p>Tennis is as much about the heart and the mind as the softness of a player’s hands and Gasquet has not always been the most courageous of fighters. There have been times when he has had the backbone of a soaking wet lettuce, always liable to fold in the heat of competition. One of Gasquet’s more memorable capitulations was his defeat, from a two-set lead, by Murray in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2008/jun/30/andymurraylive\" title=\"\">fourth round of Wimbledon in 2008</a>.</p> \n<p>Gasquet’s choking tendencies flared up again in his dramatic and unexpected victory over the French Open champion, Stan Wawrinka, in his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/wimbledon-2015-richard-gasquet-stan-wawrinka\" title=\"\">quarter-final on Wednesday</a>. Serving for the match at 5-3 in the fifth set, he was broken. It was peak Gasquet and somehow he kept his nerve, following up his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/03/wimbledon-2015-richard-gasquet-grigor-dimitrov\" title=\"\">impressive wins over Grigor Dimitrov</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/nick-kyrgios-richard-gasquet-wimbledon-2015\" title=\"\">Nick Kyrgios</a> by knocking out the fourth seed.</p> \n<p>Djokovic must have been delighted for Gasquet. The world No1 did not want another dust-up with Wawrinka, his tormentor in the final of the French Open last month; much better to play the Frenchman, who has taken one set off Djokovic in their past 10 matches. Gasquet’s only win over Djokovic was in 2007 and he was beaten 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 when they met in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/01/andy-murray-jeremy-chardy-french-open-2015-live\" title=\"\">fourth round in Roland Garros</a> last month. With numbers that gruesome the world No20 did well to keep the scoreline respectable.</p> \n<p>Thierry Henry was watching his compatriot from the Royal Box and the thought occurred that, if Gasquet had been a footballer, he probably would have been Robert Pir&egrave;s. He is a beautiful player to watch, with that one-handed backhand, that Gallic swish which at times left Djokovic shaking his head during a compelling first set. One gossamer drop shot sent Djokovic tumbling to the floor and his racket flying into the air, like a waiter who had slipped while carrying a tray of dishes in the middle of a packed restaurant.</p> \n<p>Gasquet had chances after recovering from losing his first service game, none better than when he had an easy smash for a 0-30 lead in the ninth game of the first set. He dumped it wide. Djokovic held and dominated the tie-break.</p> \n<p>From that point onwards the result was inevitable as Gasquet’s head dropped just enough for Djokovic, who twice had treatment on his left shoulder, to run away with the match.</p> \n<p>Although Gasquet hung in there and maintained his dignity, the world’s best player was impenetrable and brilliant. Djokovic has come a long way in the past eight years.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/10/1436546665976/Richard-Gasquet-Wimbledon-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Richard Gasquet reacts in frustration during his semi-final defeat against Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon.

It is improbable any of her contemporaries will seriously challenge her reign.</p> \n<p>If Williams can destroy Sharapova – perhaps the toughest competitor in the game, men’s or women’s – she may not waste a lot of the fans’ time dismissing a player ranked 20th in the world who, before this tournament, had a single win at Wimbledon in three visits, over Anne Keothavong in 2013. If Muguruza is to become the first Spanish champion here since Conchita Mart&iacute;nez in 1994, she will have to play the match of her life against an opponent who has won the title five times.</p> \n<p>Muguruza does have some cause for optimism, having <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/may/28/serena-williams-garbine-muguruza-french-open\" title=\"\">beaten Williams handily in the second round at Roland Garros</a> last year, 6-2, 6-2. And she took a set off her the last time they met, in the fourth round of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jan/26/australian-open-day-eight-women-report\" title=\"\">Australian Open this year</a>. Williams won their only other encounter, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jan/17/serena-williams-australian-open-azarenka\" title=\"\">6-2, 6-0, also in Melbourne, in 2013</a>.</p> \n<p>Muguruza ought not be seduced by Williams’ cautious summary of the match the previous evening. Williams, reaching for her 21st slam title in her 25th final, is a raging favourite, yet talked down suggestions that this would be a formality. She has done this all summer and all tournament, clucking and chuckling to avoid even the mention of a “Serena Slam” here, as concurrent holder of all the majors, or a calendar grand slam by successfully defending her US Open title in September.</p> \n<p>As Williams would like us to see it: “It’s definitely not an easy match-up. She actually has a win against me. We had a tough match the last time we played, and she’s given me problems in the past. So this time I have to just go in, have fun and do the best that I can, just try to stay positive and stay focused. I don’t think she’s intimidated at all. She’s not that kind of person. She’ll be fine.”</p> \n<p>Pressed on why she should ask people to believe such a downbeat assessment, Williams said she wanted to take pressure off herself, repeating: “I want to have fun.”</p> \n<p>She added: “I’ve won so many grand slam titles. I could lose tomorrow. Sure, I won’t be happy but I don’t need another Wimbledon title. I don’t need another US Open. I don’t need any titles to make it. Every time I step out on court, the practice court, the match court, I do look at it as a more fun time because it’s not as stressful as it was. Getting to 18 [majors] was super stressful for me. It was fun, but I was so stressed out. After that, I’ve just been really enjoying myself.”</p> \n<p>Up to a point. Watson gave her fits over three sets, as did <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/serena-williams-victoria-azarenka-wimbledon-2015?CMP=share_btn_tw\" title=\"\">Victoria Azarenka</a>. It is as if Williams sometimes needs that shock to find her best tennis.</p> \n<p>Muguruza will do her best to provide that intensity. If she does, it could be an entertaining final. If not, it is likely to be as one-sided and predictable as was Williams’ win over Sharapova. That would be a shame.</p> \n<p>Williams is two wins from moving alongside Steffi Graf on 22 majors; after that – and we are allowed to say it, even if she does not want us to – there is the grand slam for 2015. As ever, there is only one player who can stop her – and her name is not Muguruza.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/10/1436540530199/Serena-Williams-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Serena Williams reached the Wimbledon final with a straight sets victory over Maria Sharapova.

And then she suffered some more.</p> \n<p>As feisty afterwards as she had been in enduring another public hammering against a rival with whom she shares mutual respect but little warmth, she rejected suggestions – daft ones during an uncomfortable press conference – that she either change her baseline strategy or even look for a new coach.</p> \n<p>“I’m not going to come out and become a serve-and-volleyer or a chip-and-charge type of player. No, you’re not going to see that from me,” the Russian said after Williams had beaten her 6-2, 6-4, with only the hint of parity near the end.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/09/garbine-muguruza-beats-agnieszka-radwanska-wimbledon-2015-final\">Garbi&ntilde;e Muguruza beats Agnieszka Radwanska to reach Wimbledon 2015 final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>She seethed when asked to respond to David Cameron’s remarks that women players should wear earplugs to block out the screeching that plagues the women’s game, with Sharapova among the chief culprits. “Next question, please,” she said through pursed lips. She would probably give Cameron a run for his money at prime minister’s questions.</p> \n<p>There was further awkwardness when Sharapova was reminded that Williams’s coach, Patrick Mouratoglou – whom she pointed out here two years ago had left his family for Serena – said Victoria Azarenka was a better player than her. “I don’t think you’re ever going to hear nice words from him about me,” she said. “I don’t expect that, and I’m sure you don’t either.” If the match had been tough, this was an ordeal she probably could have done without. “Maybe if I was British, a semi-final would be incredible,” she said to weak laughter. “I’d be on the front page of the paper.” It did not get any more cordial than that.</p> \n<p>Williams, meanwhile, is in fine spirits. With her long-time friend, the musician Drake, again sitting among the journalists and smiling from start to finish, she looked relaxed and sharp, ready to introduce the young Spaniard Garbi&ntilde;e Muguruza to the realities of elite competition at the highest level in Saturday’s’s final.</p> \n<p>She said of the Canadian rapper’s presence: “It’s all about luck. You got to keep your luck around. We’ve been friends for like so many years, just like family. Kind of like we’re on a streak right now. We got to do this.”</p> \n<p>But it is harder than she makes it sound, and she does not lack for motivation – especially against Sharapova, who beat her to win the title when a teenager <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2004/jul/04/wimbledon2004.wimbledon4\">in 2004</a> and has won only five sets in 18 matches against her since. Williams gives the impression she would happily play her morning, noon and night.</p> \n<p>Every time Williams looks across the net and sees Sharapova staring back she surely thinks to herself: “You’re the queen off the court. This is my place – and it always will be.” The American didn’t face a single break point.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ea8f4c0b2f0aeb5ef90d64d5dd1f6ca717e591c3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436472196483/88e8a5b3-1272-46a8-947c-ac98d242ff73-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Maria Sharapova\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A despondent Maria Sharapova.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Pain/Rex Shutterstock/Mark Pain/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is the rivalry that isn’t. It’s a serial nightmare for the Russian, an opportunity for Williams to show who is, by a distance, the finest player in women’s tennis since Steffi Graf and in all likelihood, crowned the very best of them all before she retires. She should also be the owner of 21 slam titles by late Saturday afternoon – one behind the German – if, as universally expected, she dismantles the No20 seed, Muguruza, to win her sixth Wimbledon final, having lifted the trophy in 2002, 2003, 2009, 2010 and 2012.</p> \n<p>Sharapova, the highest-earning female athlete in the world, loses to Williams whether she plays well or not, and she was rarely more than a bystander as the world No1 took her apart in front of a lightly baked audience as embarrassed as they were unsurprised.</p> \n<p>Williams has won $6,175,648 in prize money this year, nearly three times as much as Sharapova. Over her career, she has won $69,676,428 – nearly twice as much as Sharapova. Yet each time they meet it is an event. There is not a weirder duality in sport.</p> \n<p>In every facet of the game, the American was dominant. As Sharapova struggled to even get her ball-toss right, Williams banged down ace after ace, 13 to go with 68 already collected in getting this far, and 29 winners to nine.</p> \n<p>Sharapova led on serve in the second set but it was an illusion. Once Williams found her rhythm, the hammering resumed. Facing break point in the fifth game, she double-faulted – her 43rd of the tournament – and the match was all but done. The hum that rattled around the stadium was one of barely contained pity.</p> \n<p>She gained brief hope with a couple of points on the Williams serve, but, as loud as she shrieked, as fiercely as her eyes blazed, she could not sustain the charge. She tried, nonetheless, as she always does – all the way to the grim end.</p> \n<p>Serving to stay in the championships, she battled to deuce, double-faulted, saved match point and held through two deuce points. A lot of players would dissolve in such circumstances. A lot of players aren’t Maria Sharapova.</p> \n<p>But she could only swish in vain as Williams’s concluding ace flew past her like a bullet. And there were precious few missiles that had gone the other way.

Once Williams consolidated with a pair of heat-seeking 118mph aces, the greatest front-runner in sports had all the edge she needed.</p> \n<p>The world’s two highest-profile sportswomen may compete for the same endorsements, column inches and trophies, but Williams’s straightforward victory to book a place in the final – where she will face the Spanish ing&eacute;nue Garbi&ntilde;e Muguruza – proved once again this is no more a rivalry than hammer v nail.</p> \n<p>“It’s never easy to beat such a great player who’s had such a wonderful career,” Williams said following a 6-4, 6-2 victory in which she crunched 29 winners and 13 aces. “Whenever you play someone that has beaten you before, you get really focused.”</p> \n<p>No one can accuse the world No1 of having a short memory. Williams has now won 17 straight matches against Sharapova extending back 11 years, an astonishing run that includes six meetings at grand slams and three in major finals. In 13 outings since they met here five years ago, Sharapova has taken just one set.</p> \n<p>The 33-year-old from Compton, California flummoxed Sharapova with her rangy court coverage and ability to uncork flat, sharply angled groundstrokes with depth and pace. What few moments of danger Williams encountered, she escaped with efficiency and aplomb. Sharapova faced break points in six of her nine service games while Williams did not face a break point.</p> \n<p>What’s happened with Williams v Sharapova can no longer be explained away as an anomaly. The five-times Wimbledon champion has mastered an oppressive, pugilistic style that Sharapova has neither the nerve nor tactical versatility to match.</p> \n<p>“I always expect her to play the best tennis against myself,” a despondent Sharapova said. “You have to be able not to just produce your best tennis, but more. Obviously it hasn’t happened for me.”</p> \n<p>Now she is one win from holding all four grand slam titles simultaneously, an achievement so rare she became its namesake – the “Serena Slam” – when she first did it in 2003. And with losses in only four major finals out of 24 played, she is no doubt the overwhelming favourite.</p> \n<p>One mark of Williams’ excellence is how she has always heightened her game against the best of her era. Consider her head-to-head record against the other players who have spent time at No1 over the past decade: Victoria Azarenka (16 wins, 3 defeats), Caroline Wozniacki (10-1), Jelena Jankovic (10-4), Kim Clijsters (7-2), Dinara Safina (6-1), Ana Ivanovic (8-1), Am&eacute;lie Mauresmo (10-2), Lindsay Davenport (10-4).</p> \n<p>Only Justine Henin (8-6) kept it close among her top rivals, though Williams inflicted some famous beatings when they met. But no one has felt the back end of her wrath more consistently than Sharapova. “It’s strange because a lot of the people I grew up with are now on the legends tour,” Williams said with a laugh. “Me and Venus just laugh. We’re just enjoying our time. We’re so fortunate to still be playing. We feel just really overjoyed.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/9/1436475832077/serena-williams-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Serena Williams shakes hands at the net with Maria Sharapova after defeatingthe No2 seed 6-2, 6-4 in their semi-final.

In an era when Rafael Nadal has led a “golden generation” in the men’s game, Garbi&ntilde;e Muguruza became the first Spanish woman to reach a grand-slam final for 15 years when she beat Poland’s Agnieszka Radwanska in a three-set battle that swung one way, then the other and, finally, back again. Her 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 victory set up a final against the world No1 Serena Williams, a daunting prospect for most, but one the 21-year-old said she cannot wait for.</p> \n<p>“I think it is the best final you can play,” said Muguruza, who is the first Spanish woman to make a final here since Arantxa S&aacute;nchez Vicario in 1996. “To have Serena in the Wimbledon final I think is the hardest match you can have [but] if you want to win a grand slam, when you dream, you say: ‘I want Serena in the final.’ She’s one of the best players in all these years. It’s obviously the best challenge to have.”</p> \n<p>The fact that Muguruza has beaten Williams before, at the French Open last year, will obviously help her cause. But Thursday was all about holding her nerve in her biggest match yet, even when the 2012 runner-up from Poland fought back in the second set and threatened to run away with it at the start of the decider.</p> \n<p>Overpowered in the first set, Radwanska trailed 3-1 in the second but levelled the match and then broke for 1-0 in the third with a run of six successive games. But Muguruza regained her poise and held on to reach Saturday’s final. The match ended in dramatic fashion when at deuce in the last game, Radwanska, seemingly responding to a suggestion from her team box, challenged a call on her baseline. The Hawk-Eye replay showed it was in, giving Muguruza match point instead of a break point to Radwanska, who glared at her box when the replay was shown.</p> \n<p>Muguruza then sent down a big serve and put away a drive volley to win the match. Radwanska evaded questions about where the call came from and said it had been her decision to challenge. “It was a 50/50 call on that ball,” she said,” later stressing on Twitter that it had not been a deciding factor in the outcome. “I decided to challenge. Wasn’t really a good decision. I did it because I’m the one to decide if I challenge or not. Nobody can do that for me. I tried everything I could today, but she was better than me.”</p> \n<p>The only sign of nerves from Muguruza came midway though the second set when she suddenly remembered where she was. “I think I was 6–2, 3–1,” she said. “I was like: ‘What?’ I was playing really good. I was thinking: ‘OK, you’re the only one that can lose this match.’ I just got really nervous. And I think Radwanska was waiting for this moment.</p> \n<p>“She was [thinking]: ‘OK, she’s playing good. I’m going to wait to see if she can handle this situation.’ She did good. She fought, she won the second set. But I was: ‘OK, be calm. You’re playing against Agnieszka.’ It [was always] going to be a tough match. In the third, I could find a way, as in the first set, to play more aggressive, lose the fear to win the match.” Having lost in the second round on her debut here two years ago and in the first last year, Muguruza arrived with low expectations, especially as she also lost early in her two warm-up events. But wins over Angelique Kerber and Caroline Wozniacki showed she was on song and she displayed huge poise to see off the vastly more experienced Radwanska.</p> \n<p>“I don’t have words to explain it,” Muguruza said. “I am just happy, I worked all my life to achieve this moment. No words. I was very nervous in the second set so I just tried to fight. It’s a dream, I am in the final of Wimbledon but I really want to win it.”</p> \n<p>Victory in the final would catapult the Venezuela-born Muguruza to stardom in Spain, especially in her home base of Barcelona. The only Spaniard to win the women’s title here was Conchita Mart&iacute;nez, whose victim in the 1994 final was Martina Navratilova and who has been working with Radwanska this year.</p> \n<p>Mart&iacute;nez, who has just taken over as Spain’s Davis Cup captain alongside her Fed Cup duties, has been in touch with Muguruza throughout the fortnight, offering advice via text message. It is clearly working. “We were laughing when the tournament started,” she said. “I was like: ‘Conchita, I’m not sure about grass.’ She said: ‘Come on, you can play good.’ She’s telling me every day, every match: ‘Keep going, you’re doing great.’ Giving me power.”</p> \n<p>Muguruza said Spain’s women still have a way to go to match the feat of their men. “It’s tough,” she said. “The men’s in Spain is amazing right now, so many players. We say it’s like the golden years of the Spanish tennis. I think I’m doing good. I think I have a chance [to lead Spanish tennis in future]. There’s also Carla [Su&aacute;rez Navarro] from Spain. She’s top-10. Maybe we can make it a competition with the men.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436452559324/Garbi-e-Muguruza-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Garbiñe Muguruza of Spain celebrates reaching the final of Wimbledon 2015 after beating Agnieszka Radwanska on Centre Court.
