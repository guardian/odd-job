No doubt, home sentiment has coloured early investment but those markets are probably not far wrong.</p> \n<p>On their respective showings on Wednesday, Federer might be the fresher and more relaxed, coming off a relatively untroubled win over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/roger-federer-victory-wimbledon-semi-finals-gilles-simon\" title=\"\">Gilles Simon</a> that detained him an hour and 35 minutes, to add to the six hours 16 minutes it took him to get through his first four matches without dropping a set.</p> \n<p>Murray, looked more stressed beating the versatile and dangerous young Canadian Vasek Pospisil 6-4, 7-5, 6-4 in two hours 12 minutes, to go with the eight hours and 50 minutes of his journey to the quarters. But neither of them has been seriously in danger at any time over the first nine days.</p> \n<p>Murray, in his 150th victory in a grand slam match, moved into the semi-finals for the sixth time in 10 visits – excellence of the highest order – but he will come away from his victory (which was interrupted twice for rain and finished under the roof even though there was not a drop of rain to be seen for miles) eager to restore his energy levels over the concluding stages of his favourite tournament.</p> \n<p>The soreness in Murray’s right shoulder that struck during his edgy win over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/andy-murray-andreas-seppi-victory-wimbledon\" title=\"\">Andreas Seppi</a> last week and flared when he beat <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/andy-murray-wimbledon-2015-ivo-karlovic\" title=\"\">Ivo Karlovic on Monday</a> might have been the root cause of some under-powered hitting from hand and off the ground, although there is no cause yet for major concern.</p> \n<p>If Murray was striving for full force, Pospisil had his own physical burden, coming into his first grand slam quarter-final after three five-setters, including a tough win over the Londoner James Ward, not to mention his three hours and 39 minutes doubles defeat with Jack Sock against Andy’s brother, Jamie, and the Australian John Peers.</p> \n<p>If Pospisil did not come to Centre Court a sitting Canadian duck, he was certainly a tired moose.</p> \n<p>Just before the ground staff scurried on to court at 1.25pm to draw the covers over the turf after 13 minutes’ tennis, Murray (whose mood is always in sync with the elements) double-faulted in probably the most bizarre fashion of his interesting career, landing the ball in the middle of the wrong box. Nevertheless, he hit a 114mph boomer down the middle to hold for 3-1, regrouped and took the set.</p> \n<p>When they resumed at 2.03pm, the skies had brightened, as had Pospisil’s spirits. He played his best tennis in this period before the second break for rain.</p> \n<p>At 2.57pm, the umbrellas went up and the ground staff again rushed to the covers. They returned under the roof, windless and away from the now warm and pleasant sunshine bathing the rest of Wimbledon.</p> \n<p>The club’s thinking was that more rain was forecast, so this was the time to go inside. Unfortunately for them, it did not rain for the rest of the match.</p> \n<p>Pospisil struggled to hold his level under a fresh burst of pressure in longer rallies – and he was warned for slow serving as he gathered his composure in the 10th game of the second set.</p> \n<p>Murray won a deft net battle for break point, taking his chance with an astonishingly difficult backhand crosscourt winner that left the Canadian sprawled on the grass.</p> \n<p>“The first set, he played a great game to break,” Pospisil said. “Also, maybe my energy was a little bit low – first time in the quarter-finals of a grand slam. After the first rain delay, that first set and a half, I was pretty comfortable. I felt like I was dictating play. But I missed a couple balls when I shouldn’t have.”</p> \n<p>He also did well to keep his composure during two time violations that arrived at the worst moment for him. Afterwards he vented his frustration. “A lot of times these umpires, they seem to just want to be seen. I don’t know why they do it at a time like that. How many times do you see the top guys go more than [30 seconds] and they don’t get any violation, especially when it’s important moments? But I go out there and I get a time violation. I was right about to serve the ball. If he would have waited one second longer, I would have served.</p> \n<p>“I don’t agree with that time when he did it. Maybe the second one, yes, but not at five-all, 30-all. That was ridiculous, in my opinion. But I don’t think it affected me mentally very much.”</p> \n<p>The argument was resolved in the proper way in the third set, with Pospisil, his legs slowing, still fighting hard and Murray chipping away at his resolve. The Canadian saved three break points in the first three games, hung in for 2-2 and also 4-4.</p> \n<p>In the ninth game he was penalised on his serve for a second perceived delay on delivery, a decision that the partisan home crowd did not greet warmly. Murray got a fifth break point, Pospisil returned between his legs and was applauded but Murray broke with a clinical backhand and served for the match.</p> \n<p>Pospisil left it until the death but finally got a break point then saved match point, before Murray served through deuce twice to finish the job with a final whipped forehand.</p> \n<p>It was the sort of hard-earned win that will either harden Murray up for what will be an altogether different examination of his endurance and skills on Friday or eat into his self-belief. The former would seem more likely.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/8/1436370856795/andy-murray-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray gives his all during victory over Vasek Pospisil.

Novak Djokovic advanced effortlessly to his sixth consecutive Wimbledon semi-final with a straightforward victory over the US Open champion, Marin Cilic. Following the exertions of his fourth-round, five-set victory over Kevin Anderson with its attendant tantrums and tribulations, this was as effortless a quarter-final victory as the reigning champion could have wished for as he prevailed 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/novak-djokovic-sorry-ball-girl-wimbledon-2015-tennis\">Novak Djokovic promises to apologise to Wimbledon ball girl after outburst</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Serb, coming to Wimbledon off the back of his French Open disappointment, called it “a very solid performance”. And so it was in a match in which he refused to offer his cowed opponent even the slightest chance of an upset. “I managed to make three decisive breaks in each set,” said Djokovic. “I have been playing really good. I hope I have that extra gear and it can come out in the semi-finals and the final stages of the tournament.”</p> \n<p>Such was the straightforward nature of this victory, afterwards he faced more questions over the ballgirl he had yelled in the direction of during his fourth-round win. “I have talked with the girl and she said she didn’t mind. We cleared it up. I apologised. I didn’t direct anything to her. It was in the moment of the battle,” he said. “I am sorry she was there in that moment but the media made a much bigger deal out of it.”</p> \n<p>Djokovic initially looked a little tired following his exertions against Anderson in the previous round, when he secured a tense victory over five sets and two days but made unusual errors – a backhand sent very long here, a mishit there.</p> \n<p>But Djokovic is formidable and in contrast to the unusual sight of him at times being all at sea against Anderson, this was a performance of masterful control, in which he won by almost imperceptibly turning the screw at the right time.</p> \n<p>When it mattered he made it count, consistently forcing Cilic on to the back foot and waiting for him to make an error. As the Croat – who did not earn a single break point – said afterwards, it was the “small things” that mattered.</p> \n<p>The unusually edgy Djokovic of the fourth round was banished in favour of the focused model of consistency with eight grand slam titles to his name, commanding proceedings from the baseline. Each time Cilic let the door open an inch, Djokovic barged right through.</p> \n<p>Cilic had not beaten Djokovic in 12 previous attempts. Only once in those dozen matches had he taken the world No1 to five sets – but the fact that match was here at Wimbledon in the same stage last year gave the Croat a scintilla of hope.</p> \n<p>Neither player’s path to this stage had been entirely seamless, certainly not compared with the smooth progress made by Roger Federer and Andy Murray.</p> \n<p>Where Djokovic had to battle back from two sets down over two days against Anderson, Cilic had to overcome John Isner in five in the fourth round and was also taken the distance by Ricardas Berankis in the third.</p> \n<p>Djokovic tested Cilic’s resolve as early as the third game, converting a volley to break the Croat’s serve. At the start of the first set the rangy Cilic had pursued the tactic of trying to approach the net wherever possible but soon appeared to abandon the idea.</p> \n<p>On Djokovic’s third set point the pair exchanged sumptuous half-volleys and Cilic saved again with an exquisite cross-court dink. But the Serb was not to be denied and converted his fourth to seal the first set.</p> \n<p>It was a similar story in the second set, Cilic trying manfully to work his way back into the match but crumbling in the ninth game to hand Djokovic the crucial break of serve. And again in the seventh game of the third set Cilic sent a forehand woefully long to hand Djokovic the initiative again as the Croat’s coach, Goran Ivanisevic, ruefully shook his head.</p> \n<p>Victory for Djokovic brought up the usual barrage of statistics. But one stands out – this will be his 25th grand slam semi- final. “I try not to take it for granted. You need to earn it, you need to work your way through,” he said.</p> \n<p>Following the stop-start nature of Murray’s victory over Vasek Pospisil in the preceding match due to rain showers, which eventually saw the roof closed, the decision was taken to roll it back. As it was, the grey clouds overhead failed to bring forth the threatened showers.</p> \n<p>And so it was for Djokovic, moving on without exertion to face Richard Gasquet. He said he had put the disappointment of losing in the French Open final at Roland Garros behind him to focus on Wimbledon. “It wasn’t easy to digest the loss in the final against Stan Wawrinka,” he said.“ But this is sport. You have to keep on going.” And so he has. As Djokovic signed autographs on the way off court, he did not have a single bead of sweat on his forehead.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436387319735/Novak-Djokovic-hits-a-for-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Novak Djokovic hits a forehand during his straight-sets win over Marin Cilic in the quarter-finals.

If, however, it’s a contest between two players who compete better than anyone else in the game and for whom giving an inch is not in their DNA, then theirs is as much a rivalry as any other.

But at the same time, it’s been one-sided. Maria’s also known for getting out of holes and for mental toughness. I think people keep hoping there’s going to be a rivalry.”</p> \n<p>In pure numbers terms, there is only likely to be one winner. When <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2004/jul/04/wimbledon2004.wimbledon4\" title=\"\">Sharapova stunned Williams to win Wimbledon as a 17-year-old in 2004</a> and followed it with victory in the season-ending WTA Championships, she led their head-to-head record 2-1. Since then, Williams has won all 16 of their contests, five of them in grand slams – including three finals. She has also won both their meetings on grass, the most recent of them a 6-0, 6-1 drubbing in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2012/aug/04/serena-williams-beats-maria-sharapova\" title=\"\">Olympics final at Wimbledon in 2012</a>.

The comments may even not have been about Sharapova but the Russian hit back, taking aim at Williams’ alleged relationship with her <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/serena-williams-french-open-champions-2015-patrick-mouratoglou\" title=\"\">coach Patrick Mouratoglou</a>. It was an ugly, if revealing incident. Williams later said she had apologised to Sharapova but one thing is for certain, every time she sees her across the net, she raises her game.</p> \n<p>Evert, working as a pundit for ESPN, said the personal side matters. “They don’t want to lose to each other, more than anybody,” she said. “They’re competitive, in the business field, in endorsements, in popularity, in PR, so definitely I think the personal part carries over. Serena gets really psyched up naturally for Maria. If she plays like she has the last two matches, she’s going to win. It’s all about the first serve and the court coverage. Serena’s a level ahead of Maria and that’s where the difference is.”</p> \n<p>Going into Williams’ fourth-round match against her sister, Mouratoglou said Wimbledon was now about “four grand slam finals”; Venus, Azarenka, Sharapova and Petra Kvitova. That was before the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/petra-kvitovas-wimbledon-defence-ended-by-inspired-jelena-jankovic\" title=\"\">Czech crashed out in round three</a> but the fact remains that Williams knows she has to play her best from here on if she’s to complete a second “Serena Slam” of four grand slams in a row and remain on track for the calendar year grand slam.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/wimbledon-2015-centre-court-crowd-azarenka-irritated\">Wimbledon 2015: Centre Court crowd leaves more than Azarenka irritated | Owen Gibson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Sharapova said “there will be no secrets when they meet” but this is where Williams usually steps up. “I love playing Maria,” Williams said. “I think she brings out the best in me. I think I bring out the best in her. I thought we had a wonderful final in Australia. It was very entertaining, she played really well.”</p> \n<p>Williams and Sharapova (in reverse order) are the two biggest earners in women’s tennis and the latter’s five grand slams make her the third-most successful active player, behind the American and her sister, Venus. The two players respect each other hugely for what they have achieved on and off the court and no one fights harder through adversity during matches than they do. Thursday’sclash will be another mental battle but Williams knows that if she is not on her game, Sharapova is good enough to beat her.

There was nothing towards her.</p> \n<p>“Maybe she was just afraid of my screaming there. I was pretty close to her. I’m definitely going to try to apologise to her if I did something wrong.”</p> \n<p>Djokovic’s safe progress to the quarter-finals came on the 30th anniversary of the coach Boris Becker’s first Wimbledon triumph as a 17-year-old.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t know it was today. But he’s going to have a glass of wine, I’ll have a glass of water, and we will celebrate this nice milestone,” Djokovic said.</p> \n<p>Becker remarked of Djokovic’s performance: “I think that’s a message to the locker room that whoever said he wasn’t ready before, well he’s ready now.”</p> \n<p>The 28-year-old world No1 will face the US Open champion Marin Cilic on Wednesday in the quarter-finals. They have played 12 times previously, and Djokovic has prevailed each time.</p> \n<p>The Serb will be looking to avoid an unlucky 13th, and he said of his Croatian rival: “He had an exceptional season last year, the best of his life. He played very well at the grand slams, and of course won the US Open. That’s the crown of his career.</p> \n<p>“I remember him mentioning earlier this year that he wants to focus mostly on Wimbledon, grass. That’s where he feels like he has a best chance besides the US Open.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bf617f16dcafbba09a4d702e8ee494f8f27adb42/0_99_3848_2309/3848.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2309,"width":3848,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"BPI/REX Shutterstock/BPI/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Wimbledon Championships 2015 Day Eight All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club, Church Rd, London, United Kingdom - 7 Jul 2015<br>Editorial use only.

The sun that shone across SW19 during his quarter-final against Vasek Pospisil may not have reached Britain’s No1, but neither did the black clouds of championships past.</p> \n<p>His victory over Pospisil set up a semi-final against Roger Federer, evoking memories of their last meeting in these championships in the final of 2012. Back then, with the scores level at one set apiece and on serve in the third, the rain came down and Murray’s hopes drained away. Heartache turned to joy later that summer when Murray defeated the Swiss in the Olympic final, but it was a difficult defeat to swallow.</p> \n<p>It is highly unlikely that Murray and Federer will contest their semi-final on Friday under the roof, given the good forecast. However rain is a possibility on Sunday and should Murray feature in a final affected by the weather, this performance will certainly stand him in good stead.</p> \n<p>Twice the match was halted because of showers but the Wimbledon referee, Andrew Jarrett, only opted to close the roof on the second occasion with Murray a set up. Bizarrely, it was closing just as the sun began to steadily spread over the All England Club and conditions did not dip throughout the afternoon.</p> \n<p>Yet when play resumed after 35 minutes, Murray was revived. Perhaps an earlier stoppage of 38 minutes had disrupted his rhythm but even though he had already won the opening set thanks to an early break, his level improved midway through the second.</p> \n<p>By then Pospisil was taking his time between points on his own serve, recuperating from the long, draining rallies he was coerced into playing. Murray’s returns were deeper and his timing more decisive, even though the common consensus is that his game is far more effective when playing outside.</p> \n<p>Federer, on the other hand, is a true indoor master, able to use the more humid conditions with slower ball speed to his advantage, working the service angles with even greater precision than usual. So it proved in the first of those meetings in 2012 but Murray adapted well here on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Murray played in the first full match under the Centre Court roof in 2009 against Stan Wawrinka, and four years later was involved in controversy when his quarter-final against Jerzy Janowicz was delayed for bad light at 8.39pm while the roof was closed. Back then, he was visibly angry with Jarrett’s decision to close the roof but he has also won games in the indoor conditions even though he admitted being surprised at his improved level against Pospisil.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t feel like the breaks affected me too much,” Murray said. “Actually I played pretty well under the roof for a change, which is nice. I haven’t always played that well under the roof in the past.</p> \n<p>“But I did feel like I played some good stuff when the roof closed. It was quite tricky conditions when we went out there. At the beginning it was pretty windy, it doesn’t normally swirl around in there but the wind was swirling around a bit, so it was making it tough.</p> \n<p>“Then when the roof closed it actually made it a little bit easier. It was very humid in there.</p> \n<p>“Both of us were sweating a lot when the roof closed. It does change the conditions a lot but I felt like I played quite well.”</p> \n<p>If Murray reaches the final and rain descends, this performance could prove to have been pivotal. Unflustered by the Pospisil serve, his returns became fiercer and his backhands, in particular, arrowed across court past his 6ft 4in Canadian opponent. The performance provided a renewed confidence for a player whose game is not best suited for indoor conditions.</p> \n<p>First, however, is Federer. Murray has not played the No2 seed in a grand slam since that 2012 final meeting. Federer was asked on Wednesday about the rain delay against Murray three years ago, saying: “It was tricky because there was rain, then the roof closed I think midway through the second. I don’t remember, maybe the third. So that was tricky.”</p> \n<p>Asked about his rain-interrupted victory over Gilles Simon on No1 Court, he added: “I don’t want to say it came in handy but I definitely came out with the right game plans.

The 20-year-old will spend four to five days in Canberra with his family, including his ailing grandfather, before heading to Darwin for Australia’s Davis Cup quarter-final against Kazakhstan from 17 to 19 July.</p> \n<p>Despite the storm that surrounded his heavily criticised fourth-round loss to Frenchman Richard Gasquet, the 20-year-old says he’s not “too fussed” about finding a coach to replace the sacked Todd Larkham.</p> \n<p>“I think I’m doing pretty well without one,” he told the Seven Network after touching down at Sydney Airport on Wednesday night. “I’ve got a great team around me, obviously a strength and conditioner, my dad came. I feel good riding solo for a little bit and we’ll just see what happens.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/nick-kyrgios-wimbledon-behaviour-shocked-criticism\">Nick Kyrgios ‘shocked’ by criticism over his behaviour at Wimbledon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kyrgios seemed unfazed about the drama that dogged his Wimbledon exit and indicated he doesn’t have any regrets. “Not at all, I thought it was a pretty emotional couple of weeks, obviously physically as well,” he said. “I’m feeling it a little bit, I mean I thought it was a pretty successful couple of weeks as well. It was tough reading those things every day, but you think it’s part of it now.”</p> \n<p>He also played down fears he’s considering quitting tennis despite admitting he doesn’t love the sport. “Andre Agassi didn’t love the sport,” he said. “I think you know, I still like it to some degree. I still like going out there and enjoying it, the crowd and competing. I don’t think I’ll put down the racquet anytime soon.”</p> \n<p>Kyrgios’ laid-back attitude towards finding a new coach hasn’t stopped others making suggestions. Australian Davis Cup captain Wally Masur said he should make a play for Roger Rasheed following the tough task master’s split with Bulgarian star Grigor Dimitrov.</p> \n<p>Kyrgios sacked Larkham on the eve of Wimbledon after parting ways with Simon Rea after last year’s championships. Rasheed is a well-respected mentor who also worked with Lleyton Hewitt, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gael Monfils before spending 20 months with Dimitrov, a Wimbledon semi-finalist last year.</p> \n<p>Masur admitted he was biased towards Australian coaches and, ideally, a Tony Roche or Darren Cahill would be among his top preferences. But with Roche – who has guided grand slam champions Ivan Lendl, Pat Rafter and Hewitt in the past and is also assisting Bernard Tomic – only able to spend around 15 weeks on the road these days, he’s probably not the best fit for Kyrgios.</p> \n<p>Cahill helped Hewitt become the youngest men’s world No1 and then Agassi to become the oldest, but is already committed to commentary and junior coaching and development.</p> \n<p>“I’m a bit of a fan of Roger Rasheed. I really think Roger is good. He’s got an interesting personality,” Masur said. “I think he takes players along for the ride. He works them pretty hard; he’s pretty uncompromising.”</p> \n<p>Rafter, Australia’s director of player performance, agrees Kyrgios needs a strong disciplinarian, but most importantly someone the two-time grand slam quarter-finalist can trust. “The only one who can coach him is a person he wants to listen to,” he said.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a19a1b1ab3a2817c8fbf0b11f98cc1aceede2bf2/0_150_3216_1931/3216.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1931,"width":3216,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA","altText":"Kyrgios reached the fourth round at the All England Lawn Tennis Club, making plenty of headlines along the way.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T01:07:55Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T01:07:56Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":25,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Nick Kyrgios","Tennis","Australia sport","Sport","Davis Cup","Wimbledon","Wimbledon 2015"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/nick-kyrgios","webTitle":"Nick Kyrgios"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/daviscup","webTitle":"Davis Cup"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/09/coachless-nick-kyrgios-happy-without-coach","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agx9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/09/coachless-nick-kyrgios-happy-without-coach","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/09/coachless-nick-kyrgios-happy-without-coach"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a19a1b1ab3a2817c8fbf0b11f98cc1aceede2bf2/0_150_3216_1931/3216.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1931,"width":3216,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kyrgios reached the fourth round at the All England Lawn Tennis Club, making plenty of headlines along the way.
