The Spaniard, who won the title in 2008 and 2010 but who has slipped down to No10 in the rankings after struggles with form and confidence, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/dustin-brown-rafael-nadal-wimbledon\">was beaten 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4</a> in the second round by Dustin Brown, a German qualifier ranked 102.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/dustin-brown-rafael-nadal-wimbledon\">Rafael Nadal crashes out of Wimbledon after bravura Dustin Brown display</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Looking more down than ever as he tried to sum up the effect of another early defeat – his fourth consecutive loss before the quarter-finals here – Nadal said the only thing he can do is keep trying to get back to the form that took him to 14 grand slam titles. “I lost,” he said. “Sad today for that, obviously. But end of the day, that’s sport. Good moments, bad moments. Obviously today is a bad moment for me.</p> \n<p>“I just need to accept these kind of things that can happen. I did all my career. Keep going. It’s not the end. It is a sad moment for me but life continues. My career, too. I have to keep going and working more than ever to try to change that dynamic.”</p> \n<p>When he lost in round two in 2012 and in the first round in 2013, Nadal had been struggling physically, with his knees a real problem. Last year, when he lost in round four to Australia’s Nick Kyrgios, he was blown off the court and on Thursday, Brown outgunned him with power and finesse.</p> \n<p>“It is obvious that 2012 and 2013 were not an issue,” he said. “I was not competitive. Too much problems on my knees. Last year and this year, no problems at all with my knees. I was ready to compete. I lost. I don’t know if I will be back to the level of 2008 or 2010 or 2007 or 2006 or ’11.</p> \n<p>“My motivation is try to be back to that level. I am going to keep working on that. But if I don’t make that happen, actually I played five times here the last day, had the trophy back home two times, so it is not bad. At the end of the day, today I lost. Don’t forget I played five finals here. I don’t know how many players did that.”</p> \n<p>Nadal, who lost his French Open title last month when he was beaten by Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals, rued a series of missed chances to beat Brown, who played well above his ranking and threw the Spaniard off his game with aggressive net play backed up by stunning shot-making and dozens of drop shots.</p> \n<p>The Spaniard admitted he had simply made too many mistakes and left himself too much to do. “On this court especially, you meet players that don’t want to play from the baseline sometimes,” he said. “You cannot have mistakes against a player like him with that big serve, nothing to lose, serving first and second almost the same speed. Without having rhythm at all. I didn’t hit three balls in a row the same way. Then when you need to hit that ball, extra ball, you don’t have the confidence to do it. That’s what happened.”</p> \n<p>Having gone two sets to one down, Nadal said the start of the fourth set had been the final straw. “First game of the fourth set was terrible for me,” he said. “A very disappointing moment. Two forehands that I should not make the mistake with. I did not play that forehand during the whole match. Arrive at that one, you lose confidence, you miss another.</p> \n<p>“Then I fought at the end, but no chance at all on the return. That’s it.”</p> \n<p>Nadal will return home to Mallorca, try to forget the experience and move on. “I had the right preparation, all the things I thought were going to be fine to play a good Wimbledon,” he said. “I am not a person that will be thinking about it for the next two weeks. But obviously today it’s tough.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435870987411/Rafael-Nadal-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rafael Nadal suffers during his defeat to Germany's Dustin Brown in the second round match at Wimbledon.

Aliz&eacute; Cornet has won her past three meetings with the American and is probably the last person Williams would want to see across the net as she continues her quest for grand slam title No21. Drawn in opposite halves this time round, their chances of a meeting were slim – they could only have face each other in the final – but slim became none on Thursday as the Frenchwoman was ousted 7-6, 2-6, 6-1 by Olga Govortsova of Belarus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/heather-watson-serena-williams-venus-wimbledon-2015\">Wimbledon 2015: Heather Watson undaunted by double Williams challenge</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Cornet got the better of Williams three times in 2014, the most famous of the three coming in the third round at Wimbledon, a match Cornet won in three sets. In the year since, Williams has lost only three times, including to Cornet in Wuhan in September, when she retired at 6-5 up in the first set. Whatever the reason, Cornet has been able to do something few others have managed lately – to make Williams play below her imperious best. So if a smile passed the American’s lips yesterday as Cornet went out, it would have been easily understood.</p> \n<p>“I think I played with good tactics for the three times I beat her last year,” Cornet said. “I was playing the right shot at the right time and I was not panicking of who I had on the other side of the net, forgetting about who she is, how many titles she has and her ranking.”</p> \n<p>“She is a good runner, she is strong and a great athlete so I was trying to play up the middle and deep. I think the key is to play very deep against Serena because if you play short, you’re dead. I put a lot of first serves in and one of the keys for me was to return all of her serves, and I think she was annoyed by the fact I was returning them, just getting them back. And I was aggressive on the second serve and I think she is not used to that.”</p> \n<p>Not everyone can do that, of course, and Cornet admits that consistency is her own problem. But if Heather Watson is looking for tips, then Cornet is worth listening to. “Against Serena you have nothing to lose,” she said. “It’s a pleasure for me to play against such a big champion. I think I put her in a kind of trouble when I play against her and I’m proud of it. My best is coming out against her somehow. I wish I could do it against everyone.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435873067038/cfba77d3-3547-4132-ae24-5f61e0375002-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom

Or a thousand others who have dreamed, perhaps, they could do what Murray did?</p> \n<p>Murray bossed Haase from start to finish to win 6-1, 6-1, 6-4 in just under an hour and a half, and is in excellent shape to do the same to Andreas Seppi in the third round on Saturday. The Italian saved him from the precocious challenge of young Borna Coric (who <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/feb/26/andy-murray-loses-borna-coric-dubai\" title=\"\">beat Murray in Dubai earlier in the year</a>), winning 4-6, 6-4, 6-7, 6-1, 6-1. For all his talent, the Croatian whizzkid clearly still has strength and stamina issues – as did Murray at his age.</p> \n<p>What was most impressive about the now-mature Murray’s tennis against Haase was the calmness and poise with which he injected so much power into his ground strokes. The great ball strikers in any sport involving a moving ball have the gift of making it look simple, when it plainly is not – especially on grass, be it tennis or cricket. That extra element makes for a wonderful amount of uncertainty.</p> \n<p>When Murray gets “in the zone”, as he did for extended periods here, there is little his opponent can do about it, because the world No3 allies his attack to a defensive game that destroys the spirit. Time and again Haase, himself a gifted hitter, was frustrated to the point of impotence by Murray’s ability to grind him into the turf.</p> \n<p>The domination was near total. Murray took just 20 minutes to blow Haase away in the first set, broke him six times in all, won 85 of the 136 points contested, hit 25 clean winners, with only 11 unforced errors – as well as five well-timed aces in a service game that clicked pleasingly, with perhaps a little room for improvement.</p> \n<p>Murray is always tinkering with his game and he will work on those finer points he considers need tweaking before taking on Seppi, whom he has beaten in the last six of their seven meetings.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/02/andy-murray-robin-hasse-wimbledon-2015-live\">Andy Murray v Robin Haase: Wimbledon 2015 – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Against Haase he knew what to expect in every department. The Dutchman <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/aug/25/andy-murray-robin-haase-us-open-tennis-2014\" title=\"\">took a set off him at the US Open last year</a> when cramp coursed through the Scot’s legs in a worrying third set. But, as he has done in four matches against him now, Murray&nbsp;found a way through what, ultimately, was not a forest of that many dark secrets.</p> \n<p>Indeed, there was a decided lack of drama – even Dutch resistance. It was disappointing to see Haase appear so resigned to his fate after a decent start, only briefly coming to life again at the beginning of the third when the fight already appeared lost.</p> \n<p>As for Seppi, his lone win against Murray was on the grass of Nottingham nine years ago. The last time they met, on clay in Naples in the Davis Cup last year, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/apr/05/andy-murray-davis-cup-great-britain-italy\" title=\"\">Murray won in straight sets</a>.

Petra Kvitova was not in the mood for fun and games.</p> \n<p>She started with an ace, banged down another and held to love to hammer home the size of the task facing Kurumi Nara, who was beginning to appreciate the feeling of resignation that so many of Kvitova’s victims on these lawns have experienced in the past.</p> \n<p>Kvitova led 2-0 five minutes later, breaking her Japanese opponent’s serve with one of her trademark forehand scythes, and even someone with entry-level powers of precognition would have known that the defending Wimbledon champion was heading for the third round and a meeting with Jelena Jankovic, who beat Evgeniya Rodina 6-7, 6-1, 6-3.</p> \n<p>The No2 seed has made an ominous start to the defence of her title and she was in breathtaking form in her resounding 6-2, 6-0 victory in 57 minutes over Nara. At times like this, there is a compelling case to be made for offering players a shovel instead of a racket, giving them a way to erect an escape route from their Kvitovian torture chamber.</p> \n<p>Not that Kvitova will take anything for granted against Jankovic. “It’s always a big challenge to face her,” she said. “Former No1 player. It’s always little bit special. Always she has a weapon to play. Especially her backhand – it’s really great. I played her in Rome, I never played her on grass. It’s really different.”</p> \n<p>It is not that Nara, the world No57, played badly, simply that the 23-year-old was hopelessly outgunned in every facet of the game by Kvitova, who will take some stopping as she chases her third title here. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/30/petra-kvitova-wimbledon-kiki-bertens\" title=\"\">At least Nara lasted longer than Kvitova’s first-round patsy, Kiki Bertens</a>, who was vanquished in a staggering 36 minutes on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Kvitova was always in control, never forced out of her comfort zone. At times she was like a big tree that was firmly rooted in the middle of the baseline, extending her swinging branches to the side to clump a slew of fearsome backhands and forehands past a bewildered Nara.</p> \n<p>To her credit, Nara fought hard and she drew appreciative applause from the crowd when she caught Kvitova out with a clever forehand lob in the fifth game of the first set. But mostly the patrons on No1 Court sighed in sympathy for Nara, glad that it was her out there and not them. Kvitova was rampant. She is a wonderful player, blowing Nara away in the second set with a barrage of aces and booming forehand winners.</p> \n<p>Kvitova banged down 10 aces overall, one of them coming off a second serve, and Nara found it impossible to read her lefty deliveries.

No one makes tennis look as easy as the Swiss when he is in full flow and his 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 second-round victory over the American Sam Querrey was every bit as dominant as it sounds.</p> \n<p>From a sublime half-volley drop shot to one outrageous rally when, after over-running the ball, he lobbed Querrey with a between-the-legs forehand to win the point, Federer cut his opponent’s big game to pieces with a performance which Andy Murray, a potential semi-final opponent, will surely have taken notice of.</p> \n<p>“I’m very happy with the way I’m playing,” he said. “I’ve been playing well this season, really since here last year. It’s also a bit of a relief to be playing well at Wimbledon.”</p> \n<p>Seeing Federer rip through opponents in the first week of a grand slam is nothing new – he makes a habit of steamrolling opponents in the early rounds – but it remains hugely impressive to see the seven-time Wimbledon champion gliding around a grass court, touching down only to smash a forehand or carve a perfectly crafted slice.</p> \n<p>The world No36 Querrey, a former champion at Queen’s Club, was utterly helpless in the face of Federer’s range of attack and the 17-times grand slam champion also did a great job in returning serve, always making life difficult for Querrey. The American held his own until 4-4 but, once he was broken, the first set was over and another break in the opening game of the second crushed his spirit.</p> \n<p>The shot of the match came at 4-2 in the second set, on the first point of the Querrey serve. Running across to cut off a Querrey approach, Federer overran the ball but stopped dead, put the racket between his legs and lifted a perfect lob over Querrey’s head. As the crowd gasped, the American could only net the forehand as he ran back.</p> \n<p>Like the crowd, Querrey was in awe. “He hits shots that other guys don’t hit,” he said. You want to go over and give him a high five sometimes, but you can’t do that. You want to beat him but he’s fun to watch, too.” Federer laughed. “He said that? That’s cool. That would have been OK.”</p> \n<p>“It’s rare that it happens,” Federer said of the between-the-legs lob. “So when it does you have to pull it off. I even had a bit of time – I had to shuffle my feet to get in position. But if you don’t win the point, you do look a bit silly.”</p> \n<p>There were any number of other moments of brilliance and, after cruising through the rest of the set, Federer served out, saving energy for his next battle, a clash with another big server, Australia’s Sam Groth. “He’s a good serve-and-volley player,” Federer said. “He’s got an amazing serve that he can crack really hard.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435854159926/Roger-Federer-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Roger Federer won a point with this behind-the-legs lob after Sam Querrey put his return into the net on Wimbledon's Centre Court.
