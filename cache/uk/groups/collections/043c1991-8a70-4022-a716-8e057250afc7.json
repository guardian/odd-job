final","trailText":"Roger Federer praised his conqueror, Novak Djokovic, after his four-set defeat in the Wimbledon singles final but sounded confident he still has the game to extend his extraordinary Wimbledon career","standFirst":"Seven-times champion not quite at his imperious best in Sunday’s showpiece but gives every impression of being back next year","byline":"Owen Gibson at Wimbledon","body":"<p>So Roger Federer is mortal after all. Slumped at the end with head in hands – a rare display of emotion before he regathered his trademark poise – the man who won five consecutive titles here between 2003 and 2007 was perhaps looking round the arena he came to regard as home and wondering whether he would ever now add to his total of seven.</p> \n<p>Restored to equilibrium by a post-match shower during the strange break in proceedings that followed Djokovic’s victory while the roof was closed ahead of the trophy presentation, Federer was magnanimity personified in a monogrammed tracksuit. “I thought he played great. I didn’t play bad myself. That’s how it goes,” he said. “I am still very hungry and motivated to keep playing.”</p> \n<p>Federer knew that to win Wimbledon for the eighth time he would have to maintain or even surpass the superlative levels he reached in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/andy-murray-hurry-wimbledon-davis-cup\" title=\"\">beating Andy Murray</a> on Friday. In the end it was not to be, as the Swiss – surely now confirmed as the greatest ever to play the game – was ground down by the brilliance and athleticism of Novak Djokovic.</p> \n<p>This was not the imperious Federer of Friday, who had blown away Murray by rolling back the years. There were plenty of glimpses of him, not least during a titanic second-set tie-break in which he levelled the scores having saved seven set points. But just as on Friday Murray was able to say he played close to his limit but not quite close enough, so here Federer fell short by the smallest of margins. Perhaps fatigue did play a part, perhaps the cooler conditions suited him less than Djokovic.</p> \n<p>By the fourth set that elegant backhand was not working quite as it had. Against Djokovic he made 35 unforced errors, compared with 11 in defeating Murray. The Federer serve, so terrifyingly impregnable on a march to the final in which he dropped only one service game, was not quite as unplayable. Before the final someone unearthed the statistic that, when Federer gets 76% of his first serves in at Wimbledon, he wins. Against Djokovic it was 67%. He won less than half the points on his second serve.</p> \n<p>When the players returned following a short rain delay at 3-2 to Djokovic in the third, it was as though he had aged in the interim. There were crucial moments – when he failed to convert two set points in the first set and, in particular, when he failed to capitalise on levelling at one set all by handing Djokovic the initiative early in the third – when Federer’s challenge foundered on fine margins. But like last year’s five-set epic this was a match to be enjoyed for its aesthetics rather than seen through the prism of endless stats. In admiring his imperiousness over the past fortnight it was worth recalling the eulogies when Federer sat in the bunker-like Wimbledon press room and analysed in his matter-of-fact way his defeat by the Ukrainian world No116, Sergiy Stakhovsky, in 2013. Few of those present would have given him much hope of being here for his second consecutive final – apart, that is, from the man himself. And here he was, on the verge of his 34th birthday, the oldest finalist since Ken Rosewall in 1974, still the darling of the Centre Court.</p> \n<p>Around the turn of that year he took on Stefan Edberg as coach, switched to a larger racket head size and has enjoyed an Indian summer since, despite his 18th grand slam title remaining frustratingly out of reach. Federer loves it here and they undoubtedly adore him. “It’s beautiful. It almost means as much to me as winning. I’ve been around for a long, long time. It’s so cool when everyone gets involved,” he said afterwards.</p> \n<p>Gliding around Centre Court, he slips seamlessly in alongside the upmarket brands unobtrusively nestling amid the green and cream colour scheme. Djokovic, in contrast, is backed by the more utilitarian likes of Uniqlo and Peugeot. Federer, even in his advancing years, brings in $54m a year in endorsements. Has a sportsman ever managed so comprehensively to monetise his huge talents while maintaining such an aura and giving away so little of himself?</p> \n<p>At times during the past two years Federer has come close to regaining the aura of his imperial phase – not least against Murray, when a stunning display of dominant serving was capped off by that amazing whipped backhand that seemed to defy the laws of physics.</p> \n<p>He was not able to reach those stratospheric heights against Djokovic or wasn’t allowed to, but he does not have to prove anything to anyone. “It does not feel [like] I am chasing anything,” he said. “I am right there. My game is good. I got broken very few times. I played on my terms. Things are all right.” He does not yet sound like a man contemplating the end of a career that in the final reckoning will surely stand comparison with any other, in any sport.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436733910282/Roger-Federer-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Roger Federer looks dejected during a final in which he was unable to reproduce the brilliant form that had seen off Andy Murray.

After a triumph that earned the Serb a third title at the All England Club and a ninth major in all, that may seem merely a statistical footnote. But for Djokovic, it gestures towards the wider truth that he is finally beginning to make up ground on Federer, if not in the affections of the public then certainly in the grand sweep of sporting history.</p> \n<p>Defeat to the Swiss maestro, which looked an even-money bet when an inspired Federer sent the Centre Court crowd into delirium by staving off six set points to win the second-set tie-break, would have reinforced the impression of Djokovic as a man playing third fiddle in a symphony of unprecedented excellence. But while he remains short of both Federer and Rafael Nadal in terms of majors won – his two biggest rivals have 17 and 14 respectively – he is now in a class of his own on nine.</p> \n<p>“He’s marching through history right now and we’re watching it,” said the former world No1 Andy Roddick after a win that lifted Djokovic one slam clear of Andre Agassi, Ivan Lendl, Jimmy Connors, Ken Rosewall and Fred Perry.</p> \n<p>How different that picture might have looked had Djokovic foundered, as he had done in six of his previous nine major finals heading into the match. Then the talk would have turned to a man suffering a crisis of confidence after his recent defeat to Stan Wawrinka in the final of the French Open, the only grand slam Djokovic has yet to win. The Serb would have faced accusations not only of a failure of nerve on the game’s biggest stages but also of complacency, following his decision not to play a warm-up event on grass for the second year running.</p> \n<p>Instead, Djokovic confirmed that this is his time. This year has seen him at his most dominant since 2011, when he marked his emergence as a genuine rival to Federer and Nadal by winning in Melbourne, London and New York. Until now, he has struggled to match that high-water mark, failing to win more than one major a year. But victory in SW19 suggests that – like Federer and Nadal, who marked their best years by claiming at least two slams a season – Djokovic is ready to dominate the sport in earnest.</p> \n<p>Certainly his comments to the press after his 7-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-3 victory spoke of a man with history on his mind. “I’m very proud with all the success that I’ve had so far in my career,” said Djokovic. “If you had said to me as a 14-year-old back in Serbia, trying to find my way, that this was how I was going to end up at 28, of course I would have signed the deal and taken it right away.</p> \n<p>“There were a couple of grand slam finals that I think I could have won, but having said that everything happens for a reason. I try to learn from every experience, especially the ones that don’t end up victorious for me. I’m going to keep going. I’m 28, I feel good, I don’t feel old, I have hopefully many more years in front of me. I’m going to try to push my own limits and see how far I can go.”</p> \n<p>Whether it will be enough to take him beyond his two great rivals remains to be seen. Federer may have thrown down the gauntlet for good with his seventh Wimbledon title three years ago, but Nadal will surely come again after a season spent labouring unsuccessfully to rediscover his best form. For now, though, Djokovic will train his sights on the US Open, where victory would draw him level with Bill Tilden, the great American champion of the 1920s, on 10 majors. Only a fool would bet against him.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436739489962/c1bdafb2-fa82-4f9b-8836-3da2762b7590-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Han Yan/Han Yan/Xinhua Press/Corbis","altText":"Novak Djokovic poses with the Wimbledon trophy after defeating Roger Federer to claim his ninth grand slam title.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Han Yan/Han Yan/Xinhua Press/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-12T22:24:29Z","lastModified":"2015-07-12T23:21:44Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":27,"contributors":[{"name":"Les Roopanarine","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/lesroopanarine"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Novak Djokovic","Tennis","Sport","Wimbledon 2015","Wimbledon"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/novak-djokovic","webTitle":"Novak Djokovic"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Les Roopanarine","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/lesroopanarine"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/12/novak-djokovic-wimbledon-2015-history-in-sights","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4atcb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/12/novak-djokovic-wimbledon-2015-history-in-sights","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/12/novak-djokovic-wimbledon-2015-history-in-sights"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436739489962/c1bdafb2-fa82-4f9b-8836-3da2762b7590-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Novak Djokovic poses with the Wimbledon trophy after defeating Roger Federer to claim his ninth grand slam title.

But that moniker was entirely inappropriate on an evening where she was instrumental in producing one of the most dominant performances on Centre Court of these entire championships. It was so good it could be released as an instructional DVD on how to play mixed doubles tennis.</p> \n<p>“My body was hurting here, there and everywhere but the adrenaline got me back out there,” said <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/martina-hingis-sania-mirza-win-wimbledon-womens-doubles-final\" title=\"\">Hingis, who took the ladies’ doubles with her partner Sania Mirza</a>. “So to also bring this title home was incredible.”</p> \n<p>As she spoke Paes nodded before adding his own tribute. “Everyone knows what Martina has achieved over the years at Wimbledon. To come out there and do it back to back, the physical and mental effort that it takes to win two titles in the same week, is something really, really special.”</p> \n<p>Hingis’s story loses nothing in its retelling: she claimed her first ladies’ doubles title at Wimbledon in 1996 aged 15, and became the youngest singles’ champion in 110 years when she won the title aged 16 years and nine months. But after winning six grand slam titles and nine women’s doubles titles she retired at 22 after two ankle surgeries. She returned in 2005 and climbed into the top 10, but was banned for two years in 2007 after testing positive for cocaine. And now she is back again, just two months short of her 35th birthday, as arguably the best women’s doubles player in tennis.</p> \n<p>And what is even more impressive is that in an era of power tennis, Hingis is a glorious throwback. She strokes the ball rather than throttles it, but her extra-sensory powers of anticipation combined with a mathematician’s appreciation of angles makes her absolutely formidable on a doubles court. Her volleying at the net stood up to everything that the muscular Peya, in particular, threw at her.</p> \n<p>In mixed doubles the women’s serve is the most threatened because it is slower. But while the Hingis serve was the slowest on court, Paes’ timing at the net was staggering. Repeatedly Hingis would get a first serve in and the 42-year-old Paes would anticipate the return to put away a winner. As Hingis put it afterwards: “He was striking winners right and left. I was like: OK, if I can just keep up with him a little bit. The chemistry we had was incredible.”</p> \n<p>Hingis and Paes broke early and won their first 10 points on serve to race to a 4-1 lead. Another break of serve meant they were 5-1 up in 17 minutes and the first set followed two minutes later.</p> \n<p>Paes appears to have got better with age: 12 of his 16 grand slam men’s doubles and mixed doubles titles have come in his 30s and 40s, and he became the oldest man to ever win a grand slam title when he and Hingis won the mixed doubles at the Australian Open in January. The hour of yoga she does every day surely helps.</p> \n<p>The second set was just as one-sided. Just before halfway through it, there was a particularly telling statistic – Paes and Hingis had won 100% of their second-serve points, while Peya and Babos had managed just 14%. In truth, though, Paes and Hingis dominated everywhere. It seemed entirely appropriate that Paes sealed victory in 41 minutes with a masterful disguised return – and that they celebrated the standing ovation from the crowd by signing tennis balls and hitting them into the stands.</p> \n<p>This was Paes’ fourth Wimbledon mixed doubles title – with four different partners – while Hingis was claiming her first. Afterwards Paes reflected on another of those wins, with Martina Navratilova in 2003, as he compared what he called “two legends of the game.”</p> \n<p>“They’re both the two greatest female athletes in the planet that we have had in any sport,” he said. “In tennis Martina Navratilova and Martina Hingis are right at the top. Hingis probably has the best groundstrokes or return of serves I have ever seen. I still learn from her.”</p> \n<p>Hingis now has five singles and 11 doubles titles to her name, but she is not finished yet. Afterwards she admitted she wanted to play in the mixed doubles at the Rio Olympics next year – and on this evidence whoever wins the battle between Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka to play with her will be halfway towards a gold medal.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436738209210/Martina-Hingis-right-cele-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Martina Hingis, right, celebrates her second Wimbledon title in two days with Leander Paes.
