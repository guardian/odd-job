As he made his way to practice court No4 at lunchtime, a little boy lifted up a tennis ball for him to sign, and his mum, momentarily confused, said: “Thank you, Ga&euml;l.” When someone nearby pointed out her mistake, she was mortified: “I’m so sorry, Dan.”</p> \n<p>Brown responded with one of his wide smiles, and in doing so won over yet another fan. “I’ve just offended him twice, and he’s been very gracious,” she giggled, as he wandered away, his red headphones clamped to his ears. “I like him even more now.”</p> \n<p>Further along, a couple of young men eagerly discussed the technicalities of how <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/dustin-brown-rafael-nadal-wimbledon\" title=\"\">the 30-year-old had managed to beat Rafa Nadal</a>. Ten minutes earlier, the crowd hadn’t been speaking at all: watching Roger Federer hit, you might have thought Friday’s one-minute silence had lasted a half-hour. Then Brown arrived – someone who inspires effervescence, rather than a reverential hush. From the moment he released his magnificent dreadlocks from his cap, and tied them back with a piece of red string, he had everyone’s attention. Even poor James Ward, walking past the queue of onlookers, went unnoticed.</p> \n<p>It was only a gentle practice for Saturday’s match against Viktor Troicki and he didn’t need to run far, not with those long, lean arms and legs that stretched across the court to thwart Nadal. He kept most of his trick shots under wraps – he later claimed that he is not working on anything new – but his clever hands couldn’t keep themselves quiet, spinning his racket on his wrist in between exchanges.</p> \n<p>Brown’s entourage is a fluid affair – Scott Wittenberg flew out to coach him after qualifying, and he enlists the ad hoc help of an ATP tour analyst, Craig O’Shannessy. “It’s loose and casual but that works, it fits,” says O’Shannessy, who suggests that if Brown had a full-time coach “it would probably last about three months”. There’s also Brown’s agent, Scott Norton. “They’ve known each other for a long period of time so there’s a lot of trust, a lot of positive energy,” says O’Shannessy. “When Dustin looks up to the box and sees Scott doing this” – he pumps his chest – “he grows another six feet.”</p> \n<p>A couple of friends from home were watching Brown practise and confirmed there had indeed been a small celebration on Thursday night in the house that they are renting near Southfields. “We only had one drink!” they cried, but still, that drink was champagne. Brown’s practice partner, meanwhile, looked too young to drink. He turned out to be a junior who met him two years ago at the M&ouml;nchengladbach sports club in Germany.</p> \n<p>Being a black youth in north Germany had its problems for Brown growing up. “The village next to my town was infamous for being a Nazi stronghold,” he said earlier this week. “We were three or four coloured kids around and sometimes the other ones showed up with knives after school.”</p> \n<p>But it made him neither hard nor angry. “He’s so chilled,” said his young hitting partner, Tim Sandkaulen. “Two days ago he gave me his Centre Court tickets. This morning I texted him and said congrats, and he said ‘thanks’ and ‘you want to hit today?’” What’s the hardest thing about facing him? “His drop shots. You cannot see it when he plays it. There is no one like him. That’s why he’s so dangerous for all the players because you don’t know what’s coming.”</p> \n<p>After the practice, there was time for a few words with Brown himself. He talked about the tattoo of his dad (it took eight hours, he listened to music to deal with the pain), and his hair (last cut in August 1996). He did not talk about his British grandmother – “I am pretty sure she does still live here but there’s no direct contact” – or his campervan experiences (“that’s a very old story”).</p> \n<p>But he did admit it had taken him a while to get to sleep after the adventures of Thursday evening. “I ended up getting to dinner, it was already 11pm, so it took a bit of time to wind down.” His extremely glamorous-looking girlfriend, Dione Gonzales, has been rooting for him from Las Vegas on Twitter – would she be coming to watch him? “We’re not sure yet. We’re still waiting. Going to see how I play tomorrow and then we’ll decide.”</p> \n<p>Financial concerns have limited more than his entourage – they have had an impact on his rise up the rankings. “He can’t go to the tournaments he wants to,” says O’Shannessy. “And he’s playing a game style that naturally takes more time to develop. That makes it a slower burn for him.”</p> \n<p>Brown is relaxed. “I guess it just takes a long time for everything to fall in place,” he says. “And maybe three, four, five or six years ago, I wasn’t ready for it. Who knows, for whatever reason? The things that are happening now, I just try to enjoy it as much as I can.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435943796116/Dustin-Brown-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dustin Brown has a 'loose and casual' approach to employing coaches but those current around him believe he has now found a winning formula.

After dropping serve in the opening game, the 2004 winner eased her way through the gears and, despite a late rally from the world No40, was good value for her win as she moved into the second week here for the 10th time.</p> \n<p>With so much focus on Serena Williams and her quest for a 21st grand slam title,<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/26/serena-williams-wimbledon-grand-slam\" title=\"\"> the Serena Slam</a> and the third leg of the calendar year grand slam, Sharapova has been in the unusual position of being able to go about her business without too much fuss.

Three matches in and having not dropped a set, he looks every inch the man to beat again.</p> \n<p>On Friday it was the turn of the talented Australian Bernard Tomic to feel the heat of the Djokovic game as the world No1 recorded a 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 victory that was utterly ruthless. The big-serving South African Kevin Anderson, who beat Argentina’s Leonardo Mayer in straight sets on Friday, may offer more resistance in the fourth round on Monday but on current form it is going to take something special to knock the two-times champion off his perch.</p> \n<p>“It’s been great so far,” said Djokovic of his first week’s work, which consists of three straight-set wins, each one better than the last. “I was hoping that I could play better and better as the tournament progresses and that’s exactly what’s happening right now. I feel more confident on the court and in control of my baseline shots.”</p> \n<p>Last year Djokovic also came to Wimbledon with the mental scars of having missed out in Paris, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jun/08/imperious-nadal-overcomes-djokovic-to-win-his-ninth-french-open-title\" title=\"\">beaten by Rafael Nadal as the Spaniard claimed a ninth French Open title</a>. If the scars are any deeper after his latest Paris disappointment, losing to Stan Wawrinka in the final, they are well hidden and he will surely draw strength from his efforts of 12 months ago, when he beat Roger Federer in five sets to clinch a second Wimbledon title.</p> \n<p>Tomic, who <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/jun/29/wimbledon-2011-novak-djokovic-tomic\" title=\"\">reached the quarter-finals here as an 18-year-old in 2011</a>, had no answer to the Serb’s brilliance, unable to cope in the face of what became a brutally efficient assault. Having held serve in a long third game, Djokovic promptly broke the Tomic serve and even at that stage, it looked an awfully long way back for the Australian as a one-set lead quickly became two.</p> \n<p>The only glimmer of hope for Tomic came when he held 0-40 on Djokovic’s serve in the opening game of the third set but the top seed was in no mood to become embroiled in a scrap, saving all three and holding. One break was enough to seal victory and Tomic was generous in his praise. “I can’t even describe it in words,” he said. “Too good, too good.”</p> \n<p>Djokovic could barely be more confident and relaxed as he heads into week two, staying long after the end of his match to pose for photos and sign autographs, including one man’s prosthetic leg. “That’s probably the first time, maybe the second time, that I’ve signed a prosthetic limb. I hope it gives him luck and he’s going to feel better.”</p> \n<p>With Andy Murray also playing superbly and Roger Federer cruising through his first couple of matches, Djokovic knows the title will not be handed to him on a plate. He will also be well aware that Wawrinka, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/french-open-2015-stanislas-wawrinka-novak-djokovic-win\" title=\"\">his conqueror in Paris</a>, could yet be waiting for him in the semi-finals. On Friday the Swiss matched Djokovic with a third straight-sets win, his 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 success over Spain’s Fernando Verdasco – an exercise in efficiency.</p> \n<p>When Djokovic and Wawrinka practised together here a few days before Wimbledon, the Swiss unleashed his trademark one-handed backhand down the line, only for Djokovic to gesture and tell his friend: “I’ve seen enough of those, no more.” On grass, Wawrinka, the fourth seed, does not have as much time as he does on clay to wind up the backhand but if the seedings pan out he may not have much choice. There is still a long way to go before that happens, of course, and Wawrinka’s first task will be to get past David Goffin of Belgium in round four on Monday.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/3/1435939646173/Novak-Djokovic--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Novak Djokovic is mildly extended by Australia's Bernard Tomic.

The player burst on to the world stage this time last year when, as a wild-card entrant making his Wimbledon debut, he <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/01/nick-kyrgios-rafael-nadal-wimbledon-2014\">knocked out the then world No1 Rafael Nadal</a> in the first round and steamrollered his way as far as the quarter finals.</p> \n<p>Blessed with a variety of weapons, chief among them an audacious serve, his talent is not in question. “I think he is without a doubt one of the most dangerous players in the draw,” John McEnroe said after his match on Monday. “He is, to me, going to win majors.”</p> \n<p>But, as one tennis writer from the Sydney Morning Herald <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/wimbledon-2015-its-getting-harder-to-love-nick-kyrgios-20150629-gi07o7\">put it earlier this week</a>, “The show is starting to wear a little thin. I’m starting to feel like Nick Kyrgios is – and there’s no delicate way of putting this – a bit of a tool.”</p> \n<p>This is not the first tournament in which the player – who shaves a zigzag into his hair and wears oversized diamond studs in his ears – has provoked controversy. </p> \n<p>During last year’s US Open he found himself close to being disqualified after picking up three code violations in one match for swearing and smashing the ball out of the court in frustration. He could have suffered the same fate in January’s Australian Open, after again attracting censure for swearing at fans (he went on to reach the quarter finals before an encounter with Andy Murray proved a step too far). </p> \n<p>But, for everyone who may disapprove of his behaviour, there are many more who welcome the emergence in world tennis of a player as colourful as Kyrgios. </p> \n<p>While he may win censure from umpires, the player is often wildly entertaining on court, chatting and joking with spectators. Frequently during his defeat of Raonic, met with a line call he didn’t like, he would gawp at the linesman in mock shock, and drop his racquet and ball where he stood, drawing inevitable laughter. By the end of the match, with the help of vocal Australian fans in the crowd, many of the impartial crowd were on his side. </p> \n<p>“People are starting to get on him and to say they don’t like the way he’s cut his hair and he’s talking too much,” added McEnroe, “but the truth is, he’s a breath of fresh air for the game.”</p> \n<p>Or, as the former Wimbledon champion Andy Roddick told the New York Times about Kyrgios’s behaviour: “Would I want my child to do it? Maybe not. But would I watch it? I probably would.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c9f045f70fa9acd0b23487f5d58f099ad841eeed\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435951260421/8c8fe3ca-2308-4b55-ad77-17f2ae1c39cd-257x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The entertainer ... the other side of Nick Kyrgios.\" width=\"257\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The entertainer ... the other side of Nick Kyrgios</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked if he felt tennis would benefit from a few more characters, as in the days of McEnroe, Ilie Nastase and Andre Agassi, Kyrgios said yesterday: “Yeah, I guess so. I like to watch entertaining tennis. I’m not the biggest believer in saying nothing out there or being a robot. I feel you should express yourself. You know – it’s a sport.”</p> \n<p>Tennis’s new bad boy was born in Canberra in 1995, the son of a Greek-born tradesman father and a mother who was born as a princess in Malaysia, but dropped her royal title when she moved to Australia as a child.</p> \n<p>An NBA obsessive, the 6ft 4in Kyrgios has said he turned to professional tennis under pressure from his parents.</p> \n<p>“I was all for basketball and I made the decision to play tennis. I got pushed by my parents and to this day I can still say I don’t love the sport. If it’s NBA on one channel and a tennis tournament on the other, I’m watching NBA, 100%.” </p> \n<p>That may be almost heretical in the obsessive world of tennis, but there are plenty who are rooting for Kyrgios.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/02/nick-kyrgios-enfant-terrible-reaction\">Cut Nick Kyrgios some slack – if you built the boy up, you can't then cut him down</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After the legendary coach Nick Bollettieri – mentor to Agassi, Monica Seles and many others – tweeted his admiration earlier this year, the Australian replied, “please let me know where I can improve”.</p> \n<p>This week, Bollettieri did just that, sending a lengthy letter in which he said Kyrgios could be one of the world’s top players. “You are also a character and have a very engaging personality on the tennis court ... The game needs ‘characters’. That being said, you must also be able to maintain discipline and avoid negativity.”</p> \n<p>But if Kyrgios appreciated the American’s detailed input, he couldn’t quite find it in himself to be grateful – when asked about the letter after his match, he said with a shrug: “I didn’t really read it in much detail.” </p> \n<p> <strong>John Newcombe, three-time Wimbledon champion: </strong>“Nick is an exceptional talent and he doesn’t beat to the same drum as everyone else – he’s a real individual. Some media people will take the little negative things and build them into big issues, rather than looking at more positive things, which far outweigh the negative things.”</p> \n<p> <strong>Todd Woodbridge, nine-time Wimbledon doubles champion: </strong>“How you are going to be remembered at 19 or 20 is irrelevant. He is going to mature and he is going to grow and realise some of the things he’s done and said were not the right thing. There is so much focus on him at 20 and he has to learn to cope with that. He has people round him who can help him deal with it.”</p> \n<p> <strong>Tim Henman, four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist: </strong>“Kyrgios is a performer, an entertainer and will go out and play the tennis he is capable of. He can beat anyone because he is seriously talented. He is a bit different and speaks his mind but the most important thing is that he doesn’t get distracted from what’s happening on the court.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/21cf4cd10b55df843f3c76c68a94de95c08f4fcb/0_126_5184_3109/5184.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3109,"width":5184,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom Jenkins for the Guardian","altText":"Nick Kyrgios","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435950953885/ce23c309-5e71-4d25-beea-c77af66f2c47-699x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":699,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"A nice return ...

The world No11 is 24, not quite in his prime but no longer a kid who can exist on potential alone. “I just didn’t play good,” the Bulgarian said. “That’s just how it is. He was playing good tennis today as well.”</p> \n<p>Perhaps Gasquet sees something of himself in Dimitrov. The Frenchman has a classical approach and was once seen as a future champion but the chances of the 29-year-old winning a major look slim. Gasquet has a habit of capitulating under pressure and needed five match points to finish off Dimitrov.</p> \n<p>There is a gladiatorial vibe to most matches at the top level now but this one felt more like a gentlemanly duel between two of the game’s finest practitioners of the one-handed backhand. A memorable early exchange captured the old-school feeling, Dimitrov producing a neat imitation of Federer’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/roger-federer-sam-querrey-wimbledon-2015\" title=\"\">between-the-legs lob</a> in Thursday’s win against Sam Querrey. Gasquet stretched and volleyed wide.</p> \n<p>By then, however, Gasquet was in control, breaking for a 2-0 lead after a double-fault from Dimitrov. Every cuffed backhand down the line from Gasquet was a sharp blade across Dimitrov’s chest. This was their fifth encounter and Dimitrov is yet to come out on top.</p> \n<p>After saving three break points and holding to lead 5-2, Gasquet sealed the first set when he reached a lousy drop shot and whipped a forehand down the line.</p> \n<p>Dimitrov made 24 unforced errors and he was vulnerable after wasting three break points in the fifth game of the second set. Gasquet broke in the next game and Dimitrov’s head dropped.</p> \n<p>The question was whether Gasquet could keep it going. The answer came when Dimitrov, down a break point in the middle of the third set, let a backhand fly by and watched in despair as it kissed the baseline.</p> \n<p>Serving for the match at 5-4, Gasquet almost blew it, losing three consecutive match points, a double-fault on the third bringing the game to deuce.</p> \n<p>Dimitrov then saved a fourth match point with a monstrous forehand but there was no more generosity from Gasquet.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435934833495/Richard-Gasquet-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Richard Gasquet reaches for a forehand during his straight-sets win over Grigor Dimitrov in the third round at Wimbledon.

But the veteran may well struggle to explain the vagaries of her 7-5, 7-5 defeat by the 18-year-old Belinda Bencic, rising star of women’s and Swiss tennis.</p> \n<p>The knowledgable professional takes nothing for granted but Mattek-Sands, aged 30, could reasonably have thought things were going to plan in her third-round meeting with the youthful winner of the Eastbourne championships.</p> \n<p>Mattek-Sands, who has won doubles titles at the French and Australian Opens this year, brought her doubles toolbox to Court 18, slicing repeatedly, keeping everything low and driving into the corners at every opportunity. Bencic seemed befuddled and overwhelmed and in 23 minutes was 4-1 down. The teenager, who had tape on her right knee, trudged back to her seat disconsolate and called for the trainer. Only her magic circle will know what alchemy transpired. The result was an extraordinary turnaround.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/03/maria-sharapova-wimbledon-2015-irina-camelia-begu\">Maria Sharapova’s serene Wimbledon continues with win over Irina-Camelia Begu</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At the resumption she was all first serves in and steady drives. Mattek-Sands kept rushing the net but now, routinely, the ball would whizz past her.</p> \n<p>As her level rose, that of Mattek-Sands deteriorated, the rot particularly evident in a wayward forehand. Bencic lost one more game to go 5-1 down but then won six to take the set 7-5. How to explain it? “Tennis viagra,” joked one smiling Swiss official courtside. A compatriot sitting next to him celebrated by ringing a cowbell.</p> \n<p>Mattek-Sands, to her credit, stayed positive and aggressive in a tighter second set. With both players serving more reliably, the set went with serve until the seventh game when Mattek-Sands was broken. Still she stuck to the game plan, surged forward and took the third of three break points in the next game to level at 4-4.</p> \n<p>But Bencic, now swinging freely, moving well and cajoled to greater heights by the supportive cowbell, kept up the pressure; she had raced the length of the court in the seventh game to whip a low and angled forehand past the despairing American at the net. The teenager raised both arms in triumph, much enamoured with her new script. She broke Mattek-Sands again to go 6-5 up and to serve for the match, at which point the veteran might have hoped to see her young opponent entangled by nerves. Instead Bencic went 0-30 down before taking the set 7-5 and the match. There were more smiles, more cowbells – the last act of the great escape.</p> \n<p>Afterwards Bencic said the trainer’s physical input was minimal. “I called the physio so she could redo the tape and to loosen it up a little bit. I mean, it hurt a little bit.”</p> \n<p>The self-repair, she said, was psychological. “I was definitely thinking too much about her game and her always coming to the net and me panicking. I think I just calmed down a bit and focused on my game. I just tried to put the ball in the court, to make rallies and to not think about what I will do when she attacks. I was trying to find out how to play against her.”</p> \n<p>Mattek-Sands, who slipped from 30 to 158 after a hip injury, will regroup for the doubles and the US Open, with many excited that she and her partner Lucie Safarova may together achieve a calender grand slam of doubles titles. But the singles draw will undoubtedly be less colourful without her. For in great measure, she rebuts the notion that modern tennis has become bland.</p> \n<p>This week hers was one of the strongest voices against Wimbledon’s strict policing of its white clothing stipulation, complaining that the strictures had “gotten a little excessive”. As a proponent of colour, she will have found the rules particularly stifling. She is known for dyeing her hair in different hues and this week there has been a purple tint. Just as visible was the bright tattoo on her right arm. She played in pristine whites, as required, but also in knee-high white socks. At least she did not wear the faux baseball shoes that she sported elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Bencic, who will play Victoria Azarenka in the fourth round, has long been tipped to break through into the top tier, having won junior titles at the French and Wimbledon in 2013. She also enjoys the benefit of being jointly coached by Martina Hingis’s mother, Melanie Molitor.</p> \n<p>Her rise has prompted comment about her strengths and that of Swiss tennis.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know why we have so many good players,” she said recently. “Maybe it’s in the chocolate or something.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435950934203/21770684-3d14-4a5a-89b5-2127351dcade-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alastair Grant/AP","altText":"Belinda Bencic","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T19:17:31Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T19:59:28Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":9,"contributors":[{"name":"Hugh Muir","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733739000/HughMuir.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/hughmuir"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Wimbledon 2015","Tennis","Wimbledon","Sport","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Hugh Muir","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/hughmuir"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/03/bethanie-mattek-sands-belinda-bencic","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4acdd","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/03/bethanie-mattek-sands-belinda-bencic","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/03/bethanie-mattek-sands-belinda-bencic"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435950934203/21770684-3d14-4a5a-89b5-2127351dcade-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Belinda Bencic sends a volley past Bethanie Mattek-Sands during her third-round win at Wimbledon.
