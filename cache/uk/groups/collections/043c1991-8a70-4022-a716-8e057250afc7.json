After losing a set, the pair saw off Israel’s Jonathan Erlich and the German Philipp Petzschner 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. At least one Murray will contest a Wimbledon final.</p> \n<p>It was a victory hard won. There were tight early skirmishes, with each duo holding serve until the seventh game when Murray lost his serve to give their opponents a 4-3 lead. Both held again but the single break allowed Petzschner to serve out the set after just half an hour.</p> \n<p>Murray and Peers started the second set more combatively and broke Petzschner’s serve to take a 2-0 lead. Serving in the third game, the Scot showed great athleticism, chasing down and angling an acute forehand winner and fending off two break points to hold and take a 3-0 lead. He was cheered but nothing he would do could eclipse the ovation given to the member of the crowd who caught a ball when it flew into the Royal Box. But then Jamie Murray, for all his talents, is not David Beckham.</p> \n<p>Still, Murray and Peers had the momentum and after almost an hour’s play, his serve stretched the advantage to 5-2. His opponents won the best point of the set; a quickfire duel which saw all four players lunging for volleys at the net and Petzschner winning the point before falling flat on his back. But Peers held to level the match at a set apiece.</p> \n<p>The third set was immediately more competitive with each man comfortably holding serve until the fourth game when Murray was taken to deuce. He survived after Erlich left a forehand from the Scot, thinking it was going long, only to see it drop two inches inside the line. The exchanges were tight.</p> \n<p>At one point a frustrated Murray threw his racket on to the grass. And yet he was fired up with good reason. In the ninth game, at 4-4, pressure from Murray and Peers paid off and they secured a break. Serving crisply, Peers held and the pair took the third set.</p> \n<p>They took the initiative into the fourth set by breaking Petzschner’s serve at the outset and inflicting the same pain on the German in the fifth game to go 4-1 up. Petzschner and Erlich sought a way back with a barrage of ground strokes but found Murray and Peers impregnable.</p> \n<p>Erlich held his serve, leaving Murray to serve the final game, which he began with an 112mph ace. Peers sealed the win with a crisp volley at the net.</p> \n<p>Murray, 29 and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2007/jun/30/tennis.wimbledon5\" title=\"\">winner of the mixed doubles in 2007 with Jelena Jankovic</a>, attributed much of his success this year in the men’s competition to the fanaticism of the Wimbledon crowd.</p> \n<p>As a Brit and a Murray, he has a certain following. Add in the boisterous advocacy of Peers by the hardcore Australian supporters – the Fanatics – and the pair can rely on a substantial headwind.</p> \n<p>Both are now guaranteed a share of &pound;170,000 with the prospect of double that if they win on Saturday. And beyond the guaranteed spoils, a chance for glory. Murray senior – Jamie – may well join Murray minor in the Great Britain Davis Cup team to play France at Queen’s Club next weekend. And afterwards he said he will spend Friday practising for his own final rather than <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/09/andy-murray-roger-federer-wimbledon-semi-final\" title=\"\">watching Andy battle his own semi-final against Roger Federer</a>. “We have to focus on our own match,” he said. “I will watch it on TV, that will be more relaxing. He is going to have to play a lot of great tennis over the last few days to lift the trophy again but he is full of confidence and has a great chance.”</p> \n<p>He spoke of life as a doubles grand slam champion yet still in his younger brother’s shadow. “People talk to me because they want to talk about Andy, but we are doing great things ourselves. All the hard work we have put in has paid off.”</p> \n<p>Murray said he and Peers were acutely aware that on the other side of the net, Erlich was struggling with a knee injury. “He was kind of on one leg at one point. I took some time to get into it but we always felt that we would find a way.”</p> \n<p>The victory vindicates his decision to work through a period during which he had no regular partner and his enjoyment of the doubles circuit dipped. “It wasn’t much fun for me and I wasn’t enjoying it but the opportunity came to do something with John and it has worked out.”The pair will play the Dutchman Jean-Julien Rojer and Romania’s Horia Tecau, who overcame Rohan Bopanna and Florin Mergea in five sets on Court Two, in the final.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/9/1436470934271/Jamie-Murray-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jamie Murray, right, celebrates a point while his opponent, John Erlich looks on, during Murray and John Peers' win in their Wimbledon semi-final on Thursday.

As she smashed a forehand winner to take the match 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, she dropped her racquet, put her hands to her face, and collapsed face first onto the grass. “I don’t have words to explain it,” she said moments later, flashing her characteristic dimpled smile. “I worked all my life to achieve this moment.”</p> \n<p>Tracy Austin, commentating for the BBC, was clear about the significance of the victory, saying: “A star is born in women’s tennis.”</p> \n<p>But though she is ranked number 20 in the world and has twice reached the quarter finals of Roland Garros – beating Serena Williams last year - it almost seems success has come sooner than even the immensely likeable Spaniard expected.</p> \n<p>Asked in her post-match press conference to explain her second set wobble, when she let her Polish opponent back into the match to win six games in a row, she giggled and said: “Well, I think I was 6-2, 3-1 [up]. I was like, what?” </p> \n<p>Muguruza has dual nationality, having been born in Venezuela to a Spanish-Basque father and Venezuelan mother. The family moved to Barcelona when she was a young child, and she rarely visits the South American country. </p> \n<p>It was a dilemma, all the same, when she was forced last year to choose which country to represent: “My family, half is in Spain and half is in Venezuela. Someone’s going to hate me so I don’t want to choose.” She opted, however, for Spain.</p> \n<p>In her spare time she watches tennis and loves to cook - “sweet things, with sugar, not with salt. I know it’s not good for me, but it’s how I like to spend time.”</p> \n<p>Having not expected to do well on her least favourite surface, the player told her parents not to watch her play in London. “They [said to] me two days ago, ‘We want to come.’ I said, ‘No! Don’t change anything!’” She had been brushing her teeth the same way and getting out of bed using the same leg, she laughed, so as not to jinx her unexpected run.</p> \n<p>But would they be coming on Saturday to watch her take on Williams, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/09/serena-williams-maria-sharapova-wimbledon-2015-live-tennis\">who defeated Maria Sharapova in the other semi-final</a>?

This week, Katie Swan – just 16 and the fifth-ranked girl in the world – experienced both. A happy journey to the quarter-finals that saw an expectant crowd screaming her support on No3 Court. And then, the anguish of crashing out in straight sets without giving the desired account of herself.</p> \n<p>The right-hander, who finished <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jan/30/katie-swan-australian-open-girls-final-dalma-galfi\" title=\"\">runner-up in the junior Australian Open</a> in January and won a Wimbledon women’s qualifier last month, stepped into her big match against the Slovakian, Viktoria Kuzmova, ranked 493, with a reputation as a player with a big serve and heavy forehand. But on the brink of her biggest achievement so far, she found herself unable to fully deploy either.</p> \n<p>An injury saw her underhitting drives and serves and clutching her abdomen. She sought salvation in a nine-minute medical timeout, but still could not retrieve the situation.</p> \n<p>Seeing her discomfort, Kuzmova grew in confidence and authority. Tennis can be cruel. The first set ended 7-6 after a tie-break the Slovakian won 7-2. The next she took 6-0.</p> \n<p>There was no indication at the outset that such a denouement was likely. Swan dropped her opening serve, but also did so in the previous round when she beat the American, Sofia Kenin. Kuzmova seemed the more aggressive. She failed to take any of four break points in the third game. But thereafter they settled into a pattern, with Swan stronger on serve and Kuzmova probing the Briton’s backhand. They matched each other until the tiebreak when Swan’s challenge fell away.</p> \n<p>She came out briskly, keen to impose herself and grabbed a break point in Kuzmova’s first service game but could not take it. The lapse was costly as Swan lost her own serve soon after. The Slovakian cemented the break to go 3-0 up, at which point Swan left for medical assistance.</p> \n<p>A supportive roar greeted her return to Court Three but she was a pale shadow at the resumption and the set – peppered with her errors and painful grimaces – was gone in 18 minutes. She left a sad figure. But she will have better days.</p> \n<p>Like Andy Murray and Heather Watson before her, Swan – from Bristol – has ventured abroad to plot this crucial stage in her development. She moved to Wichita, Kansas, last year where her father works and she trains at the local state university.</p> \n<p>But then her potential was also spotted abroad. Aged seven and on a family holiday, she took tennis lessons as a diversion. The coach was a Portuguese former professional.</p> \n<p>“He told us: ‘She’s going to be a professional tennis player,’” recalled her mother, Nicki, recently, a pronouncement the family found “hilarious”.</p> \n<p>Still the coach was unrepentant, and finally the family took him at his word. “We gave her proper lessons,” her mother recalled. “It went from there.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/9/1436480946908/Katie-Swan-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Britain's Katie Swan serves in her Girls Singles match against Viktoria Kuzmova of Slovakia.

For a man who has spent a large chunk of his career inside the top 20, and been as high as No7, that may sound harsh. But his record of one win in 12 meetings with the world No 1, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2007/nov/13/tennis.simonburnton\" title=\"\">back in 2007</a>, and just one set to his name since that victory, means Gasquet knows that he is the underdog. And that is how he likes it.</p> \n<p>It is 10 years since an 18-year-old Gasquet shot to prominence when he beat Roger Federer in Monte Carlo. A prodigiously gifted junior, he had long been tipped for the top and with his one-handed backhand one of the most elegant, effective strokes in the game, he seemed set for big things. A semi-final appearance here in 2007 promised much but eight years on, Friday’s match is his third grand slam semi-final. His other semi-final was in the 2013 US Open, when he lost to Rafael Nadal. His ability has never been in question and his backhand is a thing of beauty, able to create pace, spin and angles that few others can match.</p> \n<p>Slighter of build than players such as Nadal, his physical strength has been the subject of some criticism, and at the crucial moments in big matches he has often been found wanting. Handling the pressure has never been considered his forte but the way he coped with the final set of his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/wimbledon-2015-richard-gasquet-stan-wawrinka\" title=\"\">quarter-final with Stan Wawrinka</a>, when he failed to serve out at 5-3 in the fifth but won it 11-9, bodes well. At 29, the road to this point has been a long one and despite his woeful record against Djokovic, he wants to relish it.</p> \n<p>“Novak is the favourite,” said Gasquet, who described himself as “the worst” of the four semi-finalists. “Everybody knows that. But I want to take my chance and we will see what will happen. I want to play a big game, try to be very aggressive. I want to enjoy it. It’s important for me to think I can win this match. That’s the most important thing, to go on the court and think you can win, it’s something I need to do on my mental part, to be there to win.”</p> \n<p>When he was in the semi-finals in 2007, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2007/jul/07/tennis.wimbledon10\" title=\"\">Gasquet was easily beaten by Federer</a>. That experience, he hopes, will stand him in good stead. “I’m 29 now,” he said. “I was 21. I have more experience. I know what it means to be in the semis. It’s a long time I didn’t do it.”</p> \n<p>Djokovic, who <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/jul/03/novak-djokovic-rafael-nadal-wimbledon-final\" title=\"\">won here in 2011</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/06/novak-djokovic-wins-wimbledon-title-roger-federer\" title=\"\">last summer</a>, looks strong again as he tries to bounce back from his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/06/novak-djokovic-stan-wawrinka-french-open-final\" title=\"\">defeat by Stan Wawrinka in the French Open final</a>, just as he did 12 months ago, recovering from defeat to Nadal in Paris. “Definitely it wasn’t easy to digest this loss in the finals against Stan,” he said. “I thought it was a great chance for me to win Roland Garros for the first time. But you’ve got to keep going. If there’s one thing I learnt from tennis it is the fact you have to recover so quickly. Try to use these losses, these particular experiences, as a way of getting stronger, encouraging yourself to be better. Last year was a pretty similar situation. I lost another close Roland Garros final against Rafa. Came here, won the title.</p> \n<p>“I try not to take things for granted. I worked very hard to get myself in position to fight for the big trophies. I want to keep on going.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/9/1436463270985/Richard-Gasquet-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Richard Gasquet held his nerve to win 11-9 in the final set against Stan Wawrinka in their Wimbledon quarter-final.

He’s hitting his spots, he’s serving well, first serve, serve and volley, he’s mixing second serves, serve and volley. Everything is built around a strong first-serve percentage for him. That’s really the most important thing in the match. Every part of Roger’s game is better when he’s serving well. It allows Roger to do other things. Even the return game is better because he’s not under pressure. I think his average first serve percentage over his career is about 63%. It feels like it has to be more here, maybe about 67%. If he hits that average there’s not much Andy Murray can do.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/09/andy-murray-roger-federer-wimbledon-semi-final\">Mature Andy Murray in form of his life to face Roger Federer at Wimbledon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>The Murray second serve<br /></h2> \n<p>Roger should attack the Murray second serve, for sure. He makes more errors off his forehand return but he wins more points overall off it. He puts a ton of backhands back into play but he doesn’t win quite as many. Andy has to figure out where to go. On the deuce court, on the first serve, he’s got to go wide, pull him off the court, open up a hole. Two or three times a set Roger will chip and charge and come in off the return – and he likes to do it on the deuce court, down the line on the backhand – so Andy’s got to try to jam him a bit to the forehand. Mixing second serves to the forehand will be vital because if Roger gets in a rhythm with that serve coming to the backhand he’ll start to come over it with topspin.</p> \n<h2>How Murray deals with Federer coming to the net<br /></h2> \n<p>Roger just grows another leg up there, he really does. So anything Andy can do to stop him coming in will help. The thing Andy’s got to have an awareness of is how good is Roger going to be at the net? Roger’s going to come in on first serves, on second serves, on returns, with a regular approach, and he’s probably going to hit a drop shot and come in. So there are five ways he will come in and Andy’s got to have an awareness of which one’s working better on the day and try to have a plan to shut that down. Using the lob is a great idea for Andy. Roger can close in tight on the net and I’ve seen him miss quite a few overheads going back. You try to put it over the backhand if you can but for sure that’s a good idea.</p> \n<h2>The Murray forehand on the run<br /></h2> \n<p>I did some analysis of four matches between them and Andy made something like 67 errors when he was running from the ad[vantage] court to the forehand out wide, about 15 in the middle and only a few on the backhand. It used to be that you’d just get him on the run; it’s now a strength – I’ve hardly seen him miss it. Every time I’ve seen him on defence there, he’s flicked it across, and that corner to corner, I believe, is four and a half feet longer than down the line, so when he’s on defence he’s going right at that corner, where he’s got more room to land that.</p> \n<h2>Who deals with the occasion better on the day<br /></h2> \n<p>I don’t remember Andy <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/09/andy-murray-roger-federer-wimbledon-semi-final\" title=\"\">playing better than this</a>, and I don’t remember Roger playing better than this either – both guys are really at the absolute peak of their game. Roger’s not framing the ball, he’s hitting it clean. Andy’s hitting it harder. Both have improved. It’s going to be remarkable to see who blinks, to see who gets nervous. We always say it’s going to come down to a few points but it could come down to one point. It’s a crackerjack match. With Roger, all his strengths are on the serving side. For Andy, all his are on the returning side.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436461132646/Andy-Murray-and-Roger-Fed-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray and Roger Federer face off in the Wimbledon men's semi-final for the chance to face Novak Djokovic or Richard Gasquet.
