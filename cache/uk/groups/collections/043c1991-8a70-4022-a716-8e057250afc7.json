At least it won’t be dull","standFirst":"Nick Kyrgios’s arrogance and tantrums have proved a big turn-off, but in time he can challenge the best. At least it won’t be dull","byline":"Kevin Mitchell at Wimbledon","body":"<p>Apparently, there are only five things you need to do to win Wimbledon, Nick Kyrgios: beat Richard Gasquet, Stan Wawrinka, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray – and, as one of your compatriots sitting courtside said the other day, “pull your head in”.</p> \n<p>The growing perception that the strong-minded young Australian from his country’s most boring city, Canberra, is in danger of becoming “a bit of a tool” – as a columnist in the Sydney Morning Herald put it so delicately the other day – might be harsh, but it is not going to go away. Mud sticks.</p> \n<p>An Australian television station canvassed views among British tennis writers in the first week and it was clear that Kyrgios, after barely a year in the unforgiving glare of a sometimes brutal media examination, has divided opinion from Melbourne to London. Those craving “a character”, someone to market, to save tennis from descending into post-Federer-Murray-Nadal-Djokovic boredom, can’t get enough of his freewheeling antics and exuberant tennis. Others – older and stuffier in his youthful reckoning, probably – who remember the dignity that Rod Laver and his generation brought to the game think he is, well, see above.</p> \n<p>I would like to have a bit each-way on him coming through this – but maybe not for a year or two. He’s still struggling with his celebrity, whatever he might think to the contrary, in his laid-back, knowing way.</p> \n<p>When Kyrgios drawls “Nah” to the question of whether or not he cares what people think about him, it does not ring true. He might be rich and getting richer ($1.36m in three years on the Tour), he might be the star turn in the locker room, he might even win this Wimbledon, but the advice from the stands during a match last week to basically get on with it and stop complaining disturbed him. “I didn’t find it funny,” he told us later.</p> \n<p>So he is not as impassive to criticism as his drooped eyelids and air of indifference in front of reporters that night might have suggested – at least not to his friends, among them the American Jack Sock, who was standing at the back of the room, swapping knowing smirks.</p> \n<p>A lot of the players like Kyrgios. Murray is an admirer. Roger Federer has hit with him. Wawrinka, who chased him in vain all summer to share a practice court, likes his cheek. Stan thinks Nick loves to wind up the press. There is no harm in that – if you can take it, as well.</p> \n<p>Everyone would like to cut the kid a bit of slack. He is, after all, a special talent. If fit, he can beat Gasquet in the fourth round. He might take Wawrinka, the French Open champion who looks as strong as a bull after three matches, to a fourth or fifth set. He will not beat Djokovic – and nor would he beat Murray in the final.</p> \n<p>But one day he could. Those fine players are in their late 20s and early 30s, and Kyrgios left his teenagehood behind him only three months ago – which will come as no surprise to anyone who has endured his often withering sarcasm.</p> \n<p>Some critics have compared him to one of his biggest fans, John McEnroe, but that is misleading. Superbrat could be sullen on and off the court.</p> \n<p>When Kyrgios has a racket in his hand he is at his happiest, “having fun” as he has repeatedly described it, and he is a joy to watch: eccentric, courageous in the shot, inventive and – when not being appallingly rude to officials – entertaining fans with the sort of easy banter you would hear in a park or on a beach, but rarely in the down-to-business surroundings of Centre Court.</p> \n<p>He is also capable of perceptive analysis of his sport – when he can be bothered to answer questions about it. The players he admires are the showmen who express themselves on court, particularly Ga&euml;l Monfils, who wears his genius far more lightly. Maybe he should have a chat with the Frenchman.</p> \n<p>Back in the boring grown-up world, Djokovic remains favourite to win here. The defending champion has had fewer anxious moments than either Murray or Federer, his main rivals alongside Wawrinka, who he will probably meet in the semi-finals, and is disturbingly relaxed, usually a sign that his mind and body are in sync – and that is not always the case.</p> \n<p>And, if Djokovic were to play Kyrgios in the semi-finals? For as long as it lasted, it would not be dull.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436121316021/Australias-Nick-Kyrgios-d-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Australia's Nick Kyrgios during his third-round defeat of Canada's Milos Raonic at the 2015 Wimbledon Championships.

On Monday the sisters will meet at Wimbledon once more, this time in the fourth round, and it is Serena who has everything to lose.</p> \n<p>It would be a strange turn of events if the younger sister’s hopes of completing her second “Serena slam” of four consecutive majors were to be ended by Venus. In 2002-03, when Serena won the French Open, Wimbledon, US Open and finally the Australian Open the following January to achieve the feat for the first time, it was Venus who was on the receiving end in all four finals. At 35, the odds are against the older sibling doing it but she will take heart from the fact that she won their last meeting, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/aug/10/serena-williams-venus-williams-rogers-cup\" title=\"\">in Montreal last year</a>, and the pressure, undoubtedly, is on the world No1.</p> \n<p>Four years ago Venus announced that she had been <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/sep/01/venus-williams-illness-us-open\" title=\"\">diagnosed with Sjogren’s syndrome</a>, an incurable auto-immune disease that leaves her short of energy and causes joint pain. Many medical experts thought she would struggle to play again, at least at the highest level, but the five-times Wimbledon champion has managed the illness incredibly well, climbing back up the rankings to be seeded 16 this year and playing some impressive tennis, reaching the fourth round without dropping a set.</p> \n<p>In the interim, Serena has dominated the Tour, winning seven grand slams in the past three years, ever since she <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2012/jul/06/serena-williams-secret-weapon-wimbledon\" title=\"\">teamed up with Patrick Mouratoglou just before Wimbledon in 2012</a>. It is a partnership that has made her more consistent than ever, yielding 28 of her 67 titles, taking her grand slam tally to 20 and putting her halfway to the calendar year grand slam, something only three women have achieved.</p> \n<p>But this will be the first time Mouratoglou has had to prepare Serena to face Venus in a grand slam and the Frenchman knows it’s going to be a tough match, especially after the top seed came <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/heather-watson-wimbledon-2015-serena-williams\" title=\"\">within two points of losing to Britain’s Heather Watson</a> in the previous round. “It’s always special for Serena to play her sister,” Mouratoglou said. “It’s never easy to find the aggressivity and what she needs to do. I’ll try to help her get that because in this special situation it’s pretty difficult.”</p> \n<p>The stats are in Serena’s favour: she leads 7-5 in grand slam meetings, 3-2 at Wimbledon and 14-11 overall, including five of the past six. But against Watson the American looked tense and almost paid the price. At the French Open last month, Williams managed to win five of her seven matches in three sets, often recovering from a set down to do so; here, Mouratoglou feels she’s playing better, even if Watson almost pulled off a mighty shock.</p> \n<p>“That was much closer than all the matches in Paris, where she was playing so bad, so she could only do better, suddenly she was clicking and then she was winning easily,” he said. “She did a few things wrong [against Watson] but she didn’t play badly. To a certain point, she didn’t really need to know what to do, because she couldn’t hit winners any more, she was forcing, she was trying to play closer to the lines and making too many unforced errors.</p> \n<p>“But I think she’s much better than in Paris. I think she’s played better tennis, she started matches well, except the first round. She’s there, I know. She lost her calmness [against Watson] but the match was really, really difficult for her, with the atmosphere and with Heather playing so well. In a way Heather took her out of her calmness and her game so she has all the credit. But she won, as she does, not always, but most of the time.”</p> \n<p>After scraping past Watson, Serena said Venus was the favourite for their match and her state of mind was evident when she said: “I’m not answering any more questions about the grand slam or the alleged Serena slam.” Don’t believe a word of it. She is intent on history.</p> \n<p>In Serena’s half of the draw, Maria Sharapova continues her title quest against Zarina Diyas of Kazakhstan but <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/petra-kvitovas-wimbledon-defence-ended-by-inspired-jelena-jankovic\" title=\"\">the defeat of the defending champion, Petra Kvitova</a>, on Saturday means the bottom half of the draw is wide open, leaving opportunities for players such as Agnieszka Radwanska, the 2012 runner‑up, who plays Kvitova’s conqueror, Jelena Jankovic.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436109672441/World-No1-Serena-Williams-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"World No1 Serena Williams was far from perfect in coming back to beat Heather Watson, whereas her sister Venus is yet to drop a set this Wimbledon.

The three-time champion suggested that the rules needed to be changed to make it more exciting. He’d start by removing line judges and have the players decide when the ball was in or out. An umpire and Hawk-Eye would settle the most contentious disagreements. Then McEnroe would ban on-court microphones so that opponents could yell at each other without fearing a fine.</p> \n<p>“The players need to be able to feel that they can express themselves,” McEnroe reasoned. “I’m sure on the soccer pitch, they’re not saying, ‘Hello, how are you?’ Or on the rugby field. Is it really different in tennis? Should it be treated differently?”</p> \n<p>McEnroe is correct that real characters have become an endangered species in tennis, but the first week at Wimbledon 2015 has been enlivened by some authentically offbeat performers. On the men’s side, the 20-year-old Australian wonderkid Nick Kyrgios is through to the fourth round and enthusiastically justifying his nickname, the Wild Thing. Dustin Brown, a German-Jamaican journeyman, provided some of the most intoxicating moments of the tournament <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/dustin-brown-rafael-nadal-wimbledon\">in beating Rafael Nadal </a>with a mix of old-school serve-and-volley and outrageous invented shots.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d349d48e6e98af8c91cd63eca9675b09934c0553\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436021642570/7d1b9fe8-42d3-4a84-aadf-62134a46c3ec-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nick Kyrgios \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Kyrgios has won John McEnroe’s seal of approval.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tang Shi/Xinhua Press/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the women’s draw, Bethanie Mattek-Sands, the world No 158, upset the seventh seed, Ana Ivanovic. Until now, Mattek-Sands has mostly been known for her novelty sartorial choices, which have included cowboy hats, pink knee socks and chandelier earrings. She also has an extravagant tattoo of lilies running down her right bicep. A yellow dress made from tennis balls that she wore to a pre-Wimbledon party in 2011 led to a description of her that has stuck: “the Lady Gaga of tennis”.</p> \n<p>These are certainly not the usual suspects, and they have lit up a phase of the tournament typically dominated by ceremonial drubbings for lower-ranked players. Of the breakout performers, the one with the greatest potential is Kyrgios, the 26th seed, perhaps the most eccentric player to reach the highest levels of tennis since the 1980s. McEnroe has anointed him as the current player most like himself and Kyrgios, perhaps accepting the mantle, has even taken to competing in a throwback towelling headband.</p> \n<p>At Wimbledon, Kyrgios, an Australian with Greek-Malaysian roots, has done McEnroe proud. In a perfunctory first-round victory, he shouted “dirty scum”, an insult that he insisted was self-admonishment and not directed at officials (the All England Club agreed). In the next round, he took umbrage when a line judge reported him to the umpire for swearing. When the umpire refused to be drawn on the exact nature of their conversation, Kyrgios barked, “Does it feel good to be in the chair up there? Do you feel strong up there?”</p> \n<p>So far, so charmless, but Kyrgios does have his winning moments. He plays explosive, high-wire tennis accompanied by a stream-of-consciousness commentary. In his third-round clash on Friday against Milos Raonic, the No 7 seed, Kyrgios had a prolonged back-and-forth with a stranger in the crowd wearing a Batman T-shirt, which he claimed was key to his victory. He tried impossible trick shots (didn’t work), stood next to a ballboy to receive serve (didn’t work either) and threw his racket down so violently that it bounced up and landed five rows back in the first tier of the stands. But, like McEnroe, every outburst and stunt made him more focused and, in turn, discombobulated the hapless Raonic.</p> \n<p>Asked afterwards if tennis had become too conformist, Kyrgios replied, “I guess so. I’m not the biggest believer in saying nothing out there or being a robot. I feel you should express yourself. You know, it’s a sport.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97ee434a592c8851bd9558aa2376799223943a1b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436021839702/0711142f-9a16-4de2-9d6e-decd1d3f37d3-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Bethanie Mattek-Sands arrives on court at Wimbledon in 2011 in a tasselled jacket covered with tennis balls\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bethanie Mattek-Sands arrives on court at Wimbledon in 2011 in an (all-white) tasselled jacket covered with tennis balls.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Dempsey/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>McEnroe’s also a fan of Brown, the world No 102, describing his win against Nadal as one of the all-time great performances by a lower-ranked player. (He was unable to rediscover the magic on Saturday and lost in four sets to Viktor Troicki.) A 30-year-old with thick cables of dreadlocks down his spine, Brown was born in Germany but played his formative tennis in Jamaica. When he returned to Europe, he travelled round tournaments in a VW campervan – though one with three rooms and a bathroom, he notes defensively – and strung other players’ rackets for pocket money.</p> \n<p>After tactically dismantling Nadal on Thursday, it was suggested to Brown that it must be a relief to talk about his tennis, not just his hair or his unusual backstory. “I am the way I am,” he replied. “Obviously it’s great that people appreciate it. But on the other side, if I would worry too much about what people think, then I wouldn’t have the hair and definitely wouldn’t look the way I look.”</p> \n<p>Brown looked out at the press corps: overwhelmingly white and middle-aged. “It’s difficult when people ask me that about myself because for me it’s normal,” he said. “I could be sitting here and saying, ‘Why are you guys all different?’”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/04/bbc-wimbledon-2day-clare-balding-gatsby-club\">Clare Balding and guests endure a wild week on BBC’s Wimbledon 2day | Emma John</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For Mattek-Sands, a 30-year-old American, the conversation – even at pristine, all-white Wimbledon – has again been dominated by clothing.

The disappointment of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/03/heather-watson-serena-williams-wimbledon\" title=\"\">being so close to beating the great Serena Williams</a> will take a while to disappear but the 23-year-old will resolve to dig in, kick on and achieve her goal of being one of the world’s best players.</p> \n<p>The Briton’s run to the third round will take her back into the top 50 and the way she played against the world No1 has convinced her that she can go much higher. A top-25 place is her target by the end of the year and to do that she will need to show the same kind of focus and determination in the smaller events as she did on the biggest stage of all.</p> \n<p>That is not an easy task. Raising your game on Centre Court with the entire crowd lifting you is one thing, but doing it when one man and his dog are in the stands is another altogether.</p> \n<p>Williams’s coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, said she had every reason to hold her head high. “She played an incredible match,” he told the <em>Observer</em>. “I looked at her stats at one set all and 3-0 and she’d made four unforced errors. In two and a half sets against Serena, that’s not too bad. If she played like that against any player she would have a good chance to win against almost everybody because she doesn’t miss, she brings all the balls back. When Serena tried to slow down, she attacked and she did well.”</p> \n<p>Mouratoglou, who has helped Williams to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/serena-williams-french-open-champions-2015-patrick-mouratoglou\" title=\"\">seven grand slam titles in 12 events since they joined forces</a>, issued a word of caution to the chorus who say she can only take confidence from going so close against arguably the greatest player the women’s game has ever seen. “I don’t know how much confidence you get from a loss, whoever it is against,” the Frenchman said. “It’s still a loss. She was so close to winning it, probably one or two points would have made the difference, but she lost.”</p> \n<p>Britain’s Jo Durie, a former world No5 who made the semi-finals of the French and US Opens in 1983 and the Wimbledon quarter-finals a year later, told the <em>Observer</em> it was now that the really hard work would begin if Watson is to get to where she wants to be. “She should take a lot of confidence from it but in her next tournament, I presume in America somewhere, on court six or something with a few people watching, is it going to be the same?” she said. “That’s what you have to take with you and understand that the top players are doing it time and time again, consistently. It’s about moving on again.”</p> \n<p>Watson was beaten in the women’s doubles on Saturday, going down 7-6 (7-2), 3-6, 6-0 with Marina Erakovic of New Zealand to Spain’s Anabel Medina Garrigues and Arantxa Parra Santonja.</p> \n<p>Watson will play four tournaments this summer in the buildup to the US Open, starting in Washington in the first week of August. Good performances should propel her towards her ranking goal and Durie said she cannot let up. “She won’t ever have the weapons [of the bigger hitters] so she has to play her way, which is getting a lot of balls back and then counterattacking. Then she’s got to keep it going, because [the tour] is relentless.</p> \n<p>“If she wants to get [into the] top 20, then it has to be week after week after week. No first-round losses and being out of it, you have to keep that standard going. It’s not easy at all, but what do you want?”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436035311918/Heather-Watson-certainly--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Heather Watson certainly benefited from an intense partisan crowd on Centre Court but how she fares away from the spotlight will dictate her world ranking.

He returned to the fray untroubled in his movement and won six games in a row over the next half-hour, breaking Murray twice to take the set.</p> \n<p>Asked afterwards if he knew how Seppi’s leg was, Murray said: “I don’t know what his problem was … I was having a few issues with my serve. Then when he took the injury timeout, I came out and I was stiffer.”</p> \n<p>Murray’s mood, buoyant in the first hour, changed dramatically. He received attention courtside on his right shoulder after being broken again at the start of the fourth. Was it retaliation for Seppi’s timely break? Nobody could be sure. Tennis has become a psychological as well as physical jungle and there are swamps at every turn.</p> \n<p>Not for the first time, Murray seemed perturbed when his opponent wobbled physically, then came back hard at him to stop his momentum. But, unlike his losses to Djokovic in the final in Melbourne and the semi-final at Roland Garros, he drew inspiration from the interruption. He fist-pumped and cajoled himself into action, moving with urgency and purpose between points in the fourth set, impatient to get back into the game.</p> \n<p>In the fourth set, Murray broke him almost at will, angry but focused, and served the match out in fading light to the delight of the packed arena.</p> \n<p>Seppi, an accomplished 31-year-old from northern Italy and his country’s best player, had taken just two sets off Murray in seven matches, nine years ago on the grass of Nottingham. His slam form this year has fluctuated: he beat Federer in the third round in Melbourne (his first win in a major over a top-tenner) but John Isner took him out in straight sets in the first round at Roland Garros. Ever so briefly, though, he looked as if he might spring a significant upset.</p> \n<p>Murray is into the second week of his home tournament for the ninth time in 10 visits. But it was a close-run thing.</p> \n<p>Whatever his views on timeouts – and he was diplomatic afterwards, while stating that his was the first one he had taken this year – the Scot was confident his shoulder was not going to cause too many problems. “It’s something I had the last two, three days. And, yeah, I mean, I only really feel it when I’m serving. But it’s not something that’s of major concern to me.”</p> \n<p>Looking down on Murray’s performance from the royal box on a warm and pleasant Saturday evening – alongside Gary Lineker and the England rugby union captain, Chris Robshaw – was Boris Becker, esteemed here as the youngest champion 30 years ago and now the mentor of the defending champion, Djokovic. He will have noted the ups and the downs.</p> \n<p>Murray’s next obstacle, in the fourth round on Monday, is bigger in every way: the 6ft 10in Ivo Karlovic, who earlier on Saturday became the first player in the recorded history of the game to hit 40-plus aces in three consecutive matches and, at 36, seems only to be getting better.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/roger-federer-sam-groth-wimbledon\">Roger Federer stutters but proves too good for Sam Groth at Wimbledon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Karlovic goes into the match with some hard miles on the clock, and surely the weariest right arm in the tournament. He took two hours and 50 minutes and three tie-breaks to beat the 13th seed, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (11-9) on No3 Court, adding 41 aces to the 53 he struck in beating Alexandr Dolgopolov and the 42 in the first round against the Swedish qualifier Elias Ymer.</p> \n<p>But his extraordinarily long legs covered 1,924 metres against the artful Frenchman and he will start to properly feel the strain if Murray keeps him on the end of his nagging ground strokes.</p> \n<p>The Croat took his tournament tally to 136 to stay well on top of the leaderboard for free points. Although he has not beaten Murray in five attempts and last played him here in 2012, he will be tough to beat.</p> \n<p>“It will be a very different match from today,” Murray said. “Ivo will be coming to the net a lot. Returns are going to have to be on.”</p> \n<p>Beyond Karlovic lies either Viktor Troicki, whom he tamed in the semi-finals at Queens, or Vasek Pospisil, the Canadian who took five sets to beat James Ward. If the form guide holds, Federer will be waiting for him in the semi-finals.</p> \n<p>For now, Murray has time to rest and gauge the battle ahead. In a way, Seppi did him a favour. He turned on a switch to his elemental beast – and it roared with astonishing ferocity at the conclusion of a performance that will serve the world No3 well in harder assignments to come.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436038480008/Andy-Murray-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray celebrates breaking Andreas Seppi's serve in the fourth set en route to a 6-2, 6-2, 1-6, 6-1 win in the third round at Wimbledon.

But these days, being a home fan at the championships requires a greater level of nuance.</p> \n<p>It was hard for the Centre Court crowd to know where they stood at 8pm on Saturday. Their hero, who had cruised so easily past Robin Haase in his previous match, was now proceeding equally smoothly against Andreas Seppi. There was no need for panic, or the mad encouragement they usually dish out to the home talent. A calm but earnest approval seemed the right tone to take.</p> \n<p>The hush of serious endeavour hung about the place. And when Murray got a challenge completely wrong in the second set, and the ball was shown on the big screen to be well within the line, they felt they could afford to laugh. He was 6-2 up, after all. For two sets, Centre Court was entirely devoid of the nerve-biting tension that has traditionally accompanied Murray’s Wimbledon appearances.</p> \n<p>A row of men in pink T-shirts spelling out “#MURY!” – the other “R” and “A” were presumably, still stuck in the queue – worked hard to start a Mexican wave, and were rewarded with the sight of the royal box joining in. Seppi took a medical time out. Then Murray lost the third set. In the royal box, Justin Rose looked concerned; Geoffrey Boycott looked as if he’d like to have words with someone. The crowd looked genuinely confused. Had they, like their hero, been guilty of complacency?</p> \n<p>Still, if there’s one thing the Wimbledon faithful thrive on, it’s jeopardy. An hour earlier, it had required James Ward to go a set down before the No1 Court crowd remembered its place and revved itself into the Englishman’s personal pep rally. Although, to be fair, the first set had been extremely dull. Murray has made great fun of his hitting partner’s love of Taylor Swift, and if you were picking one of her tracks to describe the opening of this match, it would have been Blank Space rather than Style.</p> \n<p>“C’mon James, just go for it,” yelled an avuncular voice, and Ward responded by winning the first three games of the second set in a row. The tennis was rarely scintillating – mostly, the pair bullied the ball back and forth from the baseline – but it made the odd unexpected thrill all the more enjoyable. There was a 20-stroke rally in which Ward launched a lob that threatened a passing Airbus; and a 30-stroke one that the crowd celebrated too early when he dispatched a forehand down the line. He took both points – each time, the crowd stood to applaud as if he’d just won the match itself.</p> \n<p>But there were plenty of mishits too, when Ward’s forehand went on the fritz. The crowd was obliged, by dint of its partisan nature, to respond sympathetically to these ugly shots, to “ooh” when they were hit thickly outside the lines, and to “aah” when they dribbled thinly into the net. The murmured sighs that escaped when a Ward return ballooned up in the air, with a rampant Vasek Pospisil primed to dispatch it, was the collective sound of parents watching their child trip over its shoelaces.</p> \n<p>Out on the hill the atmosphere remained relaxed rather than rapt, especially when Pospisil started taking control of the match. No one out there, among the scotch eggs and the cider, was living or dying with every point. It felt as if a Ward win was to be considered a bonus, rather than a desperate necessity. Poor Ward lost the fifth set 8-6. Mr Pospisil, why d’you have to be so mean?</p> \n<p>The hill gathered fresh interest when the screen switched to the Murray match. A few Scots pulled out the tartan caps they had been saving for the occasion. When things started going south, Murray double-faulted and kicked the ball away in anger. A Scottish voice yelled out in approval: “Get a bit sweary, Andy!”</p> \n<p>They knew what he needed. Back on Centre Court, it was as if someone had changed the battery – the place lit up with a new passion. Sudden bursts of noise now accompanied the close of every point and Murray responded with fire, his forehands whipping around the court with renewed speed. He opened his throat wide and roared, and the crowd roared back. He served an ace, and they roared again.</p> \n<p>The space itself seemed to warp and bend at the intensity. “I tried to use that positive energy on the court,” he said after his victory. “I finished the match how hopefully I can go on.” Murray was back to what he knew – and so was the crowd.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/4/1436044830285/Andy-Murray-fan-club-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"What Andy Murray's pink-clad fan club lacked in spelling prowess, they made up for in cheering him over the line.

That’s a big plus for him.”</p> \n<p>Not only does Kyrgios believe he can go all the way and join Newcombe, Pat Cash and Lleyton Hewitt as only the fourth Australian man in the professional era to lift trophy, the 20-year-old is vowing to deliver in style.</p> \n<p>“I feel you should express yourself. You know, it’s a sport,” Kyrgios said of his flashy, sometimes abrasive, on-court conduct that has polarised fans and challenged officialdom.</p> \n<p>The Canberra ace has an unabashed fan in three-time Wimbledon champion and former tennis superbrat John McEnroe. “This guy is one of the greatest talents in a long time, bursting with personality. Reminds me of 35 years ago,” McEnroe told the BBC after watching Kyrgios’s breathtaking four-set second-round triumph over world No.8 Milos Raonic.</p> \n<p>Newcombe is not as critical of the flamboyant youngster’s behaviour as some other tennis greats. “He’s a free spirit out there and that’s how he performs at his best,” said Newcombe. “I think he was having trouble for a set and a half playing against Milos because Milos gives you nothing.</p> \n<p>“I had the feeling that Nick had to try to create some sort of flow to get into the match and in the end he did exceptionally well.</p> \n<p>“The antics are a very small part of the whole package. If you look at the positive side of it, this kid’s got enormous talent. I think he’s only touching the edges of how good he can be.”</p> \n<p>But the former world No.1 would like to see Kyrgios tone down the language.</p> \n<p>“You can say things on court and you can leave out one or two of the swear words,” Newcombe said. “You don’t need to have the swear words because if everyone went around doing that, it’d be a problem. So there’s a couple of things here and there that he doesn’t need to do and the rest is fine.”</p> \n<p>Kyrgios will be meeting Gasquet for the first time since fighting off a grand slam-record nine match points and recovering from two sets to love down in the second round last year to topple the Frenchman.</p> \n<p>The victory catapulted the Australian to stardom and he backed up to beat Rafael Nadal to make the last eight of a major for the first time.</p> \n<p>After repeating the run at Melbourne Park, Kyrgios has a huge chance to make the quarter-finals once again in his quest to become the youngest men’s winner at the All England Club since Boris Becker in 1986.</p> \n<p>And tennis’s great entertainer plans to do it his way.</p> \n<p>“When I’m in that state of mind, when I feel relaxed and I’m playing around, I think that’s when I play my best tennis,” Kyrgios said. “I’m focusing, but at the same time I’m having fun.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a06abc73ad9c09fdb0ee375137098c53b74b3c8e/0_84_2912_1748/2912.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1748,"width":2912,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ella Ling/BPI/REX Shutterstock/Ella Ling/BPI/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Nick Kyrgios","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ella Ling/BPI/REX Shutterstock/Ella Ling/BPI/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-05T05:43:56Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T05:43:57Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":26,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Wimbledon","Wimbledon 2015","Tennis","Sport","Australia sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/wimbledon-nick-kyrgios-title-threat-warns-former-champion-newcombe","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4acm5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/05/wimbledon-nick-kyrgios-title-threat-warns-former-champion-newcombe","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/05/wimbledon-nick-kyrgios-title-threat-warns-former-champion-newcombe"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a06abc73ad9c09fdb0ee375137098c53b74b3c8e/0_84_2912_1748/2912.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1748,"width":2912,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"If there’s one thing that can never be overlooked in sport, it’s momentum, says John Newcombe.
