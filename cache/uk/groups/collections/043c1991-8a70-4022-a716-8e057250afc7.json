I think he must relax and try to do something good.”</p> \n<p>Indeed he must, probably over five sets, and their respective and mutual histories do not suggest that is likely. They are worlds apart in achievement, money and prospects, with Murray, the world No3, many people’s favourite to win his second Wimbledon title, and Kukushkin, ranked at 59, probably grateful to be picking up &pound;29,000 as his first-round cheque.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/liam-broad-wimbledon-first-round-win-friends-floors\">Liam Broady hopes Wimbledon win will get him off friends’ floors</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Murray has won their only two encounters fairly easily. However, where Kukushkin and Murray have common ground is more obvious: both are coached by women, as is Denis Istomin (uniquely tutored by his mother, Klaudiya), who is on their side of the draw. It is a trio unique in the ATP top 100, rarely in the whole of the game.</p> \n<p>Anastasia played until she was 16 and was a coach at the famous Moscow club, Spartak. “She was working there for a couple of years,” Kukushkin says. “When we met and she started to help me, then she start to go full-time with me. She had to quit [the club] because there was not time enough for that.”</p> \n<p>While Murray has been hailed as a pioneer for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/28/amelie-mauresmo-coach-who-made-andy-murray-mint-again\">hiring Am&eacute;lie Mauresmo</a> a year ago to succeed Ivan Lendl and lauded as a feminist for his stalwart defence of her, as well as the protective sentiments he has expressed as she approaches the delivery of her first child in August, the Kazakh of Russian origin has been allowed to tour with his wife without much fuss.</p> \n<p>His ranking probably explains why – although he is a clever player with a fine tennis brain. And he does not lack for ambition.</p> \n<p>“To get a draw with Andy Murray at his home, one of his favourite tournaments, it’s tough for sure,” he says. “But it’s one of the challenges that I met a lot in my career. I played twice here in the Centre Court against Roger [Federer] and Rafa [Nadal]. I won one set last year against Rafa – I play good in the first set and after that … not really.”</p> \n<p>Murray beat him in Brisbane then Melbourne two years ago but Kukushkin says: “It is different to the Australian Open. It was fourth round, I played already a couple of matches before so it felt inside the tournament. Now it’s the first round, just preparing, waiting for your match. It’s a bit different but I’m not that nervous.”</p> \n<p>For Anastasia, it has not always been an anxiety-free experience, watching her husband play, week in week out, often on outside courts away from the glamour and noise of the Tour.</p> \n<p>“But I’m not so nervous, like three or four years ago,” she says. “Now I’m just relaxing and try to give him some more …power?” She laughs again.</p> \n<p>“Confidence,” he smiles.</p> \n<p>Kukushkin is not surprised there are few women coaching men on the Tour. “All of us [Murray, Istomin and himself], we are happy with it but I believe most other tennis players, they don’t support it. A lot of people around tennis, they think that it’s not good.”</p> \n<p>“Not professional,” offers Anastasia. They have what she calls, “sceptic vision”. She adds: “In my opinion it doesn’t matter with whom you are coaching. If you have a result, it doesn’t matter if it is a female or a male.”</p> \n<p>There is a level of irritation emerging, although Mr and Mrs K are impeccably polite. Still, Anastasia does not like the fact she is not allowed near the locker room – as well as other manifestations of exclusion. “I don’t have access,” she says. “Maybe I can go in but not everywhere.”</p> \n<p>Kukushkin reveals his wife has even had trouble getting accreditation as a coach, as tournament organisers regard her as just his girlfriend. “There are always problems.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/lleyton-hewitt-bids-farewell-to-wimbledon-after-nieminen-loss\">Lleyton Hewitt bids farewell to Wimbledon after Nieminen loss</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He explains also why he switched his allegiance from Russia to Kazakhstan in 2008. “As I remember, I was about 150 in the rankings and everyone, all the coaches, thought I could be a top-100 player but there were a lot of good Russian players [ahead of him] back then.</p> \n<p>“I knew I had to do something to break through. The Kazakhstan federation came to me with good support, the kind of support which I believe is important to every player. I think it was a good decision to move to Kazakhstan and I have lived there seven years. I have had good results in the Davis Cup as well as my own good results on the tour. I believe it has helped me a lot – to become a better player.”</p> \n<p>Kukushkin regards himself – as do many players – as an “internationalist”. “I feel more international,” he says, “because for 51 out of the 52 weeks of the year I travel and stay in hotels. When I have a week out of a tournament [when losing early], now I just go to practise somewhere. If I have time during the off season, I go on holiday, so I am never at home. I don’t feel like I belong to one country.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435602672263/Andy-Murray-with-Am-lie-M-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray shares a light moment with his coach Amélie Mauresmo and trainer Matt Little during practice at Wimbledon.

The symmetry of the 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 scoreline was slightly misleading in that it took the world No1 an hour or so to get into his majestic stride.</p> \n<p>Fending off accusations this week that he and his coach overstep the rules about coaching from the stands, Djokovic received a warm reception in victory, and told the BBC’s Garry Richardson: “They were very kind. It is great to be back. This is the cradle of our sport. It doesn’t get any bigger than Wimbledon. It’s a privilege to open the tournament as defending champion. I have only the dearest and best memories of Centre Court, coming back where I won the title the year before.”</p> \n<p>He added: “I had a very tough opponent who can be very tricky on all surfaces, especially grass. The first set could have gone either way. He broke me back right away.”</p> \n<p>As it happens, there were no indications that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/28/novak-djokovic-cheat-wimbledon-boris-becker\" title=\"\">Djokovic and Becker combined at any point</a> with a gesture that might be construed as cheating. In truth, he needed no assistance.</p> \n<p>Djokovic’s first stroke of the championships, at 1.09pm, was a 118mph ace down the middle. After that – with interruptions for Kohlschreiber and a ballboy to chase away a seemingly confused bird wandering over the court – there were few distractions for the Serb.</p> \n<p>There was more discussion in the early stages on the identity of the invading bird than there was of the tennis surrounding it. Was it wagtail? Surely not a common chaffinch at the All England Club … The consensus was that it was young blue tit and not very good at being a bird, otherwise it would have flown away rather than skipped and hopped.</p> \n<p>Maybe it liked tennis – certainly more than Kohlschreiber when Djokovic teased him through deuce then broke early, inducing a lazy backhand into the tramlines for 2-0.</p> \n<p>The champion handed back the advantage before claiming the set. The second set followed the pattern of the first, with Djokovic gradually gaining the upper hand and for awhile in the warm sunshine, it was pleasantly tedious.</p> \n<p>The bird returned briefly, looking ill at ease after trying to fly the coop, his wings not quite up to it. Kohlschreiber probably sympathised. Errors seeped into his tennis and he looked as if he knew what was coming in the third.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435592338430/Novak-Djokovic-meets-the--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Novak Djokovic tries to shoo a bird from the court during his first-round victory against Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber at Wimbledon Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images","credit":"Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Novak Djokovic meets the bird","cleanCaption":"Novak Djokovic tries to shoo a bird from the court during his first-round victory against Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber at Wimbledon Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-29T15:43:47Z","lastModified":"2015-06-29T23:20:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":10,"contributors":[{"name":"Kevin Mitchell","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741641/KevinMitchell.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/kevinmitchell"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Novak Djokovic","Wimbledon 2015","Wimbledon","Tennis","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/novak-djokovic","webTitle":"Novak Djokovic"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Kevin Mitchell","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/kevinmitchell"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/novak-djokovic-wimbledon-2015-first-round-match-report","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a8bc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/29/novak-djokovic-wimbledon-2015-first-round-match-report","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/29/novak-djokovic-wimbledon-2015-first-round-match-report"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435592338430/Novak-Djokovic-meets-the--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Novak Djokovic tries to shoo a bird from the court during his first-round victory against Germany’s Philipp Kohlschreiber at Wimbledon.

The world No1 can make yet more history here and with every match the focus on what she could achieve will build. Victory a week on Saturday would give her a sixth Wimbledon title, a 21st grand slam title in all, a second “Serena Slam” of four straight majors and leave her needing “only” to win the US Open this summer to become the sixth person to complete the calendar-year grand slam.</p> \n<p>To deal with the pressure, Williams does a good line in pretending she is not sure what is going on. Not completely – of course she knows what is at stake – but on Monday, after a slightly nervy opening-round win, 6-4, 6-1 over Russia’s Margarita Gasparyan, she gave the impression that she has been hiding away from anything to do with what stands before her in the next two weeks.</p> \n<p>Not only did she say she had not known that Gasparyan was a qualifier, until she was told by an interviewer, the 33-year-old then appeared to have no idea she will meet her sister and five-times champion, Venus, in the last 16, should the seedings pan out. Venus crushed the young American, Madison Brengle 6-0, 6-0.</p> \n<p>Given that they are sharing a house, as always, over the fortnight, it seems unlikely, but it was classic Serena – and who are we to argue with her thought process? “I didn’t know that,” she said, to a number of raised eyebrows. “Well, she’s been really tough. Last time we played, she actually beat me. That’s not going to be an easy match. You know what, I’m going to just focus on right now. You got me?”</p> \n<p>Williams had the grace to smile as she said it but of course she is well aware of what she can achieve. Having fought her way to the French Open title this month, she is two grand slam wins short of Steffi Graf’s total of 22, while Margaret Court’s all-time record of 24, won before and after the open era began, is also within her grasp. She knows about it but does not want to think about it too much.</p> \n<p>“Honestly, I don’t think about it,” she said. “But every time I come into press, you guys talk about it, so naturally it’s definitely getting more on my mind than I want it to be, than what it has been. It’s definitely historic, I guess, but it’s also six matches away. It’s definitely not guaranteed. I’m just going to try to enjoy holding three right now and enjoy that moment.”</p> \n<p>There is, of course, good reason to try to avoid over-egging the subject. In 2002, when she won the French Open, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/wimbledon\" title=\"\">Wimbledon</a> and US Open, she went into Australia chasing the Serena Slam and was very nervous.</p> \n<p>“I remember I almost lost in the first round,” she said. “I remember I had a very intense final against Venus. I don’t remember much in between. Maybe I had a tough semi, I think against Kim [Clijsters]. I don’t remember mentally where I was at this moment, whether I was thinking about getting the Serena Slam. I don’t know; we’ll see.”</p> \n<p>When she trailed the world No113 Gasparyan 3-1 in the first set here, the Serena Slam seemed a long way off as the American’s feet refused to move. Beaten early in the past two years in SW19, there were nerves, something that was clear for everyone to hear when she was warned for swearing in the sixth game. That was the game that got her back on track, though, as she broke to level and then eased through the rest to set up a match against Timea Babos of Hungary.</p> \n<p>The former world No1, Ana Ivanovic, crushed China’s Xu Yifan 6-1, 6-1 but the No9 seed, Carla Su&aacute;rez Navarro, was hammered 6-2, 6-0 by last year’s junior champion Jelena Ostapenko, of Latvia. The former grand slam champions Victoria Azarenka and Sam Stosur advanced while the French Open runner-up, Lucie Safarova, battled through to beat the American, Alison Riske, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435587767948/Serena-Williams--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Serena Williams recovered from being 3-1 down in the first set to convincingly beat qualifier Margarita Gasparyan in the first round at Wimbledon.

Liam Broady’s fabulous comeback from two sets down to beat Australia’s Marinko Matosevic will be a nice cushion to withstand the usual criticism of the host country’s performance in SW19 but for the 21-year-old Broady, it was far, far more important.</p> \n<p>The left-hander’s 5-7, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 win was his first grand slam victory – on his grand slam debut – and the manner of it spoke volumes about the path he has taken to reach this point. No longer in contact with his father, Simon, who disapproved of his return to the LTA fold a few years ago, Broady has had to grow up fast. Four years after he was beaten in the final of the juniors here, and he showed enormous mental resolve to see off Matosevic. Regardless of the fact it was the Australian’s 12th consecutive defeat – which explains his slide down the rankings to 138 – it meant the world to Broady, as his Nadal-like, leaping celebration showed.</p> \n<p>Watson may yet record another victory after fighting back to level her match with the No32 seed Caroline Garcia of France. Out-hit in the first set, she bounced back well and had the momentum at 1-6, 6-3 when the players agreed to stop because the light was not good. “I don’t want to play without Hawk-Eye because there have been so many bad calls,” said Watson, who will return to finish the match after the opener on Court 12.</p> \n<p>Broady, who sported a thick beard, has played in some of the less salubrious venues on the Tour and had to battle it out on the first rung of the professional ladder to reach this point. There have been many who have questioned his ability, saying he lacks the big weapon needed to really make it big. But his backhand is outstanding and as he showed against Matosevic, he has the heart required to win big matches on big stages. This win should take his ranking from No182 into at least the low 160s and the confidence he will gain from it could mean everything over the months to come.</p> \n<p>In 2007, Broady’s father took Liam and his sister, Naomi, who was beaten 7-6, 6-3 by Mariana Duque-Mari&ntilde;o of Colombia later in the day, out of the LTA system, funding them on his own after Naomi was suspended for a photo on a social media website appearing to depict her in a situation where alcohol was present. Broady, from Stockport, said the decision to go back to the LTA after many years away was the correct one. “People would disagree it was always the right decision for me whether I got the results or not,” he said. “I had to kind of grow up and mature as a person, not just a tennis player by sort of doing things on my own, even things like, I’ve said it before, filing your tax, getting your own rackets strung, booking your own flights. It’s all stuff you need to learn and grow up and realise that you’re not living in an enclosed world any more. I’ll always say I think it was the right decision.”</p> \n<p>The match was played out on Court 18, the scene of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2010/jun/24/wimbledon-2010-isner-mahut\" title=\"\">the famous John Isner-Nicolas Mahut epic</a>, and if it was not quite in their league, it was nevertheless Broady’s first five-set match. To come through it against a much more experienced opponent says a lot about his spirit and Leon Smith, the watching Davis Cup captain, must have been impressed.</p> \n<p>As he later admitted, Broady might and probably should have won the first set. With Matosevic low on confidence after his terrible recent run, the Briton had break points for 4-3 in the first set that might have set the Australian even further back into a rut but to his credit Matosevic came up with some big points when required and one bad game gave him the break he needed for the set. When Matosevic doubled his lead, surely few people crammed into the court and watching from the top of the broadcast centre above believed Broady could come back.</p> \n<p>But an early break in the third gave him belief and as Matosevic wilted, Broady roared back to level. As so often happens when a player comes from two sets down, they have a lapse at the start of the final set and Broady double-faulted to be broken for 2-0. But he broke back immediately and then dominated the rest of the set, clinching victory when Matosevic could only put a forehand volley wide. “At 5-3 in the third set I was thinking: ‘I will remember today for the rest of my life,’” Broady said. “I wanted to make sure I did myself proud.”</p> \n<p>He did that in style, and with a match to come against David Goffin, the No6 seed, he will have another chance to show he belongs at this level. “I’ve seen him play in Futures in Belgium when I was about 15 so I think I’ll be comfortable going on court with him. It’s not like I’m going to be stepping on court with Novak Djokovic. He’s obviously a fantastic player but I’ve got nothing to lose.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/29/wimbledon-2015-day-one-live\">Wimbledon 2015: day one – live!</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435586702284/Liam-Broady-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Liam Broady fought back from two sets down to complete a thrilling comeback against Marinko Matosevic on court 18.
