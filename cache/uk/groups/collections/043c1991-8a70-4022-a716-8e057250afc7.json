As if it was not enough that the opening set lasted a faintly embarrassing 27 minutes, Watson had to save three match points in a decider that tested the blood pressure of everyone watching on Court 12, deal with a code violation for foul language and raise herself after allowing Garcia to break when she served for the match at 6-5. She will drag herself back on court on Wednesday to face the experienced Slovakian and world No72, Daniela Hantuchova, who beat Watson in the Australian Open last year.</p> \n<p>Playing for the third time in three days will be a stiff examination of Watson’s physical conditioning, although she will surely be fresh against Hantuchova after one of the biggest wins of her career.</p> \n<p>Garcia must be mystified by her early exit. The 21-year-old, who was once tipped by Andy Murray to become the world No1, was a class above during a painful first set for Watson and she ought to have secured her place in the next round after breaking in the first game of the second.</p> \n<p>Watson was wounded and Garcia let her squirm out of her grasp.</p> \n<p>Despite Garcia’s generosity, an area where Watson must improve is her unfortunate knack of starting matches slowly. She got away with it twice in Eastbourne last week, rousing herself from early torpor to beat <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/heather-watson-varvara-lepchenko-eastbourne\" title=\"\">Varvara Lepchenko</a> and Elina Svitolina, but Sloane Stephens had her number in the third round.</p> \n<p>Maybe Watson feeds off anxiety, flat when the umpire barks “play” but able to tap dance her way out of trouble when she is standing on the edge of a cliff. Watson can throw a punch and, if she can play with more aggression on a regular basis, she will move up the rankings. Her backhand stung Garcia. The third set was an almighty battle. After a few comfortable holds, the temperature rose when Watson squandered several break points, throwing away chances to lead 3-2 and 4-3.</p> \n<p>Watson’s frustration boiled over after Garcia held in the seventh game of the set and she was given a point penalty by the umpire, meaning that her next service game began with her trailing 0-15. She was warned for racket abuse on Monday night and that one point in Garcia’s favour almost proved costly for Watson, who had to save two break points.</p> \n<p>“She gave it to me for audible obscenity,” Watson said. “She didn’t like me, that’s for sure. I say things that I shouldn’t say. I apologise to anybody that’s offended. I need to control it and I just can’t.”</p> \n<p>Garcia attacked Watson’s second serve and she earned two match points when she was leading 5-4. She missed two forehands.</p> \n<p>She had another match point; she missed another forehand. That was the difference: the winner count was 32-13 in Garcia’s favour but she also made 38 unforced errors to Watson’s 18.</p> \n<p>Watson made the most of her reprieve after holding and she broke to lead 6-5 after a double-fault from Garcia. However Watson’s serve was also falling to pieces and Garcia immediately broke back.</p> \n<p>“I was actually quite nervous,” Watson said. “Going to serve the first time, I don’t think I made a first serve to close that game out. She took advantage of that.”</p> \n<p>There was a sharp intake of breath. Watson steeled herself and Garcia, riddled with self-doubt, lost her serve again.</p> \n<p>Serving for the match for a second time, Watson led 40-0. There was a brief delay, a double-fault from Watson, but Garcia had pretty much seen enough by then and knocked a forehand return long to settle a perplexing match.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435688452954/8845c0e6-1ba1-4156-b382-0732d903fd10-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graeme Robertson for the Guardian","altText":"British No1 Heather Watson celebrates her victory over Caroline Garcia.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T15:51:49Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T23:01:41Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":7,"contributors":[{"name":"Jacob Steinberg","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/3/4/1425468993908/Jacob-Steinberg-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jacob-steinberg"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Heather Watson","Wimbledon 2015","Wimbledon","Tennis","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/heather-watson","webTitle":"Heather Watson"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jacob Steinberg","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jacob-steinberg"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/30/heather-watson-caroline-garcia-wimbledon","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a8zx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/30/heather-watson-caroline-garcia-wimbledon","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/30/heather-watson-caroline-garcia-wimbledon"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435688452954/8845c0e6-1ba1-4156-b382-0732d903fd10-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"British No1 Heather Watson celebrates her victory over Caroline Garcia.

Her serve in particular seemed to be misfiring. Ten double faults and just 28% of second service points won told their own story. At one point, as another groundstroke drifted wide, she yelled to herself: “Make her play the ball, Laura.”</p> \n<p>Then occasionally she would send one of her trademark double handed backhands flashing past her Russian opponent and kindle memories of 2013, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/01/laura-robson-wimbledon-kaia-kanepi\" title=\"\">when she reached the fourth round</a>.</p> \n<p>On her competitive return following 18 months out with a wrist injury sustained before last year’s Australian Open and exacerbated during it, Robson managed to win just one game <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/laura-robson-daria-gavrilova-eastbourne\" title=\"\">in defeat at Eastbourne</a>.</p> \n<p>So this was an improvement on that at least. She could not have asked for a much kinder draw against an opponent ranked 101 in the world. After her Eastbourne defeat she joked that Hadad had told her afterwards that there was just one thing she needed to work on – “everything”.</p> \n<p>Robson, who needed a wildcard after dropping out of the rankings from a 2013 high of 27, has conceded that it will take time to put her game back together. But she showed she had lost none of her fighting spirit.</p> \n<p>There were lengthy games in both sets, with Robson saving a break point during an attritional six-deuce sixth game in the first set. In the next she failed to convert a break point of her own in another flurry of deuces.</p> \n<p>Then, in a passage of play that seemed to sum up her frustrating afternoon, she threw her next service game away to hand the initiative to her opponent.</p> \n<p>In the pivotal third game of the second set, Robson lost her service game to love. The 21-year-old kept battling to the end, including during a controversial denouement when Rodina had run out of challenges and could not hide her fury when a ball was called long on match point. But it was only temporary relief for Robson, as the Russian finished things off.</p> \n<p>“We still love you, Laura,” cried a lone voice as she departed.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/30/1435676354076/Laura-Robson-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Laura Robson leaves the court, and this year's singles tournament, after her 6-4, 6-4 defeat.

For all his menace, talent and athleticism, Tsonga, who won 7-6, 6-7, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, is bedevilled by lapses in concentration and wavering intensity.</p> \n<p>He has the modus operandi of a security light. He flicks on when there is danger, rests when the threat has passed. This mental approach can and does get him through against lesser opponents but is repeatedly exposed by titans of the circuit. Tsonga took the first set in a relative languid manner. It went to a tie-break, which the Frenchman won 10-8 but there never seemed much doubt he would win it.</p> \n<p>M&uuml;ller’s game plan to stifle him at the net stuttered at the outset, while Tsonga served well and stepped up the power when necessary. He seemed content to do the same for the second set, easing through his service games – aces the rule, not the exception – and pressuring but never breaking M&uuml;ller’s serve.</p> \n<p>But at the tie-break, the light stayed off with intruders lurking. M&uuml;ller won 7-3. Now obviously bothered by M&uuml;ller’s constant charges to the net, Tsonga flickered to life in the third breaking the Luxembourger’s serve to take a 3-2 lead. He squandered another opportunity to break on M&uuml;ller’s next service game but, refocused, began to attack M&uuml;ller with greater authority and took the set 6-4. But the light flickered off again.</p> \n<p>With M&uuml;ller canny and brave in his serving and volleying, Tsonga surrendered his first serve of the fourth set to go 2-0 down. He threatened to break his opponent’s serve at next opportunity but doughty M&uuml;ller – by now encamped at the net and reaping the benefits – held firm. At 3-0 down, the light flickered again – Tsonga, visibly frustrated, ferociously secured a love game but it was clearly tough going. On at least three occasions the volleying of M&uuml;ller left him so flat-footed he fell over. At 5-2 he chased the break again but squandered two break points. He was frustrated but so were his supporters. “Come on Jo,” shouted one. “It’s too hot for five sets.”</p> \n<p>But with M&uuml;ller moving well, serving cleverly and predatory master of the net, that was where they headed. M&uuml;ller prevailed 6-3. Both started the final set strongly and in the fourth game, Tsonga got the break. “Finish him,” shouted one fan, overheating. Tsonga obliged with serve and volley to go 5-3 up. The biter bit. As he served to stay alive M&uuml;ller kept faith in his net game but Tsonga’s whipped forehand passed him. Another break for 6-3 and with it the match.</p> \n<p>If he tires later in the tournament, Tsonga may reflect on a blisteringly hot encounter that was longer than it should have been.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435678211403/Jo-Wilfried-Tsonga-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jo-Wilfried Tsonga needed five sets to get past Luxembourg’s Gilles Müller.

The fact that he has made it from there to the tour is remarkable in itself and he enjoyed himself on his Wimbledon debut.</p> \n<p>The 23-year-old showed some lovely touches, especially at the net but lacked the power to hurt Federer and the Swiss had his own way throughout, as he had done when they had met in the third round of the French Open earlier this month.</p> \n<p>After the first point, one male fan shouted out: “Roger, I love you,” and most of the crowd seemed to feel the same way as they cheered everything that came off his racket.</p> \n<p>Two breaks, in the fourth and sixth games, gave him the opening set and though Dzumhur held his own until 3-3 in the second, Federer pulled away before cruising through the third to set up a clash with the American Sam Querrey or Igor Sijsling of the Netherlands.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/30/1435675527665/roger-federer-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Roger Federer shakes hands with the Wimbledon debutant Damir Dzumhur.

Having sunk to No10 in the rankings for the first time in a decade, the Spaniard did not look like a veteran struggling for form.</p> \n<p>He hit with certainty and precision, forcing Bellucci into extended rallies and testing his commitment to the fight. The crowd gave Nadal an extended round of applause for his performance.</p> \n<p>Bellucci had not taken a set off Nadal in four attempts and there was little likelihood of his doing so here. The 27-year-old clay-courter, ranked 42 in the world, never properly got into the match after trading breaks in the first set, which Nadal wrapped up in 43 minutes.</p> \n<p>The second set detained him only a couple of minutes more than the first and the Spaniard’s attritional top-spin from deep made the struggle a chore in the heat of mid-afternoon.</p> \n<p>In the third Bellucci strained at his serving limit to stay in touch but Nadal – hitting the ball ludicrously hard from behind the baseline – broke for 3-2 with some stunning cross-court winners off the forehand.</p> \n<p>After a little over two hours Bellucci stayed in the struggle with a solid service game before Nadal finished it with a wristy inside-out forehand that the Brazilian could do no more than bat back into the net.</p> \n<p>This was vintage Nadal: no frills, no surprises. If he is to do well here he will not tinker with the game that has served him well through 14 major titles over as many years.</p> \n<p>“You cannot change your basic style – or it is not good to do that,” Nadal told the Guardian. “What you need is to improve all the time, the things that you are good at and the things you are not so good at. Over the years, you lose things in your tennis. If you are not as quick as before, you have to bring something else. That is why for 10, 11 years of my career I have been in a very high position of the rankings – and winning.</p> \n<p>“I am working on the same things as always. I know this year I am not playing that well, but I cannot change many things. It’s just a little bit more confidence, play a bit better.
