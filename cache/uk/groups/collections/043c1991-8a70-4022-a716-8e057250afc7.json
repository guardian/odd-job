But it was not to be as Murray and his partner, the Australian John Peers, lost 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 to the No4 seeds, Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau.</p> \n<p>One of Godfree’s other claims to fame was that he played the first match on Centre Court when it opened in 1922. According to legend, his opening serve went into the net so he walked up to his ball and put it in his pocket as a souvenir. After this final Murray’s pockets will also be a little heavier: both he and Peers, the 13th seeds, walked away with &pound;85,000 for being runners-up.</p> \n<p>Yet after a positive opening they were second best for much of the match.</p> \n<p>Tecau, in particular, played textbook doubles tennis. His serve was impenetrable. His volleys were as sharp as any blade. And his return never stopped asking questions. As Murray admitted: “I felt they got momentum early and that was the difference. If we could have snuck out a break early, things could have gone completely different. But they deserved to win.”</p> \n<p>Most of Centre Court was taking a breather after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/serena-williams-beats-garbine-muguruza-wimbledon-grand-slam\">the women’s final</a> when the players arrived on court but the noise that greeted them was passionate and partisan. One wag summed up the mood moments before play started: “Come on Jamie, do it for Scotland!” Seconds later Murray hit a crosscourt winner against Rojer’s serve to go up 0-15 up and the volume went even higher.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b636f131980dd63d905e968b06d759335cf24a59\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b636f131980dd63d905e968b06d759335cf24a59/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Murray plays a forehand return at the net during the men’s doubles final. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Murray plays a forehand return at the net during the men’s doubles final. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And while Rojer and Tecau just about held their opening service game from 15-30, the tone was set for the opening 30 minutes of the match – with Murray and Peers pressing for a break and their opponents doggedly holding them at bay.</p> \n<p>They had two breakpoint chances at 1-1 only for Tecau’s muscular serve to dig him out of a hole, and another one at 2-2 when Murray’s vicious dipping return swirled and stung Rojer’s shoelaces. Yet Peers was unable to take advantage, first hitting a return straight at Tecau then sending his lob wide.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately while the Australian was serving well, his return game was as streaky as zigzag-cut bacon: he went games without disturbing the wall that Rojer and Tecau put up at the net before suddenly whipping up a couple of passing shots in quick succession before going arctic cold again.</p> \n<p>Murray, though, was playing well and dropped only one point on serve and also saved a breakpoint at 4-5 down before the first set went to a tie-break. His brother Andy, who had been unsure whether he would watch for fear of jinxing him, watched on discreetly from three rows above the players’ box, quietly urging him on.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t know he was coming until I heard him shouting encouragement,” admitted Jamie to laughs afterwards.</p> \n<p>But Rojer and Tecau were gradually finding their feet on their return game and at 3-2 on the tie-break they drew a crucial mistake from Peers at the net. That mini-break proved enough, with Rojer and Tecau clinching the tie-break 7-5 after a final point that was a mini-classic.</p> \n<p>Three times Peers and Murray dived to get smashes back before Tecau settled the argument with a thunderbolt bludgeoned down the middle.</p> \n<p>The loss of the opening set meant that Murray and Peers had to regroup quickly but they soon went a break down in the second when Peers lost his serve.</p> \n<p>At 4-3 on Rojer’s serve, there was a glimmer of hope at 15-30 but it was soon strangled as Rojer saved the game and, shortly afterwards, a flying Tecau smash put them two sets up.</p> \n<p>Murray and Peers had twice won five-setters during this Wimbledon but never looked like knocking their opponents off their stride. And at 4-4 in the third Peers tossed in a double fault at 30-30, allowing Rojer and Tecau to pounce. A game later it was all over.</p> \n<p>With this victory Tecau became the first Romanian player to win a Wimbledon men’s doubles title since Ilie Nastase in 1973 with Jimmy Connors. And that he finally triumphed after losing in his three previous finals here in 2010, 2011 and 2012 might give encouragement to Murray. Not that he was feeling it last night.</p> \n<p>“I guess it’s a missed opportunity,” he sighed. “We may never have a chance to play a grand slam final again.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/10459c7851e4359c2505b9d3cf3e46f2cbbe6d3e/0_16_5070_3045/5070.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3045,"width":5070,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom Jenkins for the Guardian","altText":"Andy Murray shouts encouragement to his brother Jamie in the men’s doubles final at Wimbledon.

Serena Williams captured her sixth Wimbledon singles title and 21st major championship on a flawless Saturday afternoon <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/serena-williams-beats-garbine-muguruza-wimbledon-grand-slam\" title=\"\">with a 6-4, 6-4 win over Garbi&ntilde;e Muguruza</a>. Surely now recognition as the greatest ever women’s tennis player is no longer a point of dispute but a jumping-off point for her broader influence across society at large.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/serena-williams-beats-garbine-muguruza-wimbledon-grand-slam\">Serena Williams beats battling Garbi&ntilde;e Muguruza to win Wimbledon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A black female Jehovah’s Witness from Compton continues to rewrite the record books of a sport once the province of the wealthy and privileged, winning with unspeakable power and grace and doing it on her terms. She took an hour and 23 minutes to win her first title at the All England Club since 2012, giving her ownership of all four major championships for the second time in her career.</p> \n<p>Williams (33 years, 289 days) becomes the oldest player to win a grand slam singles title in the Open era. She has now won majors in her teens (one), 20s (12) and 30s (eight, a record), and improved to a preposterous 21-4 in finals – redoubling her reputation as the greatest closer in sport.</p> \n<p>To be sure the grand slam championships are the recognised metric of greatness and Williams remains one behind Steffi Graf’s 22 for the most won in the Open era.</p> \n<p>But Wiliams’ place atop that leaderboard – the last, desperate argument against her undisputed supremacy – seems predestined, given her current form. She has now won 28 consecutive matches at majors – second only to her previous streak of 33 amid her first Serena Slam 12 years ago – and will enter the US Open in seven weeks’ time as the runaway favourite to tick the lone unchecked box on her r&eacute;sum&eacute;: a calendar-year grand slam. Victory at Flushing Meadows would move Williams level with Graf, the last player to capture the sport’s four prestige titles in a single season.</p> \n<p>Saturday’s latest triumph offered compelling if not overly dramatic theatre. The 21-year-old Muguruza – who had blasted Williams off the court <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/may/28/serena-williams-garbine-muguruza-french-open\" title=\"\">in a Roland Garros stunner last year</a> – was a determined and wildly underestimated opponent who will one day win majors.</p> \n<p>Williams, who this week confessed to nerves every time she steps on the court, felt the weight of history and expectations in her opening service game. She double-faulted three times and gave the heavy-hitting Muguruza – one of the few players on tour capable of matching her first-strike pressure – an early dash of confidence.Yet Williams almost immediately began rolling through her service games more quickly and applying pressure on Muguruza’s serve.</p> \n<p>From 2-4 down Williams won eight of the next nine games – forcing her Spanish opponent into a high-risk approach beyond her comfort level – and staked a chance to serve for the championship. Yet she tightened late as Centre Court burst into life amid Muguruza’s last-gasp kick, the toe-to-toe exchanges between massive hitters bringing the crowd to their feet, until Muguruza blinked and Williams was the champion again.</p> \n<p>In 2011, when Williams confirmed she had suffered a haematoma and pulmonary embolism, there was no guarantee she would ever play tennis at an elite level again, let alone the stratospheric heights she has reached. Since then Williams has accrued a 249-20 match record, an 81-9 mark in majors and eight grand slam titles with an 8-1 record in finals.</p> \n<p>She has not simply cleaned out the sport’s heavyweight division: she has scrubbed, cleansed and disinfected it, taking up residence in her rivals’ heads rent-free.</p> \n<p>Consider her head-to-head records against the other active players to win major titles: Maria Sharapova (18 wins, two defeats), Svetlana Kuznetsova (8-2), Victoria Azarenka (17-3), Ana Ivanovic (8-1), Petra Kvitova (5-1), Francesca Schiavone (7-2) and Samantha Stosur (8-3). Only the uncomfortable rivalry with her elder sister Venus (15-11), a rivalry fraught with complex emotional depth, is close.</p> \n<p>And Williams has done it all as the ultimate outsider, subject to misguided criticism and bigotry throughout her career. She has handled these undue burdens, particularly in the later stages of her illustrious career, with an uncommon strength and grace.</p> \n<p>The greatest champions in sport win titles win they are young and keep them till they are old. Now with six titles at SW19, three on the clay of Paris, and six apiece on the hard courts of Melbourne and Flushing Meadows, Wiliams’ greatness is beyond dispute. Whether immortality awaits in New York is almost immaterial.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436634622397/Serena-Williams-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Serena Williams holds the Venus Rosewater Dish aloft following her straight sets victory over Garbiñe Muguruza in the Wimbledon final.

But the practicalities would prove difficult, despite the current vogue at the BBC for joint deals as with the FA Cup, Formula One and now the Six Nations – which will <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/09/bbc-itv-join-forces-sky-six-nations\" title=\"\">be shared with ITV under a new &pound;50m-a-year deal</a>.</p> \n<p>Lewis has now confirmed that he is keen to renew Wimbledon’s special 60-year relationship with the BBC. “We have got a very good relationship with the BBC. They do a very good job for us and we do a good job for them. It’s a win-win. I don’t see any reason for it to change,” said Lewis, at the end of a fortnight that has been as popular as ever in ticket sales and ratings.</p> \n<p>“They recognise we do a good job for them and are valuable to them. Certainly, we feel that they get us. They are part of us, they understand us. They understand what impact Wimbledon has in the UK, let alone globally. There is a mutual respect and understanding.”</p> \n<p>He cites the atmosphere that can build when a big Wimbledon moment is brewing, such as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/03/heather-watson-serena-williams-wimbledon\" title=\"\">Heather Watson’s match with Serena Williams, </a>with free-to-air blanket coverage on the BBC a key component. “That was a big thing. Someone was telling me they were in a pub in north London and it was like a football match. I can believe it. The centre court atmosphere was very special and it was a great contest.”</p> \n<p>Lewis’s comments will reassure the BBC that the club is determined to maintain a relationship that goes back to the beginning of televised sport and will reassure those viewers lamenting the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/bbc-loses-control-olympic-tv-rights-discovery-eurosport\" title=\"\">International Olympic Committee’s recent deal with Discovery</a> and the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/feb/03/sky-sports-buys-open-championship-golf-bbc\" title=\"\">R&amp;A’s with Sky for Open golf</a>. It could also be a gentle reminder to BBC executives considering the impact of reduced licence fee income of the tournament’s importance.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/06/wimbledon-2day-bbc-admits-defeat-over-format\">Wimbledon 2Day: BBC admits defeat over format</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The BBC is also important to Wimbledon because of its ubiquity during the fortnight and it is an important calling card when selling the brand and TV rights overseas. Lewis even backed the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/06/wimbledon-2day-bbc-admits-defeat-over-format\" title=\"\">failed experiment of <em>Wimbledon 2Day</em></a>, the daily programme that quickly morphed back into a version of the traditional highlights amid viewer complaints. “We don’t mind the BBC trying new things. We were fully supportive. It didn’t quite work and they’ve moved back to something that people are enjoying and it’s receiving support,” said Lewis, who succeeded Ian Ritchie in 2012.</p> \n<p>The former Rugby Football League and Sport England chairman said moving the tournament back by a week had been an unqualified success and resulted in higher quality matches from the first day because players had enjoyed longer on the grass. “The players have been overwhelmingly positive. With the extra week the players were arriving here earlier and practising more,” he said. “Lots of competition time, lots of practice and good weather. Qualifying week felt a lot busier all round. It has felt like a three-week tournament.”</p> \n<p>Lewis must continually maintain a balance between modernising Wimbledon, ensuring it is as accessible as possible to all pockets, while also increasing commercial income and retaining its traditions. On the subject of technology, where smart phones have subtly altered the experience as court side fans keep tabs on other matches, he remained convinced it had successfully walked the line. “It’s something we’ve talked about a lot and the feedback so far is that it’s an improvement and it’s not interfering with people’s enjoyment on the court.</p> \n<p>“But that’s always been the thing we want to keep an eye on – if people are sticking tablets in the air or interfering with people’s enjoyment of the match. But we’re not getting any complaints along those lines and the fact people know what is going on around the grounds is adding to people’s enjoyment of the day.”</p> \n<p>Around those grounds, there is an air of constant evolution. Phase one of the latest redevelopment plan, digging under courts 14 and 15 to provide more room for catering facilities and storage, is complete. Stage two will be more dramatic, adding a roof, new hospitality areas and 1,000 more seats to No1 Court over the next three years in stages. That redevelopment is being paid for by a new debenture issue that sold out almost immediately, even at double the price of the previous one.</p> \n<p>Lewis insisted there was no paradox between the debenture scheme, which allows holders to sell seats at above face value when not in use, and his determination to clamp down on touting. “Ordinary tickets can be sold back to the Club so they can get back their money at face value,” he said. “The debentures is a different type of scheme for funding new facilities. A lot of what is so positive about this place wouldn’t happen if it wasn’t for debentures.”</p> \n<p>He said the consumer rights bill would allow the club to be tougher about policing the resale of ordinary tickets for profit, arguing that it is essential to preserve the tournament’s atmosphere. “If you can’t do that and people just buy tickets to sell, that’s a recipe for the organised companies with computer systems and multiple applications,” he said. “I don’t think people would welcome that in the slightest. It is an important part of Wimbledon that tickets are fairly and reasonably priced.”</p> \n<p>John McEnroe is among those who have loudly questioned whether the grand slams should take another look at bringing in tie-breaks in the fifth set in light of the demands of the modern game. But Lewis insisted it was part of the unique appeal of the four grand slams. “I understand why it crops up when you see a match like Isner and Cilic going back on court. But I don’t think for that rare, exceptional match that goes on for a long time one should change the whole dynamic,” he said. “It’s part of grand slam tennis. There’s a narrative that builds up that’s unique to grand slam tennis.”</p> \n<p>Lewis, who played at Wimbledon 11 times (though progressed beyond the first round only once), ruled out changes to the traditional all white rule in spite of grumbles from some players: “It’s only two weeks of the year, the rest of the year they can wear what they like”.</p> \n<p>He also had some words of advice for Nick Kyrgios over the standards required in the famous grounds. “There have to be boundaries. I think that when he learns that people will relax and enjoy his personality and character. There are ballboys and ballgirls, there are spectators, there are TV viewers and people don’t want to watch and hear players go over the line into something that is unseemly.”</p> \n<p>Lewis embodies the understated but quietly ambitious modus operandi of the modern Wimbledon – one minute talking enthusiastically about Andy Murray’s form and the next its global brand building ambitions in China and elsewhere. “We’ve got the best of both worlds – some lovely facilities for hospitality and debentures, a royal box that is very special and probably as good as it gets in sport. And then one of the very best public experiences.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/11/1436622357074/Richard-Lewis-Wimbledon-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Richard Lewis has expressed his desire for the BBC to remain as sole broadcasters of the Wimbledon championships.
