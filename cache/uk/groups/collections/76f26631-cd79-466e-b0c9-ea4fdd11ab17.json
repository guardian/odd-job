But do they have to be so complicated? The Guardian’s restaurant critic considers five modern masterpieces, from the Ledbury and Sat Bains, to Hedone and the Sportsman</p>","byline":"Marina O'Loughlin","body":"<p>It was <a href=\"http://noma.dk\">Noma</a> that started it. When Copenhagen’s two Michelin star restaurant first launched its now legendary signature dish – vintage carrots with camomile – in the Noughties, a generation of chefs gasped in awe and reached for their tweezers. Suddenly, vegetables everywhere were to be lightly pickled and teased into decorative little tubes of myriad colours, tottering down a specially designed plate in a wave of exquisiteness.</p> \n<p>But they were still just vegetables, right? Did the intricate and painstaking presentation make them taste any better? Apparently so: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2014/jun/20/food-presented-artistically-taste-salad-kandinsky\">a research team at Oxford University found last year</a> that a salad plated up to resemble a Kandinsky painting was judged by human guinea pigs to be more delicious than exactly the same ingredients delivered any old how. Beauty, as ever, matters.</p> \n<p>If almost every high-end restaurant in the world is to be believed, how their dishes look is right up there with flavours and ingredients. Gone are the 1990s, when food came in vertiginous towers that required servers to have the balancing skills of a circus act. Today, a dish’s components must appear to have been insouciantly strewn by Tinker Bell in a bewitching melee of dots and splodges and tiny, edible flowers.</p> \n<p>It’s no coincidence that the practitioners of high culinary art tend to be fans of vegetables (and foraged produce from fields and hedgerows). A vast chunk of charred meat might get the juices going, but it’s unlikely to win any beauty contests. So in Paris, Alain Passard “strangles” charred baby onions with a little tangle of twine, or twists leaves of mandolined courgettes into the shape of blowsy roses and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arpegelive\">plays with colour like an artist</a>: blue potatoes and purple carrots. One of the most visually striking cookery books of recent times is <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/alexis-gauthier-vegetronic.html\">Vegetronic, by Alexis Gauthier</a>, whose <a href=\"http://www.gauthiersoho.co.uk/vegetronic.php\">acid-drenched colours frame dishes of painterly loveliness</a>. And <a href=\"http://www.theethicurean.com/\">the Ethicurean</a> in Bristol, whose ingredients frequently come from its ancient walled garden, will <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=576468845764361\">tile a plate with almost translucent slices of different-coloured beetroots</a> until it looks “like a stained-glass window”.</p> \n<p>Diana Henry is the author of another book rammed with pupil-dilating, photogenic food: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/05/change-of-appetite-diana-henry-review-cookworm\">Change Of Appetite</a> (I can’t stop perving over her perfect, limpid <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/469852173600313212/\">poached white peach with rose jelly</a>). I ask her why the appearance of what she eats is important. She is adamant: “I honestly think that if a plate of food looks good, it can taste better.” Eating isn’t simply about taste. Cliches are cliches for a reason, hence “you eat with your eyes”.</p> \n<p>Anyone who’s ever wandered in a mesmerised trance around Tokyo’s dazzling depachikas – the football pitch-sized food halls underneath department stores – can’t fail to realise how important the visuals of food are to the Japanese, from jewel box-like bento to a single, perfect melon wrapped in tissue paper and presented in a gilded box. The Japanese fetish for beauty in food – which covers everything from crockery to glassware to the correct use of negative space – even has a name: <em>moritsuke</em>. Food slants like a cedar tree (<em>sugimori</em>) or is high like a mountain (<em>takamori</em>). Their <em>kaiseki-ryori</em> (haute cuisine raised to an art form) is about presentation every bit as much as the unimpeachable quality of the ingredients: nothing is ever left to chance. And culinarily, where Japan leads, the world follows.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If a plate of food looks good, it can taste better</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Diana Henry</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I wonder what an artist might make of it. Apart from musing on something that occurs to a lot of us when presented with the over-elaborate dish (“Someone’s been fingering that for quite a while”), <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2014/oct/04/grayson-perry-dress-tranny-art-who-are-you-tv\">Grayson Perry</a> has a typically perceptive take: “Square plates – especially rough-hewn glass ones – seem to be an unofficial warning that the food is likely to be all show and no taste. I’m also averse to smears on the porcelain.” He makes me howl with laughter at a current gastropub trope: “I went to one place where the chips were served in a little galvanised pail, but went off the idea when I discovered their urinals were made from larger galvanised pails.” This is an unfortunate side-effect of the restaurateur failing to think his <em>moritsuke</em> through.</p> \n<p>I can only nod in enthusiastic agreement when Henry says, “I have a belief that the small things in life are very important. If we don’t get pleasure from the small things, the rather ordinary things, then we’re stuffed. Caring about making your food look lovely is part of that. Cumulatively, it makes you happier, however mad that sounds.” An independent observer of the Oxford experiment came to the conclusion that, yes, expectations were raised by the artistry on the plates and that, crucially, this meant people were prepared to pay more for beautiful food. They seemed a little perplexed by the discovery. How daft: of course we prize beauty. I just wouldn’t try this at home.</p> \n<h2>Flame-grilled mackerel with avocado, Celtic mustard and shiso: the Ledbury, London W11 </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bebd1b533c5cee60e4b0a3735f8b571f800bd627\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435826840320/b1d499bd-7cd1-4f54-9d04-6c4f97fddc3c-420x420.png\" alt=\"Flame-grilled mackerel with avocado, Celtic mustard and shiso: the Ledbury, London W11.\" width=\"420\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flame-grilled mackerel with avocado, Celtic mustard and shiso at the Ledbury, London W11: ‘Today, a dish’s components must appear to have been insouciantly strewn by Tinker Bell in a bewitching melee of dots and splodges and tiny, edible flowers.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Franke for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ol> \n <li>The mackerel is pan-roasted until its flesh is oily and tender; its skin is then flamed over stone until it’s a crackly mackintosh of just-charred crispness.</li> \n <li>Pillows of cucumber agar-agar (a jellying agent) with a filling of mackerel tartare, plus the sting of shiso and the balm of avocado.

Closer to home, David Gerran, bar manager of <a href=\"http://thewhipmayfair.co.uk\">The Whip in Mayfair</a>, has mixed this twist on the julep for me on many occasions, and I’ve coaxed the recipe from his chilled, minty fingers. The key to a great julep is in the careful handling of the mint. These drinks were originally served in pewter tins, but if you don’t have one, a tin camping mug works just fine (or, provided it’s got no sharp edges, the empty tin your apricots were in). Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>1 tin apricots – you’ll need 25ml tinned juice for each serving<br />8 mint leaves, plus 1 extra to serve<br />50ml bourbon</strong></p> \n<p>Drain the apricots, saving the juice in a jug (eat the fruit separately – I like them with thick cream or ice-cream, which reminds me a bit of school dinners). Put the mint leaves in the empty tin, then squish into the sides and base of the tin with the back of a spoon: you want to impart a minty flavour over as much of the walls of the tin as you can. Pour in the bourbon, then fill the tin with crushed ice. Pour 25ml tinned apricot juice over the ice, and garnish with fresh mint. Sip slowly.</p> \n<h2><strong>Common or garden G&amp;T</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a8fbf80f8a4c173c563efdd1d6ef50bf7aaad820\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673613123/33654967-82e7-44b5-899c-45c3a92b4358-193x420.jpeg\" alt=\"G&amp;T\" width=\"193\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Best drunk propped up on one elbow while lying on a lawn. The bay and sage should be easy to find or “forage” from a park or neighbour’s garden. Gnome optional. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>35ml gin (<a href=\"http://www.sipsmith.com\">Sipsmith’s</a>, for preference)<br />Tonic water (<a href=\"http://www.fever-tree.com\">Fever-Tree</a>, for preference)<br />1 fresh bay leaf<br />1 sage leaf<br />1 lemon wedge</strong></p> \n<p>Fill a large wine glass with ice cubes. Add the gin, top with tonic to taste, and add the bay and sage. Squeeze over the lemon wedge, then drop it into the glass, stir and sip.</p> \n<h2><strong>Vodka martinez</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"90725c112439f0ca68c1d3ffc265175596eae2c8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673023091/2722c33e-5c86-455c-a492-78cea9012b46-205x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Vodka Martinez\" width=\"205\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>The martinez is the father of the martini. Brian Silva of <a href=\"http://balthazarlondon.com\">Balthazar in Covent Garden</a> has mixed one for me more times than I care to remember (or should that be am able to remember?). He uses vodka instead of the gin, and I haven’t looked back since my first sip. The vodka isn’t as domineering, so the aromatics in the vermouth are free to play. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml sweet vermouth<br />15ml vodka <br />4 drops maraschino<br />1 lemon twist</strong></p> \n<p>Chill a sherry glass or coupe. Put the vermouth, vodka and maraschino in a shaker, add ice and stir until chilled. Strain into the glass, squeeze the lemon twist over the drink and discard the lemon. Sip away.</p> \n<h2><strong>Somerset appletini</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"05392f5fcb1bbf4182443a39879715f73298c7de\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673077346/8c0a63b6-d06f-4c50-a3a0-99a4c51b9b08-333x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Somerset appletini\" width=\"333\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A Somerset take on the martini, though it actually has very little incommon with that sweet cocktail. The apple part is purely a reference to the eau du vie made by <a href=\"http://www.ciderbrandy.co.uk\">Cider Brandy God Julian Temperley</a>. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>35ml Somerset apple eau du vie<br />15ml Noilly Pratt<br />1 lemon twist</strong></p> \n<p>Chill a coupe glass. Combine the eau du vie and vermouth in a shaker, stir until chilled, then double strain into the glass. Squeeze the lemon twist over the drink and drop into the glass.</p> \n<h2><strong>Michelada</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aea3449666079ae212cf87e0770e68cceea9eaf8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673125275/0443b2fa-87e0-4a2f-9348-4ed0d2e7c000-319x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Michelada\" width=\"319\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>West Country meets Mexico in this gorgeous summer drink. Trust me on this one: the combination of tomato, spice, salt, acidity and beer is brilliant. Also great served as a small shot alongside a healthy measure of good tequila (in Mexico, this is known as sangrita). Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml tomato juice<br />25ml apple juice<br />Juice of &frac12; lime <br />1 tsp chipotle paste<br />1 dash <a href=\"http://www.cholula.com\">Cholula sauce</a><br />1 lime wedge <br />Sea salt, for the rim<br />Chapel Down’s <a href=\"http://www.chapeldown.com/curious-brew\">Curious Brew lager</a> (or any other good British lager)</strong></p> \n<p>Mix all of the ingredients except the beer. Roll the rim of a highball or half-pint glass in coarse sea salt and fill with ice. Pour in the mix, add the lime wedge and top with beer. Make more immediately.</p> \n<h2><strong>White Russian</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"705627e82a039d28bf4ae49919f2b9b0d2d22d6f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673199191/ed7bfad6-d294-4c16-9fcc-3723abd7420e-240x420.jpeg\" alt=\"White Russian\" width=\"240\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>This simple cocktail gives the drinker a white moustache. Made famous by <a href=\"http://\">the Dude in The Big Lebowski</a>, white Russian has a creamy texture, obviously, and a sweet, boozy finish. I like to use <a href=\"http://www.blackcow.co.uk\">Black Cow vodka</a> here: it’s distilled from milk, so seems very fitting, plus it’s made in Dorset. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml Black Cow vodka<br />25ml Kahlua <br />25ml cream<br />Swizzle stick, to serve</strong></p> \n<p>Fill a tumbler with cubed ice. Add the vodka and Kahlua, and stir. Carefully pour on the cream – you want it to stay on top in a distinct layer – and serve with a swizzle stick.</p> \n<h2><strong>Strawberry, lemonade and mint</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"75c1b8e25d410e682e6ba8fd1c794ec8f85d9de7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673246934/c4694a0f-49ab-4a7b-b6fa-d25369b89498-202x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Strawberry cocktail\" width=\"202\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A thirst-quenching number with an almost sherbety finish for any alcohol-abstainers at your gathering (and also rather splendid dosed with a shot of vodka or gin). Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>3 strawberries<br />125ml <a href=\"http://www.fentimans.com\">Fentimans Victorian lemonade</a> (or other cloudy lemonade)<br />1 small handful fresh mint<br />1 sprig fresh mint and 1 strawberry, to garnish</strong></p> \n<p>Put three strawberries in the base of a highball glass and muddle (ie, bash) until smooth. Add the handful of mint, gently muddle again, then top with lemonade and stir to mix. Top with ice and garnish with a sprig of mint and a whole strawberry.</p> \n<h2><strong>Honey sazerac</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"db6c3db5228d69d622a36e7cd6aa43edf2650ff8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673310086/deaae14e-aba0-4ae3-9f1c-567af9b10474-257x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Honey\" width=\"257\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A strong drop that makes a superb closer to an evening. I’ve used honey rather than the more usual sugar, because I find that gives a smoother finish; the dash of absinthe leaves a heady, aniseed coating on the glass. If you’re making a batch, serve from a jug with lots of ice, and sip from a set of chilled small cups or shot glasses. Sometimes drinking from tiny vessels gives a very different perspective on life. Serves two.</p> \n<p><strong>1 dash absinthe<br />50ml rye whisky<br />1 tsp honey<br />3 dashes Peychaud’s bitters<br />1 dash Angostura bitters <br />Lemon twist, to garnish</strong></p> \n<p>Swirl the absinthe and a little ice around your chosen drinking vessels. Put the whisky, honey and both bitters in a shaker, and stir to dissolve the honey. Add ice and stir again for 30 seconds. Tip out the ice and absinthe from the glasses (or drink it: no one’s watching) and fill with fresh ice. Strain the shaker into two glasses, squeeze a lemon twist over each drink and drop in.</p> \n<h2><strong>Storm in a teacup</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"589f2c30e7635eeeec63ec2b7672eb0e4a47c3ca\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673359286/6a9faf01-04fd-4332-a896-556fb6512bfa-291x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Storm in teacup\" width=\"291\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>This is essentially a dark’n’stormy served in a teacup: a perfect way to disguise daytime drinking. If anyone asks, it’s darjeeling. The rosemary adds a savoury, herbal note. Serves two.</p> \n<p><strong>100ml <a href=\"http://www.goslingsrum.com\">Gosling’s rum</a> <br />25ml lime juice<br />250ml <a href=\"http://www.fentimans.com\">Fentimans ginger beer</a><br />2 slices fresh lime<br />2 rosemary sprigs</strong></p> \n<p>Combine the rum, lime juice and ginger beer in a teapot with plenty of ice, and stir. Pour into teacups (saucers obligatory), and garnish with a slice of lime and a rosemary sprig.</p> \n<h2><strong>Marmalade punch</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bb11d732fcba6581bfd63e6514c1055bb4a3e8ba\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673403359/4ff25856-5ffd-4a88-b206-c4b5bfd67ff1-348x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Marmalade\" width=\"348\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Just the ticket for a summer party: it has a gentle heat, and the whisky, orange and ginger are all fitting companions. The overarching flavour is one of marmalade. If Paddington Bear were old enough to drink, and also not a bear, this would be his drink of choice. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>500ml cloudy apple juice<br />250ml Fentimans ginger beer <br />100ml whisky<br />2 dashes Angostura orange bitters<br />Juice of &frac12; lemon <br />8 slices orange</strong></p> \n<p>Put everything bar four slices of orange into a large jar or jug with lots of ice. Stir, pour into tankards, peg an orange slice to the side of each and swig. Dead posh, this.</p> \n<h2><strong>White sangria</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"86777cef50044ecf7b58438b0e38217cde1e36dd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673489268/5a77e0ab-c253-4730-afef-d510dc8b04de-285x420.jpeg\" alt=\"white sangria\" width=\"285\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A gorgeous, fruity number in which the basil draws the drink towards a more aromatic and savoury conclusion. Thoroughly grown-up. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>6 strawberries<br />30g sugar<br />1 750ml bottle sauvignon blanc<br />Juice from 1 lemon<br />1 small apple, sliced<br />1 small handful fresh basil leaves</strong></p> \n<p>An hour ahead, cut the strawberries in half and sprinkle with sugar: the sugar will draw out flavour and form a syrup. Combine everything in a large jug, making sure to scrape in all the sugary strawberry juice, top with ice and stir. Serve in chilled tumblers or rocks glasses.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jackabevan\">Jack Adair Bevan</a> is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.theethicurean.com\">The Ethicurean in Bristol</a>.

friends and family, gossip and kick back. Much of the work involved in this summery menu can be done in advance. All you have to do when your guests turn up is chuck a couple of ingredients on the barbecue and toss together a salad. That leaves you plenty of time to enjoy being outside as much as possible. Have fun.</p> \n<h2><strong>Grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7431b8da468f23e6cbdd701b01b8b697042df51\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435682683820/a9176f92-f820-4d11-bbbe-7c605c8a9775-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds: ‘A perfect first course for sunshine and the outdoors.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Halloumi is a wonder ingredient, and at its best when introduced to some heat, ideally flame. Here, slices of halloumi are whipped straight from the barbecue to the platter (it doesn’t do sitting around very well), then tossed with juicy peaches, wafer-thin ribbons of courgette and almonds fried in butter. It’s a perfect first course for sunshine and the outdoors. Serves six to eight.</p> \n<p><strong>6 small courgettes<br />4 peaches, peeled, stoned and cut into thickish wedges<br />1 big handful mint leaves, roughly chopped<br />Juice of 1 large lemon<br />4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br />20g butter<br />Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />50g skin-on almonds, roughly chopped<br />&frac14; tsp paprika <br />500g halloumi, cut into 1cm-thick slices</strong></p> \n<p>Light the barbecue an hour before you want to eat (failing that, use a griddle pan). Peel the courgettes into long, thin strips with a vegetable peeler, rotating them as you do so and stopping before you get to the seedy centre (keep the middles for stewing in olive oil for a soup or side dish the next day). Put the ribbons in a salad bowl with the peach wedges, mint, lemon juice and three tablespoons of oil, toss gently but thoroughly and set aside.</p> \n<p>Put a small frying pan on a medium heat, add the butter and season generously. Swirling the pan constantly, melt the butter and cook for two to three minutes, until it starts darkening. Add the chopped almonds and paprika, cook for another minute or two, until the butter is a dark, biscuity colour and the almonds are golden, then scatter over the salad.</p> \n<p>Rub the slices of halloumi in the remaining tablespoon of oil, then lay on the hottest part of the barbecue (or on a heated griddle pan). Grill for 30-60 seconds on each side, until char marks appear and the cheese softens. Cut each halloumi slice in half, toss into the salad and taste: you may want a scrunch of black pepper, a sprinkling of sea salt, a squeeze more lemon or a touch more olive oil. Adjust accordingly and serve at once.</p> \n<p><strong>Barbecued rabbit (or chicken) with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f5933327bd4f4f84001da3641c975c1790570dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435683145236/ea3b7813-2416-484d-a2aa-b7db15f5dcfc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' barbecued rabbit with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ barbecued rabbit with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli: ‘Sensational.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’ve used free-range farmed rabbit here, which is really tender and tasty, but skin-on chicken thighs or even a whole spatchcocked chicken will work just as well. The combination of the black, herby rub, sweet tomatoes and garlicky mayonnaise is sensational. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>3 bunches fresh thyme, 1 bunch picked and finely chopped<br />1 bunch fresh mint<br />5 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped <br />Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />2 farmed rabbits, jointed into 8 pieces (or chicken thighs)<br />80ml extra-virgin olive oil<br />2 punnets cherry tomatoes, halved<br />A few splashes red-wine vinegar </strong></p> \n<p>For the a&iuml;oli<br /><strong>2 egg yolks<br />1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed to a paste with a little salt<br />1 tsp Dijon mustard<br />750ml mild olive oil <br />Juice of &frac12; lemon</strong></p> \n<p>Put the barbecue on about an hour before you want to eat. Put two dry frying pans on a medium-high heat and divide between them two of the bunches of thyme and the mint. Dry-toast the herbs, shaking the pan every so often, until they have blackened and the room is smelling fragrant – about 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>Put two-thirds of the garlic, the chopped thyme and a big pinch of salt in a mortar and bash with a pestle until you have a green paste (or use a food mixer). Pull the leaves from the burnt herbs, add these to the mortar and bash again until broken down and thoroughly mixed in. You should now have a blackish rub. Season generously, transfer to a large bowl and mix in the lemon zest. Add the rabbit pieces and rub them all over with the marinade.</p> \n<p>For the a&iuml;oli, put the egg yolks, garlic, mustard and a generous pinch of salt into a food processor and blitz briefly. With the motor running, very slowly drip the oil through the funnel of the processor, until the mayonnaise starts to thicken and emulsify, then pour in the remaining oil in a slow, steady stream. Loosen with lemon juice and a few tablespoons of water, season to taste and transfer to a bowl.</p> \n<p>Put the oil and the rest of the garlic in a small saucepan over a medium heat. Once the garlic begins to bubble in the oil, cook for a minute or two to soften, then stir in the tomatoes and season generously. Cover with a lid, turn the heat right down and poach gently for 10 minutes, until the tomatoes have softened. Season with the vinegar to taste, and set aside.</p> \n<p>Once the barbecue is ready (ie, when you can hold your hand over the coals for only about five seconds before it gets too hot for comfort), put the rabbit legs and shoulders on the grill. After five minutes, add the belly pieces and, five minutes later, the ribs and saddle. Turn the pieces frequently until charred all over, brushing them with any leftover marinade as they cook – it should take 15-20 minutes from start to finish. (To check that the meat is done, cut into a thick piece.) Pile the cooked rabbit on to a large plate, squeeze over some lemon juice, then spoon on the juicy tomatoes, followed by the a&iuml;oli. Serve at once.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26d235d0cb1ebf1d305499af9aa58c0efbe7239d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435744594796/393c318f-2ca4-4d4d-9391-486a1afcee3f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart: 'Low in gluten.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart: ‘Low in gluten.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This delicious cocoa-rye pastry comes from <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/tartine-2.html\">Chad Robertson’s amazing book Tartine 3</a> (&pound;24.99, Chronicle Books). It gives the sweet cardamom custard a crisp, grown-up, dark chocolate edge. It’s also very low in gluten. Serve with a bowl of fresh raspberries alongside. You’ll need a 26cm tart tin. Serves 12-16.</p> \n<p>For the cocoa-rye pastry<strong><br />500g unsalted butter<br />200g caster sugar<br />1 large egg plus 1 yolk, at room temperature<br />&frac12; tsp vanilla extract<br />280g rye flour, sifted<br />170g cocoa powder, sifted, plus extra for dusting</strong></p> \n<p>For the cardamom custard<strong><br />350ml whole milk<br />350ml double cream<br />6 cardamom pods, seeds crushed<br />Seeds from 1 vanilla pod<br />10 egg yolks<br />120g caster sugar</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. To make the pastry, beat the butter and sugar with a paddle mixer until soft and a pale cream colour – this will take a few minutes. Beat in the whole egg, then the yolk, and stop the mixer. Scrape down the sides and beat in the vanilla, followed by the flour and cocoa, until thoroughly combined. Transfer the pastry to a large piece of clingfilm, pat into a rectangle and refrigerate for at least an hour, until firm.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, make the custard. Put the milk, cream, cardamom, vanilla seeds and pod into a saucepan and bring to simmering point. Simmer gently for three minutes, then set aside for 10 minutes to infuse. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl, until light and pale. Discard the vanilla pod, then whisk the warm milk into the eggs and pour into a jug.</p> \n<p>Divide the dough in two and freeze half for another day. Dust both sides of the remaining dough lightly with cocoa powder and roll out between two large pieces of baking paper or clingflim, rotating as you do, until it’s an even thickness of about 4mm. Carefully roll the pastry on to the rolling pin and transfer to a 26cm tart tin. Press firmly into all the corners of the tin, leaving an overhang of roughly 0.5cm. Trim off any excess dough.</p> \n<p>Freeze the pastry case for 15 minutes, then line with baking paper, fill with baking beans and blind bake for 20 minutes, until slightly puffed up. Remove the paper and beans, and bake for 10-15 minutes longer, until the case is completely cooked (take care not to burn it, so check after 10 minutes).</p> \n<p>Turn down the oven to 140C/285F/gas mark 1. Run a sharp knife along the edges of the tart shell to neaten it, then pour in the custard, filling it up right to the brim. Bake in the centre of the oven for about 50 minutes, until just set – it shouldn’t wobble in the centre when you gently shake the tin. Leave the tart to cool completely, and serve with fresh raspberries.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of

After all, we’ll have already spent the morning sampling a fresh batch of cookies from the bakery next door; followed that with an olive oil tasting for our webstore; then moved on to the first trial of a dish that’s been going around in my head for a few days; and maybe also got to the third take of another recipe that is <em>almost</em> there. In my world, proper sit-down lunches are mostly for weekends.</p> \n<p>Our test kitchen is in a railway arch, and trains regularly thunder overhead, so it’s easy to feel cut off from the seasons. Every once in a while, however, the sun lures us outside to eat, and it’s at such moments – away from the stove, computer, fridges and sinks of the test kitchen – that I’m reminded of what all the creating, testing, tweaking and writing of recipes is really about. And that is to bring together people who dig each other to eat, drink and be merry.</p> \n<h2><strong>Rhubarb, fennel and celery salad</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74e6717693aff84b2ad9845e13d7221b82564bd8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435680241140/01f17a10-b2fa-49b8-98c6-4a8a6b1a9ad7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi's rhubarb, fennel and celery salad: 'A refreshing starter.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s rhubarb, fennel and celery salad: ‘A refreshing starter.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Don’t dress the salad until just before you serve it, otherwise it will wilt and look unappetising – if you’re taking it on a picnic, pack the dressing separately. It works as a refreshing starter or alongside some fish or meat. A few tablespoons of fresh pomegranate seeds (40g or so) makes a very tasty, not to mention pretty, addition on top. If possible, use a mandoline to cut the fennel, rhubarb and celery. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>3 tbsp olive oil<br />2 tbsp lemon juice<br />1 tbsp maple syrup<br />Salt and black pepper<br />1 large fennel bulb, trimmed and shaved widthways into 2mm slices <br />1 stick rhubarb, trimmed and cut on an angle into 2mm slices<br />4 sticks celery, trimmed and cut on an angle into 2mm slices<br />20g basil leaves, roughly torn<br />15g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped<br />10g dill leaves, roughly chopped<br />2 tsp fennel seeds, toasted and roughly crushed</strong></p> \n<p>Put the oil, lemon and syrup in a large bowl with half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper.

Using your hands, shape the mixture into about 35 meatballs, each weighing about 25g and 2.5cm wide.</p> \n<p>Put a large saute pan on a medium-high heat with two tablespoons of oil. Once hot, add half the meatballs and fry for four minutes, turning them every now and then, so they brown all over. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining meatballs.</p> \n<p>When you’ve transferred the second batch of meatballs to the plate, add the onion, carrot, fennel and remaining oil to the pan, turn down the heat to medium and fry gently, stirring frequently, for eight minutes, until softened and golden brown. Add the cumin, chilli, cinnamon and tomato paste, cook for a minute more, then add the stock, tomatoes and a third of a teaspoon of salt. Turn the heat to medium-low and simmer gently for 15 minutes, or until the sauce has slightly thickened. Return the meatballs to the pan, and cook for 10 minutes, until the sauce is thick and the meatballs are cooked through.</p> \n<p>Remove the pan from the heat and serve at once, with the following rice dish alongside, some yoghurt spooned on top (or in a bowl on the side) and the remaining parsley sprinkled on top. </p> \n<h2><strong>Clove and cardamom rice</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09088daa1b73659ec30a47ec7bcf6e916f4803e3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435680615523/e7f81ef9-cea3-412b-834d-cf3a3a7512e2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi's clove and cardamom rice: 'A simple dish.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s clove and cardamom rice: ‘A simple dish.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This simple side dish is a sneak preview from my new book, <a href=\"http://www.eburypublishing.co.uk/editions/nopi-cookbook/9780091957162\">Nopi: The Cookbook</a>, which is out in September. I love to crunch into the whole cloves and cardamom pods, but if you’re not so keen, pick them out before serving. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>1 tbsp olive oil<br />10 whole cloves<br />10 cardamom pods, lightly crushed<br />250g basmati rice, well rinsed<br />Coarse sea salt and black pepper<br />430ml boiling water</strong></p> \n<p>Put the oil and spices in a medium saucepan for which you have a lid, and put on a medium-high heat. Cook for two minutes, stirring continuously, until the cardamom starts to turn golden, then add the rice, one and a quarter teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Cook, stirring, for a minute, then pour in the boiling water and turn down the heat as low as it can go. Stir once, cover, and leave for 12 minutes (no peeking). Remove the pan from the heat, take off the lid and quickly cover the pan with a clean tea towel. Put the lid back on, set aside for 10 minutes, then uncover, fluff up the rice with a fork (any grains that were stuck to the bottom will now come off easily) and serve hot.</p> \n<h2><strong>Plum and rum ice-cream</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ce210f0050baedd2d9e78806e40042bdc436301\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435680775717/96881740-4a1a-4551-8658-e0cdbaf5359c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi's plum and rum ice-cream: 'Decadent and punchy.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s plum and rum ice-cream: ‘Decadent and punchy.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is everything I want from a summer pudding: light and fragrant enough to justify the season, but decadent and punchy enough to make it worth having.

Pour over the sugary rum and bake for 20 minutes, until soft and caramelised. Remove and set aside to cool for 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>Put all the syrup from the baking tray and 250g of the cooked plums (ie, about a quarter of them) in the small bowl of a food processor, blitz smooth, then set aside. Set aside the remaining baked plums until later, too (or, if you’re planning to serve this the next day, keep them in the fridge).</p> \n<p>Put the cream, milk, cardamom, orange skin and juice, and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt in a large saucepan, and cook on medium heat for about five minutes, stirring regularly, until it is almost coming to a boil. Remove from the heat and set aside to infuse for at least 20 minutes.</p> \n<p>Add the pureed plum mix to the cream mix and warm gently for five minutes. Put the egg yolks in a large bowl with the remaining 110g sugar and whisk until smooth. Add a ladleful of the creamy plum mix to the egg, whisking continuously, then repeat ladle by ladle until it is fully incorporated.</p> \n<p>Clean the saucepan, add the custard mix and cook on a medium-low heat for five to six minutes, stirring continuously, until it has thickened and you can draw a clear line through it with the back of a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p> \n<p>Once the mixture is cool, strain it, then stir in the remaining three tablespoons of rum. Pick out and discard the orange skin and cardamom, then pour into an ice-cream machine and churn for about an hour, until thick and almost set. Transfer to a plastic container, cover and freeze for at least three hours until set. If it’s frozen for more than five hours, you’ll need to take the ice-cream out of the freezer 30 minutes before serving, to soften.</p> \n<p>To serve, scoop the ice-cream into bowls and top with the reserved baked plums.</p> \n<p> <span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/\">Ottolenghi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/locations\">Nopi</a> in London.</p> \n<p><strong>Fiona Beckett’s wine matches </strong>Chorizo meatballs suggest a Spanish red, but rioja is not the only game in town: try the vibrant, juicy <a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/mesta-tempranillo-old-vines-case-of-6/p/p60070320?OmnitureRedirect=mesta+tempranillo\"><strong>Mesta Organic Old Vine Tempranillo 2014</strong></a> (14% abv), from the relatively unknown Ucl&eacute;s region – it’s a bargain at &pound;8 from Marks &amp; Spencer.

Provence","standFirst":"<p>Celebrate the British summer by watching the tennis and eating a meal from ... Provence. This fragrant and flavourful pissaladiere oozes sunny spirit and is so easy you’ll smash it: game, set and match... </p>","byline":"Henry Dimbleby and Jane Baxter","body":"<p>Wimbledon is here, so it must be time for the English to eat al fresco. This week’s recipes for outdoor eating, however, have a Gallic inspiration, because to me, perversely, Wimbledon always conjures up the flavours of France. The Proustian roots of this connection are somewhat tangled. I have a feeling it goes back to 1983, and the semi-final between Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe. I was 13, a plump and increasingly self-conscious boy. School had broken up early, so I had gone to stay with a friend’s parents in France. We all gathered to watch the match in the rather grand, formal sitting room in their diplomatic residence.</p> \n<p>Ignoring the anxious mutterings of my friend’s mother, I took a berth on the window seat, with my back slouched against the windowpane. When Lendl (for some reason my childhood hero) pulled off a rare stroke of genius, I made a clumsy, air-punching convulsion and heard a terrible crack behind me, followed by a rush of air around the ears as I somersaulted backwards through the broken window and landed with a <em>plumph</em> on the flower bed outside.</p> \n<p>I was physically unscathed, but the embarrassment of that moment – looking back up at the window, and seeing the entire party staring back at me, agog – makes it easily my most vivid Wimbledon memory.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I somersaulted backwards through the broken window and landed with a plumph on the flower bed outside</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>There was a silver lining, however, and that was that my friend’s mum was an absolutely amazing cook. Both Lendl’s inevitable defeat and my shame were soon washed away by a slap-up picnic lunch in the garden. I hope this lunch will help you recover from even the gravest setbacks.</p> \n<h2><strong>Pissaladi&egrave;re</strong></h2> \n<p>You can use a flaky pastry recipe, such as the one from our <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/12/cornish-pasty-recipe-squash-blue-cheese-spinach-pecan-henry-dimbleby\">Back to Basics pasty recipe</a>. A pizza dough works too.If you are feeling rushed, bought puff pastry makes a good substitute.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6-8</strong><br />325g flaky puff pastry<br />2 tbsp olive oil<br />3 onions, cut in half and thinly sliced<br />3 red onions, thinly sliced<br />A sprig of thyme<br />1 bay leaf<br />12 anchovies in oil<br />1 garlic clove, crushed<br />A pinch of sugar<br />Salt<br />15-20 pitted black olives</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Make the pastry as directed. Wrap it in clingfilm and allow it to rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. When chilled, roll it out on a floured surface into a rough rectangle, about 2mm thick, that will fit on your baking tray. Transfer the pastry to the baking tray and rest in the fridge (or in a cool place ) for another 20 minutes.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Now prick the pastry all over with a fork and bake for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow it to cool.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> To cook the onions, heat the oil in a large, heavy-based pan. Add the thinly sliced onions along with the thyme and bay. Season and cook slowly, covered, over a low heat for about 45 minutes.</p> \n<p><strong>4</strong> Chop up 4 of the anchovies and add to the onion, along with the garlic and a pinch of sugar. Cook for another 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl to cool down.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"kitchen countdown\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt; \n&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;http://assets.guim.co.uk/stylesheets/webfonts.d35b9e8c33865a46b3231a20c9f960b0.css&quot; /&gt; \n&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/assets/stylesheets/factbox2.css&quot; /&gt; \n&lt;base href=&quot;.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; /&gt; \n&lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot; style=&quot;border-top: 2px solid #fdadba;&quot;&gt; \n &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435850374200/Countdown.png&quot; alt=&quot;clock logo&quot; height=&quot;40&quot; width=&quot;39&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 0px;&quot; /&gt; \n &lt;h1 style=&quot;color: #951c55;&quot;&gt; Kitchen Countdown &lt;/h1&gt; \n &lt;div class=&quot;boxout-primary-content&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 0px;&quot;&gt; \n  &lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-bottom: 6px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 hours (or day before)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n  &lt;ul&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Make and cook pastry&lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Cook onions&lt;/li&gt;\n   &lt;hr /&gt; \n  &lt;/ul&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n  &lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-bottom: 6px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;ul&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Prepare veg for stuffed veg and make stuffing&lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Make red pepper dressing&lt;/li&gt;\n   &lt;hr /&gt; \n  &lt;/ul&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n  &lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-bottom: 6px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.5 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;ul&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Prepare veg for ni&amp;ccedil;oise salad&lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Cook beans and eggs&lt;/li&gt;\n   &lt;hr /&gt; \n  &lt;/ul&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n  &lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-bottom: 6px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;ul&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Prepare pissaladi&amp;egrave;re and cook for 10 minutes&lt;/li&gt;\n   &lt;hr /&gt; \n  &lt;/ul&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n  &lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-bottom: 6px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 mins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;ul&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Stuff veg and cook for 20 minutes&lt;/li&gt;\n   &lt;hr /&gt; \n  &lt;/ul&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n  &lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-bottom: 6px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 mins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;ul&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Arrange salad on a platter and dress&lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Cut up pissaladi&amp;egrave;re&lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Transfer stuffed veg to platter&lt;/li&gt;\n   &lt;hr /&gt; \n  &lt;/ul&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>5</strong> Turn the oven down to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Spread the onion mix over the cooked pastry base. Split the anchovies in half lengthways and arrange on top of the onions in a lattice. Dot with the olives and bake for 10 minutes. Serve warm, or at room temperature.</p> \n<h2><strong>Stuffed vegetables</strong></h2> \n<p>2 large tomatoes<br />2-3 courgettes<br />1 small aubergine<br />50ml olive oil<br /><strong> <br />For the stuffing</strong><br />100g soft breadcrumbs<br />50g gruyere, grated <br />50g parmesan, grated <br />2 shallots, finely chopped<br />2 tbsp parsley, chopped<br />A pinch of dried thyme<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />Salt and black pepper</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Prepare the vegetables by scooping out the seeds of the tomatoes, cutting the courgettes in half lengthways and scooping out the centre parts with a melon baller a teaspoon<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Cut the aubergine horizontally into 3 rough cylinders and carefully cut out some of their centres with a knife. Drizzle all of the veg with a little olive oil and season well.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Make the stuffing by blitzing the stuffing ingredients together with the remaining oil in a food processor for 5 seconds and season well. <br /></p> \n<p><strong>4 </strong>Fill the vegetables with the stuffing and bake on a tray in a medium oven for about 20 minutes, or until soft and the tops are golden brown.</p> \n<h2><strong>Vegetable ni&ccedil;oise salad</strong></h2> \n<p>4 eggs<br />2 little gem lettuce, washed and dried<br />150g French beans<br />150g runner beans<br />1 head of fennel <br />4 radishes<br />200g new potatoes, cooked and sliced<br /><strong> <br />For the dressing</strong><br />50g piquillo peppers (or other skinned peppers)<br />Leaves from a small bunch of basil (save some for garnishing)<br />1 garlic clove, crushed<br />50ml olive oil <br />1 tbsp red wine vinegar<br />Salt and black pepper</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Cook the eggs in boiling water for 6 minutes. Remove from the pan and refresh under cold running water. Peel and quarter.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Cut the lettuce into thin wedges. Trim the French beans and blanch in boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes, until tender and “squeaky”. Refresh and drain. Top and tail the runners and cut into thin strips on the diagonal. Cook as the French beans. Toss the beans in a little olive oil and season well.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Shave the head of fennel and slice the radishes into thin rounds. Arrange these on a platter along with the lettuce, potatoes and beans.</p> \n<p><strong>4</strong> Make the red-pepper dressing by blitzing the rest of the ingredients together with a stick blender or liquidiser and season well. Drizzle over the salad. Top with the quartered eggs and extra torn basil leaves.</p> \n<p><em>Henry Dimbleby is co-founder of the natural fast-food restaurant chain Leon; Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/henrydimbleby\">@HenryDimbleby</a>.

Two things: a macaroni pie (hot water crust pastry, the kind of thing you get in a Scotch pie, stuffed with macaroni cheese) can be a thing of carbtastic beauty; and I’m moved to wonder what Gregg’s trendy new snacks for Scotland might be.

It's so perfect for a summers day lunch, and is super easy to prepare. Strawberries are the perfect salad ingredient during the summer months! They are full of Biotin which is great for strong hair and nails, and they are also full of antioxidants! It's also a great meal for the #gettheglowchallenge The recipe is now on my website (www.madeleineshaw.com) Share your recreations with me using #madeleineshaw #gettheglow Just to let you guys know, I'm doing a takeover of @condenasttraveller account today and tomorrow.

It’s not Cosentino’s idea – he picked it up from the incomparable Joe Beef in Montreal and is happy to credit the restaurant’s Fred Morin for the inspiration.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Churro ice cream\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned=&quot;&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; \n  &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; \n   &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt; \n  &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/4YUdDRIb8x/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Yes, that's a churro ice cream sandwich. 💣 late night @treat_yo_selfff #EEEEEATS #InfatuationLA @churroboroughla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n  &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by The Infatuation (@infatuation) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2015-06-26T05:05:36+00:00&quot;&gt;Jun 25, 2015 at 10:05pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Throughout the recent heatwave, I’ve found myself looking at this picture like an unreconstructed perv.

Her father, Elvio, used a recipe passed down from his own father, who worked on ranches in Argentina. A bowl was always sitting on the table, accompanying all the dishes served at their table. </p> \n<p>It was so tasty that family and friends would badger Elvio to “bottle the stuff already”. In 2013, Ailin quit her job and <a href=\"http://elvioschimi.com/\">made it her mission</a> to introduce the recipe to US homes.</p> \n<p>She tells me the condiment’s name comes from the Basque country (<em>tximitxurri</em> means a mix of everything). In Argentina, it is as common as ketchup is in the US – it’s a staple made at home, with each family having its own recipe. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5d8afef637136577716658459250549516eff68c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435854799973/42cb03b0-6e2a-4feb-b606-79522f7b8a3f-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Elvio attending to the BBQ. \" width=\"355\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elvio de los Santos attending to the <em>asado</em>.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ailin de los Santos</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Chimichurri is usually served during <em>asados </em>(barbecues) – a family event which, if you know anything about Argentina, is taken very seriously<em> </em>by all of<em> </em>its citizens. This includes construction workers, who are routinely spotted making an <em>asado</em> on the sidewalk during their lunch break. Everyone owns at least a small barbecue, and the eating experience is an entire production lasting hours.</p> \n<p>The <em>asador </em>usually starts by handing over grilled chorizo sandwiches, followed by other grilled meats; each participant picks their favourite slices, choosing between medium rare to well done cuts.</p> \n<p>Chimichurri is passed around in a big bowl with one spoon, making it a communal experience (the same goes with mate, which is shared with a straw); this is why Ailin treasures the condiment so much. Simple salads – nothing more than lettuce, tomatoes and onion – and empanadas complete the feast.</p> \n<p>There are a million other ways to eat it. I personally love it on manchego and crackers, or served on top of fried eggs with fresh tomatoes and avocados. Ailin has had it on everything – including a doughnut. Her favourite way to eat it is with potatoes, but chimichurri is also great on grilled vegetables with tofu, or on white fish.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"02369035717219348a0442094a6638018b0720a7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435861093671/a4b4c7f7-761a-4328-a105-9eccdfdc06eb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Empenadas con chimichurri\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Empenadas with chimichurri.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ailin de los Santos</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As interest in Argentinian food grows (chimichurri is now sold in Pr&ecirc;t a manger chains in the US – a sure sign of its success), a million and one recipes offer variations, urging cooks to try it with coriander or <a href=\"http://food52.com/recipes/22148-kale-chimichurri\">even kale</a>.
