Simple ideas that turn frozen bananas into instant ice-cream, peaches into ready-made bellini blocks, cherries into a chewy snack and spice up your grapes</p>","byline":"Henrietta Clancy","body":"<p>Poor fruit. There it was for years, playing the nutritious role in packed lunches, filling a bowl on the kitchen table. Bland but trustworthy; unsexy but good for you. No one questioned it, because it had always been that way; an apple a day keeps the doctor away.</p> \n<p>But then it became famous – really, really famous – as smoothified liquid. Suddenly we could all reach our five a day in five minutes flat. We could blend our fruit into oblivion and gulp the shapeless mush down for breakfast – we’d conquered our healthy-living regimes by 8am. Those were the days when blueberries were the glorified superfruit; smoothies were oft indigo. We were winning.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee7b88a24ba4b55b4a734239b07458df446760d8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436369465583/cc767fa2-9d76-424f-a074-add841d92ec8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Grapes need nothing more than a stint in the freezer to turn into self-contained mini sorbets.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grapes only need a stint in the freezer to become handy portable self-contained mini sorbets.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Then the message changed. “Eat your fruit and juice your veg,” the headlines shouted. This mantra was first voiced by a certain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_W._Walker\">raw-food enthusiast named Dr Norman Walker</a> in the 1930s, but it is arguably having a far greater moment this time round. While kale stepped into the limelight – flanked by broccoli florets and a leafy head of celery – fruit receded, tarnished and shamed by the sugar brush (a glass of juice was on par with a can of full-fat Coke If you were to leave a tooth in a glass of orange juice at night, it would most likely dissolve by the morning). Those who care about such things tranformed their Instagrammed smoothies to green, brown, and occasionally red (thanks to beetroot, the earth’s gift to Renaissance fresco makers and aesthetically aware juicing fanatics alike).</p> \n<p>So where are we now? Confused. We are fearful of fruit juice and, by proxy, wary of fruit in its natural shapely state; which is sad, because it’s summertime, and nature’s sweet-smelling bounty is weighing down vines and branches across the land. If we don’t pick and eat it, the birds will. It’s time to start eating your fruit – that’s right, using your teeth. Here are some ridiculously easy ideas to help.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d7295b6fc4555e20249dfb3a5be9e098ea5b7127\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436369609202/d29fec03-78b4-40c0-afe4-cc01d8eeeb69-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The high quantity of fruit pectins in the frozen bananas turn them into a smooth, creamy dessert.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This is plain banana - whipped, with nothing added.

Bite-sized fruits work particularly well: whole red berries freeze brilliantly, but can be a tad tart to enjoy alone – serve them with a hot white-chocolate sauce, as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/04/the-ivy-celebrities-memories\">London restaurant The Ivy</a> did in the late 2000s. Alternatively, cut strawberries and raspberries into pea-sized nuggets before freezing so they’ll work as instant fruit-filled ice bombs to fold into Eton mess, or scatter over ice creams or drinks. Simplest of all, grapes need nothing more than a stint in the freezer to turn into self-contained mini sorbets. If you want to go to a little more effort (if you can call it that), try some of these recipes:</p> \n<p><strong>Frozen banana ice-cream</strong><br />Vegans have been in the know for years – a ripe banana, sliced up and frozen, and then whipped for long enough, all alone, undergoes a transformation whereby its high quantity of fruit pectins turns it into a smooth, creamy dessert. Patience is key. Although the mixture might resemble cottage cheese for a while, it will become whipped soon enough. Dollop the “ice-cream” into bowls and scatter some berry fruit nuggets on top to serve. This is best made in small batches as the ‘ice cream’ doesn’t re-freeze well, so make just enough to eat.</p> \n<p><strong>Cocktail blocks</strong> <br />Okay, so this isn’t technically eating, but it’s too good to leave out. Turn your overripe peaches into nifty bellini blocks by peeling, blending, then freezing them into ice cubes. Simply top a cube with bubbles to order. For enough strawberry daiquiris to satiate the thirsts of four, blend 400g ripe strawberries with the juice of 2 limes and a half teaspoon of caster sugar then pour into ice-cube trays. To serve, blend the cubes with 25-35ml white rum per person and a splash of water. Pour the frozen daquiri into a glass with a lime slice to garnish the rim.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/08/kitchen-gadgets-review-food-dehydrator\">Kitchen gadgets review: My Kitchen Food Dehydrator – hardly cut and dried</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>Dry it</strong></h2> \n<p>Our gadget guru <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rhik-samadder\">Rhik Samadder</a> rates his dehydrator, but you don’t need one to make the sort of snacks for which you’ll pay through the nose in a health-food shop. All you need is an oven, preferably with a fan setting, and a day at home to patiently await the drying out of your snacks. That or another heatwave.</p> \n<p><strong>Ginger apple crisps</strong><br />Using a mandolin, slice a peeled apple into very thin slices – the thinner they are, the quicker they will dry out. Use a microplane to grate a piece of ginger and thin the resultant paste with a squeeze of lemon and a little honey. Gently mix the apple slices with the paste and place on a silicone mat or parchment paper. Set your oven to 60C fan (or the lowest setting available). The apples are ready when they are no longer soft.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51d03d80d9d10ce31ebb462d086870b29f8468a3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436370067560/f4a5de10-f778-4f9e-8755-a27eef500d3d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The cherry leather is a perfect chewy snack.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cherry leather is a perfect chewy snack.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Cherry leather</strong><br />Combine 400g cherries (stoned weight around 360g), 100ml water, the zest and juice of 1 lemon and 1 tbsp honey in a saucepan, bring to the boil, then simmer for 20 minutes. The fruit will have lost its shape and the liquid will have reduced a little. Blend until smooth. Line a baking tray with a silicone mat (or parchment paper), then pour on the mixture and use a spatula or the back of a spoon to spread it evenly across the whole baking sheet – it should be 2-3mm thick. This is a little tricky, but as long as there are no holes, you’re doing fine. Set your oven to 60C fan (or the lowest setting available).

There’s even an international chain dedicated to them. So, are they worth adopting?</p> \n<h2>The preparation</h2> \n<p>If you buy your chicken wings whole, you’ll need to separate them into the rather winsome sounding drumettes and flats. Drying them before cooking, preferably for a few hours in the fridge, as <a href=\"http://www.eburypublishing.co.uk/editions/the-chicken-book-the-definitive-cookbook-every-chicken-recipe-youll-ever-need/9780091959722\">Catherine Phipps suggests in her book Chicken</a>, or, if you don’t have the time, at least drying them with paper towels just before cooking, will help the skin to crisp up (and a chicken wing, given the scanty meat involved, stands or falls on its skin). I don’t think the wings require seasoning with salt and garlic powder, as Phipps recommends, though; although this gives them a good flavour when eaten au naturel, it clashes with the spicy, intensely savoury sauce they are tossed in later, which may be why she admits to a weakness for the odd handful “as is”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c96019d2be265cd45012dee276677b6c8cfbb78e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436351593692/f877aa18-8ee2-4987-ad52-51494c228925-460x381.jpeg\" alt=\"Catherine Phipps’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"381\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Phipps’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The coating</h2> \n<p>Early recipes don’t include any coating – the chicken is just fried as is. The Joy of Cooking, however, coats the wings with seasoned flour, while <a href=\"http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/1858-buffalo-wings\">Cook’s Illustrated goes for cornflour</a> for “an even crispier exterior”. They’re delicious, but turn flabby and disappointing far more quickly than the plain variety, especially when doused in hot buttery sauce.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9abf4f1c08123836d631888fd03cf68568dca763\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352238844/f59dfc50-8373-4def-867d-6216d7c206c7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Joy of Cooking's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Joy of Cooking’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The cooking</h2> \n<p>True bar buffalo wings are deep-fried, but many home recipes shy away from this – as Phipps perspicaciously observes: “The coating makes the wings literally drip in butter anyway, I prefer to bake them.” Alton Brown, <a href=\"http://altonbrown.com/buffalo-wings/\">the scientifically minded American television chef</a>, avoids deep-frying on the basis that “most American cooks lack access to commercial fryers” – though, presumably, they do have saucepans and stoves, which is all you need to deep-fry something. He steams them first, “to render out a lot of the fat”, then cools them to “tighten the skin” before baking. I’m impressed at how crisp both baked versions are, but the meat inside is undeniably dryer than the deep-fried wings from Saveur, The Joy of Cooking and Cook’s Illustrated. If you’re really against frying, however, Phipps’s recipe is considerably less faff than Brown’s, and works just as well – bake at 220C for 20-25 minutes on each side.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"350e244f2af06922443b5aad7220937a38de25b7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352329320/5147c0f8-59d7-4048-94e2-cba2e2869d9c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alton Brown's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alton Brown’s buffalo wings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The sauce</h2> \n<p>The original recipe is as simple as you’d expect for something allegedly knocked up on the spur of the moment in a bar: hot sauce and butter (or margarine if you’re to believe Saveur, though I can’t bring myself to give it a try because I really don’t want to eat deep-fried chicken smothered in tasteless fat). Brown adds garlic, which I really like, and Phipps, The Joy of Cooking and Cook’s Illustrated all stick some vinegar in there, too, which accentuates the natural edge of the sauce and balances the richness of the butter nicely.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41820286efa3aef3ce1d626b1ed2e0aedeaeebe9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352431066/f92fef42-2111-4a2f-9d45-8550cd403cdf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Saveur's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saveur’s buffalo wings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most recipes call for a specific brand of hot sauce: <a href=\"https://www.franksredhot.com/\">Frank’s</a>, which is a sour, piquant condiment made from cayenne peppers in Missouri, but, though it is available in this country, I think you can use whichever one you happen to like. Indeed, Cook’s Illustrated found that most of its tasters found Frank’s rather mild, so they mix it with something “a little more dynamic” but, as long as it’s hot and sour, it will work. That said, I do like the pinch of dark brown sugar the magazine adds to “round out the flavours” – but, as these depend on which sauce you use, I’d recommend tasting and adjusting to suit your palate. And, though it’s sacrilege, I’d also suggest drizzling the dressing over the wings, rather than tossing them in it – they stay crisper that way.</p> \n<h2>The blue-cheese sauce</h2> \n<p>And what’s the natural accompaniment for spicy deep-fried chicken wings? Why, a rich, salty blue-cheese dip, of course – and it should be intensely savoury, which is why The Joy of Cooking’s roquefort works better than Phipps’s stilton or Cook’s Illustrated’s mild, creamy blue. Mayonnaise supplies body, and sour cream or creme fraiche the requisite tanginess; buttermilk is too runny here, pleasingly American as it sounds. A dash of vinegar accentuates the tang, along with just a splash of sweet and intensely savoury Worcestershire sauce.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1b0378c48309d07d7d2b47f74070fcb405d7518\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352561594/2eda6752-809a-4fd9-988b-8ee0eeb598eb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cook's Illustrated's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cook’s Illustrated’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’m not keen on raw onion or dried garlic powder (the other flavours are harsh enough), and parsley, though pretty, is distractingly fresh and peppery, unlike the more harmonious chive.</p> \n<p>Serve with carrot and celery sticks and pretend it’s healthy.</p> \n<p><strong><em>(serves 4 with sides)</em></strong><br /><em>For the wings</em><br />16 wing pieces (or 8 whole wings)<br />Neutral oil, to fry<br />40g butter<br />2 garlic cloves, crushed<br />120ml sour hot sauce, eg Frank’s <br />2 tsp cider vinegar<br />1 tsp dark brown sugar<br />2 carrots, peeled and cut into batons<br />2 celery sticks, destringed and cut into lengths</p> \n<p><em>For the blue-cheese sauce</em><br />100g crumbled roquefort<br />6 tbsp sour cream or creme fraiche<br />2 tbsp mayonnaise<br />2 tsp cider vinegar<br />1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce<br />Small bunch of chives, finely chopped (optional)</p> \n<p>If you have time, remove the wings from their packet and put them on a rack above a bowl or tray in the fridge for between 1 and 12 hours.

Standard food vocab isn’t applicable: there’s no succulent, or juicy, or perfectly cooked, or fresh. The best feedback you can hope for is “Mmm, that’s dry. That’s really dry.” Still, the idea of home-desiccated strawberries, apricots and mushrooms is appealing, as a way to posh up yoghurt or flavour-inject a casserole. Lakeland’s circular dehydrator is plastic but not inelegant, with cobwebbed tiers vaguely reminiscent of the Galactic Senate from Star Wars, or at least the interior of the Welsh Assembly. There are five trays on which to array any fruit, veg and herbs you fancy; all you need do is slice and switch on. In practice, the process is not so cut and dried. Have you ever hand peeled 25 cherry tomatoes? It’s hard not to feel like life is passing you by. Slice size is a minefied, too. Too thin, you’ll end up with flavourless, disintegrating brittle. Too thick and you’ll be waiting for the rest of time. The listed drying time for a slice of banana is eight to 38 hours, a window so large you could put it on a cathedral. Luckily, I found everything was done in about seven (maybe I am good at this). Unstacking and inspecting the shriveled treasures feels less like cooking, more like pressing flowers or collecting beetles. Every specimen is shrunk to essentiality. You’re encouraged to box and label them, like a junior explorer. On tasting, the flavours are a revelation: tomatoes tangy, mushrooms more mushroomy, kale chips less annoying than expected. Some of the textures are Willy Wonka crazy: strawberries are crisp, bananas chewy. I find myself imagining jerkies, fruit leathers, raw crackers. What would happen if I stuck a cucumber in it? To be honest, the thing has a diameter the length of a Jack Russell so I’ll probably stick with a baking sheet and oven on its lowest setting. Still; I rate ya, dehydrator.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11ee2afbe5d71355684a7ea29bce50b211522e20\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436289665258/29cd8a1f-f5c4-407f-8d63-3e74abf9dd18-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Willy Wonka crazy: strawberries are crisp, bananas chewy.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willy Wonka crazy: strawberries are crisp, bananas chewy.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Any downside?</strong></h2> \n<p>It’s pretty large and gets pretty warm.

Nobody knew what a frappuccino was. Staff had to put a handwritten sign saying “milky coffee” next to the generic window sign plugging their “delicious latte”.</p> \n<p>The queue was full of fearful locals who just wanted a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/27/tea-national-disgrace-beverage-british\">pot of tea</a>.

But that’s what’s happening. </p> \n<p>As a nation, we drink about 165m cups of coffee a day. Men (1.7 cups) drink more than women (1.5 cups).

I don’t know, but the reason I don’t know is because I don’t know what Fika is. I’ve never seen a more niche magazine – and I’ve worked for the company that publishes Coin-operated Laundry Monthly and Rubber &amp; Plastics Weekly. </p> \n<p>Do I want my beans ground fine or coarse?

Well, not to the bloke who stood next to me in the latest coffee house to spring up in Manchester’s Northern Quarter recently, who spent a good 15 minutes cross-examining one of the poor baristas about which variety of Guatemalan bean he’d best be suited to.

It was one of the sweltering days we’ve been enduring recently here in New York, when the rivulets of sweat coursing down your back are sufficiently torrential to distract from the stench of baking garbage in the streets. </p> \n<p>But, yes, I wanted a hot coffee, because iced coffee is an embarrassing travesty of a beverage, and nobody should drink it. That is essentially what I told him, after pausing just long enough to launch a disparaging Twitter hashtag – #EndHotCoffeeShaming – to humiliate him for his impertinence on a global scale.</p> \n<p>While less courageous columnists confine themselves to non-controversial topics, like gun control, or how to respond to Islamic State, or the Rachel Dolezal case, I’ve got the guts to step forward and say it: iced coffee is ridiculous. <br /></p> \n<p>People used to understand this. As recently as 2001, Americans drank a relatively modest <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/magazine/content/10_21/b4179077028323.htm\">300m servings</a> of the stuff per year, but by 2009, that figure stood at 1.2bn – and now <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/growing-interest-in-cold-rtd-coffee-278400061.html\">75% of the population </a>drinks<strong> </strong>its<strong> </strong>coffee cold, at least sometimes, seemingly untroubled by the recent <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2014/07/14/iced_coffee.php\">skyrocketing in its price</a>. Or by the sticky condensation that forms on the outside of the cup. Or by the watery mess of melted ice and coffee that accumulates at the bottom, unless you’re drinking the (even more expensive) fancy version. Or by the fact – and I do mean fact – that it tastes so unpleasant.</p> \n<p>Yet the problem with iced coffee goes much deeper. It’s a fundamentally confused drink, one that can’t decide if its primary purpose is to refresh or to caffeinate the drinker. Borrowing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms\">the language of Plato</a>, you might say that iced coffee neither successfully approximates the Ideal Form of Refreshment (as does, say, <a href=\"https://www.sanpellegrinofruitbeverages.com/intl/en/pompelmo-226\">a can of grapefruit-flavored San Pellegrino</a>) nor the Ideal Form of Perking You Up (as a steaming cup of hot coffee always does). Instead, it tries and fails to do both. By the way, there’s no evidence to suggest that Plato himself ever drank iced coffee, nor any of its variants, such as the Starbucks Frappuccino™ or the <a href=\"http://www.dunkindonuts.com/dunkindonuts/en/menu/beverages/frozenbeverages/coolatta/chips_ahoy.html\">Dunkin’ Donuts Chips Ahoy!-flavored Coolatta™</a>. I don’t know about you, but this strikes me as very telling.</p> \n<p>(I admit I’ve been known to enjoy a Frappuccino from time to time, just as I’ve enjoyed an <em>affogato</em>, just as I might enjoy any other sugary snack that belongs – and this is crucial – to the category of dessert. What I don’t do is go around pretending it’s “a cup of coffee”.)</p> \n<p>Iced coffee lacks focus: it is a beverage that’s attempting, fatally, to multitask. And multitasking can lead only to disaster, as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/magazine/arianna-huffingtons-improbable-insatiable-content-machine.html?_r=0\">Arianna Huffington</a> yelled across the room to me at SoulCycle during a 3am combined meditation/exercise/napping skills class just the other day. <br /></p> \n<p>Why have so many of us fallen for this absurd beverage fashion? Perhaps it was a 2011 New York Times trend piece entitled <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/fashion/party-workouts-are-growing-in-popularity.html\">‘For Brooklynites, An Icy Drink Is Suddenly Hot’</a>. Or maybe it was the moment in 2012 when Harry Styles tweeted the words “iced coffee” to his 25m delighted followers, causing an instant worldwide shortage. In any case, it’s all a huge mistake. Because depending on humidity levels and your own physiology, drinking <a href=\"http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/06/drinking-hot-coffee-in-summer-isnt-that-weird.html\">hot coffee in hot weather</a> <em>can actually make you feel cooler anyway</em>. It triggers a disproportionate sweating response, and the heat you lose from all that sweat evaporating can exceed the heat you take in from the drink. And it isn’t repulsive-tasting, or overpriced, nor does it involve a sticky cup. This is a win-win-win-win situation, people!</p> \n<p>“But hold on a second,” said my friend Simon, when I outlined this argument to him. “You’re merely taking your subjective opinion about iced coffee and seeking to elevate it to the status of an objective argument in a manner all too typical of the contemporary web! Personally, I think iced coffee’s delicious.” Needless to say, he is dead to me now. (Because I killed him.) </p> \n<p>And as for that barista? He was hounded from his job after a successful campaign of social media shaming. He has all the time in the world to drink iced coffee now.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/c9f8b0b73ea88ee74d6fb42e006ecf8f4989bdde/172_35_1705_1023/1705.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1023,"width":1705,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"REX/Broadimage/REX/Broadimage","altText":"russell brand iced coffee","cleanCredit":"Photograph: REX/Broadimage/REX/Broadimage"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T11:30:00Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T11:50:50Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Oliver Burkeman","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/11/4/1415112352678/Oliver-Burkeman-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/oliverburkeman"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Coffee","Food & drink","Summer food and drink"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/coffee","webTitle":"Coffee"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/summer-food-and-drink","webTitle":"Summer food and drink"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Oliver Burkeman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/oliverburkeman"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/oliver-burkeman-column/2015/jul/07/iced-coffee-torturing-your-taste-buds","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4adnc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/oliver-burkeman-column/2015/jul/07/iced-coffee-torturing-your-taste-buds","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/oliver-burkeman-column/2015/jul/07/iced-coffee-torturing-your-taste-buds"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/c9f8b0b73ea88ee74d6fb42e006ecf8f4989bdde/172_35_1705_1023/1705.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1023,"width":1705,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Case closed.

Rinse 150g of freekeh in cold water, then add to the boiling water and leave to cook for 40-45 minutes until tender but slightly chewy. Drain the cooked freekeh and set aside.</p> \n<p>Peel 180g of cucumber, halve lengthways and remove the seeds, then cut the flesh into small dice. Finely chop eight chives (roughly 2 tbsp). Halve, stone and peel a ripe but firm avocado, then cut into small cubes.</p> \n<p>Warm 2 tbsp of olive oil in a shallow pan, add 2 tsp of ras el hanout and let it warm through. (It is already roasted, so a minute or two over heat is long enough.) Add a 400ml can of chickpeas, drained, and the cooked and drained wheat to the pan, together with a little salt. When the chickpeas are hot stir in the chopped cucumber, chives and avocado. Stir only gently – you don’t want to crush the avocado. Trickle over a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and serve. Enough for 2.</p> \n<h2>The trick</h2> \n<p>Freekeh is whole roasted wheat. It can take a good 45 minutes to cook, but check it after 30. It should still be nutty and enjoyably chewy. I find it best to salt it after cooking rather than adding salt to the cooking water, which sometimes seems to toughen it.</p> \n<h2>The twist</h2> \n<p>All manner of grains can be substituted for the freekeh, such as barley or rye, but the cooking times will vary according to which grain you choose. Whole grains, such as pot barely, will take longer to come to tenderness than pearl barley. Use this salad as a base for adding other ingredients as you wish, such as chopped tomatoes, mint or spring onions. You can add feta or grated ricotta salata, the aged and salted sheep’s cheese, if you wish. I sometimes add lemon juice to the warm oil and vinegar dressing.</p> \n<p><br />Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></p> \n<p>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435664438939/Freekeh-with-avocado-and--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nigel Slater's freekeh with avocado and chives recipe.

Gradually add the polenta, stirring constantly with a long wooden spoon until all the flour has been incorporated into the water and is lump-free. At this stage you must be careful that you do not splash hot polenta on to your hands. Stir the polenta constantly over not too fierce a heat for about 30 minutes, by which time it should be pulling away from the side of the pan. Add the butter, Parmesan and fontina cheese and stir well until everything has amalgamated.</p> \n<p>There are two ways of serving this: either by the spoonful on a plate or, as they traditionally do, by pouring the polenta on to large wooden board and leaving it to cool a little, then slicing it with a steel wire and putting it on a plate with the sausage stew.</p> \n<p><em>From Carluccio’s Complete Italian Food by Antonio &amp; Priscilla Carluccio (Quadrille Publishing Ltd, &pound;14.99)</em></p> \n<h2>Elizabeth David’s minestrone</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a20404904433008827721b2b36f3be50bbbe7d65\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435677590292/91dad5df-9daa-419d-a1e6-f436fd24cb3b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Minestrone\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Serves 6-8<br />&frac14;lb (115g) of <strong>dried haricot beans</strong>, 2 <strong>carrots</strong>, 2<strong> small potatoes</strong>, a small <strong>turnip</strong>, 2 <strong>onions</strong>, a piece of <strong>celery</strong>, 4 <strong>tomatoes</strong>, half a small <strong>cabbage</strong>, 2 rashers of <strong>bacon</strong>, <strong>garlic</strong>, herbs and seasoning, olive oil, a small glassful of <strong>red wine</strong>, 2oz (55g) of broken-up <strong>macaroni</strong> or <strong>spaghetti</strong>, or pastine, or any of the pasta made in small shapes, such as little stars, little shells, etc</p> \n<p>Put the haricot beans to soak overnight.

It is a summer dish, which you would make when tomatoes and basil were good and plentiful.<br /></p> \n<p>If you want to make it the day before you eat it, the flavours will have longer to infuse and it will taste even better.</p> \n<p>When you cook the sardines, it is very important to get your griddle pan really hot, otherwise the sardines will stick and you won’t be able to turn them without them breaking up.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>sardines</strong> 12 large<br /><strong>extra-virgin olive oil </strong>5 tbsp</p> \n<p>For the panzanella<br /><strong>stale Tuscan bread or ciabatta</strong> 200g, without crusts, torn up<br /><strong>white wine vinegar</strong> 4 tbsp<br /><strong>tomatoes on the vine</strong> 3<br /><strong>red onion</strong> 1 large, cut into 2cm dice<br /><strong>basil</strong> a big bunch<br /><strong>extra-virgin olive oil</strong> 5 tbsp<br /><strong>salt and pepper</strong></p> \n<p>First, get a griddle pan smoking-hot, otherwise the sardines won’t release their fat and will stick to the pan.<br /></p> \n<p>To make the panzanella: soak the bread in the vinegar. Take the tomatoes from the vine, dice and add to the bread, together with the chopped onion. Tear the basil and add that too. Add the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Stir together and set aside.</p> \n<p>Under running water, scale the sardines and then open them out, leaving the heads attached. To do this, insert a sharp filleting knife at the tail end, next to the backbone, and cut upwards, until you reach the belly of the fish. Turn the sardine over, then cut in the same way to the same point on the other side of the bone. Starting at the tail end, take the backbone between your forefinger and thumb and run them along the length of the bone up to the head. Cut across the bone at the tail end and head end and the bone should lift out, leaving the fillets still attached at the opposite side, so you can open them out like a book. At the outside of each fillet, you will see a black area with some fine bones. Just take your knife under these parts, and remove them. Then, with a pair of tweezers, take out any pin bones that may have remained in the fillets.</p> \n<p>When all the sardines are prepared, season, brush with a little of the olive oil and put on the hot grill, 6 at a time. Let them get crusty on one side (about 3 minutes), then turn over and do the same on the other side (about 2 minutes).</p> \n<p>While the sardines are cooking, spoon some of the panzanella on each serving plate, then put the sardines on top, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and serve.</p> \n<p><em>From Made in Italy by Giorgio Locatelli (Fourth Estate, &pound;26).</em><em><a

The table would be covered with a linen cloth and napkins, which she had woven from linen she had spun 35 years previously, as part of her bottom drawer. To start she would bring a steaming bowl of stracciatelle soup, the broth made from a free-range chicken. To follow, the boiled chicken would be served with extra-virgin olive oil, freshly ground black pepper and home-cured black olives, ulive strinate, a speciality of the Marche region. The freshly picked black olives are put in a sack with sea salt and hung outside for 40 days in the frosty weather.

It’s a lovely way of celebrating good-quality basil, and for me is very much a summer dish. It makes a delicious first course or a one-plate meal, especially with the addition of French beans.</p> \n<p>Making pesto properly is another good case for slow food because it should ideally be made shortly before it is eaten. It is also one of the many recipes where you need to be very flexible in terms of quantities; tasting and adjusting them during preparation is a must.</p> \n<p>To my mind there is no substitute for pounding by hand, and I recommend using a marble pestle and mortar.

The following steps must be done as quickly as possible to avoid oxidation.</p> \n<p>Put the garlic and pine nuts in a mortar and pound with the pestle until smooth.</p> \n<p>Add a few grains of the salt and some of the basil leaves, then pound the mixture, using a light circular movement of the pestle against the sides of the mortar. Repeat this process until all the basil has been pounded.</p> \n<p>When the basil drips bright green liquid, add both cheeses and mix well. Pour a thin layer of the oil over the pesto and mix very lightly.</p> \n<p>Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling, well salted water until al dente. If you plan to add beans, put them in the water at the same time as the pasta. When ready, drain the pasta, then return it to the saucepan. Add 8 tablespoons of pesto and stir well so that the pasta is fully coated.</p> \n<p>Serve in pasta plates and place a basil leaf in the centre of each portion. Grate some parmigiano on top before eating.</p> \n<p><em>From Semplice by Dino Joannides (Preface Publishing, &pound;25). <a

Tinned tuna or fresh? Rocket or cos? French beans or no? Which olives, what dressing and what to drink with it? </p>","byline":"Tony Naylor","body":"<p>Hair splitters! Finicky folk! The unbearably anally retentive! Please assemble in the e-meeting room that is theguardian.com. For <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-eat\">How To Eat </a>– the blog series charged with identifying the ideal version of Britain’s favourite dishes – is back and, this month, we’re tackling that controversial classic, tuna salad. It is the star of a million at-desk lunches (so long as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2012/nov/15/liz-kendall-tuna-salad-row\">no one nicks yours from the fridge</a>, that is), and the perfect quick fall-back meal on a hot summer’s evening, but it comes in 1,001 varieties and all but one of them is completely and utterly wrong. So, without further ado, lettuce commence. As ever, keep it cool BTL: no flakiness, no raw language, no overly salty exchanges. </p> \n<h2><strong>The tuna </strong></h2> \n<p>Way back in the mists of time (1998), when we were all obsessed with the perceived sexiness and health-giving properties of the Mediterranean diet, there might have been an excuse for using seared, thinly sliced tuna steak in a salad. We were young, we were foolish and this novelty wasn’t (from memory) &pound;30-a-kilo. But, in 2015, to do so would be a flagrant waste of that precious rosy flesh. Its delicate flavour is best savoured as a rare treat, rather than leaving it to jostle for attention in a salad of competing flavours. </p> \n<p>Instead, tinned tuna will do the job - which is not to say that all tinned tuna is created equal. There is a self-evident hierarchy of quality, both for the tuna itself (flaked useless, chunks marginally better, steaks best), and the liquid it is preserved in. Tuna in spring water or brine is dry, mealy, abominable stuff. Sunflower oil is better, but for maximum flavour it has to be in olive oil. </p> \n<p>I trust it goes without saying that you should <em>never</em> a) use smoked tuna, b) mix tuna with mayo if it is going in a salad, or c) resort to any of the infused or pre-mixed tunas that (in a damning indictment of late capitalism) proliferate in our supermarkets. A salad is no place – if, indeed, one exists – to be experimenting with tuna dressed with tomato and herbs or infused with soy and ginger. </p> \n<h2><strong>Leaves</strong></h2> \n<p>Let he who has never bought a supermarket bagged salad cast the first stone, but you cannot dispute that these sad sacks are a rip-off, and that they are a particular waste of money when it comes to tuna salad. All you want and need, here, is some clean, sweet base crunch. Cos or baby gem lettuce are the way to go; shredded or chopped in chunky hunks that are neither too small nor so big that you need to unhinge your jaw to eat them. Save your swankier salad leaves – peppery watercress, bitter radicchio, that homegrown crop of woody, horrible rocket that never seems to end – for salads where they will make a genuinely effective contribution. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a/0_425_1148_689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anchovies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anchovies can be a useful addition, as long as they are chopped for thorough distribution.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Twort/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The salad ingredients</strong></h2> \n<p>Were this a band, you now have your star lead singer (the tuna) and your tight rhythm section (the leaves) in place. It is time to add some mid-range colour: a lead guitarist, a keyboard player, backing singers, perhaps a flautist for that unexpected prog-rock interlude. Now, some of you will read the ingredients listed below and think: “Hang on, this is just a bastardised salad ni&ccedil;oise”, but what of it? The not-quite-salad-ni&ccedil;oise is – to extend this rock group metaphor way past its breaking point – like a band’s classic first album. Later, they will dabble in jazz-funk and start naming their tracks with runic symbols. Which will be interesting. In a way. But that first album, <em>Not Quite Salad Ni&ccedil;oise</em>, is the one you will always come back to.</p> \n<p>Why? Because, primarily, a great tuna salad is a fine balancing act between sharp, salty, fishy flavours and those fresher, spritzier vegetable components – which function almost as an ongoing palate cleanser, as you eat. And, while there is no need to stick faithfully to the original, the salad ni&ccedil;oise remains our most reliable outline guide as regards how to achieve that balance. Moreover, it determines the additional ingredients you might use in an eminently sensible way.</p> \n<p>The full list of acceptable/unacceptable ingredients is as follows:</p> \n<p><strong>YES</strong>: slices of waxy/new potatoes (boiled); anchovies (chopped for thorough distribution, never whole); halved, not overly ripe baby plum tomatoes; cucumber, deseeded and sliced; a small amount of finely chopped sweet red or spring onion; capers; jarred, brined green olives (save those fresh, buttery nocellera to enjoy on their own); chopped or sliced boiled egg; it’s creaminess is a fantastic contrast. A handful of finely chopped leafy, green herbs (parsley, chives, chervil, basil even) is also welcome, but not essential.</p> \n<p><strong>NO</strong>: French/green beans (vile cold, and invariably boiled to a mushy consistency); raw white onion; carrot and beetroot (whose flavours are jarring in this context); croutons (this is not a caesar salad); any chilli or feta stuffed olives (it pains me that this needs pointing out); dull black and/or shrunken purple kalamata-like olives; sliced bell pepper (whose presence in <em>any salad</em> should rightly prompt a lengthy outburst of vociferous “industrial” language). </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b4da5a26b7c4daf358669726d8688eaf69349b0\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3b4da5a26b7c4daf358669726d8688eaf69349b0/0_65_5760_3460/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not quite right\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not quite right: carrots, feta and dull black olives should be avoided.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Also, on the egg-front, please note that no one wants a tepid-to-warm, still runny poached egg on their tuna salad. There is something deeply unappetising about rogue “hot” ingredients in cold salads and/or salad leaves covered in stringy trails of translucent albumen. Moreover, that running yolk turns any tuna present into gluey, indigestible lumps. You may think a soft poached egg on a tuna salad is sophisticated, clever even. It isn’t.</p> \n<h2><strong>Dressing</strong></h2> \n<p>Step away from the pesto (it makes everything taste of, well, pesto), and dispense with that sharp-elbowed white wine vinegar. All you need here is olive oil, salt, pepper, lemon juice and dijon mustard, all smoothly emulsified in such a way that the character of each ingredient is clear, but elegantly reconciled. Whisk, taste, go.</p> \n<h2><strong>Assembly and plating </strong></h2> \n<p>Serving a salad in a deep cereal bowl makes it difficult to eat. Serving it on a plate always looks wrong. Serving it on slate, meanwhile, is a clear sign that chef needs to stop browsing inspirational tableware catalogues and actually think, practically, about how people eat.</p> \n<p>Instead, line a shallow, wide-rimmed bowl with leaves, and separately (you want those leaves to retain their distinct flavour and crunch) dress and mix the other ingredients, minus the tuna. That, similarly, should be broken into substantive chunks on top and left as a separate complementary dimension of flavour, not doused in vinaigrette.</p> \n<h2><strong>When</strong></h2> \n<p>Lunch or tea – also known, in some part of the UK, as dinner. NB. If anyone in your circle every refers to tuna salad as a “light mid-week supper” you can – after your toes have uncurled from that sudden, excruciating cramp – happily kill them in any gruesome manner you think fitting. There is not a court in the land that would convict you.</p> \n<h2><strong>Drink</strong></h2> \n<p>Crisply bitter pale ales; dry, flinty white wines; water. </p> \n<p>So, tuna salad – how do you eat yours?</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f6b5fd3d82e4a524640762ffe657f01f71e4e100/0_594_7210_4326/7210.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":4326,"width":7210,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Tuna Salad","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a/0_425_1148_689/1148.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":689,"width":1148,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Anchovies can be a useful addition, as long as they are chopped for thorough distribution.
