Slice a head of fennel in half from stem to root, then slice each half thinly.</p> \n<p>Cut a large courgette into rounds. Toss the carrots, courgette and fennel in four tablespoons of olive oil and transfer to a roasting tin. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.</p> \n<p>Pull the leaves from three or four stems of thyme and toss them with the vegetables. Season with salt and black pepper.</p> \n<p>Place a medium-sized sea bass on top of the vegetables, trickle with olive oil and season inside and out. Stuff a further three or four sprigs of thyme inside the fish’s belly.</p> \n<p>Bake for 30 minutes, until the flesh will part easily from the bones. Serves 2.</p> \n<h2>The trick</h2> \n<p>It is very easy to overcook a whole fish. Start testing if it’s done after 20 minutes. Pull away a small piece of the skin, then pull at one of the larger flakes of flesh. It should slide from the bone with only the gentlest of persuasion. To serve, peel the skin away first – it should come away easily – then gently slide the fish from its bones in as large sections as possible with the help of a palette knife.</p> \n<h2>The twist</h2> \n<p>Whole small fish can be used instead of the sea bass. Allow one per person. Use thinly sliced potatoes instead of the courgettes, green beans and carrots as the vegetables. Make a herb sauce to serve on the side, stirring lemon juice, chopped fennel fronds and capers into a thick, olive oil-enriched mayonnaise.</p> \n<p><em>Email Nigel at </em><em><a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a> </em><em>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/36be6cda4bb829c8788279714a0fb216d4a5b734/740_772_3765_2258/3765.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2258,"width":3765,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin/Jonathan Lovekin","altText":"Baked sea bass with summer vegetables Observer Magazine OM Nigel Slater Nigel's Midweek Dinner 21/6/2015","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/Jonathan Lovekin"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T11:00:03Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T11:00:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Nigel Slater","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397762419839/NigelSlater.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nigelslater"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Life and style","Fish"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fish","webTitle":"Fish"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Nigel Slater","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/nigelslater"}}],"series":{"title":"Nigel Slater's midweek dinner","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/nigel-slater-midweek-dinner"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/23/nigel-slater-baked-sea-bass-recipe","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49q2t","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/23/nigel-slater-baked-sea-bass-recipe","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/23/nigel-slater-baked-sea-bass-recipe"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/36be6cda4bb829c8788279714a0fb216d4a5b734/740_772_3765_2258/3765.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2258,"width":3765,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A light supper for a warm evening: baked sea bass with summer vegetables  Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer","altText":"baked sea bass with summer vegetables","cleanCaption":"A light supper for a warm evening: baked sea bass with summer vegetables ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer"}},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"Nigel Slater's midweek dinner"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/36be6cda4bb829c8788279714a0fb216d4a5b734/740_772_3765_2258/3765.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2258,"width":3765,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin/Jonathan Lovekin","altText":"Baked sea bass with summer vegetables Observer Magazine OM Nigel Slater Nigel's Midweek Dinner 21/6/2015","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/Jonathan Lovekin"}}]},{"title":"State of independents / How do chain stores fit into artisan areas?","rawTitle":"How do chain stores fit into artisan areas?","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jun/23/state-of-independents-how-do-chain-stores-fit-into-artisan-areas-subway-manchester","title":"State of independents: how do chain stores fit into artisan areas?","trailText":"Subway is set to open one of its stores in the heart of Manchester’s independent Northern Quarter.

How will the locals react?</p>","byline":"Simon Binns","body":"<p>This 4 July, people around the UK will be celebrating independence on a day specifically created to mark it. No, not that one. Independents Day is organised by the National Skills Academy for Retail, to celebrate the small and the beautiful in the industry. </p> \n<p>This is a big deal in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, an area that has become a symbol of the “<a href=\"http://www.marketingmanchester.com/original-modern.aspx\">Original Modern</a>” city’s independent spirit, and is fiercely guarded by those who inhabit it. It has become a hub for locally owned bars, restaurants and shops. You’re never more than 10ft from an earnestly produced latte or an artisan sourdough loaf.</p> \n<p>This is hipster town. Nearly everything sold here comes with the word “craft” tacked on the front, and the locals take the indie ethos very, very seriously.</p> \n<p>So how will they react to the news that one of its most famous institutions – the <a href=\"http://russelldavies.typepad.com/eggbaconchipsandbeans/2006/07/abergeldie_cafe_1.html\">Abergeldie cafe</a>, which famously used to have a sandwich board outside proclaiming it as “Terry Wogan’s favourite caf&eacute;” – is about to become … a branch of Subway? Given its 2,139 other outlets, the grab and go sandwich chain hardly stands shoulder to shoulder with independent retail.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> There will be protests. There will be tweets. There will be meatball marinara sauce on the carpet before the doors are open. </p> \n<p>But should the independent sector really see this as a threat?</p> \n<p>Claire Rayner, a national campaigner who launched the <a href=\"http://www.independentretail.co.uk/\">Support for Independent Retail campaign</a> in 2011, claims that Subway, as a franchised business, will need just as much support as any new indie would when it opens in the Northern Quarter. “It will still be a small business with an individual putting money on the line, even though it has a big brand umbrella above it,” she points out.</p> \n<p>The Northern Quarter, as other independent areas – the Calls in Leeds, Hockley in Nottingham, Shoreditch, Hoxton and Dalston in East London – gets caught in the same commercial cycle. Cheap space attracts small and interesting businesses; interesting becomes popular; popular gets expensive (the average rent per square foot in the Northern Quarter has increased from &pound;7 to &pound;27 in the last decade); expensive can only be afforded by the biggest – and that mostly means chains. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"362329e93e77cb0364b1ab7276e1442ea21bbca9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435058449626/5fe47051-8f1f-46de-a82b-6b6841ab6a36-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"\" quirky=\"\" sells\"=\"\" ...=\"\" manchester's=\"\" northern=\"\" quarter.\"=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">“Quirky sells” ... Manchester’s Northern Quarter.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There’s already a Tesco on the edge of the Northern Quarter, which opened several years ago amid a small and fairly muted protest – although it’s always busy. But a month ago, Jamaican-themed bar chain Turtle Bay opened its second Manchester venue on Oldham Street – the epicentre of the city’s independent heart. There were ripples of disapproval, but business owners privately shrugged it off as an inevitable side-effect of the area’s growing popularity, and rubbed their hands at the ever growing footfall that is luring these brands in.</p> \n<p>The Northern Quarter has a tourism value to the city these days, so bohemia has to let in the day trippers and their holiday money. Quirky sells. Anyone who has been to <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/emmyf/why-you-need-to-visit-christiania-before-you-die#.pdJ0M5zNG\">Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen</a> will note the immediate barrage of shops and stalls before you even get to see a hippy sleeping in a tree. Growth can be an embarrassing side-effect to the independent spirit of those startups who claim not to have been in it for the money.</p> \n<p>The reality in Manchester, as with many other areas, is that many of the “independent” bars in the Northern Quarter actually belong to the same three or four chains. Almost Famous, Home Sweet Home and Liquor &amp; Burn all come from the same stable, and are situated a stone’s throw from each other. Black Dog Ballroom is the cousin of Cane &amp; Grain (over the road); Odd owns the Blue Pig; Kosmonaut and Ply belong to the same folk, and a company called MAD Ltd provides its very own Northern Quarter bar crawl, given that they own Rosylee, The Fitzgerald, Walrus, Tusk and Hula. They’re also planning another three new concepts in the area, including an American diner. Because there’s plenty of life in the old burger yet.</p> \n<p>The reaction of one Northern Quarter business owner – who asked not to be named – to the impending arrival of Subway was relatively sanguine. “We’re all in the same game,” he said. “We’re an area that just tends to get on with change and yes, I suppose there are mini-chains already in existence in the Northern Quarter. We all have a vision and if you do things well, growth is inevitable. And don’t tell anyone, but I’m quite partial to a foot-long.”</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435056502137/b8ae46f5-2ec9-49e1-9266-e09bad682b9b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Independent spirit ...

The casual revolution has been a long time coming","byline":"Jay Rayner","body":"<p>Spare a thought for Britain’s high-end laundry businesses. For decades they have been able to rely on the restaurant trade for income; on those gilded gastro palaces, their chandeliered dining rooms laid with tablecloths so thick they could double as sails for ocean-going yachts. Now apparently, not so much. Chefs like <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/marcus-warein\" title=\"\">Marcus Wareing</a> have got rid of them; others, like Stephen Harris at the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2008/feb/08/uk.travelfoodanddrink\" title=\"\">Michelin-starred Sportsman pub</a> near Whitstable, never had them in the first place.</p> \n<p>According to new research, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/food/article4476284.ece\" title=\"\">70% of diners</a> have turned against the formal French style of service, and towards the clatter and ease of multiple plates on the table associated with, say, Spain. Fewer than 20% are interested in fine dining, that dread phrase with its pinkie forever cocked, which has always sounded as if it should be spelt with an extra vowel, as in faine daining. Now, we are all about&nbsp;casual.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2008/feb/08/uk.travelfoodanddrink\">Michelin stars and pints in Whitstable</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This is something to be celebrated, perhaps with a luxury hot dog and a glass of Bollinger. Or in an old East End boozer like The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/21/the-marksman-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\" title=\"\">Marksman</a>, now serving the quality of brown butter and honey tart you would once have had to visit Knightsbridge for. At last, it seems, we are at ease with ourselves. We don’t need status symbols to make eating out worthwhile. We are more sociable, and look to the food to grease the conversation rather than be the focus of it.</p> \n<p>Boy, has it been a long time coming. Britain’s restaurant revolution began in the 1980s, as a byproduct of our fascination with something called “lifestyle”, powered by the Thatcher-Lawson boom. After we’d bought property and cars, we needed something else to spend money on, and the media alighted on food.</p> \n<p>That was the decade that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/03/restaurants.foodanddrink\" title=\"\">The River Cafe</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2007/dec/02/foodanddrink.shopping\" title=\"\">Bibendum</a> opened in London; the decade when national newspapers first acquired restaurant critics. As a result, in true 80s style, much of it was about form over content. We paid a premium for hyper-designed rooms, food in towers, and gold taps in the loo. We paid far less attention to the actual food on the plate.</p> \n<p>Finally the British public – or at least the proportion that, in an age of austerity, can afford to eat out – has wised up. Even when it’s good value, restaurants are expensive. So why waste that money on the designer’s bill, or for battalions of waiters just so one spotty teenager can ferret about in your lap placing your napkin there, or another can physically take you to the loo when all you needed was directions?</p> \n<p>What we want, we’re told, is places that deliver the good stuff with the minimum of fuss; places with narrow menus, so we can <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/food/article4476240.ece\" title=\"\">complete a meal in different restaurants</a>: a lobster roll here, Taiwanese buns stuffed with pork belly there. And we want to wear what we choose while doing it, not comply with someone else’s dress code. We will define what “special occasion” means, thank you very much.</p> \n<p>As ever with such trends, what’s actually going on is more complex. The past decade has seen a massive growth in the restaurant sector. One study found it has <a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/articles/356354/manchester-s-restaurant-renaissance-outstrips-all-uk-cities\" title=\"\">expanded by 57% in Manchester, 55% in Leeds and 32% in London</a>. It’s expected to be worth &pound;52bn by 2017, up from &pound;48bn last year. There is simply more of everything.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Why waste money on battalions of waiters just so one spotty teenager can ferret about in your lap with a napkin?</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Yes, it’s true that in all but the most traditional restaurants – I’m looking at you, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/06/restaurants.foodanddrink1\" title=\"\">Le Gavroche</a> – dress codes have loosened. But have those dreaded faine daining restaurants disappeared? Absolutely not. In certain central London postcodes there are more pointless stupidities than you could shake a gilded Chanel stick at. The non-dom economy is happily keeping afloat the likes of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/07/quattro-passi-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\" title=\"\">Quattro Passi</a>, where they splatter the dreary Italian food with silver leaf, and the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/28/dorchester-grill-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\" title=\"\">Dorchester Grill</a> where they call fish fingers <em>goujonettes</em> so they can flog them at &pound;17 a pop.</p> \n<p>Happily, more also means more of the good stuff. A rejection of formal service does not also mean a rejection of good food. Yes, occasionally a clunker opens, but if you can find the &pound;90 it will probably buy two of you a much better meal than double that would have got you a decade ago. You just won’t get a tablecloth for your money. And for an awful lot less, you can explore the burgeoning and brilliant street food scene, where you won’t even get a table. But when the food is good, who really cares? It’s called progress.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434986291331/Formal-service-at-the-Ber-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Fewer than 20% are interested in fine dining, that dread phrase that has always sounded as if it should be spelt with an extra vowel, as in faine daining.'

English-language offerings on both sides of the Atlantic are multiplying, with podcasts by food magazines, websites and individual commentators jostling for space on people’s MP3 players with established radio programmes from networks such as the BBC, KCRW and New York Public Radio. From shows dedicated to recipes, ingredients and how-tos, to others exploring the science, history, and fun in eating, here’s a guide to the best audible offerings out there, all available on iTunes and online.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://food52.com/blog/category/239-burnt-toast-a-podcast\">Burnt Toast</a></h2> \n<p><a href=\"http://food52.com/\">Food52</a> – Amanda Hesser and Merrill Stubbs’s online food destination – launched its podcast in March, and it’s as eloquent, efficient and classy as the website. The founder-hosts are often joined by more than one guest (such as authors and bakers), and witty, engaging debate ensues – it’s New York on a plate, in your ears. The first instalment, I Draw the Line at Tongue, dug into the weirdest things to eat, while the latest, with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://food52.com/blog/10178-peter-miller-on-the-importance-of-lunch-plus-a-giveaway\">author Peter Miller</a>, is all about lunch. The pace, the editing and the judiciously chosen soundbites compiled for each intro make this a keeper.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p028z2z0\">The Food Chain</a></h2> \n<p>From the BBC World Service, this won the radio category at the 2015 Fortnum &amp; Mason Food &amp; Drink Awards last month for The Case For and Against Meat, a two-parter broadcast in December 2014. Delving into “the economics, science and culture behind what we eat and drink” in a no-nonsense, newsy way, the show has covered fussy eaters, dining alone and, most recently, sexual politics in the kitchen. The Food Chain doesn’t shy away from issues, and keeps things moving with on-the-road investigative reports and studio interviews.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://thekitchenisonfire.com/\">The Kitchen is on Fire</a></h2> \n<p>An altogether more rambling – and, at times, random – London affair. Former supperclub hosts James Ramsden and Sam Herlihy, joined by the occasional guest, broadcast from a kitchen table in Hackney, east London. They are clearly good mates (they’re about to open a restaurant together in London Fields, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.hot-dinners.com/Gastroblog/Latest-news/james-ramsden-and-sam-herlihy-opening-pidgin-restaurant-in-hackney\">Pidgin</a>), with a long history of banter and interesting off-the-cuff insights. Episodes don’t come with clear labels, but that allows for a sprawling spontaneity and comfortably casual tone that the more scripted shows don’t have. To date, they have discussed whether avocados are the blood diamonds of the fruit world, and why Spam is suddenly big again. </p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://www.spilledmilkpodcast.com/\">Spilled Milk</a></h2> \n<p>Another jocular discussion between two foodies who find each other hilarious, with added writerly verve and focus. Veteran food writers Matthew Amster-Burton and Molly Wizenberg devote each episode (they’re up to No 179) to eating one thing only – pudding, brown butter, or, most recently, hot sauce. They also host international junk-food tasting sessions where listeners send in boxes of foreign snacks, which the pair try on air. The hosts are infectiously enthusiastic and their back and forth definitely draws on the joy that sometimes only food can bring. </p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://www.heritageradionetwork.org/programs/131-Radio-Cherry-Bombe\">Radio Cherry Bombe</a></h2> \n<p>A feminist food show with a punchy power-pop soundtrack, this is bit like <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini_Kill\">Bikini Kill</a> hitting your worktop: it’s a serious celebration of women in the food world. And in light of The Food Chain’s latest episode, its relevance is easily gauged. The tone is serious, considered and informative, with a consistently strong roster of guests, from <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.barefootcontessa.com/\">Ina Garten</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/17/parisian-parting-dorie-greenspans-final-meal\">Dorie Greenspan</a> to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/13/april-bloomfield-chef-new-york\">April Bloomfield</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/anna-jones\">Anna Jones</a> … the influential, the powerful, the inspirational. </p> \n<h2>Others to mention </h2> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.dinnerpartydownload.org/\">The Dinner Party Download</a> is a weekly gathering of vastly entertaining proportions, with celebrity guests, tunes to eat to and excellent conversation. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.foodisthenewrock.com/\">Food is the New Rock</a>, where musos and foodies intersect, is possibly the only food podcast to have been recorded in front of a live audience at <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.sxsw.com/\">South by Southwest</a> in Texas.

She says: “Balance the day, not each meal in the day.” She explains that we can still eat healthily without trying to get fruit juice, hot or cold cereal, scrambled eggs with bacon, and buttered toast packed into the first meal of the day; and soup, beef, mashed potatoes, lima beans and waldorf salad packed into the second, which her contemporaries were. Here is some further guidance: “Breakfast can just be toast. It can be piles of toast, generously buttered, and a bowl of honey or jam. You can be lavish, because the meal is so inexpensive. You can have fun, because there is no trotting around with fried eggs and mussy dishes.”</p> \n<p>She is right. Breakfast can be toasted bread; so can lunch be – or dinner. “Breaking bread” simply used to mean “eating”. “Our daily bread” meant “food”. Bread is also called “the staff of life”, which I like: the idea of bread, and all life leaning against it. But our lives don’t lean against it anymore: we’ve decided that bread is bad for us. Our staff has broken, and that is part of why our diets seem so hard to balance.</p> \n<p>Bread can be the thing you’re eating, not a prelude to the meal, or an afterthought. It is not bad for you. Whether as piles of toast, generously buttered, or thick slices rubbed with garlic and drizzled with olive oil, eating bread with intention is a good dietary strategy.</p> \n<p>I can think of no better way to get good, healthy vegetables, lush, ripe and in season, to the middle of your plate than to balance them on freshly toasted bread.</p> \n<p>Buy a loaf of bread with a hard crust. Pick one based on how enticing it looks, and on how good it smells. Pick something round and fat or, if it’s oval, that still has good girth at its ends, so you can get a lot of big, healthy pieces out of it. Make it a loaf that will require slow, deliberate chewing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"ideas for toast toppings\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;http://assets.guim.co.uk/stylesheets/webfonts.d35b9e8c33865a46b3231a20c9f960b0.css&quot; /&gt; \n&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/assets/stylesheets/factbox2.css&quot; /&gt; \n&lt;base href=&quot;.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; /&gt; \n&lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot; style=&quot;border-top: 2px solid #fdadba;&quot;&gt;\n &lt;h1 style=&quot;color: #951c55;&quot;&gt; Not-recipes&lt;/h1&gt;\n &lt;div class=&quot;boxout-primary-content&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 0px;&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;h2 style=&quot;margin-bottom: 6px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideas for toast toppings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;ul&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Thickly sliced, salted tomato with olive oil and torn basil.&lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Roasted squash smashed with olive oil, grated parmesan and black pepper, topped with olive oil, lemon juice and chopped toasted almonds. &lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Ricotta or goat’s cheese with garlicky Swiss chard or kale and a squeeze of lemon juice.&lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;li style=&quot;margin-bottom: 4px;&quot;&gt;Peas or asparagus with creme fraiche and chopped mint&lt;/li&gt; \n   &lt;hr /&gt; \n  &lt;/ul&gt; \n  &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Then let the rest of your meal be vegetables. Cut thick slices of bread, drizzle them with oil, and toast them in a hot oven or on a grill. Let them get nicely charred, then rub each slice lightly with the cut side of a clove of raw garlic.</p> \n<p>Or cook sliced garlic over very low heat in butter and a little water until it is completely tender and stewed. Top some toasted bread thickly with your stewed garlic, then cover with very thinly sliced bacon or pancetta. Cook each piece of toast under a grill until the meat is crisp and its fat has seeped into the bread.</p> \n<p>Use bread to balance your budget as much as your diet. Local vegetables are especially worth their cost if you’re eating them, prepared simply and well, mounded on a big piece of toast.</p> \n<p>Your bread doesn’t have to be in the middle of your plate. But if it is not your centrepiece, let it help you relish what is. Choose a piece of good bread instead of a second pork chop or second helping of lasagna. Use it to sop up your chop’s lovely juices or wipe up the last of the lasagna sauce. This will make your meal easier on your stomach, as well as your pocket.</p> \n<p><em>Tamar Adler is a food writer based in New York.

Sun-lotion was put on once, each morning, so my sister and I would get huge blisters from the beach and Mum would have to cut our T-shirts off us. Our holidays were inland on South Island, taking the car there by ferry – me trying to sleep to avoid vomiting – and then maybe camping by Mount Cook, en route to stay with grandfathers and uncles in South Canterbury who were all sheep farmers. We had amazing times – helping out on farms, eating lots of lamb, shooting guns. My cousins were driving cars by the age of 12. I’ll never forget a cousin taking me rabbit-shooting at nights. My family is really massive and I’d see lots of cousins on holiday and always have a crush on one or another.</p> \n<p><strong>Fergus </strong>Isn’t that illegal?</p> \n<p><strong>Margot </strong>They weren’t actual romances, Fergus. Don’t look at me that way. Crushes on big, strong older cousins are all right – just running after them going, “Oooo-hooo”.</p> \n<p><strong>Fergus</strong> I grew up in London and my family took holidays on Tiree. My father travelled a lot with work but Tiree was our time together. I first went there on my fourth birthday. The journey up was always part of the fun. Oban, the gateway to the Western Isles, has been a grim town for as long as I can remember, with its Victorian hotels of lost lustre. But the fish and chips there are splendid. Once on Tiree, in a rented house on a hill, with a lean-to kitchen with amazing views, we’d eat haggis and lamb and also make use of goodies purchased by Mother in Soho and packed into the Range Rover – salami, parmesan, olives and so forth. They have pesto on Tiree now but back in the day there was still a wartime mentality – one jar of Marmite on the shop shelf. The butcher, who passed away a few years ago, would wring her hands and make funny noises when we ordered a leg of lamb and then it would arrive at the house, still warm, in the afternoon.</p> \n<p><strong>Margot</strong> Because of EU regulations, the abattoir next to the butcher’s on Tiree isn’t used now – sheep are taken to the mainland for slaughter.</p> \n<p><strong>Fergus</strong> Tiree’s about recharging the batteries and sheep and smells and simplicity and memories, but everything’s based on the weather, which is terribly changeable. Dad used to do barbecues on the beach but Margot does that now.</p> \n<p><strong>Margot</strong> After moving to London at 20, as soon as I met Fergus I was taken off to Tiree with his parents. I think it was a test, whether I would love Tiree. It’s very beautiful, but very cold and there are no trees. But I’m a fierce finder of driftwood. I like the purpose of a walk being to find enough wood to build a good fire on the rocks to feed everyone. You have to wear raincoats because it could pour at any minute.</p> \n<p><strong>Fergus</strong> Thank goodness – it keeps people away. But we do take the car to the picnic and barbecue spots, with crates of wine in the boot.</p> \n<p><strong>Margot</strong> But twice I was on Tiree for a month’s holiday with the kids but Fergus for only two weeks, because of business, and those times dragged. And the kids increasingly wanted to get back to London. Nowadays all they want to do is go to festivals. But as Mark Hix says, “All people do at festivals is get trashed, then drive home and need a holiday to recover.” Fergus has organised food stalls at Wilderness and our daughter came with us and she said, “Mum, this isn’t like the festivals <em>I </em>go to,” and I said, “Thank God for that, darling.” Why go to the countryside to be around 10 billion other people? I prefer to be around no one. But Tiree nights can be grim.</p> \n<p><strong>Fergus</strong> There’s always playing-cards.</p> \n<p><strong>Margot</strong> I remember once you sat upstairs alone and later mentioned you’d enjoyed boiled sweets and I said, “Oh, you had boiled sweets, did you, fucker? You’re supposed to share.”</p> \n<p><strong>Fergus</strong> I’ve loved going to New Zealand with you and us driving around the South Island with lots of Pinot Noir.</p> \n<p><strong>Margot</strong> I probably annoyed him, always asking, “Isn’t this absolutely beautiful? Isn’t this just as beautiful as Scotland?” But we both love cooking in NZ and we love shopping at a huge Pak’nSave [superstore], where there’s just bags and no packaging. But I’ll tell you a good holiday. We went to visit my friend Anna, north of Wellington, and her bloke is a fireman. They asked us if we wanted to go on a picnic and we went to the coast and the fireman dived in and brought up sea urchin and lobster, and laid them all on the rock. That is one of the great moments of our life, isn’t it, Fergus?</p> \n<p><strong>Fergus</strong> He shoved the lobster into a boily and we had a very good lunch.</p> \n<p><strong>Margot</strong> When I went travelling around Europe in my twenties with my friend Debbie, we survived from day to day, and I remember some Italian guys in Greece diving for squid to cook on the beach and asking, “Will you join us?” We said, “Er yeah!” And I had my first calamari parmigiana, one of my favourite things, with wine, at a restaurant outside a convent in Venice we stayed in because it was so cheap.</p> \n<p><strong>Fergus</strong> I remember once visiting a friend in Paris and seeing through a window a man drinking wine with 16 women. It changed my idea of holidays and restaurants.</p> \n<p><strong>Margot</strong> I started really missing the ocean after living in London a while, then someone said, “Oh, I’ll take you to Brighton, you’ll love it.” I mean, I do love Brighton now, but the first time, I just thought, “Oh dear God, that little brown bit of muck is a beach?” There were no sticks of rock and kiss-me-quick hats back in New Zealand but the best fish and chips. Why do people here have a problem with waiting for something that’s really good? Your chips in Britain are soggy and the fish usually pre-fried and laying around, whereas ours are cooked to order and we wait.</p> \n<p><strong>Fergus</strong> Your chips are crisp, dear.</p> \n<p><strong>Margot</strong> We often go, as a family, to Ciao Bella on Lamb’s Conduit Street and pretend we are on holiday in Italy. So we don’t <em>have</em> to go on holiday. It’s difficult to leave your business behind. But fucking great also.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434452669250/d87d36b1-be05-46b9-a71c-8e2bb137bb7a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lee Strickland for Observer Food Monthly","altText":"Fergus and Margo Henderson shot for Observer Food Monthly at Holborn studios.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Lee Strickland for Observer Food Monthly"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-21T07:00:04Z","lastModified":"2015-06-21T07:00:04Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2,"contributors":[{"name":"John Hind","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/johnhind"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Fergus Henderson","Chefs","Food & drink","Summer food and drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/fergus-henderson","webTitle":"Fergus Henderson"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/chefs","webTitle":"Chefs"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/summer-food-and-drink","webTitle":"Summer food and drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"John Hind","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/johnhind"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/21/chefs-on-the-beach-fergus-margot-henderson-holidays-tiree","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ymx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/21/chefs-on-the-beach-fergus-margot-henderson-holidays-tiree","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/21/chefs-on-the-beach-fergus-margot-henderson-holidays-tiree"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434469847938/a6db0d81-1b8b-4aef-807f-5af2e8149157-2060x1260.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1260,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Margot and Fergus Henderson: holidays on Tiree and in New Zealand.

Having three sons and then an equally rambunctious daughter, our parents realised the thing to do was totally exhaust us all day, then at midnight bundle us unconscious into two cars to drive through the night – Mum steering the Mini Clubman, Dad the Mini – to catch an early morning ferry from Oban. Both cars were laden to the gunnels with camping equipment and Mum’s batterie de cuisine.</p> \n<p>We camped on island beaches and survived the most extraordinary weather – you name it, we had it. But to see the sea crashing on the shore each morning and those skies at sunset was magnificent. Mum cooked lunches and dinners and with whatever internal clock we’d had instilled in us we’d return on time from our adventures, spruced up and cleaned at a nearby tap to eat her wonderful food on the beach. Not grand cooking but beautifully plain simple food well made. Wonderfully ad hoc yet civilised.</p> \n<p>Dad was a very fussy, particular eater and supplies were gathered from the island’s best local butcher, fishmonger, grocer and baker. Apart from bacon or sausage sandwiches and kippers or mackerel, Mum made minces and stews on the beach. Then, when you saw her sitting down with a book by the sea, having watered and fed her brood, there was a very contented feeling about her. Of course, what parents crave the most is peace. So being reasonably assured that we’d be safe when we gallivanted off for hours must have been marvellous for them.</p> \n<p>My favourite meal on the beach – the one I’d ask Mum for – was breaded haddock, boiled potato and peas. She’d amass different crusts and husks and bits of bread throughout the week before pounding them into breadcrumbs, I’ve since realised. I thought that meal was the most delicious thing in the world.</p> \n<p>In my teens, things became more sophisticated, because we’d camp in Brittany – travelling at night in a VW Dormobile to Stirling and onto the sleeper to Newton Abbot, then drive to Plymouth for the ferry to Roscoff. In France, Mum’s wings just unfurled and she was at the charcuterie counter and everywhere. I remember one day, while Mum and Dad visited a couple in a nearby tent, we boys were given 30 francs and we went for roast chicken and chips at a restaurant and ordered glasses of beaujolais. The owners didn’t bat an eyelid and I felt grown up and sophisticated.</p> \n<p>Most of my travels nowadays are two days here, two days there, thanks to generous friends who ask, “Why don’t you join us?” at a place in the country, or Italy, with a swimming pool. Chefs are really terrible at taking holidays, frankly.</p> \n<p>I went quickly around the world once eating maggots and monkeys with Fergus Henderson for a TV programme [<em>Could You Eat An Elephant?</em>], and in a remarkably glamorous restaurant in Vietnam one day <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0FVG3awKq8\" title=\"\">we ate snake</a>. Anything snakey and alive is an instant urrgh for me and they’d brought out live snakes to select from and one whooshed out and got six inches from my face. We had to order a whole snake each, for head-to-toe consumption, so I went eeny-meeny-miney and chose a cobra, and it was coshed. It was pretty full-on, but tasted delicious.</p> \n<p>I do remember <em>once</em> having a traditional fish-shop fish supper – on Brighton beach, back when the [West] pier was still standing. It wasn’t very good. I do love the <em>idea</em> of fish and chips on a beach. But I’d much prefer, because of my age now, the sort of thing Mary- Lou Sturridge is doing at <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/apr/11/seaside-boarding-house-burton-bradstock-dorset-hotel-review\" title=\"\">The Seaside Boarding House</a> in Burton Bradstock.</p> \n<p>I have a full two-week holiday coming up – my first for a very long time and my first August holiday for even longer. It’s at a friend’s in north Tuscany and I’ll be doing as little as possible.
