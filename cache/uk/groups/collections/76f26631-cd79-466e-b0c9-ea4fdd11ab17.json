Nobody knew what a frappuccino was. Staff had to put a handwritten sign saying “milky coffee” next to the generic window sign plugging their “delicious latte”.</p> \n<p>The queue was full of fearful locals who just wanted a pot of tea. But it was an undoubted thrill for the young folk. Actually, getting some frothy milk in a cup is still more fun than most people up here will have in a lifetime. And the sight of the first gingerbread latte of the year still gets me all hot and bothered.</p> \n<p>To me, coffee shops are quite fun places for all – teens like them because it makes them feel grownup; adults like them for meetings; you can have a harmless date there, and some are even licensed (yay!). What you don’t want is some chin-stroking, smirking joy thief looking at you like you’ve done it wrong at the till. But that’s what’s happening. </p> \n<p>As a nation, we drink about 165m cups of coffee a day. Men (1.7 cups) drink more than women (1.5 cups). More than eight out of 10 of us drink it at home, in the office, or in one of the tens of thousands of coffee shops that litter every town and city, <a href=\"http://reports.mintel.com/sinatra/oxygen/list/id=679744&amp;type=RCItem#0_1___page_RCItem=0\">which equates to an annual national spend of more than &pound;1bn</a>.</p> \n<p>But as the industry grows, so does the aching presence of the <a href=\"http://www.timhayward.com/\">coffee bore.</a> And they’re everywhere. Not for the first time, the “craft” movement is slowly and earnestly sucking the joy out of something that isn’t half as complicated or important as some people think it is.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4759ab4a53dfafead5273aa05fcfba9defee95e8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436269152802/487aaa7a-7a1e-48f3-9749-b7fa7ab70c79-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'The “craft” movement is slowly and earnestly sucking the joy out of something that isn’t half as complicated or important as some people think it is.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The “craft” movement is slowly and earnestly sucking the joy out of something that isn’t half as complicated or important as some people think it is.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Until last week, I had never seen or heard of <a href=\"http://www.caffeinemag.com/\"><em>Caffeine</em> magazine</a>. But there it was, in an indie Manchester coffee shop that had just nervously taken three attempts to crack my order of black coffee with hot milk. “<em>Is</em> Fika just a fad?” pondered the magazine. I don’t know, but the reason I don’t know is because I don’t know what Fika is. I’ve never seen a more niche magazine – and I’ve worked for the company that publishes Coin-operated Laundry Monthly and Rubber &amp; Plastics Weekly. </p> \n<p>Do I want my beans ground fine or coarse? I don’t know. I don’t care enough about the production method. Yes, sneer if you like. But it’s only coffee, isn’t it? Well, not to the bloke who stood next to me in the latest coffee house to spring up in Manchester’s Northern Quarter recently, who spent a good 15 minutes cross-examining one of the poor baristas about which variety of Guatemalan bean he’d best be suited to. He wanted to see them. And sniff them. A lot. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f855f74ffe3a328a401661ec8535681be425ea90\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436269247350/f5012047-64af-4ad3-a41b-17ee9a276fc4-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"The shiny tin of posh coffee.\" width=\"270\" height=\"405\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The shiny tin of posh coffee.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I am but a mere normal. I like quality but I’m not obsessive. I’ll go to Costa or Starbucks just as much as the indies. I don’t have a favourite variety of bean. I accidentally bought ground coffee in the supermarket the other day thinking it was instant, because all I was really looking at was <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=illy+tin&amp;tbm=shop\">the shiny tin it came in</a>. Which wouldn’t be so bad except for the fact that I don’t own a cafetiere.</p> \n<p>I’m not an idiot. I went to university. I know how to change a car tyre. I’ve put two children through school. I just don’t know everything there is to know about coffee. Sorry. Has anybody else started to develop a jangling case of nerves as they approach a barista? Just me? How has this happened?</p> \n<p>When the craft ale thing started to happen, it was made slightly less enjoyable by the intensely solemn “punk” taste-makers, who acted as a sort of unofficial booze police. In a nutshell, they were rude, patronising and painfully boring. I just want a nice cup of coffee. </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436265180290/d9928d67-5113-4c7e-abc3-f1e9a2c68cc8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Timothy Fadek","altText":"The Barn, a coffee shop in Berlin, which does not serve milk or sugar with coffee.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Timothy Fadek"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436269153327/487aaa7a-7a1e-48f3-9749-b7fa7ab70c79-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘The “craft” movement is slowly and earnestly sucking the joy out of something that isn’t half as complicated or important as some people think it is.’ Photograph: Alamy","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'The “craft” movement is slowly and earnestly sucking the joy out of something that isn’t half as complicated or important as some people think it is.'","cleanCaption":"‘The “craft” movement is slowly and earnestly sucking the joy out of something that isn’t half as complicated or important as some people think it is.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436269247350/f5012047-64af-4ad3-a41b-17ee9a276fc4-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":405,"width":270,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"The shiny tin of posh coffee.

It was one of the sweltering days we’ve been enduring recently here in New York, when the rivulets of sweat coursing down your back are sufficiently torrential to distract from the stench of baking garbage in the streets. </p> \n<p>But, yes, I wanted a hot coffee, because iced coffee is an embarrassing travesty of a beverage, and nobody should drink it. That is essentially what I told him, after pausing just long enough to launch a disparaging Twitter hashtag – #EndHotCoffeeShaming – to humiliate him for his impertinence on a global scale.</p> \n<p>While less courageous columnists confine themselves to non-controversial topics, like gun control, or how to respond to Islamic State, or the Rachel Dolezal case, I’ve got the guts to step forward and say it: iced coffee is ridiculous. <br /></p> \n<p>People used to understand this. As recently as 2001, Americans drank a relatively modest <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/magazine/content/10_21/b4179077028323.htm\">300m servings</a> of the stuff per year, but by 2009, that figure stood at 1.2bn – and now <a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/growing-interest-in-cold-rtd-coffee-278400061.html\">75% of the population </a>drinks<strong> </strong>its<strong> </strong>coffee cold, at least sometimes, seemingly untroubled by the recent <a href=\"http://gothamist.com/2014/07/14/iced_coffee.php\">skyrocketing in its price</a>. Or by the sticky condensation that forms on the outside of the cup. Or by the watery mess of melted ice and coffee that accumulates at the bottom, unless you’re drinking the (even more expensive) fancy version. Or by the fact – and I do mean fact – that it tastes so unpleasant.</p> \n<p>Yet the problem with iced coffee goes much deeper. It’s a fundamentally confused drink, one that can’t decide if its primary purpose is to refresh or to caffeinate the drinker. Borrowing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms\">the language of Plato</a>, you might say that iced coffee neither successfully approximates the Ideal Form of Refreshment (as does, say, <a href=\"https://www.sanpellegrinofruitbeverages.com/intl/en/pompelmo-226\">a can of grapefruit-flavored San Pellegrino</a>) nor the Ideal Form of Perking You Up (as a steaming cup of hot coffee always does). Instead, it tries and fails to do both. By the way, there’s no evidence to suggest that Plato himself ever drank iced coffee, nor any of its variants, such as the Starbucks Frappuccino™ or the <a href=\"http://www.dunkindonuts.com/dunkindonuts/en/menu/beverages/frozenbeverages/coolatta/chips_ahoy.html\">Dunkin’ Donuts Chips Ahoy!-flavored Coolatta™</a>. I don’t know about you, but this strikes me as very telling.</p> \n<p>(I admit I’ve been known to enjoy a Frappuccino from time to time, just as I’ve enjoyed an <em>affogato</em>, just as I might enjoy any other sugary snack that belongs – and this is crucial – to the category of dessert. What I don’t do is go around pretending it’s “a cup of coffee”.)</p> \n<p>Iced coffee lacks focus: it is a beverage that’s attempting, fatally, to multitask. And multitasking can lead only to disaster, as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/magazine/arianna-huffingtons-improbable-insatiable-content-machine.html?_r=0\">Arianna Huffington</a> yelled across the room to me at SoulCycle during a 3am combined meditation/exercise/napping skills class just the other day. <br /></p> \n<p>Why have so many of us fallen for this absurd beverage fashion? Perhaps it was a 2011 New York Times trend piece entitled <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/fashion/party-workouts-are-growing-in-popularity.html\">‘For Brooklynites, An Icy Drink Is Suddenly Hot’</a>. Or maybe it was the moment in 2012 when Harry Styles tweeted the words “iced coffee” to his 25m delighted followers, causing an instant worldwide shortage. In any case, it’s all a huge mistake. Because depending on humidity levels and your own physiology, drinking <a href=\"http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/06/drinking-hot-coffee-in-summer-isnt-that-weird.html\">hot coffee in hot weather</a> <em>can actually make you feel cooler anyway</em>. It triggers a disproportionate sweating response, and the heat you lose from all that sweat evaporating can exceed the heat you take in from the drink. And it isn’t repulsive-tasting, or overpriced, nor does it involve a sticky cup. This is a win-win-win-win situation, people!</p> \n<p>“But hold on a second,” said my friend Simon, when I outlined this argument to him. “You’re merely taking your subjective opinion about iced coffee and seeking to elevate it to the status of an objective argument in a manner all too typical of the contemporary web! Personally, I think iced coffee’s delicious.” Needless to say, he is dead to me now. (Because I killed him.) </p> \n<p>And as for that barista? He was hounded from his job after a successful campaign of social media shaming. He has all the time in the world to drink iced coffee now.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/c9f8b0b73ea88ee74d6fb42e006ecf8f4989bdde/172_35_1705_1023/1705.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1023,"width":1705,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"REX/Broadimage/REX/Broadimage","altText":"russell brand iced coffee","cleanCredit":"Photograph: REX/Broadimage/REX/Broadimage"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T11:30:00Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T11:50:50Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Oliver Burkeman","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/11/4/1415112352678/Oliver-Burkeman-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/oliverburkeman"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Coffee","Food & drink","Summer food and drink"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/coffee","webTitle":"Coffee"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/summer-food-and-drink","webTitle":"Summer food and drink"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Oliver Burkeman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/oliverburkeman"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/oliver-burkeman-column/2015/jul/07/iced-coffee-torturing-your-taste-buds","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4adnc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/oliver-burkeman-column/2015/jul/07/iced-coffee-torturing-your-taste-buds","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/oliver-burkeman-column/2015/jul/07/iced-coffee-torturing-your-taste-buds"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/c9f8b0b73ea88ee74d6fb42e006ecf8f4989bdde/172_35_1705_1023/1705.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1023,"width":1705,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Case closed.

By Nigel Slater","standFirst":"<p>Chewy, nutty and wholesome, freekeh is a super grain – and it really comes alive when combined with smooth avocado and spiky chives</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<h2>The recipe</h2> \n<p>Put a pan of water on to boil. Rinse 150g of freekeh in cold water, then add to the boiling water and leave to cook for 40-45 minutes until tender but slightly chewy. Drain the cooked freekeh and set aside.</p> \n<p>Peel 180g of cucumber, halve lengthways and remove the seeds, then cut the flesh into small dice. Finely chop eight chives (roughly 2 tbsp). Halve, stone and peel a ripe but firm avocado, then cut into small cubes.</p> \n<p>Warm 2 tbsp of olive oil in a shallow pan, add 2 tsp of ras el hanout and let it warm through. (It is already roasted, so a minute or two over heat is long enough.) Add a 400ml can of chickpeas, drained, and the cooked and drained wheat to the pan, together with a little salt. When the chickpeas are hot stir in the chopped cucumber, chives and avocado. Stir only gently – you don’t want to crush the avocado. Trickle over a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and serve. Enough for 2.</p> \n<h2>The trick</h2> \n<p>Freekeh is whole roasted wheat. It can take a good 45 minutes to cook, but check it after 30. It should still be nutty and enjoyably chewy. I find it best to salt it after cooking rather than adding salt to the cooking water, which sometimes seems to toughen it.</p> \n<h2>The twist</h2> \n<p>All manner of grains can be substituted for the freekeh, such as barley or rye, but the cooking times will vary according to which grain you choose. Whole grains, such as pot barely, will take longer to come to tenderness than pearl barley. Use this salad as a base for adding other ingredients as you wish, such as chopped tomatoes, mint or spring onions. You can add feta or grated ricotta salata, the aged and salted sheep’s cheese, if you wish. I sometimes add lemon juice to the warm oil and vinegar dressing.</p> \n<p><br />Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></p> \n<p>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435664438939/Freekeh-with-avocado-and--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nigel Slater's freekeh with avocado and chives recipe.

It is usually accompanied by a stew of chicken or venison. With pork sausages, however, it blends to a perfect marriage.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/20-best-italian-recipes-part-1-ofm-pasta-meat-giorgio-locatelli\">The 20 best Italian recipes: part 1</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I like to use traditional polenta but if you use quick-cook polenta the cooking time is only 5 minutes.

Put the luganiga in a large pan with the oil and fry until brown on all sides. Now add the garlic, onion, rosemary and chilli and fry for 5 minutes. Drain the porcini and squeeze out the excess water, then cut them up roughly and add to the pan. Pour in the wine and bubble to evaporate, then add the passata and some salt and simmer for 20 minutes. Keep warm while you prepare the polenta.<br /></p> \n<p>To make the polenta, bring the water to the boil with the salt. Gradually add the polenta, stirring constantly with a long wooden spoon until all the flour has been incorporated into the water and is lump-free. At this stage you must be careful that you do not splash hot polenta on to your hands. Stir the polenta constantly over not too fierce a heat for about 30 minutes, by which time it should be pulling away from the side of the pan. Add the butter, Parmesan and fontina cheese and stir well until everything has amalgamated.</p> \n<p>There are two ways of serving this: either by the spoonful on a plate or, as they traditionally do, by pouring the polenta on to large wooden board and leaving it to cool a little, then slicing it with a steel wire and putting it on a plate with the sausage stew.</p> \n<p><em>From Carluccio’s Complete Italian Food by Antonio &amp; Priscilla Carluccio (Quadrille Publishing Ltd, &pound;14.99)</em></p> \n<h2>Elizabeth David’s minestrone</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a20404904433008827721b2b36f3be50bbbe7d65\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435677590292/91dad5df-9daa-419d-a1e6-f436fd24cb3b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Minestrone\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Serves 6-8<br />&frac14;lb (115g) of <strong>dried haricot beans</strong>, 2 <strong>carrots</strong>, 2<strong> small potatoes</strong>, a small <strong>turnip</strong>, 2 <strong>onions</strong>, a piece of <strong>celery</strong>, 4 <strong>tomatoes</strong>, half a small <strong>cabbage</strong>, 2 rashers of <strong>bacon</strong>, <strong>garlic</strong>, herbs and seasoning, olive oil, a small glassful of <strong>red wine</strong>, 2oz (55g) of broken-up <strong>macaroni</strong> or <strong>spaghetti</strong>, or pastine, or any of the pasta made in small shapes, such as little stars, little shells, etc</p> \n<p>Put the haricot beans to soak overnight.

It is a summer dish, which you would make when tomatoes and basil were good and plentiful.<br /></p> \n<p>If you want to make it the day before you eat it, the flavours will have longer to infuse and it will taste even better.</p> \n<p>When you cook the sardines, it is very important to get your griddle pan really hot, otherwise the sardines will stick and you won’t be able to turn them without them breaking up.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>sardines</strong> 12 large<br /><strong>extra-virgin olive oil </strong>5 tbsp</p> \n<p>For the panzanella<br /><strong>stale Tuscan bread or ciabatta</strong> 200g, without crusts, torn up<br /><strong>white wine vinegar</strong> 4 tbsp<br /><strong>tomatoes on the vine</strong> 3<br /><strong>red onion</strong> 1 large, cut into 2cm dice<br /><strong>basil</strong> a big bunch<br /><strong>extra-virgin olive oil</strong> 5 tbsp<br /><strong>salt and pepper</strong></p> \n<p>First, get a griddle pan smoking-hot, otherwise the sardines won’t release their fat and will stick to the pan.<br /></p> \n<p>To make the panzanella: soak the bread in the vinegar. Take the tomatoes from the vine, dice and add to the bread, together with the chopped onion. Tear the basil and add that too. Add the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Stir together and set aside.</p> \n<p>Under running water, scale the sardines and then open them out, leaving the heads attached. To do this, insert a sharp filleting knife at the tail end, next to the backbone, and cut upwards, until you reach the belly of the fish. Turn the sardine over, then cut in the same way to the same point on the other side of the bone. Starting at the tail end, take the backbone between your forefinger and thumb and run them along the length of the bone up to the head. Cut across the bone at the tail end and head end and the bone should lift out, leaving the fillets still attached at the opposite side, so you can open them out like a book. At the outside of each fillet, you will see a black area with some fine bones. Just take your knife under these parts, and remove them. Then, with a pair of tweezers, take out any pin bones that may have remained in the fillets.</p> \n<p>When all the sardines are prepared, season, brush with a little of the olive oil and put on the hot grill, 6 at a time. Let them get crusty on one side (about 3 minutes), then turn over and do the same on the other side (about 2 minutes).</p> \n<p>While the sardines are cooking, spoon some of the panzanella on each serving plate, then put the sardines on top, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and serve.</p> \n<p><em>From Made in Italy by Giorgio Locatelli (Fourth Estate, &pound;26).</em><em><a

The table would be covered with a linen cloth and napkins, which she had woven from linen she had spun 35 years previously, as part of her bottom drawer. To start she would bring a steaming bowl of stracciatelle soup, the broth made from a free-range chicken. To follow, the boiled chicken would be served with extra-virgin olive oil, freshly ground black pepper and home-cured black olives, ulive strinate, a speciality of the Marche region. The freshly picked black olives are put in a sack with sea salt and hung outside for 40 days in the frosty weather. To serve they are washed, dried and quickly fried in extra-virgin olive oil with crushed garlic, chilli flakes and zest of orange.</p> \n<p>Serves 6<br /><strong>eggs</strong> 3<br /><strong>pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper<br /></strong><strong>fine fresh white breadcrumbs</strong> 4 tbsp<br /><strong>nutmeg</strong> freshly grated, a pinch<br /><strong>parmesan</strong> 4 tbsp, freshly grated<br /><strong>chicken stock</strong> 1&frac12; litres</p> \n<p>Beat the eggs in a bowl, add the remaining ingredients.

Lower the heat, simmer for 2 minutes, breaking the egg up with a fork, so that it looks like little rags. (Stracciatelle means little rags.)

It’s a lovely way of celebrating good-quality basil, and for me is very much a summer dish. It makes a delicious first course or a one-plate meal, especially with the addition of French beans.</p> \n<p>Making pesto properly is another good case for slow food because it should ideally be made shortly before it is eaten. It is also one of the many recipes where you need to be very flexible in terms of quantities; tasting and adjusting them during preparation is a must.</p> \n<p>To my mind there is no substitute for pounding by hand, and I recommend using a marble pestle and mortar. Pesto made in a food processor tends to require extra olive oil and in my view, the machine is too harsh on the ingredients, making both the texture and flavour somewhat insipid.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>trenette or linguine</strong> 320-400g<br /><strong>basil leaves</strong> 4<br /><strong>french beans</strong> 200g, topped and tailed (optional)<br /><strong>pesto alla Genovese</strong> 8 tbsp (see below)<br /><strong>parmigiano reggiano PDO</strong> 60g</p> \n<p>For the pesto<br /><strong>fresh basil</strong> 4 bunches, ideally PDO Genoese, good Proven&ccedil;al or home-grown outdoors<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 1-2, preferably Imperia from Vessalico, or French pink or violet varieties, such as ail rose de Lautrec<br /><strong>pine nuts </strong>30g<br /><strong>coarse sea salt </strong>10g, ideally sale di Cervia<br /><strong>parmigiano reggiano cheese (aged 24 months)</strong> 30-40g, grated<br /><strong>fiore sardo (pecorino sardo) cheese </strong>40-50g, grated<br /><strong>PDO extra virgin olive oil from Liguria</strong> 50-70ml</p> \n<p>To make the pesto, wash the basil leaves in cold water and dry them on a tea towel but without rubbing. The following steps must be done as quickly as possible to avoid oxidation.</p> \n<p>Put the garlic and pine nuts in a mortar and pound with the pestle until smooth.</p> \n<p>Add a few grains of the salt and some of the basil leaves, then pound the mixture, using a light circular movement of the pestle against the sides of the mortar. Repeat this process until all the basil has been pounded.</p> \n<p>When the basil drips bright green liquid, add both cheeses and mix well. Pour a thin layer of the oil over the pesto and mix very lightly.</p> \n<p>Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling, well salted water until al dente. If you plan to add beans, put them in the water at the same time as the pasta. When ready, drain the pasta, then return it to the saucepan. Add 8 tablespoons of pesto and stir well so that the pasta is fully coated.</p> \n<p>Serve in pasta plates and place a basil leaf in the centre of each portion. Grate some parmigiano on top before eating.</p> \n<p><em>From Semplice by Dino Joannides (Preface Publishing, &pound;25). <a

The unbearably anally retentive! Please assemble in the e-meeting room that is theguardian.com. For <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-eat\">How To Eat </a>– the blog series charged with identifying the ideal version of Britain’s favourite dishes – is back and, this month, we’re tackling that controversial classic, tuna salad. It is the star of a million at-desk lunches (so long as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2012/nov/15/liz-kendall-tuna-salad-row\">no one nicks yours from the fridge</a>, that is), and the perfect quick fall-back meal on a hot summer’s evening, but it comes in 1,001 varieties and all but one of them is completely and utterly wrong. So, without further ado, lettuce commence. As ever, keep it cool BTL: no flakiness, no raw language, no overly salty exchanges. </p> \n<h2><strong>The tuna </strong></h2> \n<p>Way back in the mists of time (1998), when we were all obsessed with the perceived sexiness and health-giving properties of the Mediterranean diet, there might have been an excuse for using seared, thinly sliced tuna steak in a salad. We were young, we were foolish and this novelty wasn’t (from memory) &pound;30-a-kilo. But, in 2015, to do so would be a flagrant waste of that precious rosy flesh. Its delicate flavour is best savoured as a rare treat, rather than leaving it to jostle for attention in a salad of competing flavours. </p> \n<p>Instead, tinned tuna will do the job - which is not to say that all tinned tuna is created equal. There is a self-evident hierarchy of quality, both for the tuna itself (flaked useless, chunks marginally better, steaks best), and the liquid it is preserved in. Tuna in spring water or brine is dry, mealy, abominable stuff. Sunflower oil is better, but for maximum flavour it has to be in olive oil. </p> \n<p>I trust it goes without saying that you should <em>never</em> a) use smoked tuna, b) mix tuna with mayo if it is going in a salad, or c) resort to any of the infused or pre-mixed tunas that (in a damning indictment of late capitalism) proliferate in our supermarkets. A salad is no place – if, indeed, one exists – to be experimenting with tuna dressed with tomato and herbs or infused with soy and ginger. </p> \n<h2><strong>Leaves</strong></h2> \n<p>Let he who has never bought a supermarket bagged salad cast the first stone, but you cannot dispute that these sad sacks are a rip-off, and that they are a particular waste of money when it comes to tuna salad. All you want and need, here, is some clean, sweet base crunch. Cos or baby gem lettuce are the way to go; shredded or chopped in chunky hunks that are neither too small nor so big that you need to unhinge your jaw to eat them. Save your swankier salad leaves – peppery watercress, bitter radicchio, that homegrown crop of woody, horrible rocket that never seems to end – for salads where they will make a genuinely effective contribution. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a/0_425_1148_689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anchovies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anchovies can be a useful addition, as long as they are chopped for thorough distribution.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Twort/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The salad ingredients</strong></h2> \n<p>Were this a band, you now have your star lead singer (the tuna) and your tight rhythm section (the leaves) in place. It is time to add some mid-range colour: a lead guitarist, a keyboard player, backing singers, perhaps a flautist for that unexpected prog-rock interlude. Now, some of you will read the ingredients listed below and think: “Hang on, this is just a bastardised salad ni&ccedil;oise”, but what of it? The not-quite-salad-ni&ccedil;oise is – to extend this rock group metaphor way past its breaking point – like a band’s classic first album. Later, they will dabble in jazz-funk and start naming their tracks with runic symbols. Which will be interesting. In a way. But that first album, <em>Not Quite Salad Ni&ccedil;oise</em>, is the one you will always come back to.</p> \n<p>Why? Because, primarily, a great tuna salad is a fine balancing act between sharp, salty, fishy flavours and those fresher, spritzier vegetable components – which function almost as an ongoing palate cleanser, as you eat. And, while there is no need to stick faithfully to the original, the salad ni&ccedil;oise remains our most reliable outline guide as regards how to achieve that balance. Moreover, it determines the additional ingredients you might use in an eminently sensible way.</p> \n<p>The full list of acceptable/unacceptable ingredients is as follows:</p> \n<p><strong>YES</strong>: slices of waxy/new potatoes (boiled); anchovies (chopped for thorough distribution, never whole); halved, not overly ripe baby plum tomatoes; cucumber, deseeded and sliced; a small amount of finely chopped sweet red or spring onion; capers; jarred, brined green olives (save those fresh, buttery nocellera to enjoy on their own); chopped or sliced boiled egg; it’s creaminess is a fantastic contrast. A handful of finely chopped leafy, green herbs (parsley, chives, chervil, basil even) is also welcome, but not essential.</p> \n<p><strong>NO</strong>: French/green beans (vile cold, and invariably boiled to a mushy consistency); raw white onion; carrot and beetroot (whose flavours are jarring in this context); croutons (this is not a caesar salad); any chilli or feta stuffed olives (it pains me that this needs pointing out); dull black and/or shrunken purple kalamata-like olives; sliced bell pepper (whose presence in <em>any salad</em> should rightly prompt a lengthy outburst of vociferous “industrial” language). </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b4da5a26b7c4daf358669726d8688eaf69349b0\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3b4da5a26b7c4daf358669726d8688eaf69349b0/0_65_5760_3460/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not quite right\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not quite right: carrots, feta and dull black olives should be avoided.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Also, on the egg-front, please note that no one wants a tepid-to-warm, still runny poached egg on their tuna salad. There is something deeply unappetising about rogue “hot” ingredients in cold salads and/or salad leaves covered in stringy trails of translucent albumen. Moreover, that running yolk turns any tuna present into gluey, indigestible lumps. You may think a soft poached egg on a tuna salad is sophisticated, clever even. It isn’t.</p> \n<h2><strong>Dressing</strong></h2> \n<p>Step away from the pesto (it makes everything taste of, well, pesto), and dispense with that sharp-elbowed white wine vinegar. All you need here is olive oil, salt, pepper, lemon juice and dijon mustard, all smoothly emulsified in such a way that the character of each ingredient is clear, but elegantly reconciled. Whisk, taste, go.</p> \n<h2><strong>Assembly and plating </strong></h2> \n<p>Serving a salad in a deep cereal bowl makes it difficult to eat. Serving it on a plate always looks wrong. Serving it on slate, meanwhile, is a clear sign that chef needs to stop browsing inspirational tableware catalogues and actually think, practically, about how people eat.</p> \n<p>Instead, line a shallow, wide-rimmed bowl with leaves, and separately (you want those leaves to retain their distinct flavour and crunch) dress and mix the other ingredients, minus the tuna. That, similarly, should be broken into substantive chunks on top and left as a separate complementary dimension of flavour, not doused in vinaigrette.</p> \n<h2><strong>When</strong></h2> \n<p>Lunch or tea – also known, in some part of the UK, as dinner. NB. If anyone in your circle every refers to tuna salad as a “light mid-week supper” you can – after your toes have uncurled from that sudden, excruciating cramp – happily kill them in any gruesome manner you think fitting. There is not a court in the land that would convict you.</p> \n<h2><strong>Drink</strong></h2> \n<p>Crisply bitter pale ales; dry, flinty white wines; water. </p> \n<p>So, tuna salad – how do you eat yours?</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f6b5fd3d82e4a524640762ffe657f01f71e4e100/0_594_7210_4326/7210.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":4326,"width":7210,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Tuna Salad","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a/0_425_1148_689/1148.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":689,"width":1148,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Anchovies can be a useful addition, as long as they are chopped for thorough distribution.

Deborah Orr toasts the joys of the lunchtime tipple <br /></p>","byline":"Deborah Orr","body":"<p>Like smoking on planes and transporting toddlers in cars without tying them up first, a little inebriation to break up a working day is one of those things that in a generation has moved from normal to, “Oh my God, can you believe we ever did that?”</p> \n<p>Obviously, boozy lunches aren’t actually illegal. But you, the lunchtime drinker, know that when a daytime dining companion suggests ordering a bottle of wine, agreement is conspiracy. Or a test you’re about to fail. You also know, when a dining companion says, “Just water for me!” that you really could and should have done whatever you’re about to do over the phone. Or you think you do, anyway.</p> \n<p>The truth is that drinking at lunchtime is stupid and irresponsible. That’s what makes it such fun. As for having just one or two glasses, the essential paradox of alcohol is that the less you imbibe, the more you feel its effects. After one glass (feel free to adjust for personal tolerances, you dipso), one is aware that one is more relaxed than optimum cut-throat marketplace sharpness demands. After two, one is in longing-for-an-afternoon-nap territory. After three, one is top of the world, thrumming with confidence, one’s excellent judgment assuring one that another glass won’t do any harm <em>at all</em>.</p> \n<p>After which anything can happen, as long as it’s bad. Alcohol is a gateway drug, paving the way for more alcohol. This has been known to the west since the ancient Greeks so sensibly <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/topic/Dionysus\">formalised the ritual of binge-drinking into a form of worship.</a></p> \n<p>The high point of my own lunchtime drinking life came about 10 years ago, when lunch with a friend was brought to an end by kindly waiters gently explaining that, much as it pained them, they really needed our table because dinner service was in full swing. Obviously, this was confusing for us. Holding one of our own fingers in front of our own noses was confusing for us. Somehow, we had managed to have lunch for seven and a half brief hours.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Drinking at lunchtime is stupid and irresponsible. That's what makes it such fun</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>We had been celebrating. Not at first, but after ordering our first bottle of wine (at that point, as we’d imagined, our only bottle of wine), we decided it was corked. Summoning the waiter, we told him of our verdict. A single sip and he confirmed that we were very much correct, confiding also that we were discerning women of the world and a pleasure to serve, because most of the world’s idiots glugged away at corked wine without the smallest suspicion that what they were drinking was not delicious, but rank.</p> \n<p>Well, he didn’t actually say that. We said that. We were so pleased with ourselves for detecting corked wine that we had a few more goes, to check that our new superpower was not a fluke. A sensible waiter would have given us the corked wine again, as bottle three. But our waiter didn’t, because he adored us. OK, I made that up, too.</p> \n<p>The next day – realistically, it was probably two or three days later – I told a hard-drinking colleague of our Great Feat. “Wow!” he said. “So who else was there?”</p> \n<p>“Just us.”</p> \n<p>“Eh? What on Earth did you two find to talk about for seven and a half bloody hours?”</p> \n<p>In fact, both freelance journalists and the mothers of small children, we’d talked first about how we could rearrange our working day to accommodate an extra hour or so of lunch, and next about how we could rearrange our picking- up-the-kids-from-school day to accommodate another extra hour or so of lunch. We then had to have these conversations again the next day, over the phone, because of our terrible hangovers. Clearly, some corked wine had indeed crept into the proceedings. There is no other explanation.</p> \n<p>It’s pretty dreadful, screwing up your work for the sake of a drink. It’s really awful, screwing up your responsibilities to your children for the sake of a drink. I’m not proud. Except I made that up, too. I am proud. I regret nothing. It was a golden afternoon. We may not have been officially worshipping gods, but for one day, we were both Ferris Bueller and we both had a day off. The memory still gladdens my heart. That’s how much I needed a day off.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We were so pleased with ourselves for detecting corked wine that we had a few more goes</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I understand that this is a tale of privileged women who have the luxury of being able to behave badly without suffering too many consequences, but there was a time when this sort of behaviour was a little more universal. Outside the gates of Ravenscraig, the huge steelworks that dominated my home town, Motherwell, was a pub called the Cleekim Inn. It was a bare-faced acknowledgment that a drink before your shift began could turn into a few drinks, and that the solution was to get a workmate to punch your card for you.</p> \n<p>Some of the men were alcoholics, and abused this unofficial system routinely. You could argue that this was a particularly egregious example of how liberty-taking was rife in nationalised industries. Except that I look at our denationalised age and think about how much better it was for all concerned, especially their wives and children, that these men had a wage, security and a place to go and hide, a place to lose themselves that wasn’t home or the dole office.</p> \n<p>Drinking when you should be working was a bit of a gesture of defiance back then, and it’s a gesture of defiance so huge now that it’s a dying tradition. Young people now drink less, it’s said, than for many generations. They’re more sensible, it’s said, more focused. I think, though, that they’re just more fearful. Work, money, success, security: most of us live in fear of not achieving them or not retaining them. Moderation in all things, except dedication to good sense and duty, is the order of the day. One drink at lunch is rebellion. Two is sedition. Three is revolution. The boozy lunch may be rare now, but when a boozy lunch does come along, it’s just <em>wonderful</em>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/15ec9e5865f0910523aab921192b55bb6554c531/0_0_4783_2869/4783.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2869,"width":4783,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty Images","altText":"Drinking wine","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T10:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T10:46:50Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":553,"contributors":[{"name":"Deborah Orr","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/8/20/1408550842728/Deborah-Orr-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/deborah-orr"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Deborah Orr","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/deborah-orr"}}],"series":{"title":"Summer food and drink special 2015: Let's do lunch","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/summer-food-and-drink-special-2015-let-s-do-lunch"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/in-praise-of-lunchtime-drinking","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a98c","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/in-praise-of-lunchtime-drinking","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/in-praise-of-lunchtime-drinking"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/15ec9e5865f0910523aab921192b55bb6554c531/0_0_4783_2869/4783.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2869,"width":4783,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"In praise of lunchtime drinking: ‘The essential paradox of alcohol is that the less you imbibe, the more you feel its effects.’ Photograph: Getty Images","credit":"Getty Images","altText":"Drinking wine","cleanCaption":"In praise of lunchtime drinking: ‘The essential paradox of alcohol is that the less you imbibe, the more you feel its effects.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty Images"}},"importance":4,"kicker":{"title":"Make mine a large one"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/15ec9e5865f0910523aab921192b55bb6554c531/0_0_4783_2869/4783.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2869,"width":4783,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty Images","altText":"Drinking wine","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty Images"}}]},{"title":"Working lunches around the world","rawTitle":"Working lunches around the world","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/lunches-around-the-world-summer-food-special","title":"Working lunches around the world: what's in your lunchbox?","trailText":"In Rome, a lunch break is enshrined in law.

At <a href=\"http://www.creativeconcern.com\">Creative Concern</a>, an ethical media agency in the ever fashionable Northern Quarter (NQ), “gin o’clock” is a sacred institution on Fridays at 4pm, joined occasionally by “wine on Wednesdays” if they are having a particularly good (or bad) week.<br /></p> \n<p>While Manchester’s evening dining options are still not up to London’s standards, the former <a href=\"http://www.mosi.org.uk/explore-mosi/explore-revolution-manchester/revolution-manchester-themes/cottonopolis.aspx\">Cottonopolis</a> excels at cheap lunch eats. <a href=\"http://www.katsourisdeli.co.uk/\">Katsouris</a>, a deli on Deansgate, one of the main thoroughfares, has a queue out the door every day, offering a range of hot roast meat sarnies for &pound;3.50 a pop (&pound;4, if you plump for the mutant granary bap), as well as ridiculously large plates of paella and Middle Eastern meze. <a href=\"http://www.philpotts.co.uk/our-shops/\">Philpotts</a>, a superlative sandwich chain originally founded in Chester, puts Pret to shame, though the latter is always hoaching on Cross Street.</p> \n<p>Manchester is also very good at soup: <a href=\"http://www.shlurp.co.uk\">Shlurp</a>, on Brazennose Street, offers an ever-changing menu of seasonal, locally sourced soups, and is a favourite of council workers at the nearby cavernous town hall. Back in the NQ, there’s a bearded hippy, operating as <a href=\"http://lunchbrakes.com/\">Lunchbrakes</a>, who arrives on a bicycle and shouts, “Soup and sandwich guy” as he rocks up with a basket and two giant flasks of soup: &pound;1.40 for a small chicken korma soup, &pound;2 for a large.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It doesn’t look very inviting – it’s a tiny, no-frills place hidden down a back alley – but it is all about the food</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“Rice’n’three” is another popular choice, the speciality of a host of deceptively basic-looking takeaway joints that all compete with a range of tasty curries and rice for a fiver. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/little-aladdin-manchester\">Little Aladdin</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2013/apr/10/top-10-budget-restaurants-manchester\">This &amp; That</a>, both in the NQ, come recommended, while <a href=\"http://www.phathaphat-m3.co.uk\">Phatha Phat</a>, on Butter Lane near the legal district, is popular with lunching lawyers.</p> \n<p>Many people head to the <a href=\"https://www.manchesterarndale.com\">Arndale shopping centre</a>, bypassing the bland chains of the upstairs food hall for the market on the high street side, where you can eat your way around the world from stall to stall.

It’s only a few yards away from some of Manchester’s most glamorous restaurants, and I have to admit that it doesn’t look very inviting. It’s a tiny, no-frills place hidden down a back alley, but it is all about the food.</p> \n<p>Every day, the staff prepare a fresh selection of curries, daals and kebabs, and you take your pick with some rice and a salad. It costs &pound;5 and is great value. Today we’re having slow-cooked lamb nihari, sag aloo, lentil dal, pilau rice, green salad and seekh kebab. At lunch, the place heaves with a wide range of people, and on Thursdays and Fridays you are lucky to get a table. The food is fresh, full of flavour and spicy without being overpowering.

The answer was 74.3%, a figure that says much about a country in which less than half of women have a paid job; one in which most of the population lives and works in villages, towns or small cities, where employees and employers alike can often get home for lunch and maybe even fit in a <em>pisolino</em> (nap) afterwards.<br /></p> \n<p>Shopping, or doing any other kind of business, in an Italian provincial town is usually impossible between 1.30 and 3pm. And many establishments don’t reopen till 3.30 or even 4pm. Government ministers have more than once railed against the Italian lunch break, or <em>pausa pranzo</em>. One called it “a ritual that brings the whole of Italy to a stop”.</p> \n<p>But the picture among city office workers is very different. In Rome, <em>tavola calda</em> establishments, where the food is laid out on a bar, are popular with office workers. Sometimes, it is self-service; sometimes, there is a server haring between tables. But the customers all get to sit down and relax.</p> \n<p>The right to a lunch break – like almost everything in Italy – is enshrined in a law. The length of break is up to employers, and one survey by an Italian online recruitment agency found that 30% of its clients seldom left their desks at lunchtime, with 60% saying that a shortage of time forced them to rush. Then again, the same survey found more than two-thirds took lunch breaks that lasted an hour or more.<strong> JH</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It’s slow food – I would never eat a sandwich in a bar, absolutely not</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Andrea Zazzara</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>My lunch: Andrea Zazzara, 43, lawyer<br /></strong>I’m normally in court until 1pm or 1.30pm, and then I have to go back to my chambers, so I generally don’t get out to lunch before 2pm.

Lunchtime in midtown and downtown Manhattan is an exception, though. For those who aren’t stuck with sandwiches or salads at their desks, it’s a genuinely frenetic event, marked by a crazy multiplicity of choices: traditional diners and delis; “fast casual” chains serving burgers, burritos or customised salads composed from a selection of 60 ingredients; plus the new generation of food trucks, serving curries and pad thai, lobster rolls and bacon-flavoured ice-cream.<br /></p> \n<p>“Haste seems to be a controlling factor in the luncheon of the worker,” <a href=\"http://exhibitions.nypl.org/lunchhour/exhibits/show/lunchhour/quick\">declared an article in Munsey’s Magazine in 1901</a>, a few years before “<a href=\"http://exhibitions.nypl.org/lunchhour/exhibits/show/lunchhour/automat\">automats</a>” appeared in Times Square, offering pies and cakes from behind individual glass-fronted compartments, to shave off a few more seconds. The automats are gone, but the sense of haste lives on – although it’s recently grown easier to stop and breathe, too, thanks to the increase in pedestrianised areas, peppered with tables and chairs, orchestrated by Michael Bloomberg’s visionary transport commissioner, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/bike-blog/2011/jan/05/new-york-transportation-chief\">Janette Sadik-Khan</a>.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in New York, far grander things are happening at lunchtime: the city was the birthplace of the original “power lunch” (the phrase was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/14/world/americas/zagat-power-lunch-guide\">probably coined to describe meals at the Four Seasons restaurant, on 52nd Street</a>) and of the uptown, upmarket “ladies who lunch”, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_who_lunch\">a term popularised by New York magazine</a>. For the non-plutocrats, meanwhile, it’s a speedy but crucial change of scenery in the working day, marked by an ever-increasing range of food options. There are a thousand more tranquil places on the planet to eat your lunch, of course, but what New Yorkers know is that plunging into the manic energy of the city for half an hour can be just as restorative. <strong> OB</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>\u0007Lunch is, all too frequently, doing whatever I’m doing at my desk</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Amber Hoover</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>My lunch: Amber Hoover, 37, foreign rights specialist at a publishing firm<br /></strong>I’m eating braised beef over spinach, sriracha string beans and some sort of spring greens with onions.

Plates are cleared as soon as they are empty. Customers then queue again in front of the cashier, before handing their receipt to a member of staff who lurks by the exit. Lunch is often the only meal these restaurants serve, so ensuring a rapid flow of customers is key.</p> \n<p>For high-end professionals, there are more traditional restaurants with a set menu, but such establishments are relatively rare. At the other end of the scale, there are plenty of <em>lanchonetes</em>, snack bars that serve <em>salgadinhos</em> and fruit juices, where customers generally eat standing up.</p> \n<p>No one eats at their desk, because it’s considered bad manners, and grossly unhygienic. The importance of the lunch hour is such that the specific timing of the break is often written into contracts. Many workers also get food vouchers as part of their pay, with a daily allowance of about R$20 (&pound;4) loaded on to a credit card, accepted at most <em>&agrave; quilo</em> restaurants. Eating out appeals to the Cariocas’ natural sociability, allowing colleagues to spend time together chewing the fat outside the office.<strong> BD</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Leaving the office is important, a chance to nourish myself and my creativity</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Clara Ara&uacute;jo</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>My lunch: Clara Ara&uacute;jo, 33, journalist for Criar Brasil, a media NGO<br /></strong>Today, I’m eating what I usually have for lunch: on one side of the plate I have a bit of salad, because my mother taught me it was important to have something healthy; on the other is the stuff I really like – a slice of meat in mushroom sauce and a couple of <em>esfihas</em>, one filled with meat and the other with cheese.</p> \n<p>I come to this restaurant regularly with my colleagues. We like it because it’s nearby and the food is varied and excellent value. All the <em>&agrave; quilo</em> restaurants in the centre of Rio are busy and noisy at lunchtime, but this place is still kind of intimate. There are even a few booths where couples can sit close together. For me, leaving the office for lunch is important. I don’t cook, so bringing food into work is not an option. I also like to get away from work for a while. Leaving the office gives you a chance to nourish both your belly and your creativity. You get the chance to interact with your colleagues in a different way.</p> \n<h2><strong>Nairobi</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b7889632e89cb4a40f4f844844b2b785946f3e0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435747805710/b28d8cf9-1234-461d-91ad-f86bb3a5dab6-460x321.jpeg\" alt=\"jack okinyi having lunch in nairobi\" width=\"460\" height=\"321\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Okinyi in Nairobi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sven Torfinn for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lunch is a raucous and communal affair in the Kenyan capital. For many, it’s an escape from the drudgery of desk jobs, and they gather in the large restaurants around the business district, where they share hour-long sit-down meals.<br /></p> \n<p>Not too many people have time for a proper breakfast before work. Cut-throat competition in schools means that the kids have to set off for class in the half-light of dawn; adults, too, generally leave home in the early hours, to beat the city’s notorious traffic. Lunch offers a welcome respite. At around midday, office workers troop out, in groups of three or four, and sometimes even seven or eight, to find a good spot in their favourite restaurant. Very few people go out for lunch alone.</p> \n<p>Local tastes vary, depending on affordability and a region’s culinary traditions. Cuisine from western Kenya is the most widespread, with smoked, fried or whole fish, sometimes stewed in coconut sauce – a popular choice. Those with a more adventurous palate can try boiled tilapia fish head, or chicken, beef or stewed goat tripe (the latter is a favourite at the popular <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ranalo-Foods-Kosewe/487365784662499\">Ranalo Foods</a> downtown). The national dish, <em>nyama choma</em> (goat rib roasted on an open spit), is mostly enjoyed on weekend afternoons with a couple of drinks.</p> \n<p>Some choose to have their lunch at cafeteria-style restaurants, where they queue and then go out into the sunshine with their plates. But on a recent, unusually chilly Wednesday afternoon (temperatures anywhere below 20C are considered too cold by Nairobians), two sisters who work in computer sales, Marissa Oluchina and Emma Mwongeli, explained that they prefer having lunch at Abu’s Place, located just behind the city’s main mosque, which specialises in coastal dishes. Abu’s mainstay is pilau (rice cooked in a seasoned broth), while Mwongeli names a dish from the mountain region of Kenya as her favourite: “There is nothing as good as a nice plate of githeri [a mix of stewed maize and beans], topped with fresh avocado, to set you off into the afternoon in a good mood.”<strong> MM</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I rarely have time for breakfast or dinner, so lunch is important.

My favourite lunch is deep-fried whole tilapia with <em>osuga </em>(wild vegetables in cream) and brown ugali.

Legend has it taht the baozi was invented more than 1,800 years ago by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuge_Liang\">Zhuge Liang</a>, a Chinese statesman and military strategist who is also credited with creating the wheelbarrow. Facing crisis when his hungry, dehydrated soldiers began to fall ill, Zhuge dreamed up the idea of making doughy, human head-shaped buns packed with pork and beef. They are said to have cured his sick warriors and guaranteed subsequent battlefield success.<br /></p> \n<p>Today, baozi can be found the length and breadth of China, and are eaten morning, noon and night by those in search of a quick, nutritious and filling snack. In China’s capital, where office workers generally get 45 minutes to an hour for their break, a lunch on the run means a trip to somewhere such as the Qingfeng Steamed Stuffed Bun Shop. With 290 outlets, Qingfeng is one of the city’s top bun makers, churning out 16 tonnes of baozi each day for famished Beijingers.</p> \n<p>The baozi is so much a part of popular culture that <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1392160/president-xi-buys-meal-beijing-bun-shop?page=all\">even president Xi Jinping popped into one of Qingfeng’s shops</a> in an attempt to burnish his man-of-the-people credentials. The restaurant subsequently created the “Zhu xi tao can” or “<a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-01/03/content_17214891.htm\">President Xi Jinping combo</a>” meal, which includes buns stuffed with onion and pork, stir-fried pig liver and intestine, and a plate of greens.</p> \n<p>There are pork and spring onion buns, pork and cabbage buns, prawn and vegetable buns, and vegetarian buns, each costing up to 4.5 yuan (46p). Also on the menu are bowls of pumpkin porridge – a snip at 3 yuan (30p) – pork and spring onion buns, which cost 3.5 yuan each (36p), and bowls of spicy cold noodles that sell for 9 yuan (92p). <strong> TP </strong><em>Additional reporting by Luna Lin</em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It’s fast, it tastes OK and it’s safe.

Because of all the food scandals in China, I look for restaurants that are clean and tidy.</p> \n<p>In Beijing, common folk also go to restaurants that sell <em>zhajiang mian</em> – fried sauce noodles. There’s one just around the corner from here. The food is great, but the restaurant isn’t so clean. Sometimes I will eat with my colleagues and sometimes I dine alone – Chinese fast food chains are my go-to choices. I usually spend about 30 minutes having lunch. I hardly ever eat at my desk, because my job requires me to spend most of my working hours outside the office.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435746290308/tom-gilbert-and-david-coo-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tom Gilbart and David Cook having lunch in Phatha Phat in Manchester.

A jam, glowing jewel-like on the breakfast table, can be a fine thing if you have bothered to remove the stones; hell if you haven’t. But, other than that, cherries are best eaten from the bag or, better still, served cold, in a bowl of ice cubes that you have crushed to a near slush-puppy texture.</p> \n<p>An exception is a pickled cherry. A snap of sweet and sour to bring out the best in a slice of ham, a fillet of oily fish such as a tuna steak or a fillet of silver-skinned mackerel. When I say pickled, I don’t mean the fruit should be kept lurking in a jar of malt vinegar and spices for six months. I mean a quick 20-minute pickle, bright as a button, with star anise, black peppercorns, mild red wine and vinegar, and just enough sugar to stop your lips smarting.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week I simmered a ham in apple juice and served the amber broth with a dose of pickled cherries. The faintly salty cooking liquor and sour cherries were a perfect balance for the sweet, thick-cut meat and fat. An initial boiling in water prevented an over-salty broth. Skimming the surface regularly kept the juices clear and bright.</p> \n<p>The next day we ate the ham cold, cut thinner this time, with a spinach salad (dressing: cider vinegar, walnut oil, grain mustard, lemon juice) with more of the cherries and their juice. Afterwards, greedy for more of the pickled fruit, we ate thick yogurt sweetened with whipped cream, a pinch of sugar and the meanest seasoning of ground cinnamon. We then tipped a tiny spoonful of the cherries over the folds of creamy, spice-flecked yogurt.</p> \n<h2>Pickled cherries</h2> \n<p>I used dark, sweet dessert cherries for this. If you are using sour fruit, then add a little more sugar. Makes 500g of pickled cherries.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>cherries </strong>500g<strong> </strong><br /><strong>red-wine vinegar </strong>125ml<br /><strong>red wine</strong> 375ml<br /><strong>sugar </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>black peppercorns </strong>1 tsp<br /><strong>star anise </strong>2 whole<strong> </strong><br /></p> \n<p>Pull the cherries from their stalks, then halve each fruit and remove the stones. Put the stoned cherries into a stainless-steel or enamelled saucepan then pour in the vinegar and red wine and bring to the boil. Stir in the sugar, the peppercorns and the star anise then lower the heat so the liquid bubbles gently for 3 or 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and leave the mixture to cool.</p> \n<h2>Grilled mackerel, pickled cherries and samphire</h2> \n<p>The sour pickling juice of the cherries does the work of lemon juice here, balancing the oily richness of the fish. A few spoonfuls over the hot fish are as important as the cherries themselves.</p> \n<p>Serves 2<br /><strong>mackerel fillets </strong>4<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>samphire </strong>2 handfuls<br /><strong>pickled cherries </strong>6 tbsp<br /></p> \n<p>Check the mackerel fillets for any stray bones, then place them skin-side down on a lined grill pan. Brush them lightly with olive oil, then season with a little salt. Cook under an overhead grill or over the bars of a hot grill for four minutes on each side until lightly cooked through. (The advantage of cooking over a grill is that you will have crisp skin, too, but an overhead grill works well enough.)</p> \n<p>Rinse the samphire in cold running water and trim any tough roots. Put the samphire in a bowl and add the cherries and their juices. Toss the cherries and samphire and leave for a few minutes while the mackerel cooks. Place a bed of samphire and cherries on two plates, spoon over the cherry pickling liquor, then place a couple of fillets on each. Spoon over a little more pickling liquor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dcc71522b93afbfb41333d5575e4833d8d7d40b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435661454346/430168d5-e760-48e1-bd70-2e071f686d58-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nigel Slater's gammon with apple juice and pickled cherries recipe on a round plate \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the pink: Nigel Slater’s gammon with apple juice and pickled cherries recipe.

Pour in the litre of water and the apple juice, then tuck in the bay leaves. Add the peppercorns and cloves and bring to the boil. If any froth comes to the surface, remove it with a draining spoon. When every bit of froth has been removed and the liquid is clear, lower the heat so it bubbles gently, then partially cover with a lid.</p> \n<p>Let the gammon cook for about 60-90 minutes, checking the liquid level from time to time and turning the meat carefully once or twice to ensure even cooking. Switch off the heat but leave the meat in the cooking liquor.</p> \n<p>Lift the meat out and place it on a carving board. Taste the cooking liquid, correct the seasoning if necessary. Carve the meat into thick slices and put two or three per person into shallow dishes or deep plates. Ladle some of the cooking broth over each then add 2 or 3 tablespoons of pickled cherries and some of their liquid over each.
