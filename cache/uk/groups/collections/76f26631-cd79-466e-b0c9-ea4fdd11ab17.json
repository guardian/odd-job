By Nigel Slater","standFirst":"<p>The big sandwich season is upon us: bread piled high with fresh ingredients is substantial and interesting enough to serve as a light lunch</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<h2>The recipe</h2> \n<p>Cut a ciabatta loaf in half horizontally. Toast the bread on the cut side. Put four heaped tablespoons of good mayonnaise in a mixing bowl, season it with black pepper and with the finely grated zest of a small lemon. Reserve the lemon. Finely slice four large radishes and put them in a mixing bowl. Trim three spring onions, discarding the tough, darker stalks, then cut the rest into small pieces and add to the radishes. Drain 100g of crayfish tails or prawns and roughly chop them. Wash a handful of watercress, discard any tough stalks, then add to the radishes together with a trickle of olive oil and a little sea salt and toss the mixture gently. Cut each half of the ciabatta into two. Spread the lemon mayonnaise over it, then divide the crayfish salad between them. Serves 2.</p> \n<h2>The trick</h2> \n<p>There is no second slice of bread under which to hide your filling. An open sandwich needs to be made at the last minute if it is to tempt. Keep the flavours light and fresh, and pick out only the most perfect of young salad leaves and herbs.</p> \n<h2>The twist</h2> \n<p>What you need on the toasted bread is a mixture of fresh seasonal salad and shellfish, and something to hold them in place. Use a classic mayonnaise or one seasoned with crushed, roasted garlic; or maybe a herb mayonnaise scented with tarragon or basil. Keep some crunch in the salad with radishes and spring onions, but also include cubed cucumber, coarsely grated celeriac or kohlrabi. Use cooked mussels from their shells, boiled brown shrimps or crab in place of the prawns.</p> \n<p><br /><em>Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a>.

If the weather allows, we cook it on an open fire – you are rewarded with an amazing smoky aroma. This paella recipe is the fruit both of my own investigations and those of top Valencian chefs and grandmothers. Follow this recipe and I guarantee you will soon be tasting the best paella. Buen provecho!</p> \n<p>Serves 6<br /><strong>globe artichokes</strong> 2-3 (depending on the size), cleaned and trimmed<br /><strong>saffron</strong> 1g<br /><strong>salt</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>Spanish olive oil</strong> 8 tbsp<br /><strong>chicken pieces (on the bone) </strong>400g<br /><strong>rabbit pieces (on the bone)</strong> 400g<br /><strong>runner beans</strong> 200g, trimmed and cut into 2&frac12;cm pieces<br /><strong>broad beans or fresh white butter beans </strong>100g<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 4, finely chopped<br /><strong>tomatoes</strong> 1 large or 2 small, grated<br /><strong>sweet piment&oacute;n</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>water or light chicken stock</strong> 2 litres<br /><strong>Spanish rice</strong> 500g, such as calasparra or bomba<br /><strong>rosemary</strong> 1 sprig</p> \n<p>First prepare the artichokes. Trim the stalks and peel away the outer leaves so you are just left with the artichoke hearts. Scrape away any furry choke with a teaspoon, then run a lemon half over the hearts so they don’t discolour.</p> \n<p>Wrap the saffron in foil and toast it for 30 seconds on each side in a paella pan over a medium heat. Remove from the pan and set aside.</p> \n<p>Increase the heat to the maximum and season around the edges of the pan with the table salt. Wait until the pan is really hot and then drizzle with the olive oil. It should start smoking immediately; at this point throw in the pieces of chicken and rabbit (the meat needs to absorb the salt at this early stage). Fry the meat until nicely browned on all sides (this will add to the flavour of the paella).</p> \n<p>Add the runner beans and broad beans and stir together for 1 minute before adding the garlic. Cook for 1 minute and then add the grated tomatoes (discarding the skin), piment&oacute;n and toasted saffron. Cook for 4 minutes, stirring all the time, until you can see that the tomatoes have lost most of the juice and changed colour.</p> \n<p>Add the water or chicken stock and leave to simmer for about 20 minutes, allowing the bits of caramelised chicken and vegetable on the bottom of the pan to dissolve so you get a rich stock. If you use chicken stock instead of water you will only need to simmer for 5 minutes. Check the seasoning but bear in mind that the rice will absorb a lot of saltiness, so it’s okay if it tastes quite salty at this stage.</p> \n<p>Cut the artichokes into quarters and add to the pan – if you add them any earlier the entire paella will turn dark in colour. Add the rice, spreading it evenly over the paella pan and stir just once. Cook on the highest heat for about 10-12 minutes before reducing the heat right down and cooking for a further 5-7 minutes. Once you have added the rice and given it a good stir you shouldn’t touch the pan with a spoon again. You need to keep the film that develops on the top of the stock from breaking, otherwise the steam will escape and the rice won’t cook evenly.</p> \n<p>When the water is at a lower level than the rice itself, add the rosemary sprig. If the layer of rice on the top starts to look a bit crispy, cover the paella pan with a layer of newspaper for the last 5 minutes of cooking. This will help to steam the grains on top while the bottom gets crispy. In Spain this crispy bottom layer, the ‘socarrat’, is the most valuable part of the paella. Once the paella is finished it should look like a completely flat layer of rice. Leave to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</p> \n<p><em>From Tapas Revolution by Omar Allibhoy (Ebury, RRP &pound;20). </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/tapas-revolution.html\"><em>Click here to buy a copy from Guardian Bookshop for &pound;16</em></a><em>; </em><a href=\"http://www.tapasrevolution.com\"><em>tapasrevolution.com</em></a></p> \n<h2>Colman Andrews’s prawns with garlic and paprika</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ef74bbb0398420a0def21a2cbbe6b8bc9be0cff\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435158614551/768b73b4-337b-47e0-8879-b6cbc2633335-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Prawns with garlic and paprika\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This particular dish, served at one of the better traditional restaurants in Valencia, El Plat, is made with llagostins, a variety of prawn known scientifically as Penaeus caramote – a particularly large and meaty species.

You can prepare the croquettes ready for frying the day before and keep them in the refrigerator.</p> \n<p>Makes about 30 croquettes<br /><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 75g<br /><strong>onion</strong> &frac12; large, peeled and finely chopped<br /><strong>jam&oacute;n serrano or other raw dry-cured ham </strong>200g, finely chopped (this can be done in the food processor)<br /><strong>nutmeg</strong> freshly grated, a pinch<br /><strong>whole milk</strong> 725ml<br /><strong>plain flour</strong> 150g<br /><strong>salt</strong> if necessary<br /><strong>fine matzo meal or breadcrumbs</strong> about 100g<br /><strong>medium matzo meal or breadcrumbs</strong> about 125g<br /><strong>eggs</strong> 2 large<br /><strong>sunflower or olive oil </strong>for deep-frying, enough to cover the croquettes</p> \n<p>In a large pan, melt the butter and gently saute the onion over a low heat until it is soft. Add the ham and cook, stirring for a minute or so. Then stir in the nutmeg and about half the milk and bring to the boil.</p> \n<p>Beat the flour with the remaining milk using an electric mixer until any lumps have disappeared. Then pour into the pan, stirring vigorously, and cook, continuing to stir constantly, for 8-10 minutes until the mixture has the consistency of a thick paste that comes away from the bottom of the pan. Add salt if necessary – it might not need it because the ham is salty. Chill for at least 2 hours or overnight.</p> \n<p>To make the croquettes, cover a large plate with plenty of very fine matzo meal or breadcrumbs and a second plate with medium matzo meal or breadcrumbs. Beat the eggs lightly in a soup plate. Two large spoons greased with oil are normally used to shape the croquetas into an oblong. But you may find it easier, as I do, to take lumps of the thick bechamel paste the size of walnuts and roll them into balls between the palms of your hands. You can rub your hands in oil if you do not want the paste to stick. As you make them, drop the balls into the fine matzo meal or breadcrumbs. Roll a batch of the balls in the fine meal until well covered all over, then roll them in the beaten egg, and then in the medium matzo meal. This will give them a nice thick crust.</p> \n<p>To deep-fry the balls in batches in a frying pan, heat the oil until it is only medium hot (until a piece of bread dropped in sizzles immediately but does not turn dark quickly). Carefully lower the croquettes into the oil and fry over a medium-low heat for 5-6 minutes until lightly browned, turning them over once. If the oil is too hot they will burst.</p> \n<p>Lift them out with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. They are best eaten right away.</p> \n<p><em>From The Food of Spain by Claudia Roden (Michael Joseph, RRP &pound;30). </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/food-of-spain.html\"><em>Click here to buy a copy from Guardian Bookshop for &pound;25 </em></a></p> \n<h2>David Eyre’s bacalao a la malague&ntilde;a</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55a02849f540040b393664f23f914411f37a1430\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435158710765/95b77f91-2617-4dc7-a993-8c696587fec7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bacalao a la Malaguena\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Serves 4 as a starter<br /><strong>salt cod</strong> 400g, dry weight, the thicker the better, soaked in two or three changes of water, in the fridge, for about 48 hours<br /><strong>new potatoes</strong> 300g<br /><strong>your best olive oil</strong> 150ml<br /><strong>oranges</strong> 4, peeled and sliced as thinly as possible, reserving any juice<br /><strong>ground black peppercorns<br /></strong><strong>strong black olives</strong> 20<br /><strong>red pepper</strong> 1, roasted, peeled and torn into strips<br /><strong>red onion</strong> 1 small, very thinly sliced into rounds and then soaked in cold water for 10 minutes<br /><strong>picked parsley and/or mint leaves</strong></p> \n<p>Either poach the cod in water until barely cooked and then flake it, dicarding the skin and bones, or tear the uncooked cod into strips.

You can identify the fish by the stripes on the first dorsal fin and, when fresh, three or four yellow streaks along its sides. Its profile is slightly more elongated and less snub-nosed than its cousin.</p> \n<p>Buy the biggest specimens you can find – no tiddlers please. Each fish should weigh around 400g prior to filleting. Get your fishmonger to fillet them for you – each fish will give you two fillets of around 100g each.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>potatoes</strong> 3 medium, peeled<br /><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> 5 tbsp<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 2, chopped<br /><strong>thyme</strong> 1 sprig, leaves stripped<br /><strong>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br /></strong><strong>Arag&oacute;n or Kalamata black olives</strong> 30, pitted<br /><strong>chive stalks</strong> 10, chopped<br /><strong>red mullet</strong> 4 x 400g, filleted<br /><strong>olive oil</strong> for frying</p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Slice the potatoes as thinly as possible (use a mandolin if you have one), then mix with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the chopped garlic and thyme leaves. Season, then spread the mixture over a greased baking tray. Bake for about 15 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, blitz the olives and half the chive stalks with the remaining olive oil in a food processor to make a thick puree.</p> \n<p>Season the fillets. Heat some oil in a frying pan until it is medium hot – the oil should be shimmering but not smoking – and fry the mullet for 2 minutes skin-side down, then turn over and fry for another minute. You want a crispy skin.</p> \n<p>Divide the potatoes between four plates, pop two fillets on top of each mound and, using a teaspoon, drizzle the plate with the olive puree.

Leave for half an hour, then dust off excess salt.</p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 230C/gas mark 8. Transfer the pork to a large roasting tin greased with the olive oil and place in the hot oven on the top shelf. It is important that the oven is really hot to start with, as this intense heat is required to blister the skin and turn it into crackling. Roast at this high heat for a good 30 minutes until hard crackling has formed, then turn the heat down to 190C/gas mark 5 and transfer to a clean roasting tin. Continue cooking for another 2-2&frac12; hours (35 minutes if loin) until the meat is soft and tender. Remove from the oven, transfer to a chopping board and leave to rest, loosely covered with foil to keep warm, for 15 minutes.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, make the gravy. Pour off any excess oil, and place the roasting tray on the hob on a low to medium heat. Deglaze with the sherry or white wine, scraping the juices off the bottom of the pan as you go. Simmer for a couple of minutes to reduce the alcohol, then taste for seasoning. If it tastes too strong, add a splash of water. Keep hot.

Sprinkle some flour on a clean work surface and roll out the pastry to a 3mm thickness. Cut out discs from the pastry about 12cm in diameter and transfer onto a floured tray. Repeat the process with the leftover pastry: you should end up with 12 discs of pastry. Transfer to the fridge to chill.</p> \n<p>Prepare your filling. For the cumin and paprika-spiced chicken and spinach, heat a saut&eacute; pan over a low heat and add a lug of olive oil. Add the paprika and cumin and cook gently for 1 minute. Add the spinach, season and cook until fully wilted. Drain the spinach, cool and roughly chop. Mix with the chicken, parsley and lemon juice.</p> \n<p>For the ricotta, peas and mint, mix all the ingredients together and check the seasoning.</p> \n<p>When the pastry has chilled, remove from the fridge and place a heaped teaspoon of filling in the centre of each disc, leaving a 2cm border around the edges. Brush some egg wash on one half of the border and pull the other half over the top of the filling to meet the eggy side.</p> \n<p>Press down and seal the pastry, ensuring there are no gaps. You will have a half moon shape with a bulge of filling in the centre. The pastry is quite robust but will become warm with too much handling, so you should work fairly swiftly. Crimp the sealed edge with a fork to give the classic empanadilla finish. Brush all over with egg wash and pop in the fridge for at least 15 minutes.</p> \n<p>Bake the empanadillas on a floured, non-stick oven tray for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is piping hot – a knife inserted into the centre of the empanadilla will come out hot.

It may be derided as a modish condiment, but it is extremely tasty, and sparks the kind of devotion that prompts fans of the bright red bottle to buy T-shirts with it on the front and say things like: “Oh, I have it with everything.” Now, you <a href=\"http://www.dudeiwantthat.com/gear/food-drink/refillable-sriracha-keychain.asp\">can get a keyring-friendly mini-pack</a>, meaning that it can be on hand at all times.

At the weekend, it gets slathered on scrambled or poached eggs, like ketchup that punches you on the inside of your mouth. But that seems too easy, and I already know it’s lovely. So I stick with porridge. Unsweetened, watery porridge. Usually I’d blob some honey on top, but I’ve heard of savoury oats and I’ve eaten grits, which must be similar-ish, so I decide this will liven it up just fine. However, it looks like jam, which means I’m anticipating sweetness even though I know it will be spicy and savoury, which makes for a confusing mess of sensations. Plus, there’s a reason salty chilli porridge is not a thing – it’s disgusting.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f99a930774baa77b15184a09c4edf216f1b7f54\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435230486357/72a92e6f-6f61-457e-b3bc-cabec45a6875-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"Banana with Sriracha sauce turns out to be surprisingly moreish.\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banana with Sriracha sauce turns out to be surprisingly moreish.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Nicholson/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Snack</h2> \n<p>I go for a mid-morning banana, and remember that I need to put garlicky chilli sauce on it. Scarred by the porridge slop, I think about trying again tomorrow. The keyring of heat did not let me down, though. Chilli goes with banana. It brings out the sticky sweetness, and it’s surprisingly moreish. But I’d forgotten just how punchy the garlic was. “I’m going to stink of garlic,” I say to a colleague. “Going to?” she replies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e13cbfc23f108964d8ab0ff6595bbfa14e3eafcd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435230607451/36ebdabb-ba2e-40af-bcbc-513d93bf9ee3-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"Sriracha makes a decent sandwich even better.\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sriracha makes a decent sandwich even better.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Nicholson/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Lunch</h2> \n<p>Pret A Manger’s<em><a href=\"https://www.pret.co.uk/en-gb/532-baguettes-jambon-beurre.aspx\"> jambon beurre</a></em>, its slightly fancy ham sandwich, is my comfort lunch of choice, and I feel as if I’ve earned something nice.

The first is little more than crushed cherry tomatoes and basil spiked with red-wine vinegar. The other is more intense, smoky and sweet-sharp from roasting the tomatoes first with olive oil, rosemary and garlic, then crushing them and their blackened skins to a coarse, textured pur&eacute;e.</p> \n<p>It is the latter I made this week for two lunches, laid out on the rusty garden table, where I passed around bowls of mussels and fried pancetta, tarragon oil and toasted bread with lemon and pepper for everyone to stir into their soup as they wished.</p> \n<p>The second batch, two days later, came with caramelised onions, hot chilli toasts and spoonfuls of cool, white goat’s curd. We finished both lunches with white peaches, sliced and left to marinate in glasses of lightly citrus Kahlenberg Riesling. A dessert as fragrant as it was simple.</p> \n<h2>Roast tomato soup</h2> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>tomatoes</strong> 1.5kg<br /><strong>onions </strong>2, chopped <br /><strong>olive oil</strong> 60ml<br /><strong>garlic</strong> 1 whole head<br /><strong>rosemary sprigs</strong> 2<br /><strong>red-wine vinegar</strong> 2 tsp<br /></p> \n<p>Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Peel and chop the onions, then transfer them to a roasting tin. Discard the stalks and stems from the tomatoes, then cut them in half (or use whole cherry tomatoes). Pull the needles from the rosemary and mix them with the onions and tomatoes. Pour over the oil, tossing everything together. Place the whole head of garlic, unpeeled, among the tomatoes.</p> \n<p>Bake the tomatoes and onions for an hour, with the occasional stir, until the onions are soft, sticky and lightly coloured and the tomatoes have darkened. Remove from the oven and transfer the tomatoes, onions and the roasting juices to a blender or food processor.</p> \n<p>Break the garlic into cloves then squeeze the soft, inner flesh of each clove into a small dish. Add half the garlic to the tomatoes and reserve the other. Process the onions and tomato mixture until you have a coarse pur&eacute;e. Season with the vinegar, salt and black pepper and set aside.</p> \n<h2>Caramelised onions, chillli toasts and goat’s curd and basil oil</h2> \n<p>For the caramelised onions:<br /><strong>onion </strong>1, large<br /><strong>olive oil</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>golden caster sugar</strong> 2 tsp<br /><strong>red-wine vinegar</strong> 1 tbsp, mellow<br /></p> \n<p>Peel and finely slice the onion, then cook it for a good 15-20 minutes in the olive oil in a small pan. Keep the heat low to moderate stirring regularly, so that the onion softens then starts to caramelise. Scatter the sugar over the softened onion, let the sugar melt then, just as it starts to turn brown, stir in the balsamic vinegar.</p> \n<p>For the chilli toasts:<br /><strong>butter</strong> 50g<br /><strong>red chilli </strong>1, medium sized<br /><strong>ciabatta</strong> 4 slices<br /><strong>sea salt flakes</strong><br /></p> \n<p>Melt the butter in a small pan. Halve, seed and finely chop the chilli, then stir it into the butter. Using the oven at 200C/gas mark 6 or an overhead grill, toast the ciabatta on one side then place them on a baking sheet, uncooked side up and spoon over the chilli butter. Toast until the butter starts to sizzle and the bread colours, then sprinkle with sea salt flakes and serve with the soup.</p> \n<p>For the goat’s curd and basil oil:<br /><strong>goat’s curd</strong> 4 heaped tbsp<br /><strong>olive oil</strong> 150ml<br /><strong>basil</strong> 20g<br /><strong>roasted garlic</strong> 5 cloves<br /></p> \n<p>Pour the olive oil into a blender or food processor, add the basil leaves and the garlic cloves and a pinch of salt, then process to a brilliant green oil. Pour into a small jug or bowl.</p> \n<p>Serve by ladling the soup into bowls, pass around plates of the hot chilli croutes, a bowl of the goat’s curd and a jug or bowl of basil oil. Add a large spoonful of curd to the soup, a spoonful of the onions, then trickle over some of the basil oil. Float the croutes in the soup as you serve.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa72ab1a7a01daefd697c3ba551f5387e6081b2f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435057136572/df1f84de-5610-4f3b-a69b-99ad407ea8d0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Roast tomato soup with pancetta, mussels, tarragon oil and lemon croutons.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the red: roast tomato soup with pancetta, mussels, tarragon oil and lemon croutons.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Pancetta, mussels, tarragon oil and lemon croutons</h2> \n<p>For the tarragon oil:<br /><strong>parsley</strong> 15g<br /><strong>tarragon leaves</strong> 10g<br /><strong>olive oil</strong> 150ml<br /></p> \n<p>Put the parsley leaves, tarragon and olive oil in a blender.

Meal for two, including drinks and service: &pound;130</h2> \n<p><br />A restaurant of quiet ambition, located within a fancy auction house, is a whole bunch of dreadful, overwrought analogies just waiting to happen. It didn’t help that, on the day we visited the restaurant inside Bonhams on London’s New Bond Street, the galleries were filled with glorious works. There were Hockneys and Auerbachs, Rileys and Hodgkins. Another room displayed sleek Art Deco pieces all of which I coveted. In the long dirty fight to find ways by which fragile words might be bent to the service of robust flavours, ignoring the possibilities of the language of art when it is so plainly offered really is tough. How easy to talk of “provenance” and the “masterpiece” and of the “acutely composed”. Still I’ll do my best, even though Tom Kemble’s cooking is about as good a candidate for this sort of guff as I’ve come across in a long while.</p> \n<p>The six-month-old restaurant at Bonhams, which is open for breakfast and lunch and for a set menu on Thursday nights only, is literally one of London’s hidden gems. You have to know it’s there to know it’s there. Step through the small street entrance into the airy galleries beyond. Take the lift down a couple of floors, go through the bar, and back up the staircase at the end to find yourself in a small white box of a room with 20 seats and a view of a bland Mayfair courtyard. The walls are hung with prints of food-heavy still lifes of the sort wealthy men used to commission in the 16th century merely to prove they could afford the newfangled pigments needed to portray red, bleeding meat.</p> \n<p>The paintings are misdirection. Kemble’s food is in no way heavy or burdened by luxury for its own sake. It is calm and thoughtful and precise and really quite startlingly beautiful. It’s serious cooking of the best sort, which is to say the kind that makes you giggle with pleasure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56968bbbae01e50172bcd974408a5c9d674627f9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435069750589/a0bbd611-08c6-4127-bceb-efe7a07f80ae-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Gazpacho with mustard ice cream and a floating flower\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A masterpiece: the gazpacho with mustard ice cream. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Prior to a stint at a Chiswick restaurant, Kemble worked for Magnus Nilsson at F&auml;viken in Sweden and brings back with him less a Scandinavian agenda – in our meal the mood was lighter and sunnier and altogether more Francophile – but an obsessive’s commitment to quality raw materials. The cooking served some of the finest ingredients I have come across in a long while. Plus, he has all the skills. At the beginning there is some of the very best bread, a crunchy crusted sour dough with an addictively chewy crumb, served with the sort of yellow Normandy butter you could smear on a close friend. At the end there are liquid salt caramels that will give any of the chocolate specialists at work today a serious case of envy.</p> \n<p>In between there is a thoughtful menu with just three choices at each course, which changes gradually, week by week and day by day, depending on what’s good. Starters are around &pound;10, mains in the mid-20s with desserts at &pound;8. Or think of it as &pound;45 for three courses if that helps (which is the price for the supper club). Bargains are relative. For cooking of this quality in London right now, that’s a bargain. We begin with a gazpacho with mustard ice cream. It’s not an original idea. Both Alain Passard at L’Arp&egrave;ge in Paris and Heston Blumenthal at the Fat Duck have done versions. This one has a lightness of touch, the glossy cold soup having a power and intensity that forces you to stare into the bowl and think only of sunshine and languor. Crisp garlicky croutons bob at the surface and in the depths are pieces of smoked eel lending a hit of the docks. And then, in the middle, is a quenelle of just-set mustard ice cream, providing less heat than a potent savoury grounding.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2d829b1d2a45682b93a2acd70bb7c87109d8da6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435070051007/3681c26d-658e-41ba-9deb-ffd4f28622b8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Slices of duck breast and boned-out confit leg on a round plate\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The duck breast and boned-out confit leg.

There are slices of bull’s heart tomato, confited to make them more themselves, a tiny dice of crunchy courgette and a puddle of warm, foamy crab bisque, which is where the intense throb of the brown meat has gone to live out its days.</p> \n<p>There is the same intensity to the frothy, brassic green beurre blanc with a slab of turbot, cooked to an acutely timed mother-of-pearl. A heap of wilted spinach underneath, a length of charred cucumber alongside, a few peeled and smoked Jersey Royals for company and the job is done. Likewise, with slices of duck breast, and a boned-out confit leg, with crisped skin, made shameless by the fat it has been long-cooked in. They share a plate with baby beets, halved cherries, the crack of fresh almonds and an underlying sauce of all these things. There is nothing attention-seeking about this food; it is just great ingredients given a seeing to by a chap who cares.</p> \n<p>To finish there is raspberry millefeuille, the delicate wafers dusted with ground down, freeze-dried fruit, enclosing layers of a loose cr&egrave;me Chantilly and a bright elderflower sorbet. All around are perfect raspberries the colour of opera plush. A floating island is a thick disc of lightly set meringue under a sim card-thin disc of chocolate with, on the top, a mound of pistachio ice cream and all around a moat of cr&egrave;me anglaise.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1d5d0f9d89e40c7786a900808207af9562072a8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435070211028/a63e9809-e77c-440e-b29f-2acec560dbc1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The delicate-wafered raspberry millefeuille.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘There are perfect raspberries the colour of opera plush’: the delicate-wafered raspberry millefeuille.

London may be a feverish restaurant city right now, but there is very little of true brilliance. Last week at the Marksman was one kind; this is quite another. It helps that Bonhams is a serious wine dealership and has used that expertise to pull together a clever list. Given what passes through the building they could have built some thumping, tiresome bible. Instead this is a measured selection. At the top end I’m told some of the bottles are cheaper than retail. More relevant is the ever-changing list of wines by the glass, allowing you to try big Burgundies and Bordeaux you might not otherwise be able to afford.</p> \n<p>At the end of a lunch of hushed brilliance my companion implores me not to write anything. Let it stay a hidden gem, this back London room, bathed in a sunlight that drifts across the room and reaches the plate. I shake my head. It’s not what I do. I always share the good news. That’s how it is. She understands. And with that we slip from the table and return to the galleries to browse all the beautiful things we cannot afford to buy.</p> \n<h2>Jay’s news bites</h2> \n<p>■ For another food experience in a retail environment, try The Man Behind The Curtain, located inside Flannels department store in Leeds.

One unintended consequence: it reveals that certain restaurants presumed to be so hot you have to book weeks in advance, actually have free tables (<a href=\"http://uncover.london/\">uncover.london</a>).</p> \n<p>■ On the subject of new apps, hurrah for Good Food Talks, which uses text-to-speech software to make menus accessible to the visually impaired. more than 750 restaurants are now using the app including Nando’s, Ed’s Easy Diner and Carluccio’s (<a href=\"http://goodfoodtalks.com/\">goodfoodtalks.com</a>)</p> \n<p><br />Email Jay at <a href=\"http://jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a>.
