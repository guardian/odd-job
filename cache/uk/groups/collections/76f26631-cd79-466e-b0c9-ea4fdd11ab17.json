It’s the time for new takes on seasonal classics to be enjoyed in the garden</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<p>It has come to that point in the year when I want food that is light, gently flavoured and peaceful. No loud notes or vivid colours on my plate, just mild, quietly seasoned food for a summer’s day. Tempting as it is to bring out the summer classics – bowls of chilled cucumber soup, or perhaps a crab salad, a plate of cold salmon with herb mayonnaise or a pork pie – I hate the idea of food standing still. There is too much fun to be had.</p> \n<p>I made a soup this week, a broth of green peas and lettuce. Even though we ate it hot, it tasted clearly of the season. Green and light, it seemed only right to eat it in the garden. I introduced a fresh, acidic note with a rather generous amount of lemon, adding brightness to the roasted chicken broth. To make it more substantial I made toasts of ciabatta with olive oil and grated parmesan to dunk in it as we ate.</p> \n<p>The same principle, of introducing something sharp or sour to what is essentially a mild dish, included making pickled vegetables to dress a ball of creamy burrata. Courgettes and thin-skinned kohlrabi brought a crunchiness to the soft, quivering cheese, the vegetables having been given a brief pickling in vinegar, lemon and horseradish. I could have used a firmer mozzarella or even feta, but burrata is the number one summer cheese for me.</p> \n<p>Other ways I like to freshen up well-known summer classics include roasting a salmon with lemon and tarragon (tuck the herbs inside the belly of the fish with a slice of butter, squeeze the lemon over the fish and add the empty shells to the tin). I also like to add chopped radishes and even a little ripe chilli to a cold cucumber soup and let their heat liven it up.</p> \n<p>At dessert level, it can be fun to update the old summer pudding recipe with a shot of sloe gin, or by adding a layer of lemon syllabub before the cream to a fruit trifle. In our house, even strawberries and cream get a new look with a splash of raspberry pur&eacute;e and peppery basil over the berries.</p> \n<h2>Lettuce soup with parmesan toasts</h2> \n<p>The flavour will stand or fall on the quality of the stock, so it is worth making your own. I use wings rather than a whole chicken and roast them before making the stock.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br />For the chicken stock:<br /><strong>chicken wings</strong> 8<br /><strong>water</strong> 1.5 litres<br /><strong>onion </strong>1 medium-sized<br /><strong>thyme</strong> 8 sprigs<br /><strong>bay leaves</strong> 2<br /><strong>black peppercorns</strong> 6</p> \n<p>For the soup:<br /><strong>chicken stock</strong> 1 litre (see above) <br /><strong>peas</strong> 300g, frozen is fine<br /><strong>lettuce</strong> 400g<br /><strong>mint </strong>8 leaves<br /><strong>lemon </strong>half</p> \n<p>For the toasts:<br /><strong>ciabatta</strong> 4 thick slices<br /><strong>olive oil</strong><br /><strong>parmesan</strong> 3 tbsp grated</p> \n<p>Make the roast chicken stock by putting the chicken wings into a roasting tin, pour over the oil then roast for 40 minutes or until golden brown and lightly crisp-skinned.</p> \n<p>Transfer the roasted wings to a deep pot, pour some of the water into the roasting tin and stir to dislodge any juices stuck to the tin. Pour into the pot with the rest of the water, add the onion, peeled and cut in half, the thyme, bay leaves and peppercorns. Bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a simmer. Using a draining spoon remove any froth that comes to the surface and discard. If you leave it there it will make your stock cloudy. Let it simmer for an hour then strain through a fine sieve.</p> \n<p>Bring the chicken stock to the boil. Add the peas and let them cook in the stock for four or five minutes, until tender. Lower the heat to a simmer then add the shredded lettuce. Tear up the mint leaves and stir them in, together with the juice of the half lemon and a seasoning of salt and black pepper.</p> \n<p>Toast the bread on one side, using an overhead grill, then turn over and trickle with olive oil. Dust the surface with grated parmesan and toast until the parmesan has started to melt and turn golden. Ladle the soup into four warm bowls then float the toasts on top and serve.</p> \n<h2>Burrata with pickled vegetables</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e17164d176678067bdb22b25843658a9c805e75\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433943859119/2db0bde8-8c28-4de5-b147-1d1fea528e97-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Say cheese: burrata with pickled vegetables.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Say cheese: burrata with pickled vegetables.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Perfect as a light main course.</p> \n<p>Serves 2<br /><strong>red onions</strong> 2<br /><strong>lemon </strong>juice of 1<br /><strong>kohlrabi</strong> 500g<br /><strong>fresh horseradish</strong> 20g, fresh<br /><strong>yellow courgette </strong>1<br /><strong>green courgette </strong>1<br /><strong>white-wine vinegar</strong><br /><strong>burrata </strong>2</p> \n<p>Peel the red onions and slice them thinly, to about the thickness of a 10p piece.

You don’t need to peel it if the skin itself is thin and unblemished. Push the kohlrabi through a grater or food processor fitted with a coarse blade. You are after the same matchstick-thick texture as you would use in celeriac remoulade. Peel the horseradish and grate it very finely.</p> \n<p>Coarsely grate the two courgettes. Put them in a bowl with the kohlrabi then add the vinegar and the grated horseradish and toss gently so the vegetables are covered with the vinegar. Uncoated bits will discolour.</p> \n<p>Place the burrata on a serving dish, or one each on individual plates, and gently break it open. Drain the grated vegetables and the sliced onions and divide among the burrata. Trickle a small amount of olive oil over the burrata and vegetables and serve.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433943713480/lettuce-soup-with-parmesa-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"On the bright side: lettuce soup with parmesan toasts Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin/Observer","altText":"lettuce soup with parmesan toasts","cleanCaption":"On the bright side: lettuce soup with parmesan toasts Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433943860550/2db0bde8-8c28-4de5-b147-1d1fea528e97-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Say cheese: burrata with pickled vegetables.

But for how long, asks Jay Rayner</p>","byline":"Jay Rayner","body":"<p><strong>1 Leicester Street, London WC2 (020 3696 6460). Meal for two, including drinks and service: &pound;120</strong></p> \n<p>How can an entire street corner lose its way? How can it simply stop being a place anyone wants to visit and become instead the subject only of deep sighs and shrugs? For decades the corner of Leicester and Lisle Streets on the southern edge of London’s Chinatown was definitely a place people frequented – until they didn’t. It was occupied by a legendary fish restaurant called Manzi’s, with gingham tablecloths and swollen plaits of bread made of plastic hanging over the bar. You went there for oysters and Dover sole, and for Italian waiters straight out of central casting. They did stewed eels with mash, and something worrying called curried halibut and a strawberry tart everyone swore by. Manzi’s was a great London restaurant when the city didn’t have enough of them.</p> \n<p>In 2007 it went dark. London no longer thought it needed Manzi’s. Perhaps it didn’t. The building was sold to Fergus Henderson and Trevor Gulliver of Clerkenwell’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/14/foodanddrink.restaurants\">St John</a>, who took a long time converting it into a boutique hotel. It had their customary white abattoir chic, and a restaurant that grilled the inner valves and ducts of animals and did fabulous bronzed pies that scared diners from Surrey. But not enough people wanted to sleep in a room that looked like somewhere you could butcher a pig, or eat great pies and valves and ducts, however brilliantly bronzed and grilled, and the cost of delayed renovation meant they were always playing financial catch-up.</p> \n<p>It was sold to the Singapore-based hotel group behind the <a href=\"http://townhallhotel.com/home\">Town Hall Hotel</a> in Bethnal Green. They softened the whiteness of the dining room by adding gunmetal grey panelling, and kept the St John-style menu under the same chef, Tom Harris, but still no one really wanted to come, despite the food being very good. I like a grilled duct, me. So now it has been sold on again to become Leicester House with yet another restaurant, this time serving “French Vietnamese” food. And I’m afraid I’m still not convinced anyone will have much of a need to come to this London street corner. Or, if they do, it will be because they don’t know any better.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0bd559a8e2989264db6b134fcee767184ce6427\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433934332997/90f2e994-2a52-4dc0-9afa-f76a26eade05-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'The latest annoying piece of menu cobblers': bone broth.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The latest annoying piece of menu cobblers’: bone broth.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Think of this review as a companion to last week’s, where I scratched my head over Alan Yau’s glossy take on the eclectic Chinatown Chinese restaurant and then concluded it provided an interesting one-stop shop. This one sits on the other edge of Chinatown, offering something nobody needs: a limp, vapid, emasculated take on the Vietnamese repertoire. Somewhere in this hotel, perhaps locked away in a safe, must lie the testicles of an entire culinary tradition. It is Vietnamese food for people who wouldn’t like real Vietnamese food, and who want to drink cloudy “natural” prosecco while not eating it. There are warning signs: the place settings of heavy-handled knives and forks, rather than chopsticks which are never offered; the lack of chilli sauces on the tables, or any sauces at all for that matter.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the very notion should have been enough to sound the alarms. Vietnamese food has been strongly influenced by French colonialism, hence the famed b&aacute;nh m&igrave;, a baguette sandwich, only using a lighter bread than found in the occupying homeland. The idea of French Vietnamese food feels tautological. Then you see the menu. They’ve put duck liver parfait in with the dry pork belly in their b&aacute;nh m&igrave;, made with a heavy loaf, to produce something dense and cloying. They’ve also added a very short cheese and charcuterie list. Including Italian ham. I’m sorry, but now you’ve lost me.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3ec6bba2872c0726d8b3f08f443f3a390789815\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433934583679/a7b391f0-6013-423a-b2fc-d75d0421a757-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'Big tiger prawns under a deep leaf fall of fresh green herbs and crushed peanuts.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Big tiger prawns under a deep leaf fall of fresh green herbs and crushed peanuts.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The problem here is not clumsiness. They do a fair job of grilling some big tiger prawns and then offer them up under a deep leaf fall of fresh green herbs and crushed peanuts. A salad of blackened squid definitely contains squid that has been blackened. Taken alone, these dishes, and others like them, are fine without being enlivening or astonishing. But taken together it becomes a dull parade. It is all one note, a whack of sugar and salt and absolutely no fire and spice. Smoked ribs are long braised, not very smoky and again taste of sugar and salt. Some of the pricing is odd. A sizable portion of the ribs is &pound;7.50. One limp, boned-out quail is &pound;16.50. The latter is advertised as coming with salt, lime and ginger, which sounds fresh and thrilling. If only. Green papaya, daikon and cashew slaw is crunchy enough if underpowered. Steamed ong choi with fried garlic is very salty. Where is the intensity, the brazenness?</p> \n<p>Naturally, being a hip new London restaurant, they serve a “bone broth”, which is the latest annoying piece of menu cobblers. It’s a roasted bone-based stock, simmered for 12 hours. Or stock, as it’s known, but you try flogging a bowl of that for big money. (Lots of chefs, who have no medical training and who gained their nutritional knowledge from scrolling through Reddit, love making health claims for bone broth. Unsurprisingly they don’t stand up to examination. For example, ingesting collagen that’s been cooked for 12 hours will not prove beneficial for bone growth, however much you close your eyes and whisper, “I wish, I wish, I wish.”) The bone broth here, with strands of long-braised pork collar and tightly bound crab wonton, is actually the best hit of the salt and sweet on the menu, but &pound;12.50 is an awful lot to pay for a bowl of stock with stuff in it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3820a5a72308bc1969ff83598666beff60b7035\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433935008628/23ede46c-d430-4d86-ac38-e45f2f22225f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'What depresses me most is some people might think this represents Vietnamese food': salt-baked pineapple.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘What depresses me most is some people might think this represents Vietnamese food’: salt-baked pineapple.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What depresses me most is some people might think this represents Vietnamese food; that, in being served in this square, wood-panelled room with the comfy leather chairs and the fancy wine list, it is some higher expression of the tradition. It really isn’t. Desserts of a chocolate pot, topped with nitro-gunned cream, a few passable vanilla doughnuts and some salt-baked pineapple don’t help the cause any either.</p> \n<p>When we arrived at Leicester House I was greeted by a young very friendly chap who had served me here when it was both the St John Hotel and its successor. I can see why he has been kept on. He is charming and efficient without being intrusive, and makes the steely dining room a pleasant enough place in which to pass the time. As we leave, I joke that I’ll see him when the restaurant launches its next incarnation. He sighs deeply, as if to say he probably will. This once-famous, now-forgotten Chinatown corner is, I fear, still not ready for a glorious return to the limelight.</p> \n<h2>Jay’s news bites<br /></h2> \n<p>■ A few days later, for real Vietnamese food I went to Cay Tre on Soho’s Dean Street. There was a papaya salad with fire and flash, and summer rolls full of fresh prawn and crunchy rice noodle. There was catfish in caramelised anchovy sauce, pork belly stewed in coconut milk and seared mustard greens with chilli. It’s half the price and twice the flavour (<a href=\"http://vietnamesekitchen.co.uk/\">vietnamesekitchen.co.uk</a>)</p> \n<p>■ Congratulations to Chris Honor of Chris Kitch, the little deli-caf&eacute; in London’s Muswell Hill, on the publication of his cookbook Big Flavours From a Small Kitchen written with Laura Washburn Hutton. Think big-fisted salads, robust soups and terrific sweet and savoury bakes (<a href=\"http://www.chriskitch.com/\">chriskitch.com</a>)</p> \n<p>■ Meanwhile, Phaidon has some thrilling books coming up for autumn. There’s Toast at a mere &pound;14.95. Apparently, ‘Toast features 50 seasonal recipes for artisanal toast that will appeal to home cooks of all levels.’ Better still there’s Breakfast and a Dog in which food stylist Natsuko Kuwahara captures ‘the moment she serves breakfast under the watchful eye of her dog’. How have we managed without these?

In fact, it’s what gives Mexican food much of its distinctive taste. I feel a peculiar sense of pride that charring is all the rage over here, too, because I’m sure the trend stems from the huge interest in real Mexican cooking the world over. Viva Mexico!</p> \n<h2><strong>Grilled cauliflower with charred tomato chilli dressing</strong></h2> \n<p>If there is one thing you cook this month, let this be it. It’s a fabulous side for grilled fish, or for barbecued chicken or pork chops, or just as it is in a meze spread. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>125g puy lentils</strong><br /><strong>1 bay leaf</strong><br /><strong>2 garlic cloves, smashed</strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong><br /><strong>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br /><strong>2 cauliflowers, leaves removed</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>1 handful parsley leaves, roughly chopped</strong></p> \n<p>For the tomato dressing<br /><strong>1 scotch bonnet chilli</strong><br /><strong>2 plum tomatoes</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; clove garlic, peeled</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp sherry vinegar</strong><br /><strong>1 pinch brown sugar</strong><br /><strong>130ml olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>Put the lentils in a saucepan with the bay leaf and garlic. Cover with water, bring to a simmer and cook gently for 25-30 minutes, until the lentils are just tender but still holding their shape. Drain, and reserve two tablespoons of the cooking liquid; discard the rest, and the garlic and bay. Stir the oil into the lentils and season to taste.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, put your oldest, most knackered heavy-based pan on a high heat. Once hot, add the chilli and tomatoes for the dressing, and dry-roast until blackened all over, about 10 minutes: the blacker they are, the more flavour will come through in the dressing. Put the charred tomatoes in a blender. Cut open the chilli lengthways and scrape away the seeds and membrane – try not to touch either, or you will have very spicy fingers for several hours. Add the chilli and garlic to the blender, and blitz to a thick puree. Add the vinegar and sugar, season generously and, with the motor running, add the oil in a slow, steady stream until the dressing is emulsified. Season to taste – it can take quite a bit of salt.</p> \n<p>Put a griddle pan on a high heat. Cut the cauliflower vertically into 1cm-wide slabs (keep any florets that fall off for a salad, say). Rub the slices in oil and season. Grill in batches for eight to 10 minutes, turning halfway, until lightly toasted and tender in the middle; adjust the flame if they seem to be burning. Transfer to a warm place and repeat with the remaining cauliflower.</p> \n<p>Lay the cauli on plates, spoon over the lentils and drizzle on dressing. Scatter on the parsley and serve.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-74e3dbef-e266-44e9-bcb5-f5e6a95a8cbb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433947449744/5e144a13-80ff-4cc8-94e6-eec45142f12d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Warm red peppers with tarragon, caper and egg&nbsp;dressing\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ warm red peppers with tarragon, caper and egg dressing: Chargrilling gives Mexican food much of its distinctive taste.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johanna Parkin for the Guardian.

Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>4 large red peppers</strong><br /><strong>A few slices rustic bread (or sourdough)</strong><br /><strong>1 large knob butter</strong><br /><strong>1-2 garlic cloves (to taste –I like mine garlicky), peeled and chopped very fine</strong></p> \n<p>For the dressing<br /><strong>2 medium free-range eggs</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp Dijon mustard</strong><br /><strong>150ml extra-virgin olive oil</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp red-wine vinegar</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp cornichons (or 1 small pickled gherkin)</strong><br /><strong>1 heaped tsp capers, rinsed and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 handful tarragon leaves, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 handful parsley leaves, finely chopped</strong></p> \n<p>Turn on a gas flame (or, if using an electric hob, heat up an old frying pan instead) and roast the peppers directly over the flame – put them on a wire rack, if need be – for eight to 12 minutes (longer if roasting in a pan on an electric ring), turning regularly, until black and blistered all over. Transfer to a bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave to sweat for 10 minutes (this makes them easier to peel).</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, bring a pan of water to a boil, cook the eggs for 10 minutes, drain and plunge into cold water. Peel the eggs and separate the yolks from the whites. In a large bowl, mash the yolks with the mustard, then dribble in the oil in a thin trickle, whisking as you go, as if you’re making mayonnaise. (If you add the oil too quickly, the sauce will split, but don’t worry too much, because it may well come back together; it won’t affect the taste.) Once all the oil is combined, stir in the vinegar.</p> \n<p>Chop the egg white and cornichons into small dice, then add to the sauce with the capers. Stir in the tarragon, half the parsley and a splash of water, then add more vinegar, mustard or salt to taste, and set aside.</p> \n<p>Blitz the bread into crumbs in a food processor. Melt the butter in a frying pan, add the garlic and fry for a few minutes, until golden. Stir in the crumbs and fry until golden, about 10 minutes. Peel the peppers, discarding the stems and as many seeds as you can, and tear into quarters. Drape over a pretty plate, drizzle with the dressing, then sprinkle with the rest of the parsley and the golden crumbs.</p> \n<h2><strong>And for the rest of the week…</strong></h2> \n<p>The charred tomato dressing transforms everything from fried eggs on toast to toasted goat’s cheese salad and grilled mackerel. It’s so versatile, I might even try it with vanilla ice-cream next. The egg and caper dressing is a classic sauce gribiche, which is delicious on grilled leeks or grilled baby gems, or as a straight dip. Roast extra peppers – they keep well under a film of oil – for adding to sandwiches and wraps, or for blitzing with garlic and oil to make a mouth-watering puree that goes particularly well with fish.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of Mexican restaurants</a>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433947305925/Grilled-cauliflower-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Thomasina Miers' grilled cauliflower with charred tomato dressing: A fabulous side for grilled fish, barbecued chicken or pork chops, or as part of a meze spread.

How do you pronounce ‘scone’ anyway? Who cares? Try baking either of these experimental scone-based recipes, or invent your own new variations, and you’ll get irresistible results.</p>","byline":"Ruby Tandoh","body":"<p>Scones are one of those rare things that are as good as they are simple. Sat somewhere between the richness of a cake and the body of a loaf of bread, scones are perfectly light, fluffy and tender – the ideal vessel for everything from butter to fruit to jam and clotted cream.</p> \n<p>The method is easy: just mix flour and a little butter, a raising agent and some liquid to give a heavy, slightly sticky dough. The rest is yours to experiment with: try wholemeal flour, add a drop of heavy cream, sweeten the dough with sugar, or golden syrup. Even a handful of honeycomb fragments or a few chocolate chips can be a welcome addition.</p> \n<p>While the purists squabble over pronunciation and whether you’re meant to put the cream on before the jam, take your scones far from the stagnant pedantry, go off-piste, and adapt them to suit your tastes.</p> \n<h2><strong>Spelt, blackberry and lemon cream shortcake</strong></h2> \n<p>Strawberry shortcake might be the archetype, but I find the slight tartness of blackberries a better match for the richness of cream, sugar and butter. With the addition of a little torn mint, too, it steps away from simple sweetness and towards a brighter, fresher summer flavour. This is in essence just a big scone – you can easily make smaller, individual ones if you prefer.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 4 generously</strong><br />250g blackberries, halved<br />25g caster sugar<br />150g white spelt flour <br />50g wholemeal spelt flour <br />50g unsalted butter<br />60g caster sugar<br />2 tsp baking powder<br />&frac14; tsp bicarbonate of soda<br />A pinch of salt<br />1 large egg<br />225ml double cream<br />75g whole natural yoghurt<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />30g icing sugar<br />A handful of mint leaves, roughly torn<br />Icing sugar, to dust</p> \n<p><strong>1 </strong>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Lightly grease a baking tray. Combine the blackberries and caster sugar and put in the fridge to rest until ready to serve.</p> \n<p><strong>2 </strong>Mix the white and wholemeal spelt flours in a large bowl then rub in the butter using your fingertips.</p> \n<p><strong>3 </strong>Stir in the sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt. In a separate bowl or jug, whisk the egg together with 75ml of the double cream.</p> \n<p><strong>4 </strong>Pour the cream mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring lightly to combine. The dough should be soft and a little sticky – if it feels tight or floury, add a drop more cream.</p> \n<p><strong>5 </strong>Gather the dough into a soft and crumbly ball and knead lightly a few times, taking care not to handle it for longer than 30 seconds or so. Pat down on the prepared baking tray to a fat disc 15-16cm in diameter. Put in the oven straight away (if you leave it sitting around too long, the bicarbonate of soda will exhaust itself, and the shortcake might not rise as well as it should) and bake for 20-25 minutes – or as long as it takes for the shortcake to rise, gently dome and set firm.</p> \n<p><strong>6 </strong>Leave the shortcake to cool a while before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. It’ll be really hot from the oven, so it’s important that you give it this time to rest before slicing and serving.</p> \n<p><strong>7 </strong>Whisk the remaining double cream, yoghurt, lemon zest and icing sugar together until thick enough to hold in soft peaks. Halve the shortcake horizontally to give two flat discs (they’ll be fragile, so take care to handle them gently). Spoon the cream all over the lower half, then spread over the blackberries and sprinkle on the mint. Sandwich with the other half of the shortcake and dust liberally with icing sugar. Serve straight away.</p> \n<h2><strong>Saffron, honey and sultana scones</strong></h2> \n<p>These aren’t the kind of scone meant to be served heaped with cream and jam. Infused with fragrant saffron and sweet with honey and fruit, they are perfect as they are – just split and spread thickly with salted butter.</p> \n<p><strong>Makes 12-15</strong><br />200ml milk<br />A couple of pinches of saffron threads<br />75g unsalted butter<br />350g plain flour<br />4 tsp baking powder<br />&frac14; tsp bicarbonate of soda<br />&frac14; tsp salt<br />175g sultanas<br />4 tbsp runny honey<br />2 tsp vanilla extract<br />1 egg, lightly beaten with 2 tsp milk, to use as a glaze<br />4-5 tbsp demerara sugar</p> \n<p><strong>1 </strong>Heat the milk and saffron gently until just shy of the boil, then leave to cool and infuse. By the time the milk’s at room temperature, it should be a rich yellow colour, and deeply fragrant. While the milk cools, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6 and lightly grease a large, heavy baking sheet.</p> \n<p><strong>2 </strong>Rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips, mixing until no visible bits of butter are left. Stir in the baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt. Stir in the sultanas. In a separate bowl, whisk the honey and vanilla together with 160ml of the milk (some of the milk will have evaporated when it was heated, which is why we started with a little more than we needed).</p> \n<p><strong>3 </strong>Add the liquid slowly to the flour mixture, stirring gently as you go. The dough ought to be soft, very slightly sticky but robust enough to cut into neat rounds. A wetter dough will yield lighter scones, while a drier one will leave you with hockey pucks. Add a dash more milk, if necessary. Resist the urge, too, to overmix the dough – the less you work it the better. Just stir until roughly combined then use your hands to finish mixing the ingredients, taking care to distribute the fruit evenly throughout. Tip the dough on to a lightly floured work surface and knead just a couple of times to bring the mixture smoothly together.</p> \n<p><strong>4 </strong>Dust the work surface with a little more flour and pat the dough down gently to a thickness of roughly 2cm. You can roll it if you prefer, but there’s no need to be too particular. Use a 6cm round pastry cutter to stamp out circles, and gently transfer these to the prepared baking tray.</p> \n<p><strong>5 </strong>Brush the tops of the scones with the egg to glaze them then sprinkle with demerara sugar. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, until well-risen, firm and golden brown. Leave to cool completely before serving.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"What is the correct order for topping your scone?\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://guardiannewsampampmedia.formstack.com/forms/untitled_form_19_copy_12_copy_17\" title=\"COOK June 13 Ruby Bakes\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434019741038/2ffed876-fe27-4676-8e4f-0ad31042675a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"Spelt, blackberry and lemon-cream shortcake (a bit like a scone) and unusual saffron, honey and sultana scones.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-13T05:00:15Z","lastModified":"2015-06-13T05:48:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":18,"contributors":[{"name":"Ruby Tandoh","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ruby-tandoh"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Baking","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/baking","webTitle":"Baking"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ruby Tandoh","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ruby-tandoh"}}],"series":{"title":"Ruby bakes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/ruby-bakes"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/13/scone-recipes-shortcake-ruby-tandoh","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ybd","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/13/scone-recipes-shortcake-ruby-tandoh","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/13/scone-recipes-shortcake-ruby-tandoh"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434019741038/2ffed876-fe27-4676-8e4f-0ad31042675a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"On the right: spelt, blackberry and lemon-cream shortcake (‘in essence just big scone’) and unusual saffron, honey and sultana scones.

Courgettes are gorgeous as they are, and win my most exacting taste test every time</p>","byline":"Yotam Ottolenghi","body":"<p>I love food to look beautiful. With vegetables, in particular, it can be just the natural colour that gets me: the pink-through-white in a stick of rhubarb, say, or the spray of purple on an artichoke. The way a vegetable is cooked can work a similar magic: the black lines on a slice of chargrilled aubergine or butternut squash look stunning, as do black poppy seeds scattered through a cucumber salad, pink peppercorns mixed into a&iuml;oli, fried slices of red chilli and garlic on broccoli.</p> \n<p>But the most exacting trial I put any recipe through is whether or not it passes my Very Delicious test. Like most people for whom English is a second language, I have a few stock phrases that I’ve made my own – even if they’re not quite grammatically correct. “Absolutely lovely”, I gather, is fine, as is “very tasty”, but the word “delicious” allows no room for improvement (my research tells me it’s a non-gradable adjective); so I’m all-too aware that describing something as “very delicious” is a bit OTT. It’s my phrase, though, and one that makes perfect sense to me; I have no plans to drop it any time soon.</p> \n<p>Some of the most very-delicious dishes, however, are the least beautiful. I’m not sure what the correct grammatical term for that is, but I do know the dish that exemplifies this contradiction above all others: stuffed courgettes. Over the years, I’ve cooked, eaten and written about stuffed courgettes in many different guises, and they rarely make the grade under the glare of the camera. The long cooking time required, as the vegetables stuffed with rice, spices and herbs swell in their braising stock, turns that once-vibrant green skin dull and that once-firm flesh limp. The taste, on the other hand, is knockout level, and if anything it’s even better the day after, especially when served with some minty yoghurt.</p> \n<p>If you want your courgette dish to pass both the Very Delicious and the looks tests, there are all sorts of things you can do to make it more attractive. I’m too much of a pasta-head to embrace <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/09/how-to-swap-carbs-for-vegetables-spaghetti-meatballs-recipe-residency-hemsley\">the spiralising trend</a>, which involves passing courgettes through a sharp blade and turning them into “courgetti”, but what do I know? The craze has taken off, with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/29/spiraliser-courgettes-hero-vegetables-supermarket-sales-soar\">supermarkets reporting a huge rise in courgette sales</a>.</p> \n<p>For me, courgettes are gorgeous just as they are, in – for example – a simple salad of thinly shaved raw strips tossed in olive oil, and served with a sharp green leaf such as sorrel, parmesan shavings and toasted pistachios. Or roasted whole, the smoky flesh scooped out and used as a dramatic dip. I’m not sure there is anything that scores higher on the beauty front than courgette flowers, all yellow and billowy, stuffed with ricotta, dipped in a light batter and quickly fried, served as they are or on top of a vegetable pie. Beautiful and very, very delicious.</p> \n<h2><strong>Chargrilled courgette and sorrel salad</strong></h2> \n<p>Emphatic proof, if any were needed, of the beauty that chargrilling lends to courgettes. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>90ml olive oil</strong><br /><strong>40g capers, drained and patted dry with kitchen paper</strong><br /><strong>20g pine nuts</strong><br /><strong>5 medium courgettes (a mix of green and yellow, if you can find them), trimmed and sliced on the diagonal into 1cm slices</strong><br /><strong>Salt and black pepper</strong><br /><strong>20g parmesan, shaved</strong></p> \n<p>For the salsa<br /><strong>1 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp lemon juice</strong><br /><strong>Finely grated zest of &frac12; lemon</strong><br /><strong>1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>10g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>30g sorrel, shredded</strong></p> \n<p>Pour two-thirds of the oil into a small saucepan and put on a high heat. Once hot, add the capers and fry for about two minutes, until they have opened up. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the capers to a plate lined with kitchen paper. Add the pine nuts to the pan, fry for 15-20 seconds, until just turning golden-brown, and add to the capers. Discard the oil.</p> \n<p>Put a ridged griddle pan on a high heat (ventilate your kitchen). Put the courgette slices in a bowl with the remaining olive oil, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and mix to coat. Grill in batches for about 90 seconds in total, turning once halfway through so both sides get dark char marks but the courgettes retain a bite. Transfer to a bowl and repeat with the rest.</p> \n<p>Put all the salsa ingredients in a small bowl, stir to combine, then toss into the courgettes. Spread on a platter, sprinkle over the capers, pine nuts and parmesan, and serve warm or at room temperature</p> \n<h2><strong>Steamed courgette with garlic and oregano</strong></h2> \n<p>Best made with young, tender courgettes, this dish works just fine with regular-sized ones, too. I love the final flourish of thinly sliced raw garlic, but if that’s a bit too much for your tastes, fry it with the oregano at the end. These make a simple and delicate starter, or as part of a meze. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>800g young courgettes, trimmed<br />Coarse sea salt</strong><br /><strong>250ml chicken stock</strong><br /><strong>4 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced paper-thin</strong><br /><strong>20 sprigs fresh oregano</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. If the courgettes are very small, keep them whole, otherwise cut them in half lengthways. Lay the courgettes cut side up in a high-sided ceramic baking dish (about 27cm x 22cm) in which they’ll sit quite snugly. Sprinkle over three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and set aside.</p> \n<p>Pour the stock into a small saucepan with half the garlic and half the oregano sprigs. Bring to a boil, then pour the hot stock all over the courgettes. Cover the dish tightly with a layer of aluminium foil and bake for 45 minutes, until the courgettes are very soft, then set aside to cool a little.</p> \n<p>Pick the leaves from the remaining oregano sprigs and discard the stems. In a small frying pan, heat the oil on a medium-high heat and, once good and hot and shimmering, fry the leaves for 90 or so seconds, until they start to crisp up, then tip into a small bowl.</p> \n<p>When you are ready to serve, lift the courgettes out of the warm stock and arrange them on a serving platter or on smaller individual plates. Scatter the crisp oregano leaves over the courgettes, pour over the oregano oil, too, then sprinkle on half a teaspoon of salt and the remaining slices of raw garlic, and serve at immediately.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a34590cb553d68fcabfa7d31e8bf14ad54b8d3f0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433953850794/4de037ca-af10-441f-9b45-c908615ae6f1-327x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Courgette and ciabatta frittata\" width=\"327\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s courgette and ciabatta frittata: light, fluffy and comforting – what more could you ask for?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johanna Parkin for the Guardian.

It’s light, fluffy and comforting (not least because the bread is soaked in milk and cream before it goes into the mix). Serve this with a mixed herb and bitter leaf salad, dressed with lemon juice and olive oil, and perhaps a few chunks of feta. Don’t waste the ciabatta crusts: blitz them into breadcrumbs and freeze – they keep really well. Serves six.</p> \n<p><strong>500g ciabatta, crusts removed and roughly torn (about 250g net)</strong><br /><strong>200ml milk</strong><br /><strong>200ml double cream</strong><br /><strong>2 large garlic cloves, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>6 large eggs, lightly beaten</strong><br /><strong>&frac34; tsp cumin</strong><br /><strong>80g parmesan, finely grated</strong><br /><strong>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br /><strong>2 medium courgettes, washed and coarsely grated</strong><br /><strong>25g basil leaves, torn</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Mix the ciabatta, milk and cream in a bowl, cover and set aside for 30 minutes, to give the torn bread time to absorb most of the liquid.</p> \n<p>In a large bowl, mix the garlic, eggs, cumin, 50g parmesan, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a quarter-teaspoon of ground pepper. Tip in the contents of the bread bowl, then stir in the courgette and basil.</p> \n<p>Heat a 20cm x 25cm baking dish in the oven for five minutes. Remove, brush all over with oil, to grease, then pour in the courgette mixture. Level out the top, bake for 20 minutes, then sprinkle over the remaining parmesan. Bake for 20-25 minutes longer, until the frittata is golden-brown on top and cooked through (test by inserting a knife into the centre – it should come out clean). Set aside to rest for five minutes, then serve.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk\">Ottolenghi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nopi-restaurant.com\">Nopi</a> in London.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433953425231/Chargrilled-courgette-and-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chargrilled courgette and sorrel salad: best made with a mixture of green and yellow courgettes, to up the stakes in the looks department.

His “hair” deserves its own account. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Scottish sausages\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned=&quot;&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; \n  &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; \n   &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt; \n  &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/21HZhLIuI6/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Back in Scotland.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n  &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Root + Bone (@rootandbone) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2015-05-18T16:26:42+00:00&quot;&gt;May 18, 2015 at 9:26am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>I love to think that Scotland’s food scene is now all local langoustines and foraged alexanders, but then they go and do something like this. “But Alistair, the Irn Bru adds a certain lubricious minerality to the pork, don’t you think?”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Rainbow bagel\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned=&quot;&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; \n  &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; \n   &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt; \n  &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/28n0dxFdih/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;It's Your Birthday !!!

I recently noticed a curious subset of restaurateurs: former Glaswegian pop stars in north London (Altered Images’ Stephen Lironi and his <a href=\"http://www.baresteban.com/\">Bar Esteban</a>; and Stephen Irvine of Lloyd Cole and the Commotions with <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/irvinbargrill\">Irvin Bar Grill</a>). The owners of <a href=\"http://www.voltafoodanddrink.co.uk/\">Volta in Manchester</a> are Luke Cowdrey and Justin Crawford, also known as the Unabombers, the DJ duo behind the much missed Electric Chair club, where munching didn’t feature largely, unless it was your own tongue. Seems the way to prolong the fun times these days is to open your own restaurant.</p> \n<p>But only if you do it well. These guys have. Volta is a smash in branch&eacute; West Didsbury. (I take a yoof who thought cool Manc began and ended at the Northern Quarter. He’s suitably impressed.) You enter via the outdoor terrace, blending almost seamlessly into Folk bar next door and creating a kind of benign, permanent street party. I love that, despite its lineage, the clientele is not just tattooed and ironically bespectacled – though there are those, too – but stout beer fans, date-night couples hysterically escaped from the kids, and eavesdrop-worthy, blind-dating gay pairs.</p> \n<p>Inspiration for the small plates menu comes, apparently, from the Unabombers’ global DJing trips. So harissa jostles on the menu with halloumi and puy lentils and Old Amsterdam cheese. The first salvo is a board of Iberian cured meats: silky <em>lomo embuchado</em> (dry-cured, fatless pork loin), good, full-flavoured Serrano ham, and salami with the sweet nuttiness of acorn-fed pork. Dotted around are tiny, scarlet, tear-shaped Sweety Drop pickled peppers, balsamic cipollini onions, and – proof that someone has a sense of humour – what appears to be a guindilla pepper rogering an olive. It comes with fine sourdough and springy, oily focaccia from the excellent <a href=\"http://www.trovefoods.co.uk/\">Troves in Levenshulme</a>.</p> \n<p>Then, lots of little dishes: purple sprouting broccoli, almost crunchy from its frying with chilli and shallot, a throbbing bass of a plateful. Lamb shawarma, the meat “pulled” into a chewy tangle and served with harissa so fierce it’d put hairs on the back of your throat – its yoghurt useless in the face of such full-on, fruity fire. Monkfish, ceviched with lime and chilli, the acidity calmed by coconut milk and the pearly freshness of the fish. Hanger steak, black and pink, showing off all the fibrous minerality of this cut, with homemade chips, both regular and sweet potato. Magnificent, juicy lamb chops, smoky from the grill and aromatic with brooding Lebanese spices – these wind up rammed into gurning faces like meaty muzzles.</p> \n<p>There’s a daily specials board. Ours – seared Cornish black bream, its skin crisp, on a pastry base layered with sea aster and spinach, lapped by sauce choron (a tomatoey half-brother to b&eacute;arnaise) – is genuinely special. A steamed orange and pecan pudding in a pool of toffee is the last dance in the arms of the one you really wanted.</p> \n<p>Volta covers all the bases. There’s plenty for vegetarians, even if gnocchi with “orange squash”, sage and pecorino could have been in a different league had the little dumplings been homemade. They’ve a brunch rammed with good things: kedgeree, “Borough” style fried cheese sandwich, dippy duck eggs. There are rare-breed roasts on Sunday; inventive cocktails; coffee and cake. The wine list is a doozy, too: written so you can’t resist ordering Luis Canas Rioja Blanca, “the only Rioja producer to be selected for El Bulli”.</p> \n<p>None of this is eye-popping, nor does it try to be. It’s the kind of place Manchester does beautifully, not a tortured, tweezered temple of haute cuisine with all the atmosphere of an embalmers’ webinar. I wish Manchester – and Glasgow, Liverpool et al – would ditch Michelin chips on shoulders and just get on with this sort of brilliance. I do not mean only the discerning in That London can cope with old fayn dayning – rather that it is over-blessed by those willing to be snowed by specious badges of “quality”.</p> \n<p>I like Volta. A lot. Love its insouciantly chic, vintage bistrot decor; love Amy, our pink-haired waitress. So much so that I even forgive them for calling themselves an “eaterie”. Brrr. The Unabombers are still mixing it. The party never needs to end.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://www.voltafoodanddrink.co.uk/\">Volta</a>, 167 Burton Rd, West Didsbury, Manchester, 0161 448 8887.
