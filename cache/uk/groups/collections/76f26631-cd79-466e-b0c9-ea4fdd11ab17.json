They spoiled us rotten with small renditions of their classic dishes, one of which was a simple strawberry gazpacho that was refreshing, fragrant and deeply satisfying all at the same time. It inspired me to make my own version.</p> \n<p>Like strawberries, broad beans are also in the height of season, though you could use frozen for the herby, garlicky puree to go with glazed, fennel-spiced pork (and you don’t need to peel the skins, either). Magic.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tomato gazpacho with strawberries</strong></h2> \n<p>The cucumber, chilli and oil add savouriness to the tomatoes and strawberries, while the almonds give body (if you’re allergic to nuts, use bread for bulk instead). The soup should be <em>very </em>cold. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>60g blanched almonds</strong><br /><strong>2 fat cloves garlic, peeled, cut in half lengthways and green core removed</strong><br /><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br /><strong>1 small bunch basil (set aside a few leaves to garnish)</strong><br /><strong>1 red chilli, stem removed</strong><br /><strong>1 Lebanese cucumber (or &frac12; a large one)</strong><br /><strong>300g strawberries, stems removed</strong><br /><strong>6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp sherry vinegar</strong><br /><strong>1.2kg very ripe tomatoes</strong></p> \n<p>To serve<br /><strong>2 small Hass avocados, peeled, stoned and diced (do this at the last minute, so they don’t discolour)</strong><br /><strong>A few strawberries, diced</strong><br /><strong>The juice of 1 lime</strong><br /><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>Put a frying pan on a medium heat. Toast the almonds, shaking the pan occasionally, until pale golden and nutty-smelling. Tip into a food processor and blitz with the garlic, a teaspoon of salt, the basil and chilli, until the nuts are ground to dust. Top and tail the cucumber, add to the processor with the strawberries, oil and vinegar, and blitz to a smooth puree. Add the tomatoes and plenty of black pepper, and blitz until smooth – if your food processor is too full, transfer half the mix to a bowl and blitz in two phases.</p> \n<p>Now taste: chilling dulls the flavours, so make sure you can taste all the ingredients, and season with salt, pepper and vinegar as needed; if you like heat, you may want to add another chilli, too, but chop it finely before you whizz it in, so it gets fully incorporated. Pour into a suitable container, cover and chill for a good few hours.</p> \n<p>When you are ready to eat, roll up the reserved basil leaves and shred finely. Put the diced avocado and strawberries in a bowl, season and add the lime juice and a few tablespoons of oil.</p> \n<p>Serve the soup in small bowls (it is very filling) garnished with spoonfuls of avocado and strawberry relish and a scattering of basil.</p> \n<h2><strong>Griddled pork tenderloin with crushed broad beans</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"790bc2f9870da15713020aa24af4d94adce76426\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436268800372/80f85088-03d8-46c2-b6e9-03bf105101b3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' griddled pork tenderloin with crushed broad beans: 'An easy way to impress friends.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ griddled pork tenderloin with crushed broad beans: ‘An easy way to impress friends.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

An easy way to impress friends. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>2 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>Sea salt and black pepper</strong><br /><strong>3 bay leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 heaped tsp fennel seeds</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; tsp black peppercorns</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; tsp dried chilli flakes (Turkish, ideally)</strong><br /><strong>A few sprigs fresh thyme, picked and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>A few sprigs fresh rosemary, picked and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong> </strong></p> \n<p><strong>50g dark brown sugar</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp balsamic vinegar</strong><br /><strong>800g pork loin fillet</strong><br /><strong>Olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>For the broad bean puree<br /><strong>4 cloves garlic, peeled, cut in half lengthways and green core removed</strong><br /><strong>2 bay leaves</strong><br /><strong>300ml single cream</strong><br /><strong>400g podded broad beans (fresh or frozen)</strong><br /><strong>A squeeze of lemon</strong><br /><strong>1 handful each fresh dill and mint, picked and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 small handful pine nuts, toasted</strong></p> \n<p>Crush the garlic in a mortar with half a teaspoon of flaky sea salt. Add the bay leaves, fennel, peppercorns and chilli, grind for a few minutes, then work in the herbs. Stir in the sugar and vinegar, then rub into the pork with a few tablespoons of oil. Put in the fridge to marinate for an hour.</p> \n<p>Put the garlic in a pan with the bay and cream, and bring slowly to a boil. Turn down the heat and simmer gently until the garlic is soft, about 10 minutes. Discard the bay and blitz the garlic and cream with a stick blender. Return to the heat and simmer gently while you cook the beans in a pan of salted water for a few minutes, until just tender.</p> \n<p>Drain the beans, add to the cream mix and blitz until half the beans are crushed and the rest retain some shape. Season, add the herbs and a squeeze of lemon, and keep warm.</p> \n<p>Heat a griddle pan on a medium heat. Rub the fillets in oil and season well, then grill for about 10 minutes in all, brushing frequently with the oily marinade, until blackened and glazed all over. Remove from the heat, leave to rest for five minutes, then cut a piece in half – if it needs more cooking, slap it back on the griddle. Cut the fillets into avocado-length slices, then cut each slice diagonally in half. Serve with the warm broad bean mix, the meat’s resting juices, a few extra herbs and a scattering of pine nuts.</p> \n<h2><strong>And for the rest of the week</strong></h2> \n<p>I can drink gazpacho at any time of day, though I particularly like it for breakfast when I’ve overdone things the night before – it’s a really refreshing, and also filling, alternative to toast. The bean puree is gorgeous tossed just as it is into spaghetti; before serving, scatter in a few extra herbs and olive oil to liven it up. Cut leftover pork into wafer-thin slices, and toss into a stir-fry or eat cold for lunch with apple chutney and a few salads.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of Mexican restaurants</a>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/7/1436268649422/Thomasina-Miers-tomato-ga-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Thomasina Miers' tomato gazpacho with strawberries: 'Refreshing.'                 Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

Just don’t forget the sugar…</p>","byline":"Ruby Tandoh","body":"<p>In this age of prolific food photography and Instagramming, it’s no surprise that the gooseberry has fallen out of favour – these fat little berries aren’t the most attractive fruit. Some blush to a reddish purple colour as summer wears on, but most are pale green, watery looking, peppered with little seeds. They have a tendency to sink into a grey-green mush when cooked. Often they’re spiked with light bristles. But if you can look past their appearance, you’ll find them a delight to cook with: sharp, sour, bright – a remedy to summer’s heat and an unlikely kitchen hero.</p> \n<p>In early summer, the gooseberries on the shelves are the young, green ones – plump but firm, just soft enough to pinch between your fingers. The sugar quantities in these recipes reflect that: a lot of sweetness is needed to offset the mouth-puckering sharpness of these under-ripe fruits. As the season goes on, though, the gooseberries grow softer and sweeter. If you’re cooking with riper berries, you might want to tweak the amount of sugar in the sorbet and the crumble filling, to taste.</p> \n<h2><strong>Sweet wine and gooseberry sorbet</strong></h2> \n<p>Because sorbet needs a hefty dose of sugar to stop it from freezing solid, it works best with fruits that can balance that sweetness with acidity. Traditionally that would be lemon, but gooseberry works perfectly too.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br />450g gooseberries<br />150-200g caster sugar<br />200ml sweet white wine, such as Muscatel</p> \n<p>1 Simmer the gooseberries, 150g sugar and half the wine together over a low heat for 10 minutes, until the gooseberries are very soft. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve, pressing through as much of the gooseberry juice and pulp as possible. Discard the skins, seeds and stalks.</p> \n<p>2 Decant into a large, lidded plastic container, stir in the remaining wine and add another 50g sugar to taste. Make the sorbet sweeter than seems right, as the flavours will dull when it’s frozen. Leave to cool to room temperature. Transfer to the fridge to thoroughly chill before moving the sorbet to the freezer to set.</p> \n<p>3 Stir vigorously at half-hour intervals for the first couple of hours of freezing time to break up any large ice crystals, then leave to freeze completely overnight. Allow to soften slightly in the fridge prior to serving.</p> \n<h2><strong>Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard</strong></h2> \n<p>A gently sweet coconut-crumble topping balances the fruit’s bite without smothering its bright flavour. And as much as I love gooseberries, a 100% gooseberry crumble is a little too tart even for my tastes. To that end, I’ve used a mixture of gooseberry and apple for the filling, the apple lending a welcome textural contrast to the gooseberries’ yielding softness, while mellowing the taste. You can, of course, cook this in a single, larger oven dish if you prefer, baking for 40 minutes or so.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69a68984a095a2abb8ff055f7fb8394ae34dc80f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436438482535/00fbe552-eeff-440d-a8c2-8dd1e957ff6e-460x349.jpeg\" alt=\"Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard\" width=\"460\" height=\"349\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard.

Toss the fruit together with the sugar and set aside while you make the crumble.</p> \n<p>2 Stir the flour, coconut and sugar together in a large bowl, then rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture’s sandy. Divide the fruit between six ramekins, add a thick layer of crumble to each and bake for 30 minutes, until the puddings are bubbling and the topping’s crisp.</p> \n<p>3 While the crumbles are cooking, make the custard. Heat the coconut milk until it’s just about to boil. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a separate mixing bowl, then slowly pour the scalding-hot coconut milk into the bowl, whisking constantly. Once you’ve added all the milk, decant the custard back into the pan. Stir it over a very low heat for five minutes or so, until it’s smooth and coats the back of the spoon. It’ll quickly curdle if it’s overcooked, though, so take it off the heat as soon as it’s a pourable custard consistency, and don’t let it boil. Once it’s ready, whisk in the vanilla extract and serve with the hot puddings.</p> \n<h2><strong>Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake</strong></h2> \n<p>This is one of those blessedly easy cakes that you can rustle together the second the craving hits you – just summer fruit scattered through a simple pound cake mix. You can swap ground almonds for the roasted ground hazelnuts if you want, but I think the more robust, woody flavour of hazelnut sits well against the bright fruit.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"360152a618142c01feb1829d1a11cd699efc1161\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436438621227/40e964f2-cc60-41b7-a59e-af3f90f94fd4-460x311.jpeg\" alt=\"Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"311\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake: You can swap ground almonds for the roasted ground hazelnuts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If you can’t find the ready-ground stuff in the supermarket, just roast blanched hazelnuts at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 8-10 minutes, until toasted to a rich golden hue, then grind to a fine meal in a coffee grinder or food processor.</p> \n<p>I’ve left this uniced because I don’t think it needs much dressing up, but you could always brush the top with water icing or drizzle with white chocolate if you feel the cake needs a lift.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br />125g unsalted butter, softened<br />125g caster sugar<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />2 large eggs<br />125g plain flour<br />50g roasted ground hazelnuts<br />1&frac14; tsp baking powder<br />&frac14; tsp salt<br />150g gooseberries<br />75g strawberries</p> \n<p> 1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a 2lb/900g loaf tin with baking parchment.</p> \n<p>2 Beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest together until very light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating each one in thoroughly. In a separate bowl, blend the flour, roasted ground hazelnuts, baking powder and salt, then fold this mixture into the wet ingredients until smooth.</p> \n<p>3 Top and tail and then halve the gooseberries. Halve the strawberries, cutting any very large ones into quarters. Mix just over three quarters of the fruit into the cake batter. Spoon the batter into the prepared tin then scatter the remaining fruit on top and press gently in.</p> \n<p>4 Bake in the preheated oven for around an hour, until the cake is well risen and golden. A knife inserted into the deepest part of the cake should come out clean when the cake is cooked through.

With its multiple long, thin stems sprouting from a swollen, globe-shaped base, it looks very weird indeed, like something from outer space.</p> \n<p>For something so odd-looking, however, its flavour is very mild-mannered and neutral. If you’ve never tried kohlrabi, do give it a go. It belongs to the cabbage family and, eaten raw, tastes a&nbsp;bit like a mild sweet radish or cauliflower stalk. Thinly shaved, or cut into batons or dice, and added to a slaw or stir-fry, kohlrabi is crunchy and refreshing, with a little peppery kick for added interest. I love to eat young kohlrabi raw at this time of the year, and slow-cook the larger bulbs in the colder months, especially in a creamy gratin.</p> \n<h2><strong>Kohlrabi and lime salad</strong></h2> \n<p>Possibly the most amount of flavour packed into one of the shortest recipes I’ve ever written. Serves four, generously.</p> \n<p><strong>3 small kohlrabi, peeled and cut into 5mm x 5cm batons (500g net weight)</strong><br /><strong>2 granny smith apples, peeled and cut into 5mm x 5cm batons</strong><br /><strong>2 green chillies, deseeded and julienned</strong><br /><strong>15g picked coriander leaves</strong><br /><strong>15g picked mint leaves</strong><br /><strong>10g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 spring onions, trimmed and thinly&nbsp;sliced</strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tbsp black sesame seeds</strong><br /><strong>Finely grated zest of 1 lime, plus 2&frac12;&nbsp;tbsp lime juice</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp groundnut oil</strong><br /><strong>1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>80g creme fraiche</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp sesame oil</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong></p> \n<p>Put all the ingredients apart from the&nbsp;creme fraiche and sesame oil in a&nbsp;big bowl with three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Stir well, then divide between four plates. Spoon creme fraiche on top, followed by a little drizzle of sesame oil, and serve at once. (See, simple.)&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>Spicy aubergine with kohlrabi and coconut</strong></h2> \n<p>Serve this with warm naan bread or&nbsp;poppadoms, and maybe some plain&nbsp;rice. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>120ml sunflower oil</strong><br /><strong>1 medium kohlrabi, peeled and cut into 5cm-long and 1cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>2 large onions, peeled and cut into 2cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>3 aubergines, cut into 7cm-long and 3cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>&frac34; tsp turmeric</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp ground cumin</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp black mustard seeds</strong><br /><strong>4 whole sprigs fresh curry leaves (about 30 leaves)</strong><br /><strong>2 large tomatoes, cut into 2cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>80g fresh coconut, finely grated (ie, the flesh from roughly half a small coconut)</strong><br /><strong>220g Greek yoghurt</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp lime juice</strong><br /><strong>20g coriander leaves, roughly chopped</strong></p> \n<p>For the spice paste<br /><strong>4 large stalks lemongrass, woody ends and outer layer removed and discarded, very finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>6cm piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>6 fresh kaffir lime leaves</strong><br /><strong>1 red chilli, roughly chopped </strong><br /><strong>1 dried red chilli, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 small banana shallot, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>90ml sunflower oil</strong></p> \n<p>Put all the spice paste ingredients apart from the oil in a food processor. With the motor running, slowly add half the oil and process until you have a paste, stopping the machine and scraping the sides of the bowl as you go. Set aside (the remaining three tablespoons of oil will be used to fry the paste later). &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Heat a tablespoon and a half of oil in a large-heavy based saucepan or saute pan for which you have a lid, and put on a medium-high heat. Add the kohlrabi and cook, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until it starts to soften and turn a dark golden-brown. Tip into a large bowl.</p> \n<p>Pour another tablespoon and a half of oil into the pan, add the onion and saute for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden-brown. Add to the kohlrabi bowl.</p> \n<p>Add the last of the oil to the pan and fry the aubergines for 15 minutes, stirring from time to time, until soft and golden-brown, but still holding their shape. Stir in the turmeric, cumin and a teaspoon and a half of salt, cook for two minutes, then add the mustard seeds, cook for a minute and add to the kohlrabi bowl.</p> \n<p>Wipe clean the pan and put on a medium-low heat. Add the reserved oil from the spice paste and, when hot, add the paste and fry gently for about 25 minutes, stirring often, until it takes on a nice golden colour. Add the curry leaves and tomatoes, cook for five minutes, then add the fried vegetables and 400ml cold water. Cover and cook on a low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p> \n<p>To serve, divide the curry into bowls and scatter with coconut. Put a spoonful of yoghurt on each portion (serve the rest on the side), add a squeeze of lime and a sprinkling of coriander, and serve at once.</p> \n<h2><strong>Kohlrabi kimchi</strong></h2> \n<p>Kimchi is an acquired taste, but those who enjoy it, myself included, tend to find it addictive, and eat it with just about anything: grilled meat, seafood, or just spooned over a bowl of rice. The longer you leave the kimchi, the more the flavours develop – it will keep in the fridge for several months. Makes about 900g.</p> \n<p><strong>3 large kohlrabi, peeled, cut in half horizontally and then into 5mm-thick&nbsp;slices</strong><br /><strong>12 spring onions, trimmed and cut into 4-5cm slices</strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tbsp caster sugar</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>3cm piece ginger, peeled and finely&nbsp;chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp nanami togarashi (Japanese assorted chilli pepper)</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp fish sauce</strong></p> \n<p>Put the kohlrabi and spring onion in a large bowl with the sugar and two teaspoons of salt. Mix and set aside for 45 minutes, stirring once or twice. Drain off any moisture that has leached from the vegetables and add the garlic, ginger, nanami togarashi and fish sauce to the bowl. Mix to combine, cover with cling-film and put somewhere dark and cool for two days. Transfer to a clean airtight container and store in the fridge.</p> \n<h2><strong>Fritti misti</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6adac030eaa8ddaf0c516f2f772c5fc03bb52e1f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435759803973/6e956356-0974-4cd2-86bf-abf5018c4674-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi's fritti misti\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s fritti misti: ‘My version of a dish at San Francisco’s legendary Zuni Cafe.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian. Food styling: Emily Kydd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is my version of a dish at San Francisco’s legendary <a href=\"http://www.zunicafe.com\" title=\"\">Zuni Cafe</a>. Use a mandolin, if you have one, to slice the vegetables as thin as they need to be. You can use any seasonal veg you fancy; most will work really well, just as they do&nbsp;for tempura. The batter’s good with seafood, too. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>120g plain flour</strong><br /><strong>120g semolina</strong><br /><strong>1&frac14; tbsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed</strong><br /><strong>1&frac14; tbsp whole aniseed, roughly crushed</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>400g buttermilk</strong><br /><strong>1 litre sunflower oil, for frying</strong><br /><strong>1 medium&nbsp;kohlrabi, peeled, trimmed and cut into 5mm-wide rounds</strong><br /><strong>1 medium desiree potato, peeled and cut&nbsp;lengthways&nbsp;into 3mm-wide rounds</strong><br /><strong>1 small fennel bulb, trimmed and cut lengthways into 5mm-wide slices </strong><br /><strong>1 lemon, cut into 2mm-thick slices, plus 4 lemon halves for squeezing</strong><br /><strong>20&nbsp;large&nbsp;sage leaves</strong><br /><strong>40g capers, rinsed and patted dry</strong></p> \n<p>Put the flour, semolina, coriander, aniseed and a teaspoon and a quarter of salt in a shallow bowl. Mix well and set aside. Pour the buttermilk into a separate shallow bowl.</p> \n<p>Pour the oil into a large saucepan and put on a medium-high heat for five to six minutes, until it reaches 160C (if you have one, use a probe or thermometer to check). While the oil is warming, dip the kohlrabi a slice at time into first the buttermilk and then the flour, just so it’s roughly covered. Once all the kohlrabi is battered, carefully drop the slices into the oil in batches of about&nbsp;eight&nbsp;and fry for&nbsp;two to three minutes, turning once halfway through, until golden-brown on both sides. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a wire rack lined with kitchen paper; transfer to a medium oven to keep hot while you repeat with the remaining kohlrabi.</p> \n<p>Batter and cook the potato, fennel, lemon and sage in the same way: the potato and fennel will take two to three minutes, the lemon one to two minutes and the sage only about 30 seconds. Don’t worry if they are not evenly covered by the batter: the finished dish looks better if you can see some of the vegetable through the crisp coating.</p> \n<p>Once all the vegetables are fried, add the capers to the oil (ie, don’t dip them in the buttermilk and flour first) and fry on a medium heat for a&nbsp;minute, until they open up like flowers and go crisp. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and add to the vegetables. Transfer the fritti misti to a large platter or individual plates, and serve with the&nbsp;lemon halves to squeeze over.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk\" title=\"\">Ottolenghi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nopi-restaurant.com\" title=\"\">Nopi</a> in London.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/1/1435759590348/Yotam-Ottolenghis-kohlrab-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Yotam Ottolenghi's kohlrabi and lime salad: 'Possibly the most amount of flavour packed into one of the shortest recipes I've written.'

Or, failing that (and with magazine lead times and the yelping maw of the internet, it’s an increasingly rare privilege), at the very least a bit of a story. We’re all, what’s new? What’s hot? What’s happening, baybee?</p> \n<p>Me, too. Then I clock comments under <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/10/cult-food-most-incredible-dishes-share-summer-2015-instagram\" title=\"\">a piece I wrote on cult internet dishes</a> – dishes designed to appeal to the new, social-meeja-savvy breed of restaurant-goer – and see howl after howl of disenfranchised pain from people who appear to find the 21st century food fan as evil a construct as a banker pal of Pol Pot’s. And, because I’m accommodating, I&nbsp;resolve to review somewhere everyone will love. Somewhere that takes reservations. With cocktails devoid of sipping vinegars, nothing but round white crockery, and a distinct lack of anything fashioned from pig’s blood or muntjac.</p> \n<p>To find such a pillar of delicious conventionality, where to look? Why, another restaurant critic, of course. And not just any restaurant critic, but the uncrowned king of our&nbsp;breed, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2009/oct/26/aa-gill-shot-baboon\" title=\"\">the baboon-murdering</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/media/aa-gill\" title=\"\">genius wordsmith</a>. Famously cutting, <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Magazine/article1536361.ece\" title=\"\">he likes the place</a>, so here I&nbsp;am at Chelsea’s posh <a href=\"http://www.thecrosskeyschelsea.co.uk\" title=\"\">the Cross Keys</a>, shimmering with happy anticipation. Look at the lovely refurb of this ancient boozer, all Provence-meets-Dalston; feel the&nbsp;buttery, liver-coloured leather banquettes; swoon at the staff, with their well-bred hair and pinky signets.</p> \n<p>But I’ve been led up the ancestral driveway. With the exception of the&nbsp;meal’s bookends – good, airy focaccia-style bread and desserts (a&nbsp;fashionable chocolate bar, all ganache and crisp and peanuts, and idiot-proof lemon syllabub) – there isn’t anything that’s wholly successful. And there’s a lot that’s genuinely wrong.</p> \n<p>We’re still bright-eyed with the arrival of pleasingly acerbic soused mackerel with a whole soap opera of&nbsp;supporting cast: boiled purple potatoes, sections of satsuma, monk’s beard and whipped St Maure goat’s cheese. But alarm bells are set off by a veal tonnato, delivered with a “Watch out, the plate is very hot”. This classic Italian combination of thinly sliced roast veal in a tuna-laced mayonnaise is always served cold. Always. To serve it hot isn’t a&nbsp;tweak or twist, it’s a solecism – and one that does the dish no favours. The veal has collapsed into greyish mush, its mayo split into vomity curds. It is topped with cheese shavings, frilly fried red onion and the odd mouth-puckering burst from tiny, pickled mousseron mushrooms. But all this gussying can’t save the thing: it’s genuinely bloody awful.</p> \n<p>Also poor is turbot, that prince among fish, reduced here to a leathery, overcooked and minuscule prole, with Jersey Royals, mussels and (undetectable) champagne. There’s an OK lamb rump dish, padded out with quantities of hummus spiked with preserved lemon, broad beans and roast sweet potatoes, as though someone’s sneakily added meat to something from a vegan collective in Hove. With chips (“Aspen fries”: fine, in truffle oil and parmesan as is&nbsp;the cliche) and broccoli (its hollandaise and toasted almond topping disguising a sodden bottom), our meal costs &pound;160 for two. And, no, we don’t drink ourselves into a stupor.</p> \n<p>I don’t know how I manage to have such a dramatically different meal from the monkey murderer. Perhaps the chef (recruited from the entirely excellent <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2011/jul/22/medlar-london-sw1-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">Medlar</a> nearby) has moved on. Perhaps the baboon butcher was overcome by the “famous Scotch eggs”. Or perhaps he just needs to get out of&nbsp;Chelsea more often.</p> \n<p>And it turns out that the Cross Keys has quite a lot of story: patronised over the years by everyone from Agatha Christie to&nbsp;the Rolling Stones, it’s one of Chelsea’s oldest pubs. It was abandoned for a while, under threat of conversion by developers into residences for the super-rich, only to be reprieved at the last moment after petitions from the likes of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/zac-goldsmith\" title=\"\">Zac Goldsmith</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/media/piersmorgan\" title=\"\">Piers Morgan</a> (now <em>there’s </em>a conflicting sentence). While shuttered, squatters moved in; a polite band, leaving notices on the doors introducing themselves, and promising a gallery space and the serving of Sunday lunch. On the strength of our meal, I have a strong suspicion that I would have enjoyed that a whole lot more.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://www.thecrosskeyschelsea.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>The Cross Keys</strong></a> 1 Lawrence Street, London SW3, 020- 7351 0686.

Simple ideas that turn frozen bananas into instant ice-cream, peaches into ready-made bellini blocks, cherries into a chewy snack and spice up your grapes</p>","byline":"Henrietta Clancy","body":"<p>Poor fruit. There it was for years, playing the nutritious role in packed lunches, filling a bowl on the kitchen table. Bland but trustworthy; unsexy but good for you. No one questioned it, because it had always been that way; an apple a day keeps the doctor away.</p> \n<p>But then it became famous – really, really famous – as smoothified liquid. Suddenly we could all reach our five a day in five minutes flat. We could blend our fruit into oblivion and gulp the shapeless mush down for breakfast – we’d conquered our healthy-living regimes by 8am. Those were the days when blueberries were the glorified superfruit; smoothies were oft indigo. We were winning.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee7b88a24ba4b55b4a734239b07458df446760d8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436369465583/cc767fa2-9d76-424f-a074-add841d92ec8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Grapes need nothing more than a stint in the freezer to turn into self-contained mini sorbets.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grapes only need a stint in the freezer to become handy portable self-contained mini sorbets.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Then the message changed. “Eat your fruit and juice your veg,” the headlines shouted. This mantra was first voiced by a certain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_W._Walker\">raw-food enthusiast named Dr Norman Walker</a> in the 1930s, but it is arguably having a far greater moment this time round. While kale stepped into the limelight – flanked by broccoli florets and a leafy head of celery – fruit receded, tarnished and shamed by the sugar brush (a glass of juice was on par with a can of full-fat Coke If you were to leave a tooth in a glass of orange juice at night, it would most likely dissolve by the morning). Those who care about such things tranformed their Instagrammed smoothies to green, brown, and occasionally red (thanks to beetroot, the earth’s gift to Renaissance fresco makers and aesthetically aware juicing fanatics alike).</p> \n<p>So where are we now? Confused. We are fearful of fruit juice and, by proxy, wary of fruit in its natural shapely state; which is sad, because it’s summertime, and nature’s sweet-smelling bounty is weighing down vines and branches across the land. If we don’t pick and eat it, the birds will. It’s time to start eating your fruit – that’s right, using your teeth. Here are some ridiculously easy ideas to help.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d7295b6fc4555e20249dfb3a5be9e098ea5b7127\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436369609202/d29fec03-78b4-40c0-afe4-cc01d8eeeb69-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The high quantity of fruit pectins in the frozen bananas turn them into a smooth, creamy dessert.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This is plain banana - whipped, with nothing added. The high quantity of fruit pectins in the fruit turns it into a smooth, creamy dessert.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Freeze it</strong></h2> \n<p>Ripe fruit waits for no one, and the freezer is a far better place for it than the compost bin. Bite-sized fruits work particularly well: whole red berries freeze brilliantly, but can be a tad tart to enjoy alone – serve them with a hot white-chocolate sauce, as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2010/nov/04/the-ivy-celebrities-memories\">London restaurant The Ivy</a> did in the late 2000s. Alternatively, cut strawberries and raspberries into pea-sized nuggets before freezing so they’ll work as instant fruit-filled ice bombs to fold into Eton mess, or scatter over ice creams or drinks. Simplest of all, grapes need nothing more than a stint in the freezer to turn into self-contained mini sorbets. If you want to go to a little more effort (if you can call it that), try some of these recipes:</p> \n<p><strong>Frozen banana ice-cream</strong><br />Vegans have been in the know for years – a ripe banana, sliced up and frozen, and then whipped for long enough, all alone, undergoes a transformation whereby its high quantity of fruit pectins turns it into a smooth, creamy dessert. Patience is key. Although the mixture might resemble cottage cheese for a while, it will become whipped soon enough. Dollop the “ice-cream” into bowls and scatter some berry fruit nuggets on top to serve. This is best made in small batches as the ‘ice cream’ doesn’t re-freeze well, so make just enough to eat.</p> \n<p><strong>Cocktail blocks</strong> <br />Okay, so this isn’t technically eating, but it’s too good to leave out. Turn your overripe peaches into nifty bellini blocks by peeling, blending, then freezing them into ice cubes. Simply top a cube with bubbles to order. For enough strawberry daiquiris to satiate the thirsts of four, blend 400g ripe strawberries with the juice of 2 limes and a half teaspoon of caster sugar then pour into ice-cube trays. To serve, blend the cubes with 25-35ml white rum per person and a splash of water. Pour the frozen daquiri into a glass with a lime slice to garnish the rim.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/08/kitchen-gadgets-review-food-dehydrator\">Kitchen gadgets review: My Kitchen Food Dehydrator – hardly cut and dried</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>Dry it</strong></h2> \n<p>Our gadget guru <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rhik-samadder\">Rhik Samadder</a> rates his dehydrator, but you don’t need one to make the sort of snacks for which you’ll pay through the nose in a health-food shop. All you need is an oven, preferably with a fan setting, and a day at home to patiently await the drying out of your snacks. That or another heatwave.</p> \n<p><strong>Ginger apple crisps</strong><br />Using a mandolin, slice a peeled apple into very thin slices – the thinner they are, the quicker they will dry out. Use a microplane to grate a piece of ginger and thin the resultant paste with a squeeze of lemon and a little honey. Gently mix the apple slices with the paste and place on a silicone mat or parchment paper. Set your oven to 60C fan (or the lowest setting available). The apples are ready when they are no longer soft.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51d03d80d9d10ce31ebb462d086870b29f8468a3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436370067560/f4a5de10-f778-4f9e-8755-a27eef500d3d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The cherry leather is a perfect chewy snack.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cherry leather is a perfect chewy snack.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Cherry leather</strong><br />Combine 400g cherries (stoned weight around 360g), 100ml water, the zest and juice of 1 lemon and 1 tbsp honey in a saucepan, bring to the boil, then simmer for 20 minutes. The fruit will have lost its shape and the liquid will have reduced a little. Blend until smooth. Line a baking tray with a silicone mat (or parchment paper), then pour on the mixture and use a spatula or the back of a spoon to spread it evenly across the whole baking sheet – it should be 2-3mm thick. This is a little tricky, but as long as there are no holes, you’re doing fine. Set your oven to 60C fan (or the lowest setting available). Depending on your oven settings, it should take 4-6 hours to dry out. The cherry leather is ready when it’s no longer tacky to the touch.</p> \n<h2>Spice it</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4e10ba9a986dadfe4a28e2f8742747ecaec09d1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436370680925/eda3e29e-0895-4e0c-9968-9e8e60c7f04d-415x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Spiced crunchy grapes.\" width=\"415\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spiced crunchy grapes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Crunchy spiced grapes <br /><em>by </em></strong><a href=\"http://www.clubgascon.com/pascal.php\"><strong><em>Pascal Aussignac</em></strong></a><br />Crush 10g each of black sesame seeds, fennel seeds, sunflower seeds, pistachio nuts, wasabi peas and 20g Rice Krispies into a fine crumb using a pestle and mortar. Add 50g sugar to a pan and place over a medium heat.

Simply chop up a selection of fruit – mango and pineapple are traditional, apple, strawberries and grapes will work, too. Squeeze over some lime and throw in a couple of pinches of chilli powder and salt.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436369213096/Henrietta-Clancys-fruit-r-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"From top left: frozen banana ice cream, frozen grapes, strawberry daiquiri, cherry leather, spiced grapes.

Apologies to any American readers too busy rolling their eyes to read on – but your beloved spicy chicken wings, named for the north-eastern city rather than the big beast of the endless plains, are all but unknown here in Britain. In fact, though you consume 1.23bn of them every Super Bowl weekend, we’re not enthusiastic consumers of the cut in general, and I found them surprisingly hard to track down.</p> \n<p>Perhaps British meat-eaters should be embracing them as part of a commitment to eat nose to tail – they’re great value in the UK (<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/01/28/170482118/why-chicken-wings-dominate-super-bowl-snack-time?ft=1&amp;f=1001&amp;sc=tw&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">as opposed to in the US</a>) and, though there’s not much on them, what meat there is is seriously tasty.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/01/how-to-make-perfect-summer-cup-pimms\">How to make the perfect summer cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Plus, as American barflies will concur, they make excellent beer food – in fact, though much <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1980/08/25/an-attempt-to-compile-a-short-history-of-the-buffalo-chicken-wing?currentPage=all\">hotly spiced debate surrounds the circumstances</a> of their invention in the 1960s, all sources agree they were an immediate success with drinkers, and their fame soon spread nationwide. There’s even an international chain dedicated to them. So, are they worth adopting?</p> \n<h2>The preparation</h2> \n<p>If you buy your chicken wings whole, you’ll need to separate them into the rather winsome sounding drumettes and flats. Drying them before cooking, preferably for a few hours in the fridge, as <a href=\"http://www.eburypublishing.co.uk/editions/the-chicken-book-the-definitive-cookbook-every-chicken-recipe-youll-ever-need/9780091959722\">Catherine Phipps suggests in her book Chicken</a>, or, if you don’t have the time, at least drying them with paper towels just before cooking, will help the skin to crisp up (and a chicken wing, given the scanty meat involved, stands or falls on its skin). I don’t think the wings require seasoning with salt and garlic powder, as Phipps recommends, though; although this gives them a good flavour when eaten au naturel, it clashes with the spicy, intensely savoury sauce they are tossed in later, which may be why she admits to a weakness for the odd handful “as is”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c96019d2be265cd45012dee276677b6c8cfbb78e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436351593692/f877aa18-8ee2-4987-ad52-51494c228925-460x381.jpeg\" alt=\"Catherine Phipps’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"381\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Phipps’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The coating</h2> \n<p>Early recipes don’t include any coating – the chicken is just fried as is. The Joy of Cooking, however, coats the wings with seasoned flour, while <a href=\"http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/1858-buffalo-wings\">Cook’s Illustrated goes for cornflour</a> for “an even crispier exterior”. They’re delicious, but turn flabby and disappointing far more quickly than the plain variety, especially when doused in hot buttery sauce.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9abf4f1c08123836d631888fd03cf68568dca763\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352238844/f59dfc50-8373-4def-867d-6216d7c206c7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Joy of Cooking's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Joy of Cooking’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The cooking</h2> \n<p>True bar buffalo wings are deep-fried, but many home recipes shy away from this – as Phipps perspicaciously observes: “The coating makes the wings literally drip in butter anyway, I prefer to bake them.” Alton Brown, <a href=\"http://altonbrown.com/buffalo-wings/\">the scientifically minded American television chef</a>, avoids deep-frying on the basis that “most American cooks lack access to commercial fryers” – though, presumably, they do have saucepans and stoves, which is all you need to deep-fry something. He steams them first, “to render out a lot of the fat”, then cools them to “tighten the skin” before baking. I’m impressed at how crisp both baked versions are, but the meat inside is undeniably dryer than the deep-fried wings from Saveur, The Joy of Cooking and Cook’s Illustrated. If you’re really against frying, however, Phipps’s recipe is considerably less faff than Brown’s, and works just as well – bake at 220C for 20-25 minutes on each side.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"350e244f2af06922443b5aad7220937a38de25b7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352329320/5147c0f8-59d7-4048-94e2-cba2e2869d9c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alton Brown's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alton Brown’s buffalo wings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The sauce</h2> \n<p>The original recipe is as simple as you’d expect for something allegedly knocked up on the spur of the moment in a bar: hot sauce and butter (or margarine if you’re to believe Saveur, though I can’t bring myself to give it a try because I really don’t want to eat deep-fried chicken smothered in tasteless fat). Brown adds garlic, which I really like, and Phipps, The Joy of Cooking and Cook’s Illustrated all stick some vinegar in there, too, which accentuates the natural edge of the sauce and balances the richness of the butter nicely.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41820286efa3aef3ce1d626b1ed2e0aedeaeebe9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352431066/f92fef42-2111-4a2f-9d45-8550cd403cdf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Saveur's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saveur’s buffalo wings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most recipes call for a specific brand of hot sauce: <a href=\"https://www.franksredhot.com/\">Frank’s</a>, which is a sour, piquant condiment made from cayenne peppers in Missouri, but, though it is available in this country, I think you can use whichever one you happen to like. Indeed, Cook’s Illustrated found that most of its tasters found Frank’s rather mild, so they mix it with something “a little more dynamic” but, as long as it’s hot and sour, it will work. That said, I do like the pinch of dark brown sugar the magazine adds to “round out the flavours” – but, as these depend on which sauce you use, I’d recommend tasting and adjusting to suit your palate. And, though it’s sacrilege, I’d also suggest drizzling the dressing over the wings, rather than tossing them in it – they stay crisper that way.</p> \n<h2>The blue-cheese sauce</h2> \n<p>And what’s the natural accompaniment for spicy deep-fried chicken wings? Why, a rich, salty blue-cheese dip, of course – and it should be intensely savoury, which is why The Joy of Cooking’s roquefort works better than Phipps’s stilton or Cook’s Illustrated’s mild, creamy blue. Mayonnaise supplies body, and sour cream or creme fraiche the requisite tanginess; buttermilk is too runny here, pleasingly American as it sounds. A dash of vinegar accentuates the tang, along with just a splash of sweet and intensely savoury Worcestershire sauce.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1b0378c48309d07d7d2b47f74070fcb405d7518\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352561594/2eda6752-809a-4fd9-988b-8ee0eeb598eb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cook's Illustrated's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cook’s Illustrated’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’m not keen on raw onion or dried garlic powder (the other flavours are harsh enough), and parsley, though pretty, is distractingly fresh and peppery, unlike the more harmonious chive.</p> \n<p>Serve with carrot and celery sticks and pretend it’s healthy.</p> \n<p><strong><em>(serves 4 with sides)</em></strong><br /><em>For the wings</em><br />16 wing pieces (or 8 whole wings)<br />Neutral oil, to fry<br />40g butter<br />2 garlic cloves, crushed<br />120ml sour hot sauce, eg Frank’s <br />2 tsp cider vinegar<br />1 tsp dark brown sugar<br />2 carrots, peeled and cut into batons<br />2 celery sticks, destringed and cut into lengths</p> \n<p><em>For the blue-cheese sauce</em><br />100g crumbled roquefort<br />6 tbsp sour cream or creme fraiche<br />2 tbsp mayonnaise<br />2 tsp cider vinegar<br />1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce<br />Small bunch of chives, finely chopped (optional)</p> \n<p>If you have time, remove the wings from their packet and put them on a rack above a bowl or tray in the fridge for between 1 and 12 hours.

Season to taste.</p> \n<p>Heat a large pan a third full of oil to 170C and put the oven on low. While the oil comes to temperature, melt the butter in a different pan and add the garlic. Fry for a minute, then add the hot sauce and whisk to combine. Take off the heat and taste; add the vinegar and sugar, unless your particular hot sauce doesn’t need them.</p> \n<p>Put a tray lined with kitchen paper in the oven. Fry the wings in batches in the oil until golden and crisp (about 10-12 minutes) and transfer them to the oven to keep warm until you’ve done them all. Serve drizzled with the hot sauce, accompanied with a bowl of the blue-cheese dip and the vegetables.</p> \n<p><strong>Buffalo wings: an American classic or modern cooking at its least subtle?
