Tinned tuna or fresh? Rocket or cos? French beans or no? Which olives, what dressing and what to drink with it? </p>","byline":"Tony Naylor","body":"<p>Hair splitters! Finicky folk! The unbearably anally retentive! Please assemble in the e-meeting room that is theguardian.com. For <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-eat\">How To Eat </a>– the blog series charged with identifying the ideal version of Britain’s favourite dishes – is back and, this month, we’re tackling that controversial classic, tuna salad. It is the star of a million at-desk lunches (so long as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2012/nov/15/liz-kendall-tuna-salad-row\">no one nicks yours from the fridge</a>, that is), and the perfect quick fall-back meal on a hot summer’s evening, but it comes in 1,001 varieties and all but one of them is completely and utterly wrong. So, without further ado, lettuce commence. As ever, keep it cool BTL: no flakiness, no raw language, no overly salty exchanges. </p> \n<h2><strong>The tuna </strong></h2> \n<p>Way back in the mists of time (1998), when we were all obsessed with the perceived sexiness and health-giving properties of the Mediterranean diet, there might have been an excuse for using seared, thinly sliced tuna steak in a salad. We were young, we were foolish and this novelty wasn’t (from memory) &pound;30-a-kilo. But, in 2015, to do so would be a flagrant waste of that precious rosy flesh. Its delicate flavour is best savoured as a rare treat, rather than leaving it to jostle for attention in a salad of competing flavours. </p> \n<p>Instead, tinned tuna will do the job - which is not to say that all tinned tuna is created equal. There is a self-evident hierarchy of quality, both for the tuna itself (flaked useless, chunks marginally better, steaks best), and the liquid it is preserved in. Tuna in spring water or brine is dry, mealy, abominable stuff. Sunflower oil is better, but for maximum flavour it has to be in olive oil. </p> \n<p>I trust it goes without saying that you should <em>never</em> a) use smoked tuna, b) mix tuna with mayo if it is going in a salad, or c) resort to any of the infused or pre-mixed tunas that (in a damning indictment of late capitalism) proliferate in our supermarkets. A salad is no place – if, indeed, one exists – to be experimenting with tuna dressed with tomato and herbs or infused with soy and ginger. </p> \n<h2><strong>Leaves</strong></h2> \n<p>Let he who has never bought a supermarket bagged salad cast the first stone, but you cannot dispute that these sad sacks are a rip-off, and that they are a particular waste of money when it comes to tuna salad. All you want and need, here, is some clean, sweet base crunch. Cos or baby gem lettuce are the way to go; shredded or chopped in chunky hunks that are neither too small nor so big that you need to unhinge your jaw to eat them. Save your swankier salad leaves – peppery watercress, bitter radicchio, that homegrown crop of woody, horrible rocket that never seems to end – for salads where they will make a genuinely effective contribution. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a/0_425_1148_689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anchovies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anchovies can be a useful addition, as long as they are chopped for thorough distribution.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Twort/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The salad ingredients</strong></h2> \n<p>Were this a band, you now have your star lead singer (the tuna) and your tight rhythm section (the leaves) in place. It is time to add some mid-range colour: a lead guitarist, a keyboard player, backing singers, perhaps a flautist for that unexpected prog-rock interlude. Now, some of you will read the ingredients listed below and think: “Hang on, this is just a bastardised salad ni&ccedil;oise”, but what of it? The not-quite-salad-ni&ccedil;oise is – to extend this rock group metaphor way past its breaking point – like a band’s classic first album. Later, they will dabble in jazz-funk and start naming their tracks with runic symbols. Which will be interesting. In a way. But that first album, <em>Not Quite Salad Ni&ccedil;oise</em>, is the one you will always come back to.</p> \n<p>Why? Because, primarily, a great tuna salad is a fine balancing act between sharp, salty, fishy flavours and those fresher, spritzier vegetable components – which function almost as an ongoing palate cleanser, as you eat. And, while there is no need to stick faithfully to the original, the salad ni&ccedil;oise remains our most reliable outline guide as regards how to achieve that balance. Moreover, it determines the additional ingredients you might use in an eminently sensible way.</p> \n<p>The full list of acceptable/unacceptable ingredients is as follows:</p> \n<p><strong>YES</strong>: slices of waxy/new potatoes (boiled); anchovies (chopped for thorough distribution, never whole); halved, not overly ripe baby plum tomatoes; cucumber, deseeded and sliced; a small amount of finely chopped sweet red or spring onion; capers; jarred, brined green olives (save those fresh, buttery nocellera to enjoy on their own); chopped or sliced boiled egg; it’s creaminess is a fantastic contrast. A handful of finely chopped leafy, green herbs (parsley, chives, chervil, basil even) is also welcome, but not essential.</p> \n<p><strong>NO</strong>: French/green beans (vile cold, and invariably boiled to a mushy consistency); raw white onion; carrot and beetroot (whose flavours are jarring in this context); croutons (this is not a caesar salad); any chilli or feta stuffed olives (it pains me that this needs pointing out); dull black and/or shrunken purple kalamata-like olives; sliced bell pepper (whose presence in <em>any salad</em> should rightly prompt a lengthy outburst of vociferous “industrial” language). </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b4da5a26b7c4daf358669726d8688eaf69349b0\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3b4da5a26b7c4daf358669726d8688eaf69349b0/0_65_5760_3460/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not quite right\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not quite right: carrots, feta and dull black olives should be avoided.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Also, on the egg-front, please note that no one wants a tepid-to-warm, still runny poached egg on their tuna salad. There is something deeply unappetising about rogue “hot” ingredients in cold salads and/or salad leaves covered in stringy trails of translucent albumen. Moreover, that running yolk turns any tuna present into gluey, indigestible lumps. You may think a soft poached egg on a tuna salad is sophisticated, clever even. It isn’t.</p> \n<h2><strong>Dressing</strong></h2> \n<p>Step away from the pesto (it makes everything taste of, well, pesto), and dispense with that sharp-elbowed white wine vinegar. All you need here is olive oil, salt, pepper, lemon juice and dijon mustard, all smoothly emulsified in such a way that the character of each ingredient is clear, but elegantly reconciled. Whisk, taste, go.</p> \n<h2><strong>Assembly and plating </strong></h2> \n<p>Serving a salad in a deep cereal bowl makes it difficult to eat. Serving it on a plate always looks wrong. Serving it on slate, meanwhile, is a clear sign that chef needs to stop browsing inspirational tableware catalogues and actually think, practically, about how people eat.</p> \n<p>Instead, line a shallow, wide-rimmed bowl with leaves, and separately (you want those leaves to retain their distinct flavour and crunch) dress and mix the other ingredients, minus the tuna. That, similarly, should be broken into substantive chunks on top and left as a separate complementary dimension of flavour, not doused in vinaigrette.</p> \n<h2><strong>When</strong></h2> \n<p>Lunch or tea – also known, in some part of the UK, as dinner. NB. If anyone in your circle every refers to tuna salad as a “light mid-week supper” you can – after your toes have uncurled from that sudden, excruciating cramp – happily kill them in any gruesome manner you think fitting. There is not a court in the land that would convict you.</p> \n<h2><strong>Drink</strong></h2> \n<p>Crisply bitter pale ales; dry, flinty white wines; water. </p> \n<p>So, tuna salad – how do you eat yours?</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f6b5fd3d82e4a524640762ffe657f01f71e4e100/0_594_7210_4326/7210.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":4326,"width":7210,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Tuna Salad","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a/0_425_1148_689/1148.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":689,"width":1148,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Anchovies can be a useful addition, as long as they are chopped for thorough distribution.

Deborah Orr toasts the joys of the lunchtime tipple <br /></p>","byline":"Deborah Orr","body":"<p>Like smoking on planes and transporting toddlers in cars without tying them up first, a little inebriation to break up a working day is one of those things that in a generation has moved from normal to, “Oh my God, can you believe we ever did that?”</p> \n<p>Obviously, boozy lunches aren’t actually illegal. But you, the lunchtime drinker, know that when a daytime dining companion suggests ordering a bottle of wine, agreement is conspiracy. Or a test you’re about to fail. You also know, when a dining companion says, “Just water for me!” that you really could and should have done whatever you’re about to do over the phone. Or you think you do, anyway.</p> \n<p>The truth is that drinking at lunchtime is stupid and irresponsible. That’s what makes it such fun. As for having just one or two glasses, the essential paradox of alcohol is that the less you imbibe, the more you feel its effects. After one glass (feel free to adjust for personal tolerances, you dipso), one is aware that one is more relaxed than optimum cut-throat marketplace sharpness demands. After two, one is in longing-for-an-afternoon-nap territory. After three, one is top of the world, thrumming with confidence, one’s excellent judgment assuring one that another glass won’t do any harm <em>at all</em>.</p> \n<p>After which anything can happen, as long as it’s bad. Alcohol is a gateway drug, paving the way for more alcohol. This has been known to the west since the ancient Greeks so sensibly <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/topic/Dionysus\">formalised the ritual of binge-drinking into a form of worship.</a></p> \n<p>The high point of my own lunchtime drinking life came about 10 years ago, when lunch with a friend was brought to an end by kindly waiters gently explaining that, much as it pained them, they really needed our table because dinner service was in full swing. Obviously, this was confusing for us. Holding one of our own fingers in front of our own noses was confusing for us. Somehow, we had managed to have lunch for seven and a half brief hours.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Drinking at lunchtime is stupid and irresponsible. That's what makes it such fun</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>We had been celebrating. Not at first, but after ordering our first bottle of wine (at that point, as we’d imagined, our only bottle of wine), we decided it was corked. Summoning the waiter, we told him of our verdict. A single sip and he confirmed that we were very much correct, confiding also that we were discerning women of the world and a pleasure to serve, because most of the world’s idiots glugged away at corked wine without the smallest suspicion that what they were drinking was not delicious, but rank.</p> \n<p>Well, he didn’t actually say that. We said that. We were so pleased with ourselves for detecting corked wine that we had a few more goes, to check that our new superpower was not a fluke. A sensible waiter would have given us the corked wine again, as bottle three. But our waiter didn’t, because he adored us. OK, I made that up, too.</p> \n<p>The next day – realistically, it was probably two or three days later – I told a hard-drinking colleague of our Great Feat. “Wow!” he said. “So who else was there?”</p> \n<p>“Just us.”</p> \n<p>“Eh? What on Earth did you two find to talk about for seven and a half bloody hours?”</p> \n<p>In fact, both freelance journalists and the mothers of small children, we’d talked first about how we could rearrange our working day to accommodate an extra hour or so of lunch, and next about how we could rearrange our picking- up-the-kids-from-school day to accommodate another extra hour or so of lunch. We then had to have these conversations again the next day, over the phone, because of our terrible hangovers. Clearly, some corked wine had indeed crept into the proceedings. There is no other explanation.</p> \n<p>It’s pretty dreadful, screwing up your work for the sake of a drink. It’s really awful, screwing up your responsibilities to your children for the sake of a drink. I’m not proud. Except I made that up, too. I am proud. I regret nothing. It was a golden afternoon. We may not have been officially worshipping gods, but for one day, we were both Ferris Bueller and we both had a day off. The memory still gladdens my heart. That’s how much I needed a day off.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We were so pleased with ourselves for detecting corked wine that we had a few more goes</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I understand that this is a tale of privileged women who have the luxury of being able to behave badly without suffering too many consequences, but there was a time when this sort of behaviour was a little more universal. Outside the gates of Ravenscraig, the huge steelworks that dominated my home town, Motherwell, was a pub called the Cleekim Inn. It was a bare-faced acknowledgment that a drink before your shift began could turn into a few drinks, and that the solution was to get a workmate to punch your card for you.</p> \n<p>Some of the men were alcoholics, and abused this unofficial system routinely. You could argue that this was a particularly egregious example of how liberty-taking was rife in nationalised industries. Except that I look at our denationalised age and think about how much better it was for all concerned, especially their wives and children, that these men had a wage, security and a place to go and hide, a place to lose themselves that wasn’t home or the dole office.</p> \n<p>Drinking when you should be working was a bit of a gesture of defiance back then, and it’s a gesture of defiance so huge now that it’s a dying tradition. Young people now drink less, it’s said, than for many generations. They’re more sensible, it’s said, more focused. I think, though, that they’re just more fearful. Work, money, success, security: most of us live in fear of not achieving them or not retaining them. Moderation in all things, except dedication to good sense and duty, is the order of the day. One drink at lunch is rebellion. Two is sedition. Three is revolution. The boozy lunch may be rare now, but when a boozy lunch does come along, it’s just <em>wonderful</em>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/15ec9e5865f0910523aab921192b55bb6554c531/0_0_4783_2869/4783.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2869,"width":4783,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty Images","altText":"Drinking wine","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T10:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T10:46:50Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":403,"contributors":[{"name":"Deborah Orr","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/8/20/1408550842728/Deborah-Orr-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/deborah-orr"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Deborah Orr","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/deborah-orr"}}],"series":{"title":"Summer food and drink special 2015: Let's do lunch","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/summer-food-and-drink-special-2015-let-s-do-lunch"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/in-praise-of-lunchtime-drinking","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a98c","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/in-praise-of-lunchtime-drinking","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/in-praise-of-lunchtime-drinking"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/15ec9e5865f0910523aab921192b55bb6554c531/0_0_4783_2869/4783.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2869,"width":4783,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"In praise of lunchtime drinking: ‘The essential paradox of alcohol is that the less you imbibe, the more you feel its effects.’ Photograph: Getty Images","credit":"Getty Images","altText":"Drinking wine","cleanCaption":"In praise of lunchtime drinking: ‘The essential paradox of alcohol is that the less you imbibe, the more you feel its effects.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty Images"}},"importance":5,"kicker":{"title":"Make mine a large one"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/15ec9e5865f0910523aab921192b55bb6554c531/0_0_4783_2869/4783.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2869,"width":4783,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty Images","altText":"Drinking wine","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty Images"}}]},{"title":"Working lunches around the world","rawTitle":"Working lunches around the world","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/lunches-around-the-world-summer-food-special","title":"Working lunches around the world: what's in your lunchbox?","trailText":"In Rome, a lunch break is enshrined in law.

There are a few dotted around the city centre, but our favourite is <a href=\"http://www.phathaphat-m3.co.uk\">Phatha Phat</a>. It’s only a few yards away from some of Manchester’s most glamorous restaurants, and I have to admit that it doesn’t look very inviting. It’s a tiny, no-frills place hidden down a back alley, but it is all about the food.</p> \n<p>Every day, the staff prepare a fresh selection of curries, daals and kebabs, and you take your pick with some rice and a salad. It costs &pound;5 and is great value. Today we’re having slow-cooked lamb nihari, sag aloo, lentil dal, pilau rice, green salad and seekh kebab. At lunch, the place heaves with a wide range of people, and on Thursdays and Fridays you are lucky to get a table. The food is fresh, full of flavour and spicy without being overpowering. This sort of restaurant represents what I love about my home city: friendly and lacking in pretension, but excellent quality.</p> \n<h2><strong>Rome</strong><br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96ac13a448c0565647d11a785823d43fd8e72305\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435748965406/5d35efa5-36ae-4756-92e1-699ae1f6a907-339x420.jpeg\" alt=\"andrea zazzara having lunch in rome\" width=\"339\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Zazzara in Rome.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chiara Goia for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Three years ago, the government carried out a survey to find out how many people ate their lunch at home. The answer was 74.3%, a figure that says much about a country in which less than half of women have a paid job; one in which most of the population lives and works in villages, towns or small cities, where employees and employers alike can often get home for lunch and maybe even fit in a <em>pisolino</em> (nap) afterwards.<br /></p> \n<p>Shopping, or doing any other kind of business, in an Italian provincial town is usually impossible between 1.30 and 3pm. And many establishments don’t reopen till 3.30 or even 4pm. Government ministers have more than once railed against the Italian lunch break, or <em>pausa pranzo</em>. One called it “a ritual that brings the whole of Italy to a stop”.</p> \n<p>But the picture among city office workers is very different. In Rome, <em>tavola calda</em> establishments, where the food is laid out on a bar, are popular with office workers. Sometimes, it is self-service; sometimes, there is a server haring between tables. But the customers all get to sit down and relax.</p> \n<p>The right to a lunch break – like almost everything in Italy – is enshrined in a law. The length of break is up to employers, and one survey by an Italian online recruitment agency found that 30% of its clients seldom left their desks at lunchtime, with 60% saying that a shortage of time forced them to rush. Then again, the same survey found more than two-thirds took lunch breaks that lasted an hour or more.<strong> JH</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It’s slow food – I would never eat a sandwich in a bar, absolutely not</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Andrea Zazzara</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>My lunch: Andrea Zazzara, 43, lawyer<br /></strong>I’m normally in court until 1pm or 1.30pm, and then I have to go back to my chambers, so I generally don’t get out to lunch before 2pm. There’s a nice little trattoria nearby, so if I go out with colleagues, we ring ahead and say how many we are. The chef, Pasquale, will then cook us a pasta. But we don’t know what it is. It’s a surprise. He has a lot of imagination and revisits traditional recipes. My favourite is a spaghetti alla carbonara that he makes with tuna and courgette.</p> \n<p>There’s another fantastic place nearby. There are tables, though not many. It’s slow food, really: nice, healthy ingredients and genuine flavours. It’s a bit like having a meal at home. But it does get very crowded, because this is how Romans particularly like to have lunch.</p> \n<p>If I don’t have enough time, I’ll go to a place selling <em>pizza al taglio</em> (pizza sold in rectangular slices). But I would never eat a sandwich in a bar. Absolutely not. I think they’re unhealthy.

Lunchtime in midtown and downtown Manhattan is an exception, though. For those who aren’t stuck with sandwiches or salads at their desks, it’s a genuinely frenetic event, marked by a crazy multiplicity of choices: traditional diners and delis; “fast casual” chains serving burgers, burritos or customised salads composed from a selection of 60 ingredients; plus the new generation of food trucks, serving curries and pad thai, lobster rolls and bacon-flavoured ice-cream.<br /></p> \n<p>“Haste seems to be a controlling factor in the luncheon of the worker,” <a href=\"http://exhibitions.nypl.org/lunchhour/exhibits/show/lunchhour/quick\">declared an article in Munsey’s Magazine in 1901</a>, a few years before “<a href=\"http://exhibitions.nypl.org/lunchhour/exhibits/show/lunchhour/automat\">automats</a>” appeared in Times Square, offering pies and cakes from behind individual glass-fronted compartments, to shave off a few more seconds. The automats are gone, but the sense of haste lives on – although it’s recently grown easier to stop and breathe, too, thanks to the increase in pedestrianised areas, peppered with tables and chairs, orchestrated by Michael Bloomberg’s visionary transport commissioner, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/bike-blog/2011/jan/05/new-york-transportation-chief\">Janette Sadik-Khan</a>.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in New York, far grander things are happening at lunchtime: the city was the birthplace of the original “power lunch” (the phrase was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/14/world/americas/zagat-power-lunch-guide\">probably coined to describe meals at the Four Seasons restaurant, on 52nd Street</a>) and of the uptown, upmarket “ladies who lunch”, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_who_lunch\">a term popularised by New York magazine</a>. For the non-plutocrats, meanwhile, it’s a speedy but crucial change of scenery in the working day, marked by an ever-increasing range of food options. There are a thousand more tranquil places on the planet to eat your lunch, of course, but what New Yorkers know is that plunging into the manic energy of the city for half an hour can be just as restorative. <strong> OB</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>\u0007Lunch is, all too frequently, doing whatever I’m doing at my desk</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Amber Hoover</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>My lunch: Amber Hoover, 37, foreign rights specialist at a publishing firm<br /></strong>I’m eating braised beef over spinach, sriracha string beans and some sort of spring greens with onions.

They even have a phone app, so I can pay without having to bother with cash. Because I work in publishing, there’s an entertainment element to lunch that happens sometimes – once or twice a week, I’ll have a business lunch, a proper sit-down. The rest of the time, lunch is either like this or, all too frequently, crammed in at my desk while I keep doing whatever I’m doing.</p> \n<h2><strong>Rio de Janeiro </strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ae32ef5785e0597bccda5cdb6d7228de24b89a1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435747535612/2d9530e8-3263-4c91-a7a0-6dfe5478ddee-346x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Clara Ara&uacute;jo having lunch in Rio de Janeiro\" width=\"346\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clara Ara&uacute;jo in Rio.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lianne Milton for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Typically, Cariocas [residents of Rio de Janeiro] lunch at a <em>restaurante &agrave; quilo,</em> a buffet where the price is determined by the weight of food on the plate. Almost all offer staple Brazilian fare, such as rice, <em>feij&atilde;o</em> (black beans), meat, <em>farofa</em> (toasted cassava flour) and <em>salgadinhos</em> (a variety of savoury snacks), alongside various other dishes.<br /></p> \n<p>Brazil has large and long-established Japanese, Italian and Middle Eastern communities, meaning sushi, spaghetti and <em>esfihas</em> (an unleavened bread pasty introduced by immigrants from Syria and Lebanon) are commonplace. Most <em>&agrave; quilo</em> restaurants also boast a salad bar.</p> \n<p>They vary enormously in quality, price and atmosphere, but the high-end ones operate with the efficiency of a well-oiled production line. Customers are given tickets on their way in, form an orderly queue around the buffet, weigh their plates, then sit at a table where one of the waiting staff takes their order for drinks. Plates are cleared as soon as they are empty. Customers then queue again in front of the cashier, before handing their receipt to a member of staff who lurks by the exit. Lunch is often the only meal these restaurants serve, so ensuring a rapid flow of customers is key.</p> \n<p>For high-end professionals, there are more traditional restaurants with a set menu, but such establishments are relatively rare. At the other end of the scale, there are plenty of <em>lanchonetes</em>, snack bars that serve <em>salgadinhos</em> and fruit juices, where customers generally eat standing up.</p> \n<p>No one eats at their desk, because it’s considered bad manners, and grossly unhygienic. The importance of the lunch hour is such that the specific timing of the break is often written into contracts. Many workers also get food vouchers as part of their pay, with a daily allowance of about R$20 (&pound;4) loaded on to a credit card, accepted at most <em>&agrave; quilo</em> restaurants. Eating out appeals to the Cariocas’ natural sociability, allowing colleagues to spend time together chewing the fat outside the office.<strong> BD</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Leaving the office is important, a chance to nourish myself and my creativity</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Clara Ara&uacute;jo</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>My lunch: Clara Ara&uacute;jo, 33, journalist for Criar Brasil, a media NGO<br /></strong>Today, I’m eating what I usually have for lunch: on one side of the plate I have a bit of salad, because my mother taught me it was important to have something healthy; on the other is the stuff I really like – a slice of meat in mushroom sauce and a couple of <em>esfihas</em>, one filled with meat and the other with cheese.</p> \n<p>I come to this restaurant regularly with my colleagues. We like it because it’s nearby and the food is varied and excellent value. All the <em>&agrave; quilo</em> restaurants in the centre of Rio are busy and noisy at lunchtime, but this place is still kind of intimate. There are even a few booths where couples can sit close together. For me, leaving the office for lunch is important. I don’t cook, so bringing food into work is not an option. I also like to get away from work for a while. Leaving the office gives you a chance to nourish both your belly and your creativity. You get the chance to interact with your colleagues in a different way.</p> \n<h2><strong>Nairobi</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b7889632e89cb4a40f4f844844b2b785946f3e0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435747805710/b28d8cf9-1234-461d-91ad-f86bb3a5dab6-460x321.jpeg\" alt=\"jack okinyi having lunch in nairobi\" width=\"460\" height=\"321\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Okinyi in Nairobi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sven Torfinn for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lunch is a raucous and communal affair in the Kenyan capital. For many, it’s an escape from the drudgery of desk jobs, and they gather in the large restaurants around the business district, where they share hour-long sit-down meals.<br /></p> \n<p>Not too many people have time for a proper breakfast before work. Cut-throat competition in schools means that the kids have to set off for class in the half-light of dawn; adults, too, generally leave home in the early hours, to beat the city’s notorious traffic. Lunch offers a welcome respite. At around midday, office workers troop out, in groups of three or four, and sometimes even seven or eight, to find a good spot in their favourite restaurant. Very few people go out for lunch alone.</p> \n<p>Local tastes vary, depending on affordability and a region’s culinary traditions. Cuisine from western Kenya is the most widespread, with smoked, fried or whole fish, sometimes stewed in coconut sauce – a popular choice. Those with a more adventurous palate can try boiled tilapia fish head, or chicken, beef or stewed goat tripe (the latter is a favourite at the popular <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ranalo-Foods-Kosewe/487365784662499\">Ranalo Foods</a> downtown). The national dish, <em>nyama choma</em> (goat rib roasted on an open spit), is mostly enjoyed on weekend afternoons with a couple of drinks.</p> \n<p>Some choose to have their lunch at cafeteria-style restaurants, where they queue and then go out into the sunshine with their plates. But on a recent, unusually chilly Wednesday afternoon (temperatures anywhere below 20C are considered too cold by Nairobians), two sisters who work in computer sales, Marissa Oluchina and Emma Mwongeli, explained that they prefer having lunch at Abu’s Place, located just behind the city’s main mosque, which specialises in coastal dishes. Abu’s mainstay is pilau (rice cooked in a seasoned broth), while Mwongeli names a dish from the mountain region of Kenya as her favourite: “There is nothing as good as a nice plate of githeri [a mix of stewed maize and beans], topped with fresh avocado, to set you off into the afternoon in a good mood.”<strong> MM</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I rarely have time for breakfast or dinner, so lunch is important.

Legend has it taht the baozi was invented more than 1,800 years ago by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuge_Liang\">Zhuge Liang</a>, a Chinese statesman and military strategist who is also credited with creating the wheelbarrow. Facing crisis when his hungry, dehydrated soldiers began to fall ill, Zhuge dreamed up the idea of making doughy, human head-shaped buns packed with pork and beef. They are said to have cured his sick warriors and guaranteed subsequent battlefield success.<br /></p> \n<p>Today, baozi can be found the length and breadth of China, and are eaten morning, noon and night by those in search of a quick, nutritious and filling snack. In China’s capital, where office workers generally get 45 minutes to an hour for their break, a lunch on the run means a trip to somewhere such as the Qingfeng Steamed Stuffed Bun Shop. With 290 outlets, Qingfeng is one of the city’s top bun makers, churning out 16 tonnes of baozi each day for famished Beijingers.</p> \n<p>The baozi is so much a part of popular culture that <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1392160/president-xi-buys-meal-beijing-bun-shop?page=all\">even president Xi Jinping popped into one of Qingfeng’s shops</a> in an attempt to burnish his man-of-the-people credentials. The restaurant subsequently created the “Zhu xi tao can” or “<a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-01/03/content_17214891.htm\">President Xi Jinping combo</a>” meal, which includes buns stuffed with onion and pork, stir-fried pig liver and intestine, and a plate of greens.</p> \n<p>There are pork and spring onion buns, pork and cabbage buns, prawn and vegetable buns, and vegetarian buns, each costing up to 4.5 yuan (46p). Also on the menu are bowls of pumpkin porridge – a snip at 3 yuan (30p) – pork and spring onion buns, which cost 3.5 yuan each (36p), and bowls of spicy cold noodles that sell for 9 yuan (92p). <strong> TP </strong><em>Additional reporting by Luna Lin</em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It’s fast, it tastes OK and it’s safe.

The table would be covered with a linen cloth and napkins, which she had woven from linen she had spun 35 years previously, as part of her bottom drawer. To start she would bring a steaming bowl of stracciatelle soup, the broth made from a free-range chicken. To follow, the boiled chicken would be served with extra-virgin olive oil, freshly ground black pepper and home-cured black olives, ulive strinate, a speciality of the Marche region. The freshly picked black olives are put in a sack with sea salt and hung outside for 40 days in the frosty weather.

It’s a lovely way of celebrating good-quality basil, and for me is very much a summer dish. It makes a delicious first course or a one-plate meal, especially with the addition of French beans.</p> \n<p>Making pesto properly is another good case for slow food because it should ideally be made shortly before it is eaten. It is also one of the many recipes where you need to be very flexible in terms of quantities; tasting and adjusting them during preparation is a must.</p> \n<p>To my mind there is no substitute for pounding by hand, and I recommend using a marble pestle and mortar. Pesto made in a food processor tends to require extra olive oil and in my view, the machine is too harsh on the ingredients, making both the texture and flavour somewhat insipid.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>trenette or linguine</strong> 320-400g<br /><strong>basil leaves</strong> 4<br /><strong>french beans</strong> 200g, topped and tailed (optional)<br /><strong>pesto alla Genovese</strong> 8 tbsp (see below)<br /><strong>parmigiano reggiano PDO</strong> 60g</p> \n<p>For the pesto<br /><strong>fresh basil</strong> 4 bunches, ideally PDO Genoese, good Proven&ccedil;al or home-grown outdoors<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 1-2, preferably Imperia from Vessalico, or French pink or violet varieties, such as ail rose de Lautrec<br /><strong>pine nuts </strong>30g<br /><strong>coarse sea salt </strong>10g, ideally sale di Cervia<br /><strong>parmigiano reggiano cheese (aged 24 months)</strong> 30-40g, grated<br /><strong>fiore sardo (pecorino sardo) cheese </strong>40-50g, grated<br /><strong>PDO extra virgin olive oil from Liguria</strong> 50-70ml</p> \n<p>To make the pesto, wash the basil leaves in cold water and dry them on a tea towel but without rubbing. The following steps must be done as quickly as possible to avoid oxidation.</p> \n<p>Put the garlic and pine nuts in a mortar and pound with the pestle until smooth.</p> \n<p>Add a few grains of the salt and some of the basil leaves, then pound the mixture, using a light circular movement of the pestle against the sides of the mortar. Repeat this process until all the basil has been pounded.</p> \n<p>When the basil drips bright green liquid, add both cheeses and mix well. Pour a thin layer of the oil over the pesto and mix very lightly.</p> \n<p>Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling, well salted water until al dente. If you plan to add beans, put them in the water at the same time as the pasta. When ready, drain the pasta, then return it to the saucepan. Add 8 tablespoons of pesto and stir well so that the pasta is fully coated.</p> \n<p>Serve in pasta plates and place a basil leaf in the centre of each portion.

pickle a bowl of cherries they add a glorious sweet-and-sour kick to ham and fish dishes</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<p>Aside from a soft-crusted, sugar-dusted pie, there is little reason to cook a cherry. A jam, glowing jewel-like on the breakfast table, can be a fine thing if you have bothered to remove the stones; hell if you haven’t. But, other than that, cherries are best eaten from the bag or, better still, served cold, in a bowl of ice cubes that you have crushed to a near slush-puppy texture.</p> \n<p>An exception is a pickled cherry. A snap of sweet and sour to bring out the best in a slice of ham, a fillet of oily fish such as a tuna steak or a fillet of silver-skinned mackerel. When I say pickled, I don’t mean the fruit should be kept lurking in a jar of malt vinegar and spices for six months. I mean a quick 20-minute pickle, bright as a button, with star anise, black peppercorns, mild red wine and vinegar, and just enough sugar to stop your lips smarting.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week I simmered a ham in apple juice and served the amber broth with a dose of pickled cherries. The faintly salty cooking liquor and sour cherries were a perfect balance for the sweet, thick-cut meat and fat. An initial boiling in water prevented an over-salty broth. Skimming the surface regularly kept the juices clear and bright.</p> \n<p>The next day we ate the ham cold, cut thinner this time, with a spinach salad (dressing: cider vinegar, walnut oil, grain mustard, lemon juice) with more of the cherries and their juice. Afterwards, greedy for more of the pickled fruit, we ate thick yogurt sweetened with whipped cream, a pinch of sugar and the meanest seasoning of ground cinnamon. We then tipped a tiny spoonful of the cherries over the folds of creamy, spice-flecked yogurt.</p> \n<h2>Pickled cherries</h2> \n<p>I used dark, sweet dessert cherries for this. If you are using sour fruit, then add a little more sugar. Makes 500g of pickled cherries.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>cherries </strong>500g<strong> </strong><br /><strong>red-wine vinegar </strong>125ml<br /><strong>red wine</strong> 375ml<br /><strong>sugar </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>black peppercorns </strong>1 tsp<br /><strong>star anise </strong>2 whole<strong> </strong><br /></p> \n<p>Pull the cherries from their stalks, then halve each fruit and remove the stones. Put the stoned cherries into a stainless-steel or enamelled saucepan then pour in the vinegar and red wine and bring to the boil. Stir in the sugar, the peppercorns and the star anise then lower the heat so the liquid bubbles gently for 3 or 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and leave the mixture to cool.</p> \n<h2>Grilled mackerel, pickled cherries and samphire</h2> \n<p>The sour pickling juice of the cherries does the work of lemon juice here, balancing the oily richness of the fish. A few spoonfuls over the hot fish are as important as the cherries themselves.</p> \n<p>Serves 2<br /><strong>mackerel fillets </strong>4<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>samphire </strong>2 handfuls<br /><strong>pickled cherries </strong>6 tbsp<br /></p> \n<p>Check the mackerel fillets for any stray bones, then place them skin-side down on a lined grill pan. Brush them lightly with olive oil, then season with a little salt. Cook under an overhead grill or over the bars of a hot grill for four minutes on each side until lightly cooked through. (The advantage of cooking over a grill is that you will have crisp skin, too, but an overhead grill works well enough.)</p> \n<p>Rinse the samphire in cold running water and trim any tough roots. Put the samphire in a bowl and add the cherries and their juices. Toss the cherries and samphire and leave for a few minutes while the mackerel cooks. Place a bed of samphire and cherries on two plates, spoon over the cherry pickling liquor, then place a couple of fillets on each. Spoon over a little more pickling liquor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dcc71522b93afbfb41333d5575e4833d8d7d40b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435661454346/430168d5-e760-48e1-bd70-2e071f686d58-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nigel Slater's gammon with apple juice and pickled cherries recipe on a round plate \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the pink: Nigel Slater’s gammon with apple juice and pickled cherries recipe.

Do this twice if you fear your ham is on the salty side. Serves 4<br /></p> \n<p><strong>ham or gammon joint </strong>1.5kg, rolled and tied<br /><strong>water </strong>1 litre<br /><strong>apple juice </strong>1 litre<br /><strong>bay leaves </strong>2<br /><strong>peppercorns </strong>10<br /><strong>cloves </strong>4<br /></p> \n<p>To finish<br /><strong>cooking liquor </strong>from the ham <br /><strong>pickled cherries </strong>12 tbsp<br /></p> \n<p>Put the piece of gammon in a large, deep pan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat so the water doesn’t boil over, and leave to cook for 20 minutes.</p> \n<p>Carefully pour the water away and return the pan to the heat. Pour in the litre of water and the apple juice, then tuck in the bay leaves. Add the peppercorns and cloves and bring to the boil. If any froth comes to the surface, remove it with a draining spoon. When every bit of froth has been removed and the liquid is clear, lower the heat so it bubbles gently, then partially cover with a lid.</p> \n<p>Let the gammon cook for about 60-90 minutes, checking the liquid level from time to time and turning the meat carefully once or twice to ensure even cooking. Switch off the heat but leave the meat in the cooking liquor.</p> \n<p>Lift the meat out and place it on a carving board. Taste the cooking liquid, correct the seasoning if necessary. Carve the meat into thick slices and put two or three per person into shallow dishes or deep plates. Ladle some of the cooking broth over each then add 2 or 3 tablespoons of pickled cherries and some of their liquid over each.

But do they have to be so complicated? The Guardian’s restaurant critic considers five modern masterpieces, from the Ledbury and Sat Bains, to Hedone and the Sportsman</p>","byline":"Marina O'Loughlin","body":"<p>It was <a href=\"http://noma.dk\">Noma</a> that started it. When Copenhagen’s two Michelin star restaurant first launched its now legendary signature dish – vintage carrots with camomile – in the Noughties, a generation of chefs gasped in awe and reached for their tweezers. Suddenly, vegetables everywhere were to be lightly pickled and teased into decorative little tubes of myriad colours, tottering down a specially designed plate in a wave of exquisiteness.</p> \n<p>But they were still just vegetables, right? Did the intricate and painstaking presentation make them taste any better? Apparently so: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2014/jun/20/food-presented-artistically-taste-salad-kandinsky\">a research team at Oxford University found last year</a> that a salad plated up to resemble a Kandinsky painting was judged by human guinea pigs to be more delicious than exactly the same ingredients delivered any old how. Beauty, as ever, matters.</p> \n<p>If almost every high-end restaurant in the world is to be believed, how their dishes look is right up there with flavours and ingredients. Gone are the 1990s, when food came in vertiginous towers that required servers to have the balancing skills of a circus act. Today, a dish’s components must appear to have been insouciantly strewn by Tinker Bell in a bewitching melee of dots and splodges and tiny, edible flowers.</p> \n<p>It’s no coincidence that the practitioners of high culinary art tend to be fans of vegetables (and foraged produce from fields and hedgerows). A vast chunk of charred meat might get the juices going, but it’s unlikely to win any beauty contests. So in Paris, Alain Passard “strangles” charred baby onions with a little tangle of twine, or twists leaves of mandolined courgettes into the shape of blowsy roses and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arpegelive\">plays with colour like an artist</a>: blue potatoes and purple carrots. One of the most visually striking cookery books of recent times is <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/alexis-gauthier-vegetronic.html\">Vegetronic, by Alexis Gauthier</a>, whose <a href=\"http://www.gauthiersoho.co.uk/vegetronic.php\">acid-drenched colours frame dishes of painterly loveliness</a>. And <a href=\"http://www.theethicurean.com/\">the Ethicurean</a> in Bristol, whose ingredients frequently come from its ancient walled garden, will <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=576468845764361\">tile a plate with almost translucent slices of different-coloured beetroots</a> until it looks “like a stained-glass window”.</p> \n<p>Diana Henry is the author of another book rammed with pupil-dilating, photogenic food: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/05/change-of-appetite-diana-henry-review-cookworm\">Change Of Appetite</a> (I can’t stop perving over her perfect, limpid <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/469852173600313212/\">poached white peach with rose jelly</a>). I ask her why the appearance of what she eats is important. She is adamant: “I honestly think that if a plate of food looks good, it can taste better.” Eating isn’t simply about taste. Cliches are cliches for a reason, hence “you eat with your eyes”.</p> \n<p>Anyone who’s ever wandered in a mesmerised trance around Tokyo’s dazzling depachikas – the football pitch-sized food halls underneath department stores – can’t fail to realise how important the visuals of food are to the Japanese, from jewel box-like bento to a single, perfect melon wrapped in tissue paper and presented in a gilded box. The Japanese fetish for beauty in food – which covers everything from crockery to glassware to the correct use of negative space – even has a name: <em>moritsuke</em>. Food slants like a cedar tree (<em>sugimori</em>) or is high like a mountain (<em>takamori</em>). Their <em>kaiseki-ryori</em> (haute cuisine raised to an art form) is about presentation every bit as much as the unimpeachable quality of the ingredients: nothing is ever left to chance. And culinarily, where Japan leads, the world follows.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If a plate of food looks good, it can taste better</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Diana Henry</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I wonder what an artist might make of it. Apart from musing on something that occurs to a lot of us when presented with the over-elaborate dish (“Someone’s been fingering that for quite a while”), <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2014/oct/04/grayson-perry-dress-tranny-art-who-are-you-tv\">Grayson Perry</a> has a typically perceptive take: “Square plates – especially rough-hewn glass ones – seem to be an unofficial warning that the food is likely to be all show and no taste. I’m also averse to smears on the porcelain.” He makes me howl with laughter at a current gastropub trope: “I went to one place where the chips were served in a little galvanised pail, but went off the idea when I discovered their urinals were made from larger galvanised pails.” This is an unfortunate side-effect of the restaurateur failing to think his <em>moritsuke</em> through.</p> \n<p>I can only nod in enthusiastic agreement when Henry says, “I have a belief that the small things in life are very important. If we don’t get pleasure from the small things, the rather ordinary things, then we’re stuffed. Caring about making your food look lovely is part of that. Cumulatively, it makes you happier, however mad that sounds.” An independent observer of the Oxford experiment came to the conclusion that, yes, expectations were raised by the artistry on the plates and that, crucially, this meant people were prepared to pay more for beautiful food. They seemed a little perplexed by the discovery. How daft: of course we prize beauty. I just wouldn’t try this at home.</p> \n<h2>Flame-grilled mackerel with avocado, Celtic mustard and shiso: the Ledbury, London W11 </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bebd1b533c5cee60e4b0a3735f8b571f800bd627\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435826840320/b1d499bd-7cd1-4f54-9d04-6c4f97fddc3c-420x420.png\" alt=\"Flame-grilled mackerel with avocado, Celtic mustard and shiso: the Ledbury, London W11.\" width=\"420\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flame-grilled mackerel with avocado, Celtic mustard and shiso at the Ledbury, London W11: ‘Today, a dish’s components must appear to have been insouciantly strewn by Tinker Bell in a bewitching melee of dots and splodges and tiny, edible flowers.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Franke for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ol> \n <li>The mackerel is pan-roasted until its flesh is oily and tender; its skin is then flamed over stone until it’s a crackly mackintosh of just-charred crispness.</li> \n <li>Pillows of cucumber agar-agar (a jellying agent) with a filling of mackerel tartare, plus the sting of shiso and the balm of avocado.

Whether you need a wee sip or a punch for a party, there is something here for everyone, from twists on old classics to super-trashy delights. You’ll need barely any equipment to make any of them. If you have a shaker, great, but really a pint glass will do, and a rolling pin makes a great substitute for a professional bartender’s muddler.</p> \n<h2><strong>Rum and raisin old-fashioned</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2c02c895221437fef9df775873b73e956e28142d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435672736441/111add39-df15-49bb-bc43-535c5fcbc425-311x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Rum\" width=\"311\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>No raisins were harmed in the making of this cocktail – it’s the <a href=\"http://www.harveyshalfhour.co.uk/harveys-sherry\">Harvey’s Bristol Cream</a> that brings the raisiny flavour. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml Appleton VX rum<br />25ml Harvey’s Bristol Cream<br />1 dash Angostura bitters <br />1 dash Angostura orange bitters<br />1 orange twist, to garnish</strong></p> \n<p>Fill a tumbler or rocks glass with ice cubes. Add the rum, sherry and bitters, and stir. Gently squeeze the oils from the orange peel on to the surface of the drink, then drop into the glass and serve.</p> \n<h2><strong>Apricot julep</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0992f903d57d1d0078a28b813b3b8bb0adccdafd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435672845483/5ac49fa0-d340-4185-9bca-b4a53ae4086d-460x406.jpeg\" alt=\"Apricot\" width=\"460\" height=\"406\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Mint julep is the official drink of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/kentucky-derby\">the Kentucky Derby</a>, where thousands are consumed over the two-day event. Closer to home, David Gerran, bar manager of <a href=\"http://thewhipmayfair.co.uk\">The Whip in Mayfair</a>, has mixed this twist on the julep for me on many occasions, and I’ve coaxed the recipe from his chilled, minty fingers. The key to a great julep is in the careful handling of the mint. These drinks were originally served in pewter tins, but if you don’t have one, a tin camping mug works just fine (or, provided it’s got no sharp edges, the empty tin your apricots were in). Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>1 tin apricots – you’ll need 25ml tinned juice for each serving<br />8 mint leaves, plus 1 extra to serve<br />50ml bourbon</strong></p> \n<p>Drain the apricots, saving the juice in a jug (eat the fruit separately – I like them with thick cream or ice-cream, which reminds me a bit of school dinners). Put the mint leaves in the empty tin, then squish into the sides and base of the tin with the back of a spoon: you want to impart a minty flavour over as much of the walls of the tin as you can. Pour in the bourbon, then fill the tin with crushed ice. Pour 25ml tinned apricot juice over the ice, and garnish with fresh mint. Sip slowly.</p> \n<h2><strong>Common or garden G&amp;T</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a8fbf80f8a4c173c563efdd1d6ef50bf7aaad820\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673613123/33654967-82e7-44b5-899c-45c3a92b4358-193x420.jpeg\" alt=\"G&amp;T\" width=\"193\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Best drunk propped up on one elbow while lying on a lawn. The bay and sage should be easy to find or “forage” from a park or neighbour’s garden. Gnome optional. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>35ml gin (<a href=\"http://www.sipsmith.com\">Sipsmith’s</a>, for preference)<br />Tonic water (<a href=\"http://www.fever-tree.com\">Fever-Tree</a>, for preference)<br />1 fresh bay leaf<br />1 sage leaf<br />1 lemon wedge</strong></p> \n<p>Fill a large wine glass with ice cubes. Add the gin, top with tonic to taste, and add the bay and sage. Squeeze over the lemon wedge, then drop it into the glass, stir and sip.</p> \n<h2><strong>Vodka martinez</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"90725c112439f0ca68c1d3ffc265175596eae2c8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673023091/2722c33e-5c86-455c-a492-78cea9012b46-205x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Vodka Martinez\" width=\"205\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>The martinez is the father of the martini. Brian Silva of <a href=\"http://balthazarlondon.com\">Balthazar in Covent Garden</a> has mixed one for me more times than I care to remember (or should that be am able to remember?). He uses vodka instead of the gin, and I haven’t looked back since my first sip. The vodka isn’t as domineering, so the aromatics in the vermouth are free to play. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml sweet vermouth<br />15ml vodka <br />4 drops maraschino<br />1 lemon twist</strong></p> \n<p>Chill a sherry glass or coupe. Put the vermouth, vodka and maraschino in a shaker, add ice and stir until chilled. Strain into the glass, squeeze the lemon twist over the drink and discard the lemon. Sip away.</p> \n<h2><strong>Somerset appletini</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"05392f5fcb1bbf4182443a39879715f73298c7de\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673077346/8c0a63b6-d06f-4c50-a3a0-99a4c51b9b08-333x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Somerset appletini\" width=\"333\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A Somerset take on the martini, though it actually has very little incommon with that sweet cocktail. The apple part is purely a reference to the eau du vie made by <a href=\"http://www.ciderbrandy.co.uk\">Cider Brandy God Julian Temperley</a>. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>35ml Somerset apple eau du vie<br />15ml Noilly Pratt<br />1 lemon twist</strong></p> \n<p>Chill a coupe glass. Combine the eau du vie and vermouth in a shaker, stir until chilled, then double strain into the glass. Squeeze the lemon twist over the drink and drop into the glass.</p> \n<h2><strong>Michelada</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aea3449666079ae212cf87e0770e68cceea9eaf8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673125275/0443b2fa-87e0-4a2f-9348-4ed0d2e7c000-319x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Michelada\" width=\"319\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>West Country meets Mexico in this gorgeous summer drink. Trust me on this one: the combination of tomato, spice, salt, acidity and beer is brilliant. Also great served as a small shot alongside a healthy measure of good tequila (in Mexico, this is known as sangrita). Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml tomato juice<br />25ml apple juice<br />Juice of &frac12; lime <br />1 tsp chipotle paste<br />1 dash <a href=\"http://www.cholula.com\">Cholula sauce</a><br />1 lime wedge <br />Sea salt, for the rim<br />Chapel Down’s <a href=\"http://www.chapeldown.com/curious-brew\">Curious Brew lager</a> (or any other good British lager)</strong></p> \n<p>Mix all of the ingredients except the beer. Roll the rim of a highball or half-pint glass in coarse sea salt and fill with ice. Pour in the mix, add the lime wedge and top with beer. Make more immediately.</p> \n<h2><strong>White Russian</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"705627e82a039d28bf4ae49919f2b9b0d2d22d6f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673199191/ed7bfad6-d294-4c16-9fcc-3723abd7420e-240x420.jpeg\" alt=\"White Russian\" width=\"240\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>This simple cocktail gives the drinker a white moustache. Made famous by <a href=\"http://\">the Dude in The Big Lebowski</a>, white Russian has a creamy texture, obviously, and a sweet, boozy finish. I like to use <a href=\"http://www.blackcow.co.uk\">Black Cow vodka</a> here: it’s distilled from milk, so seems very fitting, plus it’s made in Dorset. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml Black Cow vodka<br />25ml Kahlua <br />25ml cream<br />Swizzle stick, to serve</strong></p> \n<p>Fill a tumbler with cubed ice. Add the vodka and Kahlua, and stir. Carefully pour on the cream – you want it to stay on top in a distinct layer – and serve with a swizzle stick.</p> \n<h2><strong>Strawberry, lemonade and mint</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"75c1b8e25d410e682e6ba8fd1c794ec8f85d9de7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673246934/c4694a0f-49ab-4a7b-b6fa-d25369b89498-202x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Strawberry cocktail\" width=\"202\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A thirst-quenching number with an almost sherbety finish for any alcohol-abstainers at your gathering (and also rather splendid dosed with a shot of vodka or gin). Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>3 strawberries<br />125ml <a href=\"http://www.fentimans.com\">Fentimans Victorian lemonade</a> (or other cloudy lemonade)<br />1 small handful fresh mint<br />1 sprig fresh mint and 1 strawberry, to garnish</strong></p> \n<p>Put three strawberries in the base of a highball glass and muddle (ie, bash) until smooth. Add the handful of mint, gently muddle again, then top with lemonade and stir to mix. Top with ice and garnish with a sprig of mint and a whole strawberry.</p> \n<h2><strong>Honey sazerac</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"db6c3db5228d69d622a36e7cd6aa43edf2650ff8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673310086/deaae14e-aba0-4ae3-9f1c-567af9b10474-257x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Honey\" width=\"257\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A strong drop that makes a superb closer to an evening. I’ve used honey rather than the more usual sugar, because I find that gives a smoother finish; the dash of absinthe leaves a heady, aniseed coating on the glass. If you’re making a batch, serve from a jug with lots of ice, and sip from a set of chilled small cups or shot glasses. Sometimes drinking from tiny vessels gives a very different perspective on life. Serves two.</p> \n<p><strong>1 dash absinthe<br />50ml rye whisky<br />1 tsp honey<br />3 dashes Peychaud’s bitters<br />1 dash Angostura bitters <br />Lemon twist, to garnish</strong></p> \n<p>Swirl the absinthe and a little ice around your chosen drinking vessels. Put the whisky, honey and both bitters in a shaker, and stir to dissolve the honey. Add ice and stir again for 30 seconds. Tip out the ice and absinthe from the glasses (or drink it: no one’s watching) and fill with fresh ice. Strain the shaker into two glasses, squeeze a lemon twist over each drink and drop in.</p> \n<h2><strong>Storm in a teacup</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"589f2c30e7635eeeec63ec2b7672eb0e4a47c3ca\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673359286/6a9faf01-04fd-4332-a896-556fb6512bfa-291x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Storm in teacup\" width=\"291\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>This is essentially a dark’n’stormy served in a teacup: a perfect way to disguise daytime drinking. If anyone asks, it’s darjeeling. The rosemary adds a savoury, herbal note. Serves two.</p> \n<p><strong>100ml <a href=\"http://www.goslingsrum.com\">Gosling’s rum</a> <br />25ml lime juice<br />250ml <a href=\"http://www.fentimans.com\">Fentimans ginger beer</a><br />2 slices fresh lime<br />2 rosemary sprigs</strong></p> \n<p>Combine the rum, lime juice and ginger beer in a teapot with plenty of ice, and stir. Pour into teacups (saucers obligatory), and garnish with a slice of lime and a rosemary sprig.</p> \n<h2><strong>Marmalade punch</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bb11d732fcba6581bfd63e6514c1055bb4a3e8ba\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673403359/4ff25856-5ffd-4a88-b206-c4b5bfd67ff1-348x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Marmalade\" width=\"348\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Just the ticket for a summer party: it has a gentle heat, and the whisky, orange and ginger are all fitting companions. The overarching flavour is one of marmalade. If Paddington Bear were old enough to drink, and also not a bear, this would be his drink of choice. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>500ml cloudy apple juice<br />250ml Fentimans ginger beer <br />100ml whisky<br />2 dashes Angostura orange bitters<br />Juice of &frac12; lemon <br />8 slices orange</strong></p> \n<p>Put everything bar four slices of orange into a large jar or jug with lots of ice. Stir, pour into tankards, peg an orange slice to the side of each and swig. Dead posh, this.</p> \n<h2><strong>White sangria</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"86777cef50044ecf7b58438b0e38217cde1e36dd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673489268/5a77e0ab-c253-4730-afef-d510dc8b04de-285x420.jpeg\" alt=\"white sangria\" width=\"285\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A gorgeous, fruity number in which the basil draws the drink towards a more aromatic and savoury conclusion. Thoroughly grown-up. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>6 strawberries<br />30g sugar<br />1 750ml bottle sauvignon blanc<br />Juice from 1 lemon<br />1 small apple, sliced<br />1 small handful fresh basil leaves</strong></p> \n<p>An hour ahead, cut the strawberries in half and sprinkle with sugar: the sugar will draw out flavour and form a syrup. Combine everything in a large jug, making sure to scrape in all the sugary strawberry juice, top with ice and stir. Serve in chilled tumblers or rocks glasses.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jackabevan\">Jack Adair Bevan</a> is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.theethicurean.com\">The Ethicurean in Bristol</a>.
