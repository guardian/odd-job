Go for small plates, refreshing ingredients and anything containing chilli, all washed down with salted lemonade</p>","byline":"Edward Smith","body":"<p>The default response to a Great British Heatwave is to pull tables and chairs outside, fire up the barbecue and pair the sunburnt lobster look with a charred meat feast. But we’re doing it all wrong. Because although we are drawn to al fresco dining, we should, in fact, be looking for shade and food that keeps us cool. You won’t find residents of countries with hot climates heading outside to eat a heavy meal; they seek little bites of cooling and refreshing ingredients. In the unlikely event that these temperatures are seen again, what can we learn from those with more experience? What should we be eating in the heat?</p> \n<p>Sarit Packer, one half of the Israeli chef/writer team behind the restaurant Honey &amp; Co in London, is adamant about eating light meals when temperatures soar. “I think the whole aspect of summer food in Israel is so different to the UK,” she says, noting that light, fresh salads and snacks are the way forward, and “occasionally you throw in a little grilled meat skewer or a few falafel balls”. Cold vine leaves with yogurt and mint “is the best midsummer snack ever”, she adds. Packer makes dolmades from scratch with pre-salted vine leaves in the Honey &amp; Co book, but describes them as “tortuous” to put together. Alternatively, pair good-quality bought stuffed vine leaves with a dip inspired by theirs <em>(see recipe below)</em>.</p> \n<p>The light bites thing makes sense. Eating large meals sends much of your blood to your stomach to help aid the digestion process. But in hot weather, it is better to have blood close to the surface of the skin to aid cooling – through the evaporation of sweat, if it’s really sticky.</p> \n<p>Grazing to stay cool might explain the appeal of meze in the Middle East and tapas in Spain. Of course, Spaniards have gazpacho as a weapon too: chef Jos&eacute; Pizarro reckons the “ice-coolness” of blitzed tomatoes and cucumbers is “the only thing that staves off the Extremaduran heat”. Is that, in part, because of the cucumber? This ingredient is a near-constant when thinking about refreshing dishes; all that water content helps us to hydrate, and, when it’s straight from the fridge, to keep the temperature down. Melon has similar qualities. Indeed, it is part of Packer’s “all-time favourite cooling salad” of ice-cold watermelon with feta and olive oil. Cantaloupe melons feature in many an Italian salad; many different varieties of the fruit are pressed into service in Thailand; and watermelons are mentioned again by Asma Khan, a Bengali cook who runs a pop-up restaurant in Soho, <a href=\"http://www.darjeeling-express.com/\">Darjeeling Express</a>.</p> \n<p>For Khan, <em>kakri</em> (Indian cucumbers) and watermelon sherbet are two things she would most regularly seek on a hot day in Kolkata. We should also cook dishes with chilli, she confirms, as the capsaicin within the peppers causes us to perspire and lose heat more easily. She refers to fresh dishes using plenty of herbs such as mint and basil as well as chilli, perhaps with yoghurt on the side, rather than rich, oily, classically British curries.</p> \n<p>If light meals, cooling ingredients and ingredients that warm us up yet chill us out aren’t enough, then the last resort for refreshment is surely a cold drink. I found bucket-sized G&amp;Ts infused with cinnamon bark and orange particularly good on a recent trip to Spain. But Kahn’s suggestion of <em>nimbu pani</em> – a salted lemonade – is probably a more sensible and hydrating suggestion.</p> \n<p>With all this in mind, could a light salad involving watermelon, cucumber, fresh herbs and chilli be the ultimate cooling dish? Served cold but with a definite kick, this Thai-style dish is certainly more appropriate for temperatures hovering around the 30s than a hotdog or burger. Khan’s <em>nimbu pani</em> also really hits the spot; the pinch of salt is superb.</p> \n<h2>Thai-style watermelon and cucumber salad</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"143153e3d2def3163f114e80ee161e358622aade\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/143153e3d2def3163f114e80ee161e358622aade/201_0_5559_3335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thai Watermelon and Cucumber Salad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Gordon/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong><em>(Serves 4)</em></strong><br /></p> \n<p><strong>1 tsp Sriracha chilli sauce</strong></p> \n<p><strong>4 tbsp fish sauce</strong></p> \n<p><strong>1 tsp grated ginger</strong></p> \n<p><strong>1 tsp granulated golden sugar</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Juice of 1 lime </strong></p> \n<p><strong>750g watermelon, cut into 3cm cubes</strong></p> \n<p><strong>200g cucumber, peeled and cut into pound-coin-thick crescents</strong></p> \n<p><strong>1 birdseye chilli, finely sliced</strong></p> \n<p><strong>10g fresh mint, rolled and chopped</strong></p> \n<p><strong>10g fresh basil (preferably Thai), torn</strong></p> \n<p><strong>25g toasted and roughly chopped salted peanuts</strong></p> \n<p>Ensure your ingredients are fridge-cold before preparing the salad.

All they will say is that it’s gin-based and flavoured with a secret blend of herbs and spices. So far, so KFC.</p> \n<p>Tasting it unencumbered by mixers for possibly the first time in my life, I find it surprisingly rich and sweet – rather like the kind of wine served at holy communion in dusty parish churches in the deepest shires – with an orangey bitterness that lingers on the tongue. In fact, it has much more in common with other digestifs (such as Fernet Branca or, dare I say it, J&auml;germeister) than I would have guessed.</p> \n<p>The copycat recipes I try take this in several different directions. American drinks writer <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/03/diy-pimms-homemade-pimms-no-1-recipe.html\">Marcia Simmons infuses gin and sweet vermouth with bitter orange peel and fresh orange</a> for 24 hours for a concoction that’s overwhelmingly citrussy – drinkable, certainly, but not quite Pimm’s. Imbibe magazine, <a href=\"http://imbibemagazine.com/homemade-pimm-s-recipe/\">which clearly read my tasting notes</a>, mixes its gin with sweet sherry or port (the latter, I think, would be a mistake) and adds sweet vermouth (which supplies that characteristic bitter edge) and orangey triple sec – but in these quantities I find it too sweet.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"035c6db7971e5db0d3b31c3455f666e1ef2f3279\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435750943397/9c4cd65b-ed9f-4c0b-8bb7-7b50ba417382-460x411.jpeg\" alt=\"Imbibe magazine's summer cup.\" width=\"460\" height=\"411\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Imbibe magazine’s summer cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"http://fromthelarder.co.uk/2014/07/homemade-pimms/\">Georgina Hartley, author of the From the Larder blog</a>, uses a mixture of gin, sweet vermouth, triple sec and aperol, which proves richer and sweeter than the original – nice diluted with tonic or soda, but too much with lemonade. Victoria Moore keeps things simple in her cheat’s Pimm’s, using equal parts gin, red vermouth and Cointreau (a triple sec), which proves amazingly effective as a quick substitute – in fact, some of my testers prefer it to the original, its slightly drier flavour giving it “more depth”. This one’s well worth a go for keen cocktail fiends who happen to keep these things in stock (red vermouth is an essential ingredient in that fine drink the negroni, so it’s a handy chap to have around in any case), but it’s a bit more aggressively bitter and citrussy than the real thing.</p> \n<p>On side-by-side tasting, however, I’m disappointed how thin and caramel-sweet Pimm’s is, so rather than attempting to recreate it exactly, I’m going to bump up the gin content, and add a soup&ccedil;on of triple sec for its citrus flavour, a slug of red vermouth and Aperol for bitterness, and just a dash of angostura bitters to give it some extra edge.

Both are just too assertively lemony, whereas clear lemonade (not Sprite, as Simmons recommends) lends the drink a gentler, sweeter flavour. Too sweet for some – Moore actually prefers her summer cup with tonic as she finds lemonade “too cloying”, while the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Larousse-Cocktails-Fernando-Castellon/dp/0600612619\">Larousse cocktail guide</a> proves the French know nothing about the subject by using soda water, which makes its version taste as underwhelming as a well-iced Pimm’s that’s been abandoned in the garden during a freak summer rainstorm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6b61cf93b2532f417f8859ce7f04c0a7b6f0c334\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435751200528/d14670ce-26fa-4a11-8779-c7f3971b3c10-279x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Victoria Moore's summer cup.\" width=\"279\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria Moore’s summer cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Americans seem to be keen on Pimm’s with ginger ale, a combination I have never encountered this side of the pond (and, believe me, I’ve got some serious experience in this field). The fieriness doesn’t really work for me; this should be a cooling drink that slips down the throat with dangerous ease, which is why I love Hartley’s delicately flavoured cucumber, verbena and mint-infused syrup, though I do find it too sweet when topped up with lemonade. Sparkling water, however, is perfect. Salvatore Calabrese suggests topping the drink up with champagne. Like the “turbo Pimm’s” served by my college bar, supercharged with extra gin or vodka, this is only a good idea if you’re not planning to sit around in the sun all afternoon glugging glass after glass of the stuff.</p> \n<h2>The garnish</h2> \n<p>“Don’t make a fruit salad,” Moore pleads, and I’m inclined to agree: a glass half-full of soggy fruit is no one’s idea of a good time. Though you’re perfectly welcome to use lemon or apple if you must (though the latter has an unattractive tendency to discolour), I think all you need is a curl of cucumber, which looks more handsome than the diced stuff, and a few strawberries – because, though yes, they do go a bit mushy after a bit, the only thing more redolent of a British summer than Pimm’s is a warm, sharp, sweet strawberry.</p> \n<p>Herb wise, I’d steer clear of Simmons’s sage or thyme, and stick with the wonderful cucumber flavour and vivid blue flowers of borage if you can find it (I had trouble this year), or cooling mint – but keep the leaves whole so they don’t dissolve into compost at the bottom of the glass. Add the garnish to the glasses as you serve, rather than putting them in the jug, to avoid strawberry envy. If you’re planning to stand around outside in the sun, then an ice-filled glass is a must, though make sure the ingredients are well-chilled before use. Just as you will be after drinking a couple of these.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd46bcfbd2b6dbc9682e88dd9c88ff1fb7b14891\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435751095695/d8b52f79-1698-41fe-aaa5-2f9c9c34a03c-460x415.jpeg\" alt=\"Dale DeGroff’s summer cup.\" width=\"460\" height=\"415\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dale DeGroff’s summer cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The perfect summer cup</h2> \n<p><em>For the mixer (makes enough for 4)</em><br />200g white sugar<br />&frac12; cucumber, sliced (not peeled)<br />2 generous sprigs of mint<br />1 unwaxed lemon<br />600ml cold sparkling water OR 225ml clear lemonade</p> \n<p><em>For the base (per drink)</em><br />35ml gin<br />25ml red vermouth<br />1 tsp triple sec<br />1 tsp Aperol<br />&frac12; tsp dry amontillado sherry <br />Angostura bitters <br />OR 75ml Pimm’s or other summer cup</p> \n<p><em>For the garnish (per drink)</em><br />2 strawberries<br />1 curl of cucumber peel<br />Sprig of borage or mint<br />Ice</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c699b5e3d9b51ba12087a97683bc55ef27601cdf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435751685858/1994c68b-273a-4b05-b705-f007cae2126a-357x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake's perfect summer cup.\" width=\"357\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake’s perfect summer cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If making the mixer, bring the sugar to the boil with 200ml water, stirring until dissolved.

Dissolve the yeast in the water and add the oil. Now make a well in the middle of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture a little at a time, mixing constantly. We like to do this by hand, squelching out the lumps as they appear.</p> \n<p>When all the yeast mixture has been incorporated, transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead well for at least 5 minutes. If the dough is still sticky, add a little more flour; if it is stiff, a little more water. It is ready when no longer tacky but soft, elastic and smooth. Put the dough back in the bowl, cover with a cloth and leave to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk – approximately 1-2 hours.</p> \n<p>While the flatbread dough is proving, make the toppings.</p> \n<p>For the spinach topping, heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the chopped onion and a pinch of salt and fry, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until the onion is golden and sweet. Add the oregano or marjoram and fry for a few seconds, then add the spinach a handful at a time. Give the spinach a quick stir and cook for a few minutes, until tender. Set aside to cool and drain in a colander, then chop roughly. Stir in the currants and taste the mixture for seasoning. Set aside the pine nuts and anchovies for later.</p> \n<p>For the onion, red pepper and aubergine topping, first toss the aubergine with the salt and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a heavy saucepan about 25cm wide and, when hot but not smoking, add the onions with a pinch of salt. Give them a good stir, and cook over a medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring every now and then. Add the peppers and cook for 15-20 minutes, until the onions are golden and sweet and the peppers soft. Be sure to stir them often so they cook evenly and do not stick to the bottom of the pan. Blot the aubergine dry, add to the pan along with the rosemary and cook for a final 15 minutes, stirring often, until the aubergine is soft all the way through. Remove from the heat and drain off any excess oil. Check for seasoning and set aside to cool.</p> \n<p>To make and bake the cocas, preheat the oven to its maximum setting. Divide the dough into 4 balls, and roll the first one out very thinly to make a 20 x 30cm oblong. Place it on a large baking sheet (aluminium is best) and spread half of one of the fillings evenly over the surface, right up to the edges of the dough. The spinach cocas should be topped with the pine nuts and anchovy fillets, if using, and the spinach pressed down and drizzled with a little extra oil to stop it burning. The onion, red pepper and aubergine topping is ready to go as soon as it has been spread on the dough.</p> \n<p>Bake for 10-15 minutes, until browned and crispy underneath. While one coca is in the oven, start rolling and topping the next one. They are great served piping hot straight from the oven, or at room temperature.</p> \n<p><em>From Moro East by Sam &amp; Sam Clark (Ebury Press RRP &pound;17). </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/moro-east.html\"><em>Click here to buy a copy from Guardian Bookshop for &pound;14 </em></a> </p> \n<h2>Colman Andrews’s black rice</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ac1b3b2844b21cde37e53e2f148e173080cd418\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435159008520/f26659dd-b0ff-4b1d-87f4-20342926bf13-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Black rice\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is a recipe for which you should splurge on the best and the freshest possible seafood. Even fresh cuttlefish is available in some parts of Britain, though it is hard to find. It is not the same thing as squid, exactly. Its flesh is thicker and sweeter, and its ink is richer in flavour. Nonetheless, fresh squid (and squid ink) may be substituted – or you could use a combination of canned Spanish cuttlefish (sold in some Spanish shops), for its ink, and fresh squid.</p> \n<p>The ink sac in both cuttlefish and squid is a little silver-grey pouch located beneath the tentacles. It is easy to find, but treat it gently so that it doesn’t break.</p> \n<p>With the growing popularity of Italian-style black rice and black pasta, cuttlefish or squid ink has recently become available in small jars or plastic pouches (like soy sauce at Chinese take-away places). The quality of such ink is fine – but why pay for something (and it’s generally quite expensive) that comes free with the cuttlefish or squid itself? If you are using such ink, substitute about 2 teaspoons of it for the ink called for in this recipe.</p> \n<p>Serves 6 as a main<br /><strong>cuttlefish</strong> 1 medium-sized (about 250g) or <strong>squid</strong> 2-3 large, cleaned and cut into small pieces, with ink sac(s) set aside (see above)<br /><strong>olive oil<br /></strong><strong>onions</strong> 2, chopped<br /><strong>tomatoes</strong> 2, seeded and grated or peeled, seeded and chopped<br /><strong>monkfish</strong> 500g, cut into 6 pieces<br /><strong>mussels</strong> 12, cleaned<br /><strong>prawns</strong> 6 large, shells on<br /><strong>short-grain rice</strong> 650g<br /><strong>fish stock</strong> 1.25-1.5 litres<br /><strong>garlic</strong> 2 cloves, finely chopped<br /><strong>parsley</strong> 2 sprigs, finely chopped<br /><strong>salt</strong></p> \n<p>Cook the cuttlefish or squid in a cassola, flameproof casserole or large frying pan in a small amount of olive oil until just done (about 2-3 minutes).</p> \n<p>Add the onion, with more oil if necessary and cook until soft; then add the tomato and cook, stirring well, until it has almost dissolved.</p> \n<p>Add the remaining fish and shellfish to the cassola and mix in well.</p> \n<p>Place the ink sac(s) in a sieve, hold it over the cassola and crush sac(s) with the back of a spoon. Pour a few tablespoons of water through the sieve to extract more ink.</p> \n<p>Bring the fish stock to a boil; then reduce to a simmer.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, add the rice to the cassola and stir well so that all grains are coated with oil and ink.</p> \n<p>Slowly add the fish stock, stir well and bring to a boil. Add the garlic, parsley and salt to taste; then reduce the heat and cook on very low heat, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes or until all the liquid is absorbed but the rice is still creamy.

If the weather allows, we cook it on an open fire – you are rewarded with an amazing smoky aroma. This paella recipe is the fruit both of my own investigations and those of top Valencian chefs and grandmothers. Follow this recipe and I guarantee you will soon be tasting the best paella. Buen provecho!</p> \n<p>Serves 6<br /><strong>globe artichokes</strong> 2-3 (depending on the size), cleaned and trimmed<br /><strong>saffron</strong> 1g<br /><strong>salt</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>Spanish olive oil</strong> 8 tbsp<br /><strong>chicken pieces (on the bone) </strong>400g<br /><strong>rabbit pieces (on the bone)</strong> 400g<br /><strong>runner beans</strong> 200g, trimmed and cut into 2&frac12;cm pieces<br /><strong>broad beans or fresh white butter beans </strong>100g<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 4, finely chopped<br /><strong>tomatoes</strong> 1 large or 2 small, grated<br /><strong>sweet piment&oacute;n</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>water or light chicken stock</strong> 2 litres<br /><strong>Spanish rice</strong> 500g, such as calasparra or bomba<br /><strong>rosemary</strong> 1 sprig</p> \n<p>First prepare the artichokes. Trim the stalks and peel away the outer leaves so you are just left with the artichoke hearts. Scrape away any furry choke with a teaspoon, then run a lemon half over the hearts so they don’t discolour.</p> \n<p>Wrap the saffron in foil and toast it for 30 seconds on each side in a paella pan over a medium heat. Remove from the pan and set aside.</p> \n<p>Increase the heat to the maximum and season around the edges of the pan with the table salt. Wait until the pan is really hot and then drizzle with the olive oil. It should start smoking immediately; at this point throw in the pieces of chicken and rabbit (the meat needs to absorb the salt at this early stage). Fry the meat until nicely browned on all sides (this will add to the flavour of the paella).</p> \n<p>Add the runner beans and broad beans and stir together for 1 minute before adding the garlic. Cook for 1 minute and then add the grated tomatoes (discarding the skin), piment&oacute;n and toasted saffron. Cook for 4 minutes, stirring all the time, until you can see that the tomatoes have lost most of the juice and changed colour.</p> \n<p>Add the water or chicken stock and leave to simmer for about 20 minutes, allowing the bits of caramelised chicken and vegetable on the bottom of the pan to dissolve so you get a rich stock. If you use chicken stock instead of water you will only need to simmer for 5 minutes. Check the seasoning but bear in mind that the rice will absorb a lot of saltiness, so it’s okay if it tastes quite salty at this stage.</p> \n<p>Cut the artichokes into quarters and add to the pan – if you add them any earlier the entire paella will turn dark in colour. Add the rice, spreading it evenly over the paella pan and stir just once. Cook on the highest heat for about 10-12 minutes before reducing the heat right down and cooking for a further 5-7 minutes. Once you have added the rice and given it a good stir you shouldn’t touch the pan with a spoon again. You need to keep the film that develops on the top of the stock from breaking, otherwise the steam will escape and the rice won’t cook evenly.</p> \n<p>When the water is at a lower level than the rice itself, add the rosemary sprig. If the layer of rice on the top starts to look a bit crispy, cover the paella pan with a layer of newspaper for the last 5 minutes of cooking. This will help to steam the grains on top while the bottom gets crispy. In Spain this crispy bottom layer, the ‘socarrat’, is the most valuable part of the paella. Once the paella is finished it should look like a completely flat layer of rice. Leave to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</p> \n<p><em>From Tapas Revolution by Omar Allibhoy (Ebury, RRP &pound;20). </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/tapas-revolution.html\"><em>Click here to buy a copy from Guardian Bookshop for &pound;16</em></a><em>; </em><a href=\"http://www.tapasrevolution.com\"><em>tapasrevolution.com</em></a></p> \n<h2>Colman Andrews’s prawns with garlic and paprika</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ef74bbb0398420a0def21a2cbbe6b8bc9be0cff\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435158614551/768b73b4-337b-47e0-8879-b6cbc2633335-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Prawns with garlic and paprika\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This particular dish, served at one of the better traditional restaurants in Valencia, El Plat, is made with llagostins, a variety of prawn known scientifically as Penaeus caramote – a particularly large and meaty species.

You can prepare the croquettes ready for frying the day before and keep them in the refrigerator.</p> \n<p>Makes about 30 croquettes<br /><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 75g<br /><strong>onion</strong> &frac12; large, peeled and finely chopped<br /><strong>jam&oacute;n serrano or other raw dry-cured ham </strong>200g, finely chopped (this can be done in the food processor)<br /><strong>nutmeg</strong> freshly grated, a pinch<br /><strong>whole milk</strong> 725ml<br /><strong>plain flour</strong> 150g<br /><strong>salt</strong> if necessary<br /><strong>fine matzo meal or breadcrumbs</strong> about 100g<br /><strong>medium matzo meal or breadcrumbs</strong> about 125g<br /><strong>eggs</strong> 2 large<br /><strong>sunflower or olive oil </strong>for deep-frying, enough to cover the croquettes</p> \n<p>In a large pan, melt the butter and gently saute the onion over a low heat until it is soft. Add the ham and cook, stirring for a minute or so. Then stir in the nutmeg and about half the milk and bring to the boil.</p> \n<p>Beat the flour with the remaining milk using an electric mixer until any lumps have disappeared. Then pour into the pan, stirring vigorously, and cook, continuing to stir constantly, for 8-10 minutes until the mixture has the consistency of a thick paste that comes away from the bottom of the pan. Add salt if necessary – it might not need it because the ham is salty. Chill for at least 2 hours or overnight.</p> \n<p>To make the croquettes, cover a large plate with plenty of very fine matzo meal or breadcrumbs and a second plate with medium matzo meal or breadcrumbs. Beat the eggs lightly in a soup plate. Two large spoons greased with oil are normally used to shape the croquetas into an oblong. But you may find it easier, as I do, to take lumps of the thick bechamel paste the size of walnuts and roll them into balls between the palms of your hands. You can rub your hands in oil if you do not want the paste to stick. As you make them, drop the balls into the fine matzo meal or breadcrumbs. Roll a batch of the balls in the fine meal until well covered all over, then roll them in the beaten egg, and then in the medium matzo meal. This will give them a nice thick crust.</p> \n<p>To deep-fry the balls in batches in a frying pan, heat the oil until it is only medium hot (until a piece of bread dropped in sizzles immediately but does not turn dark quickly). Carefully lower the croquettes into the oil and fry over a medium-low heat for 5-6 minutes until lightly browned, turning them over once. If the oil is too hot they will burst.</p> \n<p>Lift them out with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.

You can identify the fish by the stripes on the first dorsal fin and, when fresh, three or four yellow streaks along its sides. Its profile is slightly more elongated and less snub-nosed than its cousin.</p> \n<p>Buy the biggest specimens you can find – no tiddlers please. Each fish should weigh around 400g prior to filleting. Get your fishmonger to fillet them for you – each fish will give you two fillets of around 100g each.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>potatoes</strong> 3 medium, peeled<br /><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> 5 tbsp<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 2, chopped<br /><strong>thyme</strong> 1 sprig, leaves stripped<br /><strong>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br /></strong><strong>Arag&oacute;n or Kalamata black olives</strong> 30, pitted<br /><strong>chive stalks</strong> 10, chopped<br /><strong>red mullet</strong> 4 x 400g, filleted<br /><strong>olive oil</strong> for frying</p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Slice the potatoes as thinly as possible (use a mandolin if you have one), then mix with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the chopped garlic and thyme leaves. Season, then spread the mixture over a greased baking tray. Bake for about 15 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, blitz the olives and half the chive stalks with the remaining olive oil in a food processor to make a thick puree.</p> \n<p>Season the fillets. Heat some oil in a frying pan until it is medium hot – the oil should be shimmering but not smoking – and fry the mullet for 2 minutes skin-side down, then turn over and fry for another minute.

Pork belly is cheap to buy and when cooked well can be exquisite, but you can use pork loin if you prefer. Ask your butcher to score the skin of the belly, or do it yourself with a Stanley knife (the cuts should be no more than 1cm apart and be deep enough to cut through the rind to form crackling).</p> \n<p>Serves 4-6<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 2, crushed with a pinch of salt<br /><strong>ground fennel seeds</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>organic or free-range pork belly</strong> 1.5kg, in one piece, skin on and scored<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>fino sherry or white wine</strong> 150ml<br /><strong>a splash of water</strong> (optional)<br /><strong>sea salt and black pepper</strong></p> \n<p>Mix the garlic with the fennel seeds and rub over the flesh of the belly. Place on a large board, skin-side up, and dry the skin thoroughly. Generously sprinkle with fine sea salt (about 1 tbsp) all over the scored skin. Leave for half an hour, then dust off excess salt.</p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 230C/gas mark 8. Transfer the pork to a large roasting tin greased with the olive oil and place in the hot oven on the top shelf. It is important that the oven is really hot to start with, as this intense heat is required to blister the skin and turn it into crackling. Roast at this high heat for a good 30 minutes until hard crackling has formed, then turn the heat down to 190C/gas mark 5 and transfer to a clean roasting tin. Continue cooking for another 2-2&frac12; hours (35 minutes if loin) until the meat is soft and tender. Remove from the oven, transfer to a chopping board and leave to rest, loosely covered with foil to keep warm, for 15 minutes.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, make the gravy. Pour off any excess oil, and place the roasting tray on the hob on a low to medium heat. Deglaze with the sherry or white wine, scraping the juices off the bottom of the pan as you go. Simmer for a couple of minutes to reduce the alcohol, then taste for seasoning. If it tastes too strong, add a splash of water. Keep hot. To serve the pork we often take it off any ribs beforehand as it is easier to slice.<br /><em>From Moro The Cookbook by Sam &amp; Sam Clark (Random House, RRP &pound;20).</em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/moro-cookbook.html\"><em> Click here to buy it from Guardian Bookshop for &pound;16</em></a></p> \n<h2>Nieves Barrag&aacute;n Mohacho’s classic tortilla</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6715d04777e5e44ca964c4f66e335371cf43dd67\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435157392129/2499a8f9-9f99-4689-8aec-9467d366fef9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Classic tortilla Barrafina\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A mandolin, if you have one, is best for slicing the potatoes.</p> \n<p>Serves 4 as a tapa or light lunch<br /><strong>vegetable oil</strong> 650ml<br /><strong>potatoes</strong> 750g, peeled and sliced into &frac12;cm rounds<br /><strong>onions</strong> 600g, peeled and sliced into very thin half-moons<br /><strong>free-range eggs</strong> 6<br /><strong>Maldon salt and freshly ground black pepper<br /></strong><strong>olive oil </strong>1-2 tbsp</p> \n<p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan until it is just beginning to smoke.

Sprinkle some flour on a clean work surface and roll out the pastry to a 3mm thickness. Cut out discs from the pastry about 12cm in diameter and transfer onto a floured tray. Repeat the process with the leftover pastry: you should end up with 12 discs of pastry. Transfer to the fridge to chill.</p> \n<p>Prepare your filling. For the cumin and paprika-spiced chicken and spinach, heat a saut&eacute; pan over a low heat and add a lug of olive oil. Add the paprika and cumin and cook gently for 1 minute. Add the spinach, season and cook until fully wilted. Drain the spinach, cool and roughly chop. Mix with the chicken, parsley and lemon juice.</p> \n<p>For the ricotta, peas and mint, mix all the ingredients together and check the seasoning.</p> \n<p>When the pastry has chilled, remove from the fridge and place a heaped teaspoon of filling in the centre of each disc, leaving a 2cm border around the edges. Brush some egg wash on one half of the border and pull the other half over the top of the filling to meet the eggy side.</p> \n<p>Press down and seal the pastry, ensuring there are no gaps. You will have a half moon shape with a bulge of filling in the centre. The pastry is quite robust but will become warm with too much handling, so you should work fairly swiftly. Crimp the sealed edge with a fork to give the classic empanadilla finish. Brush all over with egg wash and pop in the fridge for at least 15 minutes.</p> \n<p>Bake the empanadillas on a floured, non-stick oven tray for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is piping hot – a knife inserted into the centre of the empanadilla will come out hot.

By Nigel Slater","standFirst":"<p>The big sandwich season is upon us: bread piled high with fresh ingredients is substantial and interesting enough to serve as a light lunch</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<h2>The recipe</h2> \n<p>Cut a ciabatta loaf in half horizontally. Toast the bread on the cut side. Put four heaped tablespoons of good mayonnaise in a mixing bowl, season it with black pepper and with the finely grated zest of a small lemon. Reserve the lemon. Finely slice four large radishes and put them in a mixing bowl. Trim three spring onions, discarding the tough, darker stalks, then cut the rest into small pieces and add to the radishes. Drain 100g of crayfish tails or prawns and roughly chop them. Wash a handful of watercress, discard any tough stalks, then add to the radishes together with a trickle of olive oil and a little sea salt and toss the mixture gently. Cut each half of the ciabatta into two. Spread the lemon mayonnaise over it, then divide the crayfish salad between them. Serves 2.</p> \n<h2>The trick</h2> \n<p>There is no second slice of bread under which to hide your filling. An open sandwich needs to be made at the last minute if it is to tempt. Keep the flavours light and fresh, and pick out only the most perfect of young salad leaves and herbs.</p> \n<h2>The twist</h2> \n<p>What you need on the toasted bread is a mixture of fresh seasonal salad and shellfish, and something to hold them in place. Use a classic mayonnaise or one seasoned with crushed, roasted garlic; or maybe a herb mayonnaise scented with tarragon or basil. Keep some crunch in the salad with radishes and spring onions, but also include cubed cucumber, coarsely grated celeriac or kohlrabi. Use cooked mussels from their shells, boiled brown shrimps or crab in place of the prawns.</p> \n<p><br /><em>Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a>.

It started badly, and ended in hot-tongued outrage</p>","byline":"Rebecca Nicholson","body":"<p>Urban Dictionary <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hipster+Tabasco\">calls it “hipster tabasco”</a>. When it looked as if its Los Angeles <a href=\"http://time.com/57086/sriracha-public-nuisance-irwindale/\">factory might be closed</a> as a public nuisance, there were jokes with an air of panic about an international shortage. </p> \n<p>Sriracha hot sauce, which originated in eastern Thailand, is a mix of garlic, sugar, chillis, vinegar and salt. It may be derided as a modish condiment, but it is extremely tasty, and sparks the kind of devotion that prompts fans of the bright red bottle to buy T-shirts with it on the front and say things like: “Oh, I have it with everything.” Now, you <a href=\"http://www.dudeiwantthat.com/gear/food-drink/refillable-sriracha-keychain.asp\">can get a keyring-friendly mini-pack</a>, meaning that it can be on hand at all times. So, I decided to spend a day having it with everything. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0270156924929584a8a0bcd5828e386a56aef2e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435230371755/10002ba9-cf4d-4ad7-bfcd-5ea2d8f0c3b0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"There's a reason you don't normally put Sriracha on your porridge.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There’s a reason you don’t normally put Sriracha on your porridge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Nicholson/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Breakfast</h2> \n<p>Breakfast is where Sriracha got me hooked. At the weekend, it gets slathered on scrambled or poached eggs, like ketchup that punches you on the inside of your mouth. But that seems too easy, and I already know it’s lovely. So I stick with porridge. Unsweetened, watery porridge. Usually I’d blob some honey on top, but I’ve heard of savoury oats and I’ve eaten grits, which must be similar-ish, so I decide this will liven it up just fine. However, it looks like jam, which means I’m anticipating sweetness even though I know it will be spicy and savoury, which makes for a confusing mess of sensations. Plus, there’s a reason salty chilli porridge is not a thing – it’s disgusting.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f99a930774baa77b15184a09c4edf216f1b7f54\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435230486357/72a92e6f-6f61-457e-b3bc-cabec45a6875-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"Banana with Sriracha sauce turns out to be surprisingly moreish.\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banana with Sriracha sauce turns out to be surprisingly moreish.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Nicholson/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Snack</h2> \n<p>I go for a mid-morning banana, and remember that I need to put garlicky chilli sauce on it. Scarred by the porridge slop, I think about trying again tomorrow. The keyring of heat did not let me down, though. Chilli goes with banana. It brings out the sticky sweetness, and it’s surprisingly moreish. But I’d forgotten just how punchy the garlic was. “I’m going to stink of garlic,” I say to a colleague. “Going to?” she replies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e13cbfc23f108964d8ab0ff6595bbfa14e3eafcd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435230607451/36ebdabb-ba2e-40af-bcbc-513d93bf9ee3-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"Sriracha makes a decent sandwich even better.\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sriracha makes a decent sandwich even better.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Nicholson/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Lunch</h2> \n<p>Pret A Manger’s<em><a href=\"https://www.pret.co.uk/en-gb/532-baguettes-jambon-beurre.aspx\"> jambon beurre</a></em>, its slightly fancy ham sandwich, is my comfort lunch of choice, and I feel as if I’ve earned something nice. Since I’ve already breached the garlic barricades, I put loads of Sriracha in between the butter, gherkins and ham, and it reminds me of what I love about it: it’s hot, salty – saltier with the butter and ham – and makes a decent sandwich taste even more decent. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We dab it on the pig’s eyes until it looks like a grinning demon, and chuck it down the hatch</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>My friends say this is too safe. One produces a bag of Percy Pig sweets. “I tried to think of something truly horrible,” she says. So we dab it on the pig’s eyes until it looks like a grinning demon, and chuck it down the hatch. It tastes like vomit. “That is genuinely the worst thing I’ve ever tasted. I feel sick,” says another friend, who may not be a friend for much longer. I wonder if it’s too late to start the 5:2 diet today.

I dot the sauce all over it with a heavy heart, angry at every dollop. My mouth is annoyed at me for making it eat chilli all day. I start reading an article on my phone: ‘The molecule that tells you when you’ve used too much Sriracha.” I am probably not dying.</p> \n<p>But I am sick of Sriracha. I do not eat it again for two weeks.
