In my book, that makes it a great summer dinner dish, especially if served with a bright tomato salad (I’m not going to let <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/26/tomato-salad-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi\">Yotam have <em>all </em>the fun this week</a>). Follow that glorious plateful with an absurdly impressive yet oh-so-simple peach galette: and if it seems a bit thrown together, that’s largely because it has.</p> \n<h2><strong>Veal schnitzel with rainbow tomato salad</strong></h2> \n<p>Schnitzel is a real hit with children, though for them you might want to go easy on the chilli. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>4 veal escalopes (about 150g each)</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp plain flour</strong><br /><strong>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br /><strong>2 eggs, beaten</strong><br /><strong>8 tbsp panko breadcrumbs (or other breadcrumbs)</strong><br /><strong>Finely grated parmesan (optional)</strong><br /><strong>20g butter</strong></p> \n<p>For the salad<br /><strong>6 plum-sized tomatoes (a mix of colours ideally), cut into fat wedges</strong><br /><strong>1 big handful cherry tomatoes (again, a mix of colours), halved</strong><br /><strong>1 handful each fresh tarragon and mint leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 habanero or scotch bonnet chilli (or to taste), deseeded and finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; red onion, peeled and finely sliced</strong><br /><strong>A few pinches golden caster sugar</strong><br /><strong>Juice of 2 limes</strong><br /><strong>4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>Lay each piece of veal between two slices of greaseproof paper and bash out a bit with a rolling pin, to flatten and thin them. Season the flour generously and spread out on a large plate. Mix the breadcrumbs with the parmesan (if using) and spread out on another large plate. Beat the eggs in a large, shallow bowl.</p> \n<p>Toss each piece of veal in the flour, the egg and finally in the crumbs, then refrigerate for an hour or two (or overnight, if you want to get ahead) – this helps to set the crumbs.</p> \n<p>Half an hour before you want to eat, gently toss the tomatoes with the other salad ingredients (start with half a chilli and see how hot you want to go), and season generously. This will give the flavours time to mingle and the salad to come up to room temperature.</p> \n<p>Heat a heavy-based frying pan on a medium-high flame and add half the butter. Fry the veal in two batches until golden on the outside and cooked through – three to four minutes a side. Alternatively, fry the schnitzels ahead of time for a minute a side, until golden, and finish in a hot oven for 10 minutes just before you eat. Serve with the salad and perhaps quinoa or new potatoes tossed in chopped mint and butter.</p> \n<h2><strong>Peach, vanilla and basil galette</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2bb3153a-a90a-4fc5-a60d-e4a8300558df\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435140124273/0f292ad1-3686-4550-bb31-032b863da5c2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' peach, vanilla and basil galette\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ peach, vanilla and basil galette: absurdly impressive yet oh-so-simple.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johanna Parkin for the Guardian. Food styling: Maud Eden</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This stunning pudding is deceptively easy, because the rough, hotchpotch shape hides a multitude of sins. Simply throw together the quick pastry, assemble the pie and bake – you’ll be amazed by the result. Serves six.</p> \n<p>For the pastry<br /><strong>170g self-raising flour</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp caster sugar</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; tsp sea salt</strong><br /><strong>120g cold, unsalted butter cut into cubes</strong><br /><strong>4 tbsp ice-cold water</strong></p> \n<p>For the galette<br /><strong>8 basil leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>60g golden caster sugar, plus 1 tbsp extra</strong><br /><strong>Seeds scraped from &frac12; vanilla pod</strong><br /><strong>5 peaches, peeled, stoned and quartered</strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp ground almonds</strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tbsp plain flour</strong></p> \n<p>To finish<br /><strong>1 tbsp melted butter</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp granulated sugar</strong></p> \n<p>For the pastry, put the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor, and blitz briefly. Add the butter and pulse for a few moments, until the butter is only half incorporated – for gloriously flaky pastry, you need lumps of butter the size of small chickpeas. Add the cold water a tablespoon at a time, pulsing after each addition, until the mix begins to clump, then tip out on to a clean work surface and push together into a disc. Wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for at least an hour. Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Bash the basil in a pestle and mortar, then add the 60g caster sugar and vanilla seeds, and carry on bashing until you have what looks like green sugar. Transfer to a bowl, add the peaches, toss and set aside.</p> \n<p>Roll the pastry into a roughly 25cm circle and transfer to a baking sheet lined with baking paper. Mix the ground almonds, flour and remaining caster sugar, and sprinkle over the rolled-out dough, leaving a 3cm clear border around the edge. Pile the sugary basil and peach mix inside the borders of the pastry and bring up the sides of the pastry, crimping and folding them round the fruit. Brush the pastry with the melted butter, sprinkle over the granulated sugar and bake for 30 minutes, rotating the tart from time to time to ensure an even bake, until the pastry is golden and the fruit’s slightly coloured. Leave to cool slightly, and serve with cream or vanilla ice-cream.</p> \n<h2><strong>And for the rest of the week…</strong></h2> \n<p>Schnitzels always create a bit of a mess – the flour, egg and crumbs never go where they’re meant to – so I often make more and stash the extra schnitzels in the freezer. They’ll feel like a real gift when, tired and hungry, you remember them on a rushed Thursday night. Just defrost, and roast or fry. Tomato salad apart, schnitzel goes brilliantly with crushed new potatoes (oven-roast until crisp), or with avocado and lettuce salad, or boiled corn on the cob, or spinach puree. Make extra pastry, too, because that also freezes well. And if you have a surfeit of unripe peaches, worry not: they are really good sliced and tossed in sugar, olive oil, mint and a splash of wine vinegar.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of Mexican restaurants</a>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435139992169/Thomasina-Miers-veal-schn-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Thomasina Miers' veal schnitzel with rainbow tomato salad: a great summer dish.

When fruit is right, it’s wrong to play around with it. But with summer fruit season in full swing, I find myself (always an overzealous shopper when the fruit’s there and ripe) with a glut piled so high in the fruit bowl that every so often a peach will roll drunkenly out with a thud. At these times, there’s nothing for it but to make fruit tarts,; and put the bruised bounty to good use.</p> \n<h2><strong>Peach and black pepper frangipane tart</strong></h2> \n<p>Peach and almond are made for one another, but they can verge on cloying if a third ingredient doesn’t perk them up. Here, it’s black pepper that adds that spark – lending a little heat which, along with the brightness of the orange zest, sets the sweet frangipane and fruit into sharp relief.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6-8</strong><br /><strong>For the pastry</strong><br />135g plain flour<br />75g butter<br />50g ground almonds<br />30g caster sugar<br />A pinch of salt<br />1 large egg<br />Mascarpone, to serve</p> \n<p><br /><strong> For the filling</strong><br />75g unsalted butter, softened<br />50g caster sugar<br />50g runny honey<br />1&frac12; tsp vanilla extract<br />Zest of 1 orange<br />100g ground almonds<br />1 large egg, plus 1 large egg yolk<br />50g plain flour<br />1&frac12; tsp coarse black pepper, plus extra for sprinkling<br />&frac34; tsp baking powder<br />A generous pinch of salt<br />2-3 large peaches, skins left on, cut into slim segments</p> \n<p>1 Rub the flour and butter together in a large bowl. Keep working the ingredients using your fingertips until no visible chunks of butter remain. Stir in the ground almonds, caster sugar and salt. Whisk the egg lightly, then add half of it to the flour mixture, cutting it into the dry ingredients. Continue adding until the dough begins to form in clumps. You shouldn’t need more than &frac34; of the egg. Once all the flour has been moistened, press the dough into a ball, flatten slightly and wrap in clingfilm. Refrigerate for 20 minutes or so, during which time the dough will become less sticky.</p> \n<p>2 Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured work surface until it’s 26-27cm in diameter – big enough to line the base and sides of a 23cm-round tart or flan tin. You can also use a 20cm round loose-bottomed cake tin, if that’s all you have – just bake the filled tart for slightly longer to cook the slightly deeper filling. Line the tin with the pastry, prick all over the base with a fork and place in the fridge to chill for at least 30 minutes (this’ll reduce the risk of the pastry shrinking as it bakes). Meanwhile, set the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.</p> \n<p>3 Beat the butter and sugar together until light and creamy, then stir in the honey, vanilla extract, orange zest, ground almonds, egg and egg yolk. Combine the flour, pepper, baking powder and salt in a separate bowl before adding to the almond mixture and folding gently until smooth.</p> \n<p>4 Spoon the filling into the chilled pastry case, then arrange the peach slices neatly on top in concentric circles and grind plenty of black pepper on top. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven before reducing the temperature to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and cooking for a further 25 minutes. The pastry should be crisp, the filling slightly risen and springy, and the peaches perfectly tender. Leave the tart to cool to room temperature in its tin. Serve barely warm, with sweetened mascarpone.</p> \n<h2><strong>Strawberry vanilla custard tarts with pine nut crust</strong></h2> \n<p>The modest handful of pine nuts in this recipe round out what might otherwise have been an otherwise bland of a plain pastry case, while also making it richer, and crumblier, than ever.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Makes 6</strong><br /><strong>For the pastry</strong><br />60g pine nuts<br />150g plain flour<br />75g unsalted butter<br />40g caster sugar<br />30ml milk</p> \n<p><br /><strong> For the filling</strong><br />175ml milk<br />2 large yolks<br />50g caster sugar<br />2&frac12; tsp cornflour<br />2 tsp vanilla extract<br />50ml double cream<br />250g ripe strawberries<br />2-3 tbsp strawberry jam</p> \n<p>1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4, then roast the pine nuts for 7-10 minutes, checking them regularly, until they’ve darkened a shade and are beginning to look oily. Turn the oven off for the moment. Set aside 10g of the toasted nuts in a small bowl – you’ll use these to top the tarts later – and empty the bulk of the kernels into a food processor or coffee grinder. Pulse them until they’re finely ground, slightly greasy and starting to clump together.</p> \n<p>2 Put the flour in a large bowl and rub the ground pine nut mix into it with your fingers. Cube the butter and add it to the bowl, rubbing it into the dry ingredients until there are no visible chunks of butter left. Stir in the sugar, then add the milk, cutting it in until a dough forms in small clumps. If it’s too dry to hold together when you squeeze it, add a drop more milk. Gather the dough into a ball, pat it flat and wrap in clingfilm. Place in the fridge to chill for 20 minutes or so.</p> \n<p>3 Lightly dust the work surface and roll out the chilled pastry until it’s 3-5mm thick. Cut rounds out using a circular pastry cutter – one big enough to make circles of pastry to line the base and sides of the holes ofa standard muffin/cupcake tin. Gently press the pastry into the tin holes, taking care not to stretch it. Chill the lined tin in the fridge for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.</p> \n<p>4 Once the pastry cases have chilled, trim off any excess and line each with a small square of baking parchment (it can help to scrunch the parchment then smooth it out again before doing this, to help it mould to the contours of the pastry). Fill each parchment-lined tart with baking weights – whether the ceramic sort, or just makeshift ones such as dried chickpeas, rice or barley – and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove the weighted parchment parcels and return to the oven to cook for a further 5 minutes uncovered, then leave to cool.</p> \n<p>5 Heat the milk for the custard until scalding. While the milk warms, whisk the egg yolks, sugar, cornflour and vanilla extract together in a mixing bowl. Slowly pour the scalding milk into this yolk mixture, whisking constantly as you go. Decant the mixture back into the pan and set over a low heat. Stir the custard over the heat for 5 minutes or so, until it’s very thick and gloopy. Cover the surface with clingfilm to stop a skin forming, then leave to cool to room temperature. Beat the cooled custard to smooth it before adding the cream and whisking for a minute. The custard should hold soft peaks.</p> \n<p>6 Hull and halve the strawberries. Fill each tart case with a generous dollop of the custard, then top with the strawberry pieces – I find four half-strawberries per tart is about the right amount, clustered together into a dome shape. Warm the strawberry jam, strain it and brush a little over each of the tarts to glaze. Chop the remaining toasted pine nuts and sprinkle them over the tarts. Serve straight away.T</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435228754665/68ac0eda-a1f9-4c9b-9e5c-43427555669a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"A peach and almond tart with a twist of black pepper for piquancy, and the classic pairing of strawberry and vanilla in an extra-crumbly pine-nut tart case.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-27T04:59:06Z","lastModified":"2015-06-27T04:59:06Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":5,"contributors":[{"name":"Ruby Tandoh","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ruby-tandoh"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Baking","Life and style","Fruit"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/baking","webTitle":"Baking"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fruit","webTitle":"Fruit"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ruby Tandoh","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ruby-tandoh"}}],"series":{"title":"Ruby bakes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/ruby-bakes"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fruit-tart-recipes-peach-black-pepper-strawberry-vanilla-custard","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a5c2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fruit-tart-recipes-peach-black-pepper-strawberry-vanilla-custard","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fruit-tart-recipes-peach-black-pepper-strawberry-vanilla-custard"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435228710181/d9af8e4d-669f-4522-9723-b41d06ddad6b-2060x1247.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1247,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A peach and almond tart with a twist of black pepper for piquancy, and the classic pairing of strawberry and vanilla in an extra-crumbly pine-nut tart case.

If the question draws a blank, it’s a dead giveaway as to a person’s age, while the question itself often reveals much about someone’s interests and passions.</p> \n<p>For example, “Where were you when you had your first tomato moment?” “My <em>what</em> moment?” would be most people’s reply to that, but some obsessives will have a shortlist of their top five tomato moments, all waiting to be shared. They’re also likely to have a shot of some mixed chopped tomatoes as their phone screensaver (or is that just me?), or to entice us to open an Instagram image by giving it the tagline “Hello, sexy” – only to reveal a single heirloom tomato in <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/3v3bOWsSWy/\">its full, naked, perfect glory</a>.</p> \n<p>I’ve had many such moments of my own: sublimely sweet cherry tomatoes, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/04/dakos-onepot-chicken-recipes-ottolenghi\">chopped and piled high on dakos biscuits</a>, the Cretan barley rusk for which I fell so heavily a year or two back; a spectacular tomato and pomegranate salad at <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/istanbul/restaurants/fast-food/hamdi-restaurant\">Hamdi</a>, a kebab restaurant near Istanbul’s spice bazaar. My most memorable moment, however, came while hiking in the Italian coastal region of Liguria a few years ago. In the village of Manarola, we came across a patch of tomato vines heavy with intensely ripe, wonkily shaped, unevenly red and perfectly warmed fruit: the temptation to reach out was just too great, and the taste was unimprovable.</p> \n<p>These holiday experiences can be hard to replicate at home. Meals are savoured, phones get forgotten for large chunks of the day, actual conversation takes place, books get read. The holiday over, depsite all our good intentions to build these life-affirming habits back into our day-to-day lives, it’s all too easy to revert back to the habitual phone-checking, the box set and the meals eaten on the run.</p> \n<p>And so it is with tomatoes: the difference between those we’d happily feast on for breakfast, lunch and dinner while abroad, and what often passes for a tomato back home can be enormous. But if you shop wisely (and these days there’s a much bigger range on offer, in both local greengrocers and larger supermarkets), you can come pretty close to those holiday memories. Fill that basket with as many different varieties, sizes and colours as you can: orange Sungold cherry tomatoes, large ridged Brandywines, green, striped, you name it. When you get them home, keep that holiday sun in mind and don’t put them in the fridge: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2002/jul/06/foodanddrink.shopping1\">this dulls their fragrance and flavour</a>. And if you can, put your tomatoes out in the sun for a few hours before turning them into a salad: it makes a remarkable difference to the taste.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tomato, rhubarb and elderflower salad</strong></h2> \n<p>This salad is all about the quality and range of the tomatoes involved, so make an effort to get hold of as many different kinds, colours and sizes as you can, making sure they are all good and ripe. Elderflower is still just in season, so if you have any nearby, do go out and pick some: it makes the finished dish look even more stunning. I’ve kept this dairy-free, but it also works very well with some soft goat’s cheese dotted on top. With thanks to Esme Robinson. Serves six to eight.</p> \n<p><strong>2 tbsp elderflower cordial</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>4 tsp cider vinegar</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp Dijon mustard</strong><br /><strong>1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>160g rhubarb (1-2 sticks; pink, ideally)</strong><br /><strong>1.4kg mixed tomatoes, large ones cut into 0.5cm rounds, medium ones into 0.5cm-wide wedges, cherries halved</strong><br /><strong>5g fresh oregano leaves</strong><br /><strong>1 handful fresh elderflowers (optional)</strong></p> \n<p>Put the first five ingredients in a bowl with a half-teaspoon of salt and whisk. Cut the rhubarb on an angle into 2mm-thick slices, add to the bowl and leave to marinate for 30 minutes. Arrange the tomatoes on a platter and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Spoon over the rhubarb and dressing, scatter the oregano on top, and finish with elderflowers, if using.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tomato salad with horseradish cream</strong></h2> \n<p>This has quite a lot of horseradish, which I find works really well with the cream and the acidity of the tomatoes. If you don’t like the intensity, just use less. Serves six as a side dish or first course.</p> \n<p><strong>30g finely grated fresh horseradish (or 40g shop-bought horseradish sauce)</strong><br /><strong>1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tsp white-wine vinegar</strong><br /><strong>Coarse sea salt </strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>100ml double cream</strong><br /><strong>10g tarragon leaves, torn</strong><br /><strong>15g basil leaves, roughly shredded</strong><br /><strong>900g red tomatoes (a mixture of types and sizes, ideally), cut into 5mm-thick slices</strong></p> \n<p>In a medium bowl, whisk the horseradish with the garlic, vinegar, half a teaspoon of salt, a tablespoon of the oil and two tablespoons of cold water. Pour in the cream, whisking all the while, until you have a uniform, runny sauce (don’t over-whip: you don’t want the sauce to thicken), then stir through the tarragon and two-thirds of the basil.</p> \n<p>To serve, spread the horseradish cream on the bottom of six shallow bowls and top with the tomatoes, making sure to leave some of the cream visible underneath. Drizzle over the remaining oil, and add a sprinkle of basil and a pinch of salt.</p> \n<h2><strong>Chopped salad with tahini and za’atar</strong></h2> \n<p>The addition of tahini paste to a familiar tomato and cucumber salad is a revelation. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>6 ripe plum tomatoes, cut into 1cm dice</strong><br /><strong>2 mini-cucumbers, trimmed and cut into 1cm dice</strong><br /><strong>1 red pepper, seeds, stalk and pith removed, cut into 1cm dice</strong><br /><strong>5 spring onions, trimmed and thinly sliced on an angle</strong><br /><strong>15g coriander leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp lemon juice</strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>200g feta, cut into 4 rectangular blocks (optional)</strong><br /><strong>4 tbsp tahini</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp za’atar</strong></p> \n<p>Put the chopped tomatoes in a sieve over a bowl for 20 minutes. Discard the resulting juice and put the tomatoes, cucumbers, pepper, spring onions and coriander in a large bowl. Add the lemon juice, oil and half a teaspoon of salt, and stir gently to combine.</p> \n<p>To serve, arrange the feta (if using) on four plates and spoon the salad on top, making sure some of the feta remains visible. Pour a spoonful of tahini over each portion and finish with a sprinkle of za’atar.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tomato and mozzarella salad with buckwheat and curry leaves</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1deaa196-30b2-4fbd-a937-e59753801cd0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435140471804/2d63c69c-f3e2-41ea-824f-6cdb83482c17-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi's tomato and mozzarella salad with buckwheat and curry leaves\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s tomato and mozzarella salad with buckwheat and curry leaves: a novel twist on the classic tomato, mozzarella and basil template.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johanna Parkin for the Guardian. Food styling: Maud Eden</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Buckwheat is one of my favourite ingredients: I love its earthy, slightly nutty and smoky notes, and the welcome crunch it lends to any dish. Just leave it out if it’s not to your taste: the dish works well without it. I have to thank my friend <a href=\"http://www.peter-gordon.net/\">Peter Gordon</a> for the unusual flavour combination here. Serves six, as a first course.</p> \n<p><strong>1 large banana shallot, peeled and cut into thin, 2mm-thick rounds </strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp Pedro Xim&eacute;nez (or other sweet sherry) vinegar</strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>600g tomatoes (as wide a range as you can get – the more colours, shapes and sizes, the better)</strong><br /><strong>40 fresh curry leaves (ie, from about 3 stems) </strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tsp black mustard seeds</strong><br /><strong>25g kasha (aka roasted buckwheat; optional)</strong><br /><strong>450g buffalo mozzarella, torn into six </strong></p> \n<p>Put the shallots in a large bowl with the vinegar, a tablespoon of oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and set aside to steep for at least 30 minutes. Cut the larger tomatoes into 1cm wedges and smaller ones into halves or quarters – you’re aiming for tomato pieces of a roughly uniform size.</p> \n<p>Put a small saucepan on a medium heat and add the remaining oil. Once hot, tip in the curry leaves and mustard seeds, and fry for just a minute. Stir quickly, remove the pan from the heat and set aside to infuse and cool. Once cooled, pour the spiced oil over the onions, then mix into the tomatoes with another quarter-teaspoon of salt and half the kasha, if using.</p> \n<p>To serve, put a piece of mozzarella on each plate, spoon the tomato mixture on top and finish with the remaining kasha.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk\">Ottolenghi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nopi-restaurant.com\">Nopi</a> in London.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435140311122/Yotam-Ottolenghis-tomato--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Yotam Ottolenghi's tomato, rhubarb and elderflower salad: It's all about the quality of the tomatoes.

No prizes for guessing which one our critic prefers</p>","byline":"Marina O'Loughlin","body":"<p>This is a tale of two pubs. On the surface, very similar: both deep in the chocolate-box depths of the Kentish countryside, a landscape dotted with thatches, weathered brick and wonky, mullioned windows, where fat bumblebees drone and the air is fragranced with freshly-cut grass. Both in historic buildings, both aiming to provide more than the basic country pub beer and scratchings. But they couldn’t be more different if they tried.</p> \n<p>The first, <a href=\"http://thedukewilliamickham.com\">the Duke William in Ickham</a>, comes from a big-name chef. <a href=\"http://www.marksargeant.net\">Mark Sargeant</a> is ex-Ramsay and, like so many of the sweary one’s alumni, has set about empire building. Sticking to his Kentish roots, here he is with his own local: the fantasy gig for many a man <em>d’un certain &acirc;ge</em>. It’s been Farrow &amp; Balled to within an inch of its life, dark grey cocoons the interior, fur throws are scattered over wooden settles, there are numerous “quirky” touches (filament lightbulbs, decorative trays, mini Etch-a-Sketches).</p> \n<p>Over two visits, we make major inroads into the menu, from sausage rolls to ice-cream. It’s all… OK. That’s about as excited as I can get about lamb neck curry served with a dome of plain rice and a vague aura of <a href=\"http://www.curry-recipes.co.uk/imagehost/pics/288f7ede0bdf03d61ab6b5923d36c77d.jpg\">Vesta</a>. Or roast beef, served in a steak-like slab and defiantly repelling the knife. P&acirc;t&eacute;, with a milky disc of fat on top, chicken livers granular with a backnote of bitterness. Potted Dungeness shrimp, the butter properly softened, have an offputting metallic quality, though that might be me grinding my fillings at the &pound;10.50 price-tag. Local “heritage” tomatoes are plonked on commercial-tasting not-very-sourdough with <a href=\"http://www.goldencrosscheese.co.uk\">Golden Cross goat’s cheese</a>, no oil, butter or dressing to add lubrication or allure. Fish pie is heavy on potato, light on fish, its white sauce watery. There’s a “tankered” (sic) of prawns. Chips – decent, homemade – come in a bloody flowerpot.</p> \n<p>Staff are friendly, and remember us when we visit again, possibly because the first time they chased us out into the street for not paying (we had, obviously). But the training isn’t there: they bring malbec (red) instead of macabeo (white); finished plates are left uncleared; when none of the billed vanilla ice-cream arrives with a pedestrian apple crumble, we get a shrug and, “The kitchen is really busy.” Erm, we’re the only people in the dining area.</p> \n<p>You know what? It’s good enough – if you got this at a random pitstop, you’d be mildly chuffed – but from a “name” chef, you expect more. It’s clear, with its curry nights and steak nights, that the brief for the Duke William is “proper community pub”. Problem is, no number of Kentish Gypsy tarts or guest ales will make me believe that for a moment.</p> \n<p>Our other pub comes unburdened by names or makeovers. Down the road in less picturesque Crundale is <a href=\"http://www.thecompassescrundale.co.uk\">The Compasses</a>, an 18th-century hostelry with none of ye olde English attitude you expect from that heritage. You brave some extremely free-range chickens to enter, there are garlands of hops and an inglenook fireplace, but the mood is workmanlike, not twee. Rob Taylor runs it with his wife, Donna; he’s alone in the kitchen. His food is warming, like a hug: pasties stuffed with lamb and onion, perfect for dunking in homemade mushroom ketchup. Ox cheek, slow-cooked until spoonable, comes with a dollop of mustard-laced clotted cream, its richness pooling over the meat; crisp shallots add texture. Garnet-coloured wild pigeon breasts with sharp rhubarb and a bonbon of deep-fried black pudding. Local crab wrapped in supple, homemade cannelloni sit in a rich seafood bisque. Vegetables are given starring roles in the likes of a salt-baked celeriac dish, the root rendered sultry and languid, reclining in a pool of roast garlic cream. Spuds are basted in dripping while they roast into fudgy perfection. Brioche bread-and-butter pudding with marmalade custard delivers purest, sticky pleasure.</p> \n<p>One boozer is jazz-handsing and tap-dancing as a sleight away from its ordinariness. (Sargeant has told the trade press that <a href=\"http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Venues/Mark-Sargeant-pub-preview\">he has “no plan to chase accolades”</a> here. Just as well, eh?) The other is quietly going about its business of being genuinely excellent – it reminds me of the early days of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/26/the-sportsman-seasalter-restaurant-review\">the Sportsman in Seasalter</a>.

This would cut through the sweetness of the pork. Cinnamon in tomato sauce was something that I picked up at the River Cafe. Just a touch of it to pique the interest of the diner, but which doesn’t take centre stage.</p> \n<p><strong>I’d bypass the appetizers, </strong>but go to town on the pudding. I’d have a dessert trolley with banoffee pie, hazelnut ice‑cream and strawberry tarts, glazed on top with creme patissiere underneath the fruit.</p> \n<p><strong>I don’t really eat chocolate desserts, </strong>but I love commercial chocolate bars. I might throw a Dairy Milk at perfect temperature into the mix – not too cold, not too soft. Just melting and creamy.</p> \n<p><strong>I’m a control freak, </strong>so I’d probably want to cook it myself. It would start in the late afternoon so we could sleep in.

My heart still beats painfully fast at the recollection of the tourti&egrave;re, a pie stuffed with more meat than an abattoir and glazed with maple syrup; cretons studded with boudin noir and sweetbreads; souffl&eacute; omelette stuffed with a whole lobster; and <em>tire sur la neige</em> – freshly tapped syrup poured over snow until it toffees. It is gasp-making, once-in-a-lifetime excessive. Gabrielle Rivard-Hiller, the p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re at the restaurant, posted these beautiful dumplings.

Without Kickstarter, Crowdfunder, Crowdcube et al, the innovative schemes of countless chefs, restaurateurs and culinary inventors would have withered and died on the carpet tiles of a bank-manager’s office. But for every piece of culinary brilliance they’ve gifted us, there are the brain farts. The monkey tennis. The ones you wouldn’t waste the back of your fag packet on. Essentially, it’s like a global Britain’s Got Talent of food-based ideas, only some of them are good. Here’s our guide to the most weird and wonderful offerings out there right now.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/332642838/its-not-a-bread-knife-its-the-sandwich-knife\"><strong>The sandwich knife</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfc39cbd13e7b0e07f590d22b7edbd458531f160\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435155757371/35c93e4d-c71a-4d26-ba46-f4ed401ba32d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sandwich knife\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sandwich knife. Of course.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“It’s not a bread knife, it’s a sandwich knife,” claims the Kickstarter page for this product from Toronto. We’re looking at a serrated, two-bladed knife that uses one motion to slice two pieces of bread. According to the promo video, its USP is its “parallel and vertically offset blade configuration”. Or, as we might think of it, “the way it glues two bread knives together and tries to flog them to credulous chumps”.</p> \n<p><strong>Will it hit its target?</strong> Its goal is C$22,500 (&pound;11,600); with just hours to go, it has raised C$6,586. Will enough people consider saving the hassle of slicing twice to be worth C$25? I’d guess no.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/clear-coffee#/story\"><strong>Clear coffee</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3a4a422068b9902138aa172b1be7011ad7d824b6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435155912377/77ae4df9-dbd2-41e5-b12d-af976b48387a-366x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Clear coffee\" width=\"366\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tastes better than it looks, apparently.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Do we need coffee that looks like petrol? Entrepreneurs in the Slovakian city of Košice want to launch a see-through coffee, the main purpose of which is to “not negatively affect the whiteness of your teeth”. Actually, this isn’t a terrible idea, and judging by the promo video of it being taste-tested by random people on the street, it has exciting possibilities. Their lack of any scientific explanation is a worry, though.</p> \n<p><strong>Will it hit its target? </strong>I wouldn’t bet on it. It has taken 30 days to raise €327 (&pound;233) – 1% of the €35,000 required – with 24 days left to go.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dausage/the-dausage-a-cross-between-a-sausage-and-a-doughn\"><strong>The Dausage</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4cae79ab5512a3369bb530fbe716e7ad16b806c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435156018216/f093c7db-f43a-47b2-b669-f712ab45bbe0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Dausage\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jam plus sausage equals Dausage.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“A cross between a sausage and a doughnut,” excitedly exclaim the people behind this Welsh startup, attempting to muscle in on the cronut craze of years gone by. “There are no finer foods in the world than sausages and doughnuts, but they seldom appear together,” point out the would-be purveyors of the jam-filled meat tubes. The photos look grisly, with a botched-home-vasectomy aesthetic. The video shows jam oozing out as someone off-camera slits the sausage’s top end.
