It is most closely associated with Liguria, in the north-west of the country, where it bears little resemblance to the soft, finely textured stuff sold in many British supermarkets. Fortunately for fans of the authentic product’s rich, chewy texture and crisp, salty crust, it’s very easy to make at home.</p> \n<h2>The flour</h2> \n<p>Your choice of flour depends very much on what kind of focaccia you’re after. Using plain flour, as in <a href=\"http://www.cookstr.com/recipes/focaccia-with-onions-genoese-style\">Marcella Hazan’s Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking</a>, or even finer “tipo 00” flour as in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/River-Cafe-Classic-Italian-Cookbook/dp/0718153499\">The River Cafe Classic Italian Cookbook</a>, will give you a softer, more tender crumb; while <a href=\"http://lovinghomemade.com/2013/04/25/homemade-focaccia-great-for-sharing/\">Richard Bertinet’s mixture</a> of strong bread flour and coarse semolina in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dough-Richard-Bertinet/dp/1856267628\">his book Dough</a> creates a more robust, chewy texture.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d8ac8676de9148b327d62dcf87d26d2aace0523\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543585407/cd870eee-fd35-4c74-b613-4aceaec86670-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Marcella Hazan's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcella Hazan’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"http://kitcheninthesand.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/basic-focaccia-locatellis-foolproof.html\">Giorgio Locatelli</a>’s book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Made-Italy-Stories-Giorgio-Locatelli/dp/1841157023\">Made in Italy explains</a> that, in his restaurant, they use “Italian extra-strong flour, which has a good elasticity and the power to absorb water well”. As it isn’t widely available in this country, he recommends using equal parts strong bread flour and 00 for a similar result, and I agree – his loaf does have a pleasingly springy texture without being quite as stiff as those that use strong flour alone.</p> \n<p>Angela Hartnett* is among that number, but her recipe begins with a <em>biga</em>, or starter, which requires a 24-hour fermentation before use. Her bread has a wonderful chewiness and excellent flavour – almost more like a ciabatta than the focaccia I’m used to – but I’m looking for a loaf that can be made fairly quickly and easily, which rules this step out. If you’re intrigued, however, the recipe from her book Cucina <a href=\"https://suite.io/rebecca-ford/acv2ar\">can be found here</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"700c98da26d0b5f0f52bbf452ed8e72e5e9727ec\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543639835/50ea4806-5888-46c0-b263-ddf248bf5bae-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Richard Bertinet's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Bertinet’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Though I’m not going to put semolina flour in the bread itself, I do like the crunch it lends Bertinet’s version, so I will be dusting the baking tray with it, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/sep/08/how-to-cook-perfect-pizza\">as I do when making pizza</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>*</strong><em>Those surprised by the impressively browned crust on Angela’s focaccia should note that it had an accidental second baking after I left it in a cooling oven overnight, and then forgot to take it out when heating the oven the next day.

If you’d like to use fresh yeast instead of the fast-acting variety that I use, substitute 25g, or 12g of ordinary dried yeast, made up as per packet instructions.</p> \n<h2>The liquid</h2> \n<p>All focaccia contains olive oil, from a mere 2 tbsp in Hazan’s recipe to 150ml in the River Cafe version. As well as keeping the dough moist, the oil gives the bread its rich flavour, but I suspect the large quantity is also responsible for the slightly soft crust of the River Cafe loaf, so I’m going to reduce the amount slightly.</p> \n<p>The principal liquid, however – as in any bread – is water, and lots of it; Hartnett warns the novice baker not to be afraid of adding too much: “It can never be too wet – just trust me on this – it will come together. Too much flour and you end up with something resembling a doorstop.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84c867fbcf82fa4cc4a4ec431613e47da2bd57a2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543485352/3205d26b-b56a-43ce-baa6-0f94c0bb365f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The River Cafe's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The River Cafe’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She’s right. The drier doughs are indeed denser and heavier, and it’s almost safest – given the difficulties of precision when it comes to hydration, which depends on any number of things from the flour you use to the humidity of the day you bake – to be as vague as the River Cafe, which simply instructs one to add enough water to make a “very soft and pliable dough”. Thus the figure below should simply be taken as a guide. As in Hazan’s recipe, add the liquid in stages until you have a soft but workable dough.</p> \n<h2>The method</h2> \n<p>Perhaps it’s the temperature of my kitchen in comparison to that of a professional one, but I don’t find the short rising time in Locatelli’s recipe sufficient to allow the dough to double in size (which is another argument for using the instructions below as a guideline only – exactly how long everything takes will depend on the circumstances in which you make it), and making sure the dough has time to rise properly will ensure a structurally satisfactory result with plenty of air pockets.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d86e3f2e5d7e4ee81b71e676c3d9df5fd3f9f3dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543696856/ab2dd7f2-bafc-43e2-ac1d-3ebd199579d8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Giorgio Locatelli's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giorgio Locatelli’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s easiest to knead wet doughs like this in a food mixer, but if you don’t have one, oil your work surface rather than flouring it, so that you don’t add any more dry ingredients to the mix.</p> \n<p>That said, Locatelli’s bread boasts the best examples of those “dimples” that are such a characteristic feature of the focaccia – I think because his are made directly before baking, as opposed to before the second proof.</p> \n<h2>The baking</h2> \n<p>As with all breads, a very hot oven gives the best results – and baking it on a hot pizza stone or sheet, as Hartnett and Hazan suggest, will give your bread a pleasingly crisp bottom. Spraying a little water into the hot oven to create steam, as the former also recommends, will also help to create a decent crust.</p> \n<h2>The brine</h2> \n<p>Locatelli and others pour a mixture of oil, water and salt on top of their loaves before baking, which, as the River Cafe observes, may seem strange “but the water helps to keep the dough soft and moist in some of the grooves”. Be careful not to overdo it, though, or the loaf won’t brown on top. And don’t feel the need to overload it with salt, either: a mere teaspoon should be quite sufficient given how much there is in the dough.</p> \n<p>Do feel free to add herbs (rosemary sprigs are nice), olives, tomatoes, and so on. And, if you’re feeling really adventurous, the River Cafe even does a dessert version with black grapes and fennel seeds. Personally, I’d draw the line at <a href=\"http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/30955/salted-caramel-and-apple-focaccia\">this salted-caramel version</a>, but each to their own.</p> \n<h2>The perfect focaccia</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d20f84446ee76b10f6d30fda6acca7d93c3ea95b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543810111/93d60cdd-269b-442c-a461-64fb77ae19dc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake's perfect focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake’s perfect focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong><em>(Makes one large loaf)</em></strong></p> \n<p><strong>375g strong white bread flour</strong><br /><strong>375g “tipo 00” flour (sometimes sold as pasta flour)</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp fine sea salt</strong><br /><strong>8g active dry yeast</strong><br /><strong>130ml extra-virgin olive oil (100ml for the dough; 30ml for the topping, mixed with 30ml water and 1 tsp salt flakes)</strong><br /><strong>Water</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp coarse semolina or cornmeal (optional)</strong></p> \n<p>Put the flours in a large mixing bowl with the salt and yeast. Whisk well to combine, then make a hole in the middle and add 100ml olive oil, plus 300ml water. Stir together and add more water (I used about 100ml more) until you have a very soft, but not too sticky, dough.</p> \n<p>Knead until soft and elastic; in a food mixer (preferable) on a medium-slow speed for about 7 minutes, or by hand on a lightly oiled work surface for 10-12 minutes. Put the dough on a lightly oiled rimless baking sheet and leave to rise in a draught-free place for 60-90 minutes until roughly doubled in size.</p> \n<p>Knock back the dough, and lightly dust the baking tray with the semolina, if using. Gently press the dough out with your fingers to fit the baking tray. Brush with olive oil and leave to rise again for about another hour, or until doubled in size again. When this time has nearly elapsed, heat the oven to 220C and put a pizza stone or baking tray in there to heat up. If you have a water spray, ready it.</p> \n<p>Whisk together the remaining 30ml olive oil with 30ml water until emulsified. Transfer the dough to you pizza stone or baking tray and poke dimples into the surface of the focaccia with your fingertips. Pour the oil-and-water mixture on top and scatter with the salt flakes, then place in the oven and squirt a little water into the base of the oven. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until golden on top – keep an eye on it.

The UK market is now worth &pound;3bn annually and, increasingly, it is no longer McDonald’s and Burger King that define our idea of the perfect patty. Borne aloft by the rise of “dude food”, a new wave of gourmet bun slingers has turned this once humble sandwich into an object of reverence. The food geeks who used to obsess over the detail of fine dining are now queueing to get into hip burger joints such as MeatLiquor, Almost Famous, Dirty Burger or Patty &amp; Bun. Online, the debate rages about fat-to-lean mince ratios and what precise blend of chuck or rump steak, brisket or short-rib meat you should use, to produce the ultimate burger. That scrutiny has led the supermarkets to up their game, but the expansion of their chilled, premium burger ranges is also being fuelled by a booming demand for barbecue food. In the late 1990s, Britain held about 10m barbecues each year. Today, remarkably, that figure has risen to an estimated 120m.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/may/14/supermarket-lagers-best-worst-taste-test-bottles\">Supermarket lagers: the best and worst – taste test</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But do any of these supermarket burgers match the beefy clout of the best restaurant patties?

Just another day at the office, then. My crime that day was to have said during an episode of <em>MasterChef</em> that a dessert “looked like the sort of thing served at a cheap wedding full of regret held at a hotel on a ring road”. My correspondent’s stepdaughter had apparently just got married at a ring road hotel and it had been lovely. “I’m sure it was,” I replied, “but was it also full of regret? Because if it wasn’t, it isn’t covered by my critique.” I may be a snob, but I’m a precise snob.</p> \n<p>The touchiness shouldn’t have surprised me. When it comes to food at weddings people are like that. A wedding is one of life’s great set piece events, upon which the compass flickers. Accordingly everything about them must be perfect, even when everything plainly isn’t. And now it’s June, and wedding season is upon us. For the next few months many of us will be putting on suits and frocks smelling of dry cleaning fluid, and tramping into baggy marquees where we will eat some of the worst, most overpriced food ever inflicted upon us by people who claim to be our dearest friends. And then, regardless of how dismal it all was, we will loudly proclaim the opposite. In the coming months more lies will be told about the quality of lunch and dinner than in the rest of the year put together.</p> \n<p>We are meant to be experiencing a British food revolution, and in many ways we are. There are better restaurants than ever before. But in the business of mass catering we are generally awful. I say generally. Obviously, if you run a catering firm and you’re limbering up to complain, I don’t mean you. You’re brilliant. Likewise, the food at your wedding was obviously fabulous. It’s everyone else.</p> \n<p>Everyone else is responsible for dry canap&eacute;s that taste only of margarine and complacency. Everyone else is responsible for desiccated lumps of yesterday’s pre-cooked chicken the colour of an old stained sink; for sauces that could creosote fences and vegetables so overboiled you could suck them through a straw; for cream desserts that have split, and overbaked tarts with pastry like walnut shells. And the cost! I only use exclamation marks for shouting, which is what I’m doing. THE COST! Despite economies of scale, caterers charge more for this dismal crud than the price of a quality restaurant meal and rising. Why are they allowed to get away with it?</p> \n<p>Precisely because it’s a special event, and nobody likes to admit one of those isn’t actually that special. Plus, avoiding the pitfalls of mass catering dreariness requires a certain radicalism: the willingness to do away with the awful formally plated main course, to sack the poor exploited teenage waitresses and instead concentrate spend on the cooking. The problem is that weddings generally involve young people and for all their youthful irreverence, young people can be rather “small c” conservative. A wedding is a grown-up event, and they have a mythologised notion of what grown-up looks like, which includes a marquee and chicken the colour of a stained sink.</p> \n<p>Recently the savings expert Martin Lewis’s <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/cheaper-weddings\">website </a>said that, when booking a wedding reception at a hotel, tell them it’s for a party rather than for nuptials. Apparently hotels charge more the moment they hear it’s a wedding. This is good advice. It won’t stop the food being crap, but at least it won’t cost you as much.</p> \n<p><em>Tell us about your wedding-day catering disasters and triumphs below</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037088538/8ce08c37-1c1b-4a4a-8303-4d2a79721723-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.'","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T13:30:07Z","lastModified":"2015-06-16T13:30:07Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":350,"contributors":[{"name":"Jay Rayner","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733739943/JayRayner.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jayrayner"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Weddings","Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/weddings","webTitle":"Weddings"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jay Rayner","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jayrayner"}}],"series":{"title":"Happy eater","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/happy-eater"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/wedding-season-crimes-against-food-jay-rayner","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49kzy","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/wedding-season-crimes-against-food-jay-rayner","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/wedding-season-crimes-against-food-jay-rayner"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037088538/8ce08c37-1c1b-4a4a-8303-4d2a79721723-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.’ Photograph: Alamy","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.'","cleanCaption":"‘The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}},"importance":4,"byline":{"title":"Jay Rayner"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037088538/8ce08c37-1c1b-4a4a-8303-4d2a79721723-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.'","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}}]},{"title":"Nigel Slater's midweek dinner / Baked tomatoes and chorizo","rawTitle":"Baked tomatoes and chorizo","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/nigel-slater-baked-tomatoes-and-chorizo-recipe","title":"Nigel Slater’s baked tomatoes and chorizo recipe","trailText":"A delicious combination of sausages and tomatoes, their juices mingled in the oven","standFirst":"<p>A delicious combination of sausages and tomatoes, their juices mingled in the oven</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<h2>The recipe</h2> \n<p>Place six large tomatoes snugly in&nbsp;a&nbsp;roasting tin.

Meal for two, including drinks and service: &pound;120</strong></p> \n<p>How can an entire street corner lose its way? How can it simply stop being a place anyone wants to visit and become instead the subject only of deep sighs and shrugs? For decades the corner of Leicester and Lisle Streets on the southern edge of London’s Chinatown was definitely a place people frequented – until they didn’t. It was occupied by a legendary fish restaurant called Manzi’s, with gingham tablecloths and swollen plaits of bread made of plastic hanging over the bar. You went there for oysters and Dover sole, and for Italian waiters straight out of central casting. They did stewed eels with mash, and something worrying called curried halibut and a strawberry tart everyone swore by. Manzi’s was a great London restaurant when the city didn’t have enough of them.</p> \n<p>In 2007 it went dark. London no longer thought it needed Manzi’s. Perhaps it didn’t. The building was sold to Fergus Henderson and Trevor Gulliver of Clerkenwell’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/14/foodanddrink.restaurants\">St John</a>, who took a long time converting it into a boutique hotel. It had their customary white abattoir chic, and a restaurant that grilled the inner valves and ducts of animals and did fabulous bronzed pies that scared diners from Surrey. But not enough people wanted to sleep in a room that looked like somewhere you could butcher a pig, or eat great pies and valves and ducts, however brilliantly bronzed and grilled, and the cost of delayed renovation meant they were always playing financial catch-up.</p> \n<p>It was sold to the Singapore-based hotel group behind the <a href=\"http://townhallhotel.com/home\">Town Hall Hotel</a> in Bethnal Green. They softened the whiteness of the dining room by adding gunmetal grey panelling, and kept the St John-style menu under the same chef, Tom Harris, but still no one really wanted to come, despite the food being very good. I like a grilled duct, me. So now it has been sold on again to become Leicester House with yet another restaurant, this time serving “French Vietnamese” food. And I’m afraid I’m still not convinced anyone will have much of a need to come to this London street corner. Or, if they do, it will be because they don’t know any better.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0bd559a8e2989264db6b134fcee767184ce6427\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433934332997/90f2e994-2a52-4dc0-9afa-f76a26eade05-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'The latest annoying piece of menu cobblers': bone broth.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The latest annoying piece of menu cobblers’: bone broth.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Think of this review as a companion to last week’s, where I scratched my head over Alan Yau’s glossy take on the eclectic Chinatown Chinese restaurant and then concluded it provided an interesting one-stop shop. This one sits on the other edge of Chinatown, offering something nobody needs: a limp, vapid, emasculated take on the Vietnamese repertoire. Somewhere in this hotel, perhaps locked away in a safe, must lie the testicles of an entire culinary tradition. It is Vietnamese food for people who wouldn’t like real Vietnamese food, and who want to drink cloudy “natural” prosecco while not eating it. There are warning signs: the place settings of heavy-handled knives and forks, rather than chopsticks which are never offered; the lack of chilli sauces on the tables, or any sauces at all for that matter.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the very notion should have been enough to sound the alarms. Vietnamese food has been strongly influenced by French colonialism, hence the famed b&aacute;nh m&igrave;, a baguette sandwich, only using a lighter bread than found in the occupying homeland. The idea of French Vietnamese food feels tautological. Then you see the menu. They’ve put duck liver parfait in with the dry pork belly in their b&aacute;nh m&igrave;, made with a heavy loaf, to produce something dense and cloying. They’ve also added a very short cheese and charcuterie list. Including Italian ham. I’m sorry, but now you’ve lost me.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3ec6bba2872c0726d8b3f08f443f3a390789815\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433934583679/a7b391f0-6013-423a-b2fc-d75d0421a757-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'Big tiger prawns under a deep leaf fall of fresh green herbs and crushed peanuts.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Big tiger prawns under a deep leaf fall of fresh green herbs and crushed peanuts.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The problem here is not clumsiness. They do a fair job of grilling some big tiger prawns and then offer them up under a deep leaf fall of fresh green herbs and crushed peanuts. A salad of blackened squid definitely contains squid that has been blackened. Taken alone, these dishes, and others like them, are fine without being enlivening or astonishing. But taken together it becomes a dull parade. It is all one note, a whack of sugar and salt and absolutely no fire and spice. Smoked ribs are long braised, not very smoky and again taste of sugar and salt. Some of the pricing is odd. A sizable portion of the ribs is &pound;7.50. One limp, boned-out quail is &pound;16.50. The latter is advertised as coming with salt, lime and ginger, which sounds fresh and thrilling. If only. Green papaya, daikon and cashew slaw is crunchy enough if underpowered. Steamed ong choi with fried garlic is very salty. Where is the intensity, the brazenness?</p> \n<p>Naturally, being a hip new London restaurant, they serve a “bone broth”, which is the latest annoying piece of menu cobblers. It’s a roasted bone-based stock, simmered for 12 hours. Or stock, as it’s known, but you try flogging a bowl of that for big money. (Lots of chefs, who have no medical training and who gained their nutritional knowledge from scrolling through Reddit, love making health claims for bone broth. Unsurprisingly they don’t stand up to examination. For example, ingesting collagen that’s been cooked for 12 hours will not prove beneficial for bone growth, however much you close your eyes and whisper, “I wish, I wish, I wish.”) The bone broth here, with strands of long-braised pork collar and tightly bound crab wonton, is actually the best hit of the salt and sweet on the menu, but &pound;12.50 is an awful lot to pay for a bowl of stock with stuff in it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3820a5a72308bc1969ff83598666beff60b7035\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433935008628/23ede46c-d430-4d86-ac38-e45f2f22225f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'What depresses me most is some people might think this represents Vietnamese food': salt-baked pineapple.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘What depresses me most is some people might think this represents Vietnamese food’: salt-baked pineapple.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What depresses me most is some people might think this represents Vietnamese food; that, in being served in this square, wood-panelled room with the comfy leather chairs and the fancy wine list, it is some higher expression of the tradition.

Desserts of a chocolate pot, topped with nitro-gunned cream, a few passable vanilla doughnuts and some salt-baked pineapple don’t help the cause any either.</p> \n<p>When we arrived at Leicester House I was greeted by a young very friendly chap who had served me here when it was both the St John Hotel and its successor. I can see why he has been kept on. He is charming and efficient without being intrusive, and makes the steely dining room a pleasant enough place in which to pass the time. As we leave, I joke that I’ll see him when the restaurant launches its next incarnation. He sighs deeply, as if to say he probably will. This once-famous, now-forgotten Chinatown corner is, I fear, still not ready for a glorious return to the limelight.</p> \n<h2>Jay’s news bites<br /></h2> \n<p>■ A few days later, for real Vietnamese food I went to Cay Tre on Soho’s Dean Street. There was a papaya salad with fire and flash, and summer rolls full of fresh prawn and crunchy rice noodle. There was catfish in caramelised anchovy sauce, pork belly stewed in coconut milk and seared mustard greens with chilli. It’s half the price and twice the flavour (<a href=\"http://vietnamesekitchen.co.uk/\">vietnamesekitchen.co.uk</a>)</p> \n<p>■ Congratulations to Chris Honor of Chris Kitch, the little deli-caf&eacute; in London’s Muswell Hill, on the publication of his cookbook Big Flavours From a Small Kitchen written with Laura Washburn Hutton. Think big-fisted salads, robust soups and terrific sweet and savoury bakes (<a href=\"http://www.chriskitch.com/\">chriskitch.com</a>)</p> \n<p>■ Meanwhile, Phaidon has some thrilling books coming up for autumn. There’s Toast at a mere &pound;14.95. Apparently, ‘Toast features 50 seasonal recipes for artisanal toast that will appeal to home cooks of all levels.’ Better still there’s Breakfast and a Dog in which food stylist Natsuko Kuwahara captures ‘the moment she serves breakfast under the watchful eye of her dog’. How have we managed without these?

It’s the time for new takes on seasonal classics to be enjoyed in the garden</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<p>It has come to that point in the year when I want food that is light, gently flavoured and peaceful. No loud notes or vivid colours on my plate, just mild, quietly seasoned food for a summer’s day. Tempting as it is to bring out the summer classics – bowls of chilled cucumber soup, or perhaps a crab salad, a plate of cold salmon with herb mayonnaise or a pork pie – I hate the idea of food standing still. There is too much fun to be had.</p> \n<p>I made a soup this week, a broth of green peas and lettuce. Even though we ate it hot, it tasted clearly of the season. Green and light, it seemed only right to eat it in the garden. I introduced a fresh, acidic note with a rather generous amount of lemon, adding brightness to the roasted chicken broth. To make it more substantial I made toasts of ciabatta with olive oil and grated parmesan to dunk in it as we ate.</p> \n<p>The same principle, of introducing something sharp or sour to what is essentially a mild dish, included making pickled vegetables to dress a ball of creamy burrata. Courgettes and thin-skinned kohlrabi brought a crunchiness to the soft, quivering cheese, the vegetables having been given a brief pickling in vinegar, lemon and horseradish. I could have used a firmer mozzarella or even feta, but burrata is the number one summer cheese for me.</p> \n<p>Other ways I like to freshen up well-known summer classics include roasting a salmon with lemon and tarragon (tuck the herbs inside the belly of the fish with a slice of butter, squeeze the lemon over the fish and add the empty shells to the tin). I also like to add chopped radishes and even a little ripe chilli to a cold cucumber soup and let their heat liven it up.</p> \n<p>At dessert level, it can be fun to update the old summer pudding recipe with a shot of sloe gin, or by adding a layer of lemon syllabub before the cream to a fruit trifle. In our house, even strawberries and cream get a new look with a splash of raspberry pur&eacute;e and peppery basil over the berries.</p> \n<h2>Lettuce soup with parmesan toasts</h2> \n<p>The flavour will stand or fall on the quality of the stock, so it is worth making your own. I use wings rather than a whole chicken and roast them before making the stock.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br />For the chicken stock:<br /><strong>chicken wings</strong> 8<br /><strong>water</strong> 1.5 litres<br /><strong>onion </strong>1 medium-sized<br /><strong>thyme</strong> 8 sprigs<br /><strong>bay leaves</strong> 2<br /><strong>black peppercorns</strong> 6</p> \n<p>For the soup:<br /><strong>chicken stock</strong> 1 litre (see above) <br /><strong>peas</strong> 300g, frozen is fine<br /><strong>lettuce</strong> 400g<br /><strong>mint </strong>8 leaves<br /><strong>lemon </strong>half</p> \n<p>For the toasts:<br /><strong>ciabatta</strong> 4 thick slices<br /><strong>olive oil</strong><br /><strong>parmesan</strong> 3 tbsp grated</p> \n<p>Make the roast chicken stock by putting the chicken wings into a roasting tin, pour over the oil then roast for 40 minutes or until golden brown and lightly crisp-skinned.</p> \n<p>Transfer the roasted wings to a deep pot, pour some of the water into the roasting tin and stir to dislodge any juices stuck to the tin. Pour into the pot with the rest of the water, add the onion, peeled and cut in half, the thyme, bay leaves and peppercorns. Bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a simmer. Using a draining spoon remove any froth that comes to the surface and discard. If you leave it there it will make your stock cloudy. Let it simmer for an hour then strain through a fine sieve.</p> \n<p>Bring the chicken stock to the boil. Add the peas and let them cook in the stock for four or five minutes, until tender. Lower the heat to a simmer then add the shredded lettuce. Tear up the mint leaves and stir them in, together with the juice of the half lemon and a seasoning of salt and black pepper.</p> \n<p>Toast the bread on one side, using an overhead grill, then turn over and trickle with olive oil. Dust the surface with grated parmesan and toast until the parmesan has started to melt and turn golden. Ladle the soup into four warm bowls then float the toasts on top and serve.</p> \n<h2>Burrata with pickled vegetables</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e17164d176678067bdb22b25843658a9c805e75\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433943859119/2db0bde8-8c28-4de5-b147-1d1fea528e97-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Say cheese: burrata with pickled vegetables.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Say cheese: burrata with pickled vegetables.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Perfect as a light main course.</p> \n<p>Serves 2<br /><strong>red onions</strong> 2<br /><strong>lemon </strong>juice of 1<br /><strong>kohlrabi</strong> 500g<br /><strong>fresh horseradish</strong> 20g, fresh<br /><strong>yellow courgette </strong>1<br /><strong>green courgette </strong>1<br /><strong>white-wine vinegar</strong><br /><strong>burrata </strong>2</p> \n<p>Peel the red onions and slice them thinly, to about the thickness of a 10p piece. Put them in a small bowl, together with the lemon juice. Set aside for a good 30 minutes.</p> \n<p>Remove the leaves and stalks from the kohlrabi. You don’t need to peel it if the skin itself is thin and unblemished. Push the kohlrabi through a grater or food processor fitted with a coarse blade. You are after the same matchstick-thick texture as you would use in celeriac remoulade. Peel the horseradish and grate it very finely.</p> \n<p>Coarsely grate the two courgettes. Put them in a bowl with the kohlrabi then add the vinegar and the grated horseradish and toss gently so the vegetables are covered with the vinegar. Uncoated bits will discolour.</p> \n<p>Place the burrata on a serving dish, or one each on individual plates, and gently break it open. Drain the grated vegetables and the sliced onions and divide among the burrata. Trickle a small amount of olive oil over the burrata and vegetables and serve.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433943713480/lettuce-soup-with-parmesa-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"On the bright side: lettuce soup with parmesan toasts Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin/Observer","altText":"lettuce soup with parmesan toasts","cleanCaption":"On the bright side: lettuce soup with parmesan toasts Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433943860550/2db0bde8-8c28-4de5-b147-1d1fea528e97-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Say cheese: burrata with pickled vegetables.
