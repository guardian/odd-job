Without Kickstarter, Crowdfunder, Crowdcube et al, the innovative schemes of countless chefs, restaurateurs and culinary inventors would have withered and died on the carpet tiles of a bank-manager’s office. But for every piece of culinary brilliance they’ve gifted us, there are the brain farts. The monkey tennis. The ones you wouldn’t waste the back of your fag packet on. Essentially, it’s like a global Britain’s Got Talent of food-based ideas, only some of them are good. Here’s our guide to the most weird and wonderful offerings out there right now.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/332642838/its-not-a-bread-knife-its-the-sandwich-knife\"><strong>The sandwich knife</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfc39cbd13e7b0e07f590d22b7edbd458531f160\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435155757371/35c93e4d-c71a-4d26-ba46-f4ed401ba32d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sandwich knife\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sandwich knife. Of course.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“It’s not a bread knife, it’s a sandwich knife,” claims the Kickstarter page for this product from Toronto. We’re looking at a serrated, two-bladed knife that uses one motion to slice two pieces of bread. According to the promo video, its USP is its “parallel and vertically offset blade configuration”. Or, as we might think of it, “the way it glues two bread knives together and tries to flog them to credulous chumps”.</p> \n<p><strong>Will it hit its target?</strong> Its goal is C$22,500 (&pound;11,600); with just hours to go, it has raised C$6,586. Will enough people consider saving the hassle of slicing twice to be worth C$25? I’d guess no.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/clear-coffee#/story\"><strong>Clear coffee</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3a4a422068b9902138aa172b1be7011ad7d824b6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435155912377/77ae4df9-dbd2-41e5-b12d-af976b48387a-366x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Clear coffee\" width=\"366\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tastes better than it looks, apparently.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Do we need coffee that looks like petrol? Entrepreneurs in the Slovakian city of Košice want to launch a see-through coffee, the main purpose of which is to “not negatively affect the whiteness of your teeth”. Actually, this isn’t a terrible idea, and judging by the promo video of it being taste-tested by random people on the street, it has exciting possibilities. Their lack of any scientific explanation is a worry, though.</p> \n<p><strong>Will it hit its target? </strong>I wouldn’t bet on it. It has taken 30 days to raise €327 (&pound;233) – 1% of the €35,000 required – with 24 days left to go.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dausage/the-dausage-a-cross-between-a-sausage-and-a-doughn\"><strong>The Dausage</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4cae79ab5512a3369bb530fbe716e7ad16b806c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435156018216/f093c7db-f43a-47b2-b669-f712ab45bbe0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Dausage\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jam plus sausage equals Dausage.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“A cross between a sausage and a doughnut,” excitedly exclaim the people behind this Welsh startup, attempting to muscle in on the cronut craze of years gone by. “There are no finer foods in the world than sausages and doughnuts, but they seldom appear together,” point out the would-be purveyors of the jam-filled meat tubes. The photos look grisly, with a botched-home-vasectomy aesthetic. The video shows jam oozing out as someone off-camera slits the sausage’s top end. Apparently, the combination of sweet and meat has gone down very well in extensive taste tests. I’m happy to take their word for it.</p> \n<p><strong>Will it hit its target?</strong> With five days to go, it’s stalled at just more than a third of its &pound;2,500 goal. Not a banger, then.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/489252126/beerdecoded-the-1000-beer-genomes?ref=category\"><strong>Decoded beer</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"109baf1161009806e42502092e470f2733ee2275\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435156113773/04b144ad-25a6-4a29-885e-c33903c4152a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Beer decoding\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Decoding some beer, presumably.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A “citizen science” project from Geneva that aims to map the flavours of beer. The idea is that each beer has a distinct genome, which they call “the beer’s DNA”, that these bods can plot on a big family tree of beer to provide a scientific categorisation of beer flavours. It sounds like it was devised after much sampling of beer genomes, but they do wear lab coats in the video, so maybe they know what they’re talking about. Beer and science, two of the internet’s favourite things: got to be a winner.</p> \n<p><strong>Will it hit its target?</strong> It already has, attracting €10,219 of its €10,000 goal with a few days left to go.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/232285519/the-worlds-first-petting-zoo-and-gourmet-chocolate?ref=category\"><strong>A petting zoo and gourmet chocolate shop</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcae4d398e4846133f7fe708cec91b80f500a019\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435156227957/05957927-29fc-476d-91b6-7d5b381a12c3-460x331.jpeg\" alt=\"Zebras\" width=\"460\" height=\"331\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some zebras.

Customers are chauffeured by horse-drawn carriage to pet real live zebras, emus, alpacas and a range of mini animals (pigs, cows, horses) while chomping champagne truffles. The money is for repairs and new pens, and investing will earn you boxes of chocs or an overnight stay.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86bff8aa16a0ce23c69cb6ff6218ede567d56df1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435156428791/8f1eab31-f285-4758-90e2-5c2cccd8d052-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Before Elixir\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Magic juice for drinking.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Will it hit its target?</strong> With three days to go and $30,000 (&pound;19,100) to reach, it’s earned a grand total of zero. So probably not.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/pretty-fcking-good-toast/\"><strong>Mobile toast</strong></a></h2> \n<p>This is an attempt to raise cash to create a mobile street-food stall by sprucing up the knackered-looking bike of a chef in Hackney Wick with a pedigree in toasting sourdough bread. The solitary photo of what appears to be a gigantic DJ’s record box welded to the front of a bike suggests this is a very deserving case. Then again, the entirely detail-free write-up suggests that what they really need is some ideas.</p> \n<p><strong>Will it hit its target?</strong> He’s raised just &pound;100 of the &pound;3,500 he’s after. But. A street-food stall. On a bike. Sourdough bread. Hackney Wick. Essentially, it’s a ludicrous rollcall of hipster cliches. So – judging by <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/supper-tub-londons-next-hot-tub-thing-is-a-3course-meal-and-frozen-cocktails-10307549.html\">hot-tub-based restaurant Suppertub</a> and Cannabistro, the <a href=\"http://cannabistro.grubclub.com/\">weed-themed restaurant in Dalston</a>, both of which open on Friday – probably.</p> \n<p><strong> <br /></strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Those we backed</strong></h2> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/before-elixir#description\"><strong>Before Elixir</strong></a></h2> \n<p>A red beverage that apparently cures “alcohol flush reaction”, by which booze causes your skin to turn red and blotchy. Drink it before you imbibe and its blend of fruit, milk thistle and B vitamins will reduce the amount of toxins your liver produces in response to your attempts to pickle it.</p> \n<p><strong>How much did it raise?</strong> Almost 10% more than its target, $13,575.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2028227986/bocusini-worlds-first-plug-and-play-3d-food-printi/\"><strong>Bocusini</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"380c1c688a598b4460dbde1975fb39673fc1df87\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435156353040/ee7b6df4-0662-4b46-822d-f16826992b76-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Bocusini 3D printer\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bocusini printer.

Put a little food-filled cartridge into the machine, create a design on your computer and then, judging by the demo video, make a tiny maze from mortadella, a creepy, mashed-potato octopus or write someone a message in jam. Useless or utterly, bafflingly ingenious.</p> \n<p><strong>How much did it raise?</strong> €40,581 – over €10,000 more than they asked for. People really do enjoy playing with their food.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/crik-nutrition-delicious-cricket-protein-powder/x/10060804\"><strong>Cricket protein powder</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c1a939801e68075be736baeac493e3e8a6e7282\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435156586234/ac4c0c77-491a-49ff-9487-dd5ed7f34fc4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A cricket\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cricket protein powder, seen here in non-powder form.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Desperate for a muscle tone that says “unitard full of melons”, but worried that your insatiable bulk-lust is ruining the environment? This protein powder claims to assuage your conscience.

It’s actually on sale in more than 1,000 UK outlets already; the cash they’re after will help “create new and innovative products”.</p> \n<p><strong>How far off-target?</strong> This crowd-funding equivalent of “lend us a tenner, mate” raised &pound;11 of its &pound;10,000 goal.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hello-hungry-liquid-meal-for-office-people#/story\"><strong>Hello Hungry</strong></a></h2> \n<p>The main problem of a work schedule that leaves you banging your head against emails for eight hours solid with nary a second for a lunchbreak is our bodies’ pesky desire to fill themselves with food.

The blondie is not a slow-release carb kind of treat.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"848b38b3208cc085a2e832877dd11a6c55080bfc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435069575281/a9b05993-f635-42c0-bed5-060f15c9a251-460x298.jpeg\" alt=\"Nigella Lawson blondie\" width=\"460\" height=\"298\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigella Lawson’s chewy blondie, featuring oats.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Raising agent</h2> \n<p>Lawson is also the only one to use bicarbonate of soda in her brownies, at least on its own; the US magazine Cooks Illustrated and Annie Bell’s Baking Bible use baking powder, while <a href=\"http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2006/11/blondies-for-a-blondie/\">American blogger Deb Perelman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.marthastewart.com/336484/blondies-with-chocolate-chips-and-walnut#Brownie%20and%20Blondie%20Recipes|/275401/brownie-and-blondie-recipes/@center/276956/cookie-recipes|336484\">American domestic goddess Martha Stewart</a> eschew raising agents altogether.</p> \n<p>Cooks Illustrated, which has conducted extensive research on this point, observes that the majority of blondie recipes fall into two camps – “light and cakey” and “dense and buttery” – and that “tasters preferred [the] latter”. This chimes with my own experience; the fluffier blondies of Bell and Lawson proved less popular than flatter, more gooey versions, but some ingrates complained – while eating them – that the latter were “a bit rich”. This suggests adding a little baking powder, enough to allow a little rise, is a good idea.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d25259ef966f4c1982563bd7eaf43b0d92a4ecf0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435069731092/af17c053-95e8-4285-a67b-972248c1ab87-460x335.jpeg\" alt=\"Deb Perelman's blondie\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deb Perelman’s blondies, made with dark muscovado sugar.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Sugar</h2> \n<p>Sugar is the predominant flavour here and, as such, of paramount importance. Everyone uses a brown variety of some kind to maximise the butterscotch factor, with Perelman going as far as the treacly dark brown sort in her most recent recipe. Lawson mixes soft light brown sugar with condensed milk; Stewart cuts it with granulated sugar, which gives her blondies a pleasingly grainy texture; and Bell goes for a gloriously gooey combination of soft light brown sugar, golden syrup and honey “for an even stickier cake”. However, although this is generally desirable, it is not actually what most testers want in a blondie. The same goes for Perelman’s dark muscovado, which tastes a little too bitter and sophisticated for what is, in essence, the love child of two very simple treats: the chocolate-chip cookie and the brownie. The white chocolate flavour of Lawson’s condensed milk, meanwhile, seems better savoured for the chips. On this basis, caramelly light soft brown sugar and crunchy demerara seems the ideal combination.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2ff91b418362518e3ff07c85bf2a2dc0bcbd931\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435069888610/27297dbc-adbf-4ba8-9637-97c184d12a3b-460x299.jpeg\" alt=\"Martha Stewart blondies\" width=\"460\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blondies &agrave; la Martha Stewart.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Butter</h2> \n<p>Melting the butter – rather than creaming it into the mixture, as with a conventional sponge cake – helps provide the satisfyingly dense texture. Browning it first, as Perelman suggests, is a stroke of genius, given that one of the few things to taste better than butter is nutty, toasted butter. That said, if you’d prefer to skip this step in order to get a blondie in your mouth five minutes sooner, they’ll still be pretty delicious.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5979635b602feea79e985503dee62602803c309\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435069992309/26f3db00-db19-4bfe-ba4f-3d1414c0d2a6-460x312.jpeg\" alt=\"Annie Bell's blondies\" width=\"460\" height=\"312\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honeyed blondies by Annie Bell.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Extras</h2> \n<p>Blond or non-blond, this business demands chocolate of some sort, but the bitter cocoa of Stewart and Lawson’s dark chocolate chips overwhelms the butterscotch flavour of the cake itself. Bell’s white chocolate variety seems far more in the spirit of things. Nuts are another must, as much for the textural contrast between them and the soft, dense batter as for their lovely flavour. Stewart goes for the tannic walnut, which I also favour in brownies, but the sweeter flavour of pecans works better here. Regular readers annoyed by my one-woman campaign against the kneejerk use of vanilla in baked goods should be gratified to learn that it was made for this recipe – there is no better partner for butter and sugar. Finally, a good pinch of salt, although not quite as much as Stewart or Perelman suggest, helps balance the other flavours; I’d err on the side of caution and add a few flakes on top to finish.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"069588c57837014466b94d84e5fcdc9cc7ac2951\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435070123018/c56ba942-ff06-429a-81b9-2ca55640f51a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cooks Illustrated blondies\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cooks Illustrated blondies.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Baking</h2> \n<p>As with brownies, it is always better to undercook rather than overcook a blondie – I take Stewart’s out halfway through their cooking time after reading comments online that 45 minutes at 180C left them “brick hard” (thank God for the internet). Half that time, as Cooks Illustrated suggests, seems more reasonable, but, as ever, keep an eye on them and trust your own judgment over the clock.</p> \n<h2>The perfect blondies</h2> \n<p><em>(Makes 1 x 20cm tray)</em></p> \n<p>165g butter, cubed <br /></p> \n<p>75g pecans, roughly chopped <br /></p> \n<p>225g plain flour <br /></p> \n<p>1 tsp baking powder <br /></p> \n<p>&frac12; tsp fine salt <br /></p> \n<p>175g light brown sugar <br /></p> \n<p>50g demerara sugar<br /></p> \n<p>2 eggs, beaten <br /></p> \n<p>1 tsp vanilla extract <br /></p> \n<p>170g white chocolate, roughly chopped <br /></p> \n<p>Sea salt flakes, to top (optional)</p> \n<p>Melt the butter in a wide, light-coloured pan over a medium-low heat, swirling to help it along. Once the foam has died down, watch it like a hawk; as soon as the solids at the bottom turn from white to toasty brown and the butter smells almost nutty, tip into a bowl to cool until barely warm.<br /></p> \n<p>Toast the pecans in the same pan until they, too, smell nutty, then set aside.<br /></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark six and grease a square baking tin roughly 20cm in size. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl, then stir the sugars into the cooled butter. Stir in the eggs and vanilla, then gently fold the wet ingredients into the flour, along with the white chocolate and nuts, until just combined, being careful not to overmix.</p> \n<p>Pour into the tin and bake for 22-25 minutes, until set on top. Meanwhile, prepare a shallow sink of iced water; when the blondies are cooked, plunge in the tin, being careful not to drown the blondies, and allow to cool. Cut into squares and eat.</p> \n<p><strong>The blondie: the brownie’s paler and less-interesting cousin, or its more subtle and sophisticated older sister?

Slice a head of fennel in half from stem to root, then slice each half thinly.</p> \n<p>Cut a large courgette into rounds. Toss the carrots, courgette and fennel in four tablespoons of olive oil and transfer to a roasting tin. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.</p> \n<p>Pull the leaves from three or four stems of thyme and toss them with the vegetables. Season with salt and black pepper.</p> \n<p>Place a medium-sized sea bass on top of the vegetables, trickle with olive oil and season inside and out. Stuff a further three or four sprigs of thyme inside the fish’s belly.</p> \n<p>Bake for 30 minutes, until the flesh will part easily from the bones. Serves 2.</p> \n<h2>The trick</h2> \n<p>It is very easy to overcook a whole fish. Start testing if it’s done after 20 minutes. Pull away a small piece of the skin, then pull at one of the larger flakes of flesh. It should slide from the bone with only the gentlest of persuasion. To serve, peel the skin away first – it should come away easily – then gently slide the fish from its bones in as large sections as possible with the help of a palette knife.</p> \n<h2>The twist</h2> \n<p>Whole small fish can be used instead of the sea bass. Allow one per person. Use thinly sliced potatoes instead of the courgettes, green beans and carrots as the vegetables. Make a herb sauce to serve on the side, stirring lemon juice, chopped fennel fronds and capers into a thick, olive oil-enriched mayonnaise.</p> \n<p><em>Email Nigel at </em><em><a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a> </em><em>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/36be6cda4bb829c8788279714a0fb216d4a5b734/740_772_3765_2258/3765.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2258,"width":3765,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin/Jonathan Lovekin","altText":"Baked sea bass with summer vegetables Observer Magazine OM Nigel Slater Nigel's Midweek Dinner 21/6/2015","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/Jonathan Lovekin"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T11:00:03Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T11:00:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Nigel Slater","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397762419839/NigelSlater.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nigelslater"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Life and style","Fish"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fish","webTitle":"Fish"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Nigel Slater","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/nigelslater"}}],"series":{"title":"Nigel Slater's midweek dinner","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/nigel-slater-midweek-dinner"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/23/nigel-slater-baked-sea-bass-recipe","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49q2t","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/23/nigel-slater-baked-sea-bass-recipe","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/23/nigel-slater-baked-sea-bass-recipe"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/36be6cda4bb829c8788279714a0fb216d4a5b734/740_772_3765_2258/3765.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2258,"width":3765,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A light supper for a warm evening: baked sea bass with summer vegetables  Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer","altText":"baked sea bass with summer vegetables","cleanCaption":"A light supper for a warm evening: baked sea bass with summer vegetables ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer"}},"importance":4,"kicker":{"title":"Nigel Slater's midweek dinner"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/36be6cda4bb829c8788279714a0fb216d4a5b734/740_772_3765_2258/3765.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2258,"width":3765,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin/Jonathan Lovekin","altText":"Baked sea bass with summer vegetables Observer Magazine OM Nigel Slater Nigel's Midweek Dinner 21/6/2015","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/Jonathan Lovekin"}}]},{"title":"State of independents / How do chain stores fit into artisan areas?","rawTitle":"How do chain stores fit into artisan areas?","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jun/23/state-of-independents-how-do-chain-stores-fit-into-artisan-areas-subway-manchester","title":"State of independents: how do chain stores fit into artisan areas?","trailText":"Subway is set to open one of its stores in the heart of Manchester’s independent Northern Quarter.

How will the locals react?</p>","byline":"Simon Binns","body":"<p>This 4 July, people around the UK will be celebrating independence on a day specifically created to mark it. No, not that one. Independents Day is organised by the National Skills Academy for Retail, to celebrate the small and the beautiful in the industry. </p> \n<p>This is a big deal in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, an area that has become a symbol of the “<a href=\"http://www.marketingmanchester.com/original-modern.aspx\">Original Modern</a>” city’s independent spirit, and is fiercely guarded by those who inhabit it. It has become a hub for locally owned bars, restaurants and shops. You’re never more than 10ft from an earnestly produced latte or an artisan sourdough loaf.</p> \n<p>This is hipster town. Nearly everything sold here comes with the word “craft” tacked on the front, and the locals take the indie ethos very, very seriously.</p> \n<p>So how will they react to the news that one of its most famous institutions – the <a href=\"http://russelldavies.typepad.com/eggbaconchipsandbeans/2006/07/abergeldie_cafe_1.html\">Abergeldie cafe</a>, which famously used to have a sandwich board outside proclaiming it as “Terry Wogan’s favourite caf&eacute;” – is about to become … a branch of Subway? Given its 2,139 other outlets, the grab and go sandwich chain hardly stands shoulder to shoulder with independent retail.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> There will be protests. There will be tweets. There will be meatball marinara sauce on the carpet before the doors are open. </p> \n<p>But should the independent sector really see this as a threat?</p> \n<p>Claire Rayner, a national campaigner who launched the <a href=\"http://www.independentretail.co.uk/\">Support for Independent Retail campaign</a> in 2011, claims that Subway, as a franchised business, will need just as much support as any new indie would when it opens in the Northern Quarter. “It will still be a small business with an individual putting money on the line, even though it has a big brand umbrella above it,” she points out.</p> \n<p>The Northern Quarter, as other independent areas – the Calls in Leeds, Hockley in Nottingham, Shoreditch, Hoxton and Dalston in East London – gets caught in the same commercial cycle. Cheap space attracts small and interesting businesses; interesting becomes popular; popular gets expensive (the average rent per square foot in the Northern Quarter has increased from &pound;7 to &pound;27 in the last decade); expensive can only be afforded by the biggest – and that mostly means chains. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"362329e93e77cb0364b1ab7276e1442ea21bbca9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435058449626/5fe47051-8f1f-46de-a82b-6b6841ab6a36-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"\" quirky=\"\" sells\"=\"\" ...=\"\" manchester's=\"\" northern=\"\" quarter.\"=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">“Quirky sells” ... Manchester’s Northern Quarter.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There’s already a Tesco on the edge of the Northern Quarter, which opened several years ago amid a small and fairly muted protest – although it’s always busy. But a month ago, Jamaican-themed bar chain Turtle Bay opened its second Manchester venue on Oldham Street – the epicentre of the city’s independent heart. There were ripples of disapproval, but business owners privately shrugged it off as an inevitable side-effect of the area’s growing popularity, and rubbed their hands at the ever growing footfall that is luring these brands in.</p> \n<p>The Northern Quarter has a tourism value to the city these days, so bohemia has to let in the day trippers and their holiday money. Quirky sells. Anyone who has been to <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/emmyf/why-you-need-to-visit-christiania-before-you-die#.pdJ0M5zNG\">Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen</a> will note the immediate barrage of shops and stalls before you even get to see a hippy sleeping in a tree. Growth can be an embarrassing side-effect to the independent spirit of those startups who claim not to have been in it for the money.</p> \n<p>The reality in Manchester, as with many other areas, is that many of the “independent” bars in the Northern Quarter actually belong to the same three or four chains. Almost Famous, Home Sweet Home and Liquor &amp; Burn all come from the same stable, and are situated a stone’s throw from each other. Black Dog Ballroom is the cousin of Cane &amp; Grain (over the road); Odd owns the Blue Pig; Kosmonaut and Ply belong to the same folk, and a company called MAD Ltd provides its very own Northern Quarter bar crawl, given that they own Rosylee, The Fitzgerald, Walrus, Tusk and Hula. They’re also planning another three new concepts in the area, including an American diner. Because there’s plenty of life in the old burger yet.</p> \n<p>The reaction of one Northern Quarter business owner – who asked not to be named – to the impending arrival of Subway was relatively sanguine. “We’re all in the same game,” he said. “We’re an area that just tends to get on with change and yes, I suppose there are mini-chains already in existence in the Northern Quarter. We all have a vision and if you do things well, growth is inevitable. And don’t tell anyone, but I’m quite partial to a foot-long.”</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435056502137/b8ae46f5-2ec9-49e1-9266-e09bad682b9b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Independent spirit ...
