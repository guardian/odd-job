How much a part does food play in your holiday destinations?</p>","byline":"Vicky Frost","body":"<p>Never mind <a href=\"http://hot-dog-legs.tumblr.com/\">your hot dog legs</a> – show me the actual sausages. If there is any better use for Instagram than perving on friends’ holiday eating, I don’t know it. Those sun-baked fruit platters, dishes of oil-slicked seafood, trays of colour and texture and sometimes slightly unidentifiable stuff, are the best reasons to travel. Long after the tan has faded and the stress returned, a whiff of something familiar and delicious can transport you back to a table warmed by the sun, and the food shared around it.</p> \n<p>So when it comes to choosing where to spend those precious two weeks of summer holiday, food is almost as high in my priorities as sunshine. Not in a tour of top-class restaurants sort of way – though I have (more organised) friends who plan their trips exactly like this, with their dinner bookings made almost before their flights – but with markets, street food and local restaurants more in mind. Where will we eat well – and affordably – for the length of our holiday? <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6067ee213e69118c31ece528829a5eb3bd746f66\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436808339740/01f2e9c2-95fe-4360-a8b0-f3be4de4b3db-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Floating fish sandwich stalls on the Bosphorus in Istanbul.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Floating fish sandwich stalls on the Bosphorus in Istanbul.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Hicks/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For us that’s often Turkey: returning from town, fingers already stained the deep red of cherries, with bags of stickily ripe green figs to be eaten with sharp, creamy local yoghurt; <a href=\"http://istanbuleats.com/2014/11/emin-usta-fish-sandwich-superhero/\">Balık ekmek&ccedil;i – grilled fresh fish and onions wrapped firmly in pillowy bread</a> – devoured on the banks of the Bosphorus, under the watchful eye of hopeful seagulls; piles of crisp, fragrant calamari to be fought over with friends.

For others it’s Italy: a Sicilian holiday dinner of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/recipes/8779724/Pasta-con-le-sarde-recipe.html\">pasta with sardines, sultanas, anchovies and pine nuts</a> still talked about in revered tones by those who ate it; my first bite of pizza in Naples still memorable more than a decade later; and oh god, the gelato. And of course, there’s France, an ordinary salad of tomatoes, shallots and garlic with a chucked-together vinaigrette made almost legendary one family holiday by a combination of ripe fruit and hazy evening sunshine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"238c2f3d28c0d07d30a70f57b33e5b1dc193d6c5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436808425670/8fafc464-aec4-47dd-9052-5b7a5e6102a1-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Menu outside La Maroma steak house in Buenos Aires.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Menu outside La Maroma steak house in Buenos Aires.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One friend travelled to China to basically celebrate his own street-food festival – he says he’s still yearning for the rice noodle skewers that come doused in chilli or cumin salt, and fried using an old hand iron and a tin sheet. Others visited Argentina for the ultimate steak and red wine (the amazing pasta and ice cream an unexpected bonus), and Sri Lanka for its richly spiced curries and incredible daal.</p> \n<p>Sometimes the food adventure is in the actual travelling. A journey on the trans-Siberian railway where it became quickly clear that every item on themenu was mutton, regardless of its description as something else entirely. A train ride to Syria where there was a sign for a buffet car but no actual carriage beyond it, resulting in hasty picnics of bread, hard-boiled eggs and ripe peaches assembled from station kiosks. A flight to India, where the usual sad airline food was replaced with an awe-inspiring curry, with impressive sides, popadoms, and pickles.</p> \n<p>And sometimes the food adventure is not in restaurants at all, but in home kitchens. I often end up on self-catered jaunts because if you love to cook, a table full of great produce and lots of time in which to prepare it can be a proper luxury, for a couple of nights at least. There’s something particularly lovely about doing this in Britain: ditching the supermarket and snuffling out local foods. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"45f8f5c855c8c9f8bb2a7c809a16ecd9de56abde\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436808524100/7bed7a96-7fa6-459e-9eec-b45abcab3ef7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Taverna tables at Karavomilos lake, Kefalonia, Greece.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taverna tables at Karavomilos lake, Kefalonia, Greece.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But better still, of course, is sitting at the home table of a local. A friend who has a Lebanese husband raves about traditional mezze and Beirut streetfood, but saves her highest praise for home-cooked Lebanese dishes such as bemyeh (rice vermicelli, okra and meat stew) and laban ummo (yoghurt soup with lamb chunks).

Lots of time, bourbon and beer.)</p> \n<p>Talking of which, even those who love the country cannot recommend traveling to Germany for the food – “I can honestly say I have never been anywhere in Germany for the cuisine, nor been tempted to cook a massive pork knuckle or make potato soup when I got back,” says a translator friend who visits often and has great affection for the place.

That’s why we drink coffee out. But classes are springing up in Melbourne and Sydney, teaching mere mortals how to be baristas at home.<br /></p> \n<p>Nolan Hirte, owner of inner-city Melbourne cafes <a href=\"http://www.proudmarycoffee.com.au/\">Proud Mary</a>, <a href=\"http://staggerlees.com.au/\">Stagger Lees</a> and <a href=\"http://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/food-and-drink/directory/cafe/aunty-pegs-coffee-proud-mary\">Aunty Peg’</a>s, admits not everyone wants to do all that, but if people knew how easy it was to make it properly at home, “your coffee would be so much better.”</p> \n<p>In his most recently opened cafe, Aunty Peg’s in Collingwood, Hirte has set up what he calls the <a href=\"mailto:auntypegs@proudmarycoffee.com.au\"> Genius Bar</a>. </p> \n<p>Four different machines – French Press, AeroPress, Clever Dripper and V60 – are set up along a long wooden bench, allowing customers to come in and be trained by Hirte or one of his staff. “It’s free advice,” says Hirte. “There are many factors to making a good coffee but, once you know them, it’s easy to do it.” </p> \n<p>So here I am, a coffee drinker and a lazy one at that. I don’t weigh the water and I don’t always grind my beans at home, so I’m here to learn how. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ea68c4794ee2ab5c28c3542a8d75c3d0992c294\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/8ea68c4794ee2ab5c28c3542a8d75c3d0992c294/0_160_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There’s more than one way to skin a cat: the pour-over, chemex, aeropress, and vacuum pot. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There’s more than one way to skin a cat: the pour-over, Chemex, AeroPress and vacuum pot. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edmund D. Fountain/ZUMA Press/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>French press</h2> \n<p>We start with the French press, aka the coffee plunger. The grind size is vital, according to Hirte. We are making two cups, and as it’s 15-18g of beans for one cup of coffee (one cup being 250 ml), I weigh out 30g of beans into a silver cup on a highly sensitive digital scale. The bean we use is Ethiopian Yirgacheffe and we use the same bean for each extraction method.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/apr/02/expensive-specialty-coffee-how-much-would-you-be-prepared-to-pay\">Expensive specialty coffee: how much would you be prepared to pay?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Before we go any further we preheat the plunger, just as you would warm a teapot in anticipation of a good brew, with a pour of hot water. The glass takes on the heat and we put the vessel aside.<br /></p> \n<p>Hirte puts the beans that will become our coffee on a grind that is coarser than table salt. <br /></p> \n<p>I place the plunger on the digital scales, then put in the ground coffee and bring the scales back to zero. I weigh the just-boiled water – 500g equals 500ml – pouring it into the plunger and ensuring all the grounds are saturated. We give the mix a stir. </p> \n<p>Hirte puts the timer on for three and a half minutes. “Leave it for longer if you want a stronger brew,” he says. Time’s up and we have a delicious cup of black coffee. It’s fruity, a little nutty and delicate. Not adding milk only emphasises this flavour profile. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"410da25c0d6dbff08dfdb8e25924dab76f8b483e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/410da25c0d6dbff08dfdb8e25924dab76f8b483e/0_0_2848_4276/666.jpg\" alt=\"An old favourite – French press coffee.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An old favourite – French press coffee.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Drip coffee</h2> \n<p>“This got my mum to stop drinking Moccona,” says Hirte. “It’s really clever.” </p> \n<p>The Clever Coffee Dripper is a device that makes a single cup of filtered coffee. With the filter paper, coffee and water poured into the dripper, the extraction happens when the dripper is placed on top of the cup and the coffee is released via a weight-controlled valve. It’s like a filter coffee maker for a single cup rather than a large jug. “This allows us to brew quicker – with the press we had to wait four minutes with this – you just press it when you’re ready and get on with it,” says Hirte.</p> \n<p>This time, I weigh out 14g of coffee, we grind it a little finer than we did for the French press and put the ground coffee into wet filter paper in the dripper. Hirte wets the filter paper, “as we don’t want to taste paper in the coffee”. We put the device on the scale and weigh the water again directly over the ground coffee in the filter paper. <br /></p> \n<p>We only need 250g of water for the one cup and cover the top of the dripper to let the flavours mingle. After two and a half minutes, or however long you want it, place it on the cup and the valve will release the brew. The flavour is denser than you get with the plunger.</p> \n<p>This device is available in any specialty coffee shop that sells equipment, and retails at $20-$35 or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Shrub-Clever-Dripper-C70777/dp/B00EOM5RN0\">on Amazon</a>. </p> \n<h2>AeroPress</h2> \n<p>The AeroPress has garnered its own loyal following in the last few years and I can’t help but wonder what the fuss is about. Hirte says it’s a quick and efficient method of extraction that gets good results.</p> \n<p>This time I measure out 12g of beans for one cup of coffee. I hit 12.1g and Hirte says it’s fine to be slightly over. He preheats the AeroPress and the vessel that will hold the finished coffee and we weigh out the coffee. It is a fine grind. We put the AeroPress and ground coffee on the scales. As we measure out 200ml of water, he says, “Spot on, and then we give it a good stir.” </p> \n<p>After one and a half minutes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ8wvUKa35E \">we flip the device</a>, “like flipping a cake” Hirte says, and we push down gently on the AeroPress. The extraction is through pressure and it brings out a slightly different aroma again. There’s more depth to the smell and it’s a little richer on the palate. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"341044f34e75c4f58449f70739594280abc63444\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/341044f34e75c4f58449f70739594280abc63444/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"The AeroPress method of brewing coffee.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The AeroPress method of brewing coffee.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>V60 (pour-over method)<br /></h2> \n<p>The name is reminiscent of a rev-head’s souped-up engine but it simply refers to the angle of the cone that filters the coffee. This is 21st-century filter coffee, also known as the pour-over method. </p> \n<p>This is Hirte’s favourite method. He makes himself coffee using this method every morning because “the quality and clarity in the cup are really good”.</p> \n<p>I’ve found my rhythm now. I know I will be heating vessels first, weighing beans and weighing water. Hirte says this method is a “bit more involved and you can get this wrong”, although I feel confident we can do it. </p> \n<p>We weigh out the coffee again and we need 28g for two cups. We go 29g – why? “I want more strength in the flavour,” he says. Half a gram can change the strength markedly. “You can weigh out 32g if you want to but it will make it very strong, a tiny change can make a big difference.”<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eff43284270725e00652ebf01995c5494750229\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0eff43284270725e00652ebf01995c5494750229/0_2940_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A barista preparing coffee using the V60 in Kuala Lumpur. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A barista preparing coffee using the V60 in Kuala Lumpur. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Ruslan/Demotix/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hirte pours 80ml of water over the ground coffee. He’s using a kettle with a long thin spout. “The way you pour is very important, you can’t do this with a normal kettle,” he says. He explains that pouring a large amount of water quickly over the grounds can cause “dry patches in the coffee, and it won’t filter properly. Begin in the centre and work the water out to the edges in a circular motion.” <br /></p> \n<p>I pour the next amount, about 100ml, and Hirte finishes off. We stir the coffee and water and it takes about two minutes to filter through. It has the best flavour of all the brews, rich and rounded. I can see why this is his preferred method. </p> \n<p>I have come to the conclusion that Hirte’s right. I am lazy. I don’t know if I will change my ways or just keep coming to places like this to have my coffee weighed and made for me. I’m considering a Clever Drip for home but may find that hard to move away from my stovetop. The new methods I’ve learned are fascinating but old habits are hard to beat. </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e1191ab2e509cd850d47c7feb3b9337aaf073d25/0_78_5472_3284/5472.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3284,"width":5472,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Nan Palmero/Flickr","altText":"Pour Over Coffee with a Hario V60 at Fourteen Eighteen Cafe in USA.

I decided to make jelly. There is something entirely frivolous about the idea of setting fruit juice so that it wobbles on your spoon. No one needs jelly. It is there simply to amuse and delight. Making jelly is escapist cooking. Like trifles, whim-whams and blancmanges, they are there simply for fun.</p> \n<p>The stone fruits – particularly peaches, nectarines and apricots – are in fine fettle at the moment. I bought flat white peaches this week that smelled like roses, and apricots that had an almost wine-like scent. The peaches ended up in a softly set jelly of elderflower cordial; the apricots were warmed with a splash of orange, then crushed and embedded in juice set with very little gelatine. A grown-up version of the much-loved mandarin-orange jelly of my childhood.</p> \n<p>Take it easy on the sugar and pick your fruits wisely – redcurrants or blackcurrants, stone fruits, rhubarb or oranges – and you get an extraordinary clarity of colour and vibrancy of flavour. (The acidity in currants can affect the set, so a few more sheets of gelatine are required.) Leaf or sheet gelatine, the sort that comes in paper envelopes rather than as fine powder in sachets, is the sort I prefer. It is a doddle to use. Just soak the leaves in cold water for five minutes until they have collapsed and softened, then lift the result out of the water and stir it into warm juice or a mixture of juice and wine. It really couldn’t be easier.</p> \n<p>I make mine the day I intend to eat them, giving them a maximum of six hours in the fridge. Any longer, even overnight, and they firm up just a little too much. In my book, a jelly should quiver rather than bounce.</p> \n<h2>Apricot jelly</h2> \n<p>Ripeness is all with this fruit, but if you are working with less than perfect specimens, as is sometimes the case, cook them for a few minutes longer than in the recipe below, sweetening them with a tablespoon or so of caster sugar.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>apricots</strong> 500g<br /><strong>orange juice</strong> 500ml (6 medium oranges)<br /><strong>leaf gelatine</strong> 12g (6 sheets)<br /><strong>caster sugar</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>double cream</strong> 250ml<br /><strong>rose petals</strong> (optional)<br /></p> \n<p>Finely grate the zest of one of the oranges on to a plate and set aside.</p> \n<p>Cut each apricot in half, discard the stone, then put the fruit in a medium-sized saucepan. Pour in 4 tbsp of the orange juice and let the apricots cook, partially covered with a lid, for 10 minutes or until they are vivid in colour and soft enough to pure&eacute;.</p> \n<p>Crush the apricots with a fork, so they are part way between chopped fruit and pur&eacute;e. Spoon the fruit into a shallow serving dish, about 22-24cm in diameter.</p> \n<p>Soak the gelatine leaves in a bowl of cold water, pushing the leaves under the water one at the time to prevent them from sticking.</p> \n<p>Warm the orange juice in a saucepan, but do not let it boil. Remove the gelatine from the water – it should be a squishy lump – and stir it into the hot orange juice. When the gelatine has completely dissolved, pour over the crushed apricots and allow to cool. Transfer to the fridge and leave for a couple of hours to set.</p> \n<p>Put the grated orange and the sugar into a food processor and blitz for a few seconds, until the sugar has turned a pale-orange colour. Alternatively crush the sugar and orange zest together using a pestle and mortar. Stop when the zest has lightly coloured and perfumed the sugar.</p> \n<p>To serve, softly whip the cream (not so stiff it can stand in peaks) and place in spoonfuls around the edge of the dish. Decorate with the orange-scented sugar and, if you wish, a few rose petals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf26e4f00e85758825d705f75f03ba12df8bfb52\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436276511359/de69118e-dbe7-4453-afcd-b4f644b09ef5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"White peach and elderflower jelly with a sprig of elderflower in a small glass bowl\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Pick your fruits wisely and you get an extraordinary clarity of colour and vibrancy of flavour,’ says Nigel Slater.

They are less fragrant, but their colour makes up for it. I have included a spoonful of sugar in this recipe as I feel that, despite the sweetness of the elderflower cordial, the jelly benefits from it. Leave it out if you prefer.</p> \n<p>Makes 4<br />For the peaches:<br /><strong>white peaches</strong> 125g<br /><strong>lemon</strong> juice of <strong>&frac12;</strong><br /></p> \n<p>For the jelly:<br /><strong>leaf gelatine</strong> 10g (6 small sheets) <br /><strong>elderflower cordial</strong> 100ml<br /><strong>white wine</strong> 350ml<br /><strong>caster sugar</strong> 1 tbsp (optional) <br /></p> \n<p>Half-fill a mixing bowl with cold water then add the sheets of gelatine. If you do this one at a time, it will prevent them from sticking together. Leave the gelatine to soften for 10 minutes, in which time it becomes a clear, spongy mass.</p> \n<p>Pour the elderflower cordial and white wine into a medium-sized saucepan, add the sugar (or not, if you prefer a sharper jelly) and warm over a moderate heat. Don’t let the mixture boil, which would affect the gelatine’s setting qualities.</p> \n<p>Cut the peaches in half then into thin slices, discarding the stone as you go, then toss them gently in the lemon juice to prevent them from browning. Divide the peaches among four small serving dishes.</p> \n<p>Lower the softened gelatine into the warmed cordial and wine, then stir until it has dissolved. It should disappear almost instantly. Pour into a jug then into the dishes to cover the peaches, then refrigerate for about four hours, until lightly set.</p> \n<p><br />Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></p> \n<p>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436276258550/April-jelly-decorated-aro-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Soft on fruit: Nigel Slater's apricot jelly recipe.

They spoiled us rotten with small renditions of their classic dishes, one of which was a simple strawberry gazpacho that was refreshing, fragrant and deeply satisfying all at the same time. It inspired me to make my own version.</p> \n<p>Like strawberries, broad beans are also in the height of season, though you could use frozen for the herby, garlicky puree to go with glazed, fennel-spiced pork (and you don’t need to peel the skins, either). Magic.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tomato gazpacho with strawberries</strong></h2> \n<p>The cucumber, chilli and oil add savouriness to the tomatoes and strawberries, while the almonds give body (if you’re allergic to nuts, use bread for bulk instead). The soup should be <em>very </em>cold. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>60g blanched almonds</strong><br /><strong>2 fat cloves garlic, peeled, cut in half lengthways and green core removed</strong><br /><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br /><strong>1 small bunch basil (set aside a few leaves to garnish)</strong><br /><strong>1 red chilli, stem removed</strong><br /><strong>1 Lebanese cucumber (or &frac12; a large one)</strong><br /><strong>300g strawberries, stems removed</strong><br /><strong>6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp sherry vinegar</strong><br /><strong>1.2kg very ripe tomatoes</strong></p> \n<p>To serve<br /><strong>2 small Hass avocados, peeled, stoned and diced (do this at the last minute, so they don’t discolour)</strong><br /><strong>A few strawberries, diced</strong><br /><strong>The juice of 1 lime</strong><br /><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>Put a frying pan on a medium heat. Toast the almonds, shaking the pan occasionally, until pale golden and nutty-smelling. Tip into a food processor and blitz with the garlic, a teaspoon of salt, the basil and chilli, until the nuts are ground to dust. Top and tail the cucumber, add to the processor with the strawberries, oil and vinegar, and blitz to a smooth puree. Add the tomatoes and plenty of black pepper, and blitz until smooth – if your food processor is too full, transfer half the mix to a bowl and blitz in two phases.</p> \n<p>Now taste: chilling dulls the flavours, so make sure you can taste all the ingredients, and season with salt, pepper and vinegar as needed; if you like heat, you may want to add another chilli, too, but chop it finely before you whizz it in, so it gets fully incorporated. Pour into a suitable container, cover and chill for a good few hours.</p> \n<p>When you are ready to eat, roll up the reserved basil leaves and shred finely. Put the diced avocado and strawberries in a bowl, season and add the lime juice and a few tablespoons of oil.</p> \n<p>Serve the soup in small bowls (it is very filling) garnished with spoonfuls of avocado and strawberry relish and a scattering of basil.</p> \n<h2><strong>Griddled pork tenderloin with crushed broad beans</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"790bc2f9870da15713020aa24af4d94adce76426\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436268800372/80f85088-03d8-46c2-b6e9-03bf105101b3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' griddled pork tenderloin with crushed broad beans: 'An easy way to impress friends.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ griddled pork tenderloin with crushed broad beans: ‘An easy way to impress friends.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian. Food styling: Emily Kydd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The beans are laced with herbs, poached garlic and lemon, and make a comforting cloak for the juicy, smoky pork. An easy way to impress friends. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>2 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>Sea salt and black pepper</strong><br /><strong>3 bay leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 heaped tsp fennel seeds</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; tsp black peppercorns</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; tsp dried chilli flakes (Turkish, ideally)</strong><br /><strong>A few sprigs fresh thyme, picked and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>A few sprigs fresh rosemary, picked and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong> </strong></p> \n<p><strong>50g dark brown sugar</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp balsamic vinegar</strong><br /><strong>800g pork loin fillet</strong><br /><strong>Olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>For the broad bean puree<br /><strong>4 cloves garlic, peeled, cut in half lengthways and green core removed</strong><br /><strong>2 bay leaves</strong><br /><strong>300ml single cream</strong><br /><strong>400g podded broad beans (fresh or frozen)</strong><br /><strong>A squeeze of lemon</strong><br /><strong>1 handful each fresh dill and mint, picked and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 small handful pine nuts, toasted</strong></p> \n<p>Crush the garlic in a mortar with half a teaspoon of flaky sea salt. Add the bay leaves, fennel, peppercorns and chilli, grind for a few minutes, then work in the herbs. Stir in the sugar and vinegar, then rub into the pork with a few tablespoons of oil. Put in the fridge to marinate for an hour.</p> \n<p>Put the garlic in a pan with the bay and cream, and bring slowly to a boil. Turn down the heat and simmer gently until the garlic is soft, about 10 minutes. Discard the bay and blitz the garlic and cream with a stick blender. Return to the heat and simmer gently while you cook the beans in a pan of salted water for a few minutes, until just tender.</p> \n<p>Drain the beans, add to the cream mix and blitz until half the beans are crushed and the rest retain some shape. Season, add the herbs and a squeeze of lemon, and keep warm.</p> \n<p>Heat a griddle pan on a medium heat. Rub the fillets in oil and season well, then grill for about 10 minutes in all, brushing frequently with the oily marinade, until blackened and glazed all over. Remove from the heat, leave to rest for five minutes, then cut a piece in half – if it needs more cooking, slap it back on the griddle. Cut the fillets into avocado-length slices, then cut each slice diagonally in half. Serve with the warm broad bean mix, the meat’s resting juices, a few extra herbs and a scattering of pine nuts.</p> \n<h2><strong>And for the rest of the week</strong></h2> \n<p>I can drink gazpacho at any time of day, though I particularly like it for breakfast when I’ve overdone things the night before – it’s a really refreshing, and also filling, alternative to toast. The bean puree is gorgeous tossed just as it is into spaghetti; before serving, scatter in a few extra herbs and olive oil to liven it up. Cut leftover pork into wafer-thin slices, and toss into a stir-fry or eat cold for lunch with apple chutney and a few salads.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of Mexican restaurants</a>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/7/1436268649422/Thomasina-Miers-tomato-ga-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Thomasina Miers' tomato gazpacho with strawberries: 'Refreshing.'                 Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.
