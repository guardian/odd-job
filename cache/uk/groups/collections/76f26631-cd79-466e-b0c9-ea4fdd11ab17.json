Was my coffee too hot? Nope – I’d just been smirked at for ordering an “ex-presso”. My only comfort was that I am far from alone. Last month, the US version of the Cambridge Dictionary <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/patricksmith/parmesan-vs-pennsylvania\">was ridiculed for posting an audio link suggesting Parmesan should be pronounced “pen-sal-vane-ear” – yep, Pennsylvania</a>. The internet is awash with blogposts on culinary mispronunciations. For example, the food site Epicurious.com tried to offer a handy list of the <a href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/archive/blogs/editor/2014/06/30-commonly-mispronounced-food-words.html\">30 most commonly mispronounced words</a> last year, only for the comments to be filled with people claiming several were wrong. I expect fierce debate will ensue below the line of this feature, too.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc0f644c2c621de85d2f5992572c88685bbc69ee\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433939698704/3c126db8-9237-45f1-89ec-b4639c941afc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall: 'People can call it \" keen-wa\"=\"\" –=\"\" good=\"\" luck=\"\" to=\"\" them=\"\" but=\"\" i=\"\" won’t=\"\" be=\"\" joining=\"\" in.'\"=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall: ‘People can call it “keen-wa” – good luck to them – but I won’t be joining in.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hartley/REX_Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s hardly surprising when menus these days are such a tongue-twisting minefield; our tastes might be global, but our language skills are struggling to catch up. Even those who work in the food industry stumble over some terms. River Cottage chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall reassures me. “I say ‘ex-presso’,” he says. “I get most of these words wrong. I don’t mind,” he tells me, stoutly. “When quinoa first cropped up 10 years ago, I assumed it was ‘kwin-oa’. Other people can call it ‘keen-wa’ – good luck to them – but I won’t be joining in.” There is one example that makes him furious. “There is a guy I know in the food business who likes the finer things in life,” he tells me. “He calls truffles ‘troofles’. In France, a truffle is a ‘truffe’, but that doesn’t mean in English you pronounce them ‘troofles’. I blame myself that I have never confronted him – but I don’t trust myself. He might try to defend it and I would lose it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c3d6772f0710177831deca8782db63cac6db46d8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433938917886/8bd7c8be-7525-493b-88ed-ff9db02090b6-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A knees-up over gnocchi.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A knees-up over gnocchi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/31/giorgio-locatelli-family-values\">Italian chef Giorgio Locatelli</a>, on the other hand, says mistakes are likely to leave him chuckling. “People say ‘gee-nocchi’ instead of ‘nyocchi’ and, in Italian, that means ‘knees’. That’s fantastic.” But he does have a pet hate – when people say ‘bruschetta’ with a soft ‘shh’ (which I think a fairly easy mistake to make).“That is the one that kills me,” he complains, as I make a mental note never to do this again. “‘Sch’ in Italian is pronounced ‘sk’, so it should be ‘broo-sket-ta’,” he continues. “If I was with a friend, I would correct them, because I would always want people to correct my English.”</p> \n<p>The problem is, even if your pronunciation is perfect, that doesn’t mean you will escape being chastised, as <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/marina-oloughlin\">Guardian restaurant critic Marina O’Loughlin</a> points out. “An actual conversation with a waiter I had recently went like this: Me: ‘I’ll have the broosketta.’ Waiter: ‘One brooshetta, then.’ Me: ‘Yes, the broosketta’. Waiter, kindly, pityingly: ‘Brooshetta it is.’”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/felicity-cloake\">Food writer Felicity Cloake</a> has suffered similarly. “It’s not often that I’m lucky enough to be offered Mo&euml;t &amp; Chandon,” she says. “But since learning that the correct way to pronounce it is with a hard ‘t’ (mo-wett), I tend to avoid saying the name at all, because people often gently repeat it back to me as ‘mo-way’, as if I’m some unsophisticated hick who needs saving from myself.” It’s a middle-class dilemma that has her stumped, she says. “Where do you go from there – copy them to spare their blushes, or carry on regardless?”</p> \n<p>Guardian columnist <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/zoewilliams\">Zoe Williams</a>, who writes restaurant reviews, has the opposite problem. “I remember when I realised ‘scallop’ was pronounced ‘scollop’ – it gave me a real anxiety. When you know one thing is wrong and one is right, you will never get them the right way round. Then I hated myself for caring, because it’s obviously just a posh thing.”</p> \n<p>But she says there is something about the way the English approach foreign languages that escalates the awkwardness. “It’s that unique English pretence of not being pretentious: people who pronounce ‘<a href=\"http://www.lafromagerie.co.uk/ami-du-chambertin/\">Ami du Chambertin</a>’ in perfect French accents are considered despicable, and people who pronounce it wrong are even worse, so you just say ‘that cheese’.” The whole thing is so exhausting that she suggests – only half-jokingly – that we should just return to ordering things by numbers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff6fde6e7a381f36699af0ebef50265c6edbb8a0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433939026738/ece25337-fa87-4407-896d-cca2a4b4a6ca-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake suffers the middle-class dilemma of ‘mo-wett’ v ‘mo-way’\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake suffers the middle-class dilemma of ‘mo-wett’ v ‘mo-way’.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Luckily, when you are the one who runs the restaurant, you can make sure the menu only has easy-to-say words on it – which is an approach championed by <a href=\"https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/contacts_and_people/fergus/\">Fergus Henderson, the founder of St John restaurant</a>. He is happy to confess that there are words he stumbles on. “‘Physalis’ I struggle with – I can barely remember the name, let alone pronounce it,” he tells me. “Mind you, it’s one of those ingredients that turns up on plates where it’s not needed, so it can be safely ignored.” So, what should you do if you are faced with an unpronounceable word? Henderson insists it’s best to “just steam in”, but that, if you think you could really offend someone with your pronunciation, there are ways around it.</p> \n<p>“I find that the best course of action is to mumble. If you go to China, for instance, and there is an egg-fried rice that looks like it is called ‘fuck you’, just mumble.”</p> \n<p>And if this sounds like an unlikely situation, it’s one that <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jayrayner\">food writer Jay Rayner</a> can relate to. “In a restaurant on holiday, in Normandy, I ordered tripe in the local ‘Caen’ style, using my best terrible French,” he says.</p> \n<p>“The waitress sniggered. A French friend leaned across the table and said: ‘You just asked for your tripe to be cooked in the style of a chronic masturbator.’</p> \n<p>“I’m still not quite sure what I mispronounced.”</p> \n<h2>Menu unmentionables<br /></h2> \n<p><strong>Chipotle</strong><br /></p> \n<p>When the Mexican fast-food chain came to the UK, it helped the British out with an advertising campaign teaching the correct pronunciation of its name, derived from the Nahuatl for a smoked and dried jalape&ntilde;o chili pepper. Which you say as “chee-poat-lay”.</p> \n<p><strong>Pho</strong><br />There’s still much debate over the correct pronunciation of this fragrant noodle dish, which originated in Hanoi. Some say the recipe came about under French colonial rule, therefore the name should be pronounced with a long “o”, but the consensus is “fuh”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"213105fcaa588f4710d19b179f06de9ade06ca4d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433940240455/16654580-97e7-4040-8839-c02e6a4310ee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pho, a fragrant noodle dish, which originated in Hanoi.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pho, a fragrant noodle dish, which originated in Hanoi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Edamame</strong><br />When these immature soya beans crossed over from east-Asian cuisine to stud salads in your local M&amp;S, it led to a spate of mispronunciations. “Ed-a-mah-meh” is correct.</p> \n<p><strong>Sriracha</strong><br />The hottest sauce to hit your table in the past few years, this fruity number now graces supermarket aisles and burger chains alike, but people are still saying it wrong. “See-ratch-a”’ is what you want.

But, while it’s the first lesson we’re taught, it’s not the easiest to learn. I routinely undercook soft-boiled eggs, sending my soldiers in to fields of gooey, ectoplasmic horror. I get bored hard-boiling, time it wrong and am rewarded with grey egg flesh. I need saving from myself, and this is where the Egg-Per’fect rolls in. Weirdly, the packaging calls it Egg-Per’fect, with hyphen and apostrophe, to make absolutely certain we’re using the verb form, ie, not PER-fect, but per-FECT. Rococo punctuation and grammatical fixation in a pretend egg? Now I’m paying attention! I pop it in the pan with the other oeufs, and bring the water to boil. It nestles with them, out of place yet comfortable as a cuckoo’s. Unlike egg timers, Egg-Per’fect claims to account for the number and size of your eggs, the amount of water, and altitude you’re cooking at. It doesn’t really, though, does it? It’s just measuring its own temperature (it has the same thermal conductance as an egg), which is affected by those things. It’s not like the car from Knight Rider. Anyway, as it heats up, the central disc darkens, the red portion shrinking along a scale of egg-readiness. You can hoik your eggs out at degrees of soft, medium and hard boiled, and leave the Egg-Per’fect to cool on the counter. There’s no washing, no parts, no preparation. It works! My soft-boiled eggs are yolk-bursters, hard-boiled efforts are creamy and perfectly set. I couldn’t be more pleased with this chunky hero! I’ve taken to referring to it as my love egg, despite being informed this is a bad idea. I was always a slow learner.</p> \n<h2><strong>Any downside?</strong></h2> \n<p>Can be difficult to see the gauge clearly through roiling water, and it has a tendency to flip on to its side. There was also a slight smell the first time I used it, which kind of reminded me I was boiling a lump of plastic with my breakfast.</p> \n<h2><strong>Counter, drawer, back of the cupboard?</strong></h2> \n<p>On the counter.

Patten had suffered a stroke in 2011 which had left her unable to speak. </p> \n<p>Her daughter Judith <a href=\"http://www.olivemagazine.com/just-in/cookery-writer-marguerite-patten-dies-aged-99-obituary/9907.html\">told Olive magazine</a> she had brought her mother her favourite baked custard almost every day in the four years since the stroke. <em>“</em>Only trouble is that I didn’t inherit the genes, and they went from fantastically good to pretty awful,” she said. </p> \n<p>“Thankfully just a few hours before she died she had enjoyed one of my better ones with pureed raspberry and pureed baked apple, two other favourites. She is sadly missed, but I am delighted for her, for she really did hate the past four years!”</p> \n<p>Born Hilda Elsie Marguerite Brown in Bath, Somerset, in 1915, she initially had ambitions to be an actor. But her father died when she was 12, and she developed an interest in cooking to help out at home, as her mother returned to work as a teacher.</p> \n<p>She stressed later in life it was not true that she had been the family’s main chef. “I remember making a rabbit pie. And there was always lots to do in the garden – pick and bottle and jam. But otherwise … homework came first.”</p> \n<p>The queen of “make do and mend” during the war years, Patten began to allow herself a little luxury in her cooking after rationing ended. But she recalled in an <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/24/foodanddrink.baking45\">article in the Guardian</a> how a new rich style of Christmas cake had drawn a complaint to the BBC, after her show was broadcast in 1954.</p> \n<p>“One person did not approve of the recipes, contacted the BBC and demanded it no longer employed me,” she said. “Her reason was that I and Winston Churchill were leading the youth of Britain astray: he because he drank alcohol, and I because I used alcohol in my Christmas cooking.”<br /></p> \n<p>Prue Leith, the chef and founder of the renowned Leiths School of Food and Wine, was a long time friend of Patten, describing her as a woman of “such kindness, who was never an egoist, but always knew exactly who she was”.</p> \n<p>“She was a tiny person; I once remember seeing her on crutches as she arrived to do a broadcast with me, and she’d actually fallen down the gap between the train and the platform, the ‘Mind the Gap’ space,” Leith recalled. </p> \n<p>“It had been horribly painful for her, but they’d pulled her out, and then she carried on with her work for the day. It was the wartime spirit.”</p> \n<p>The modern trend for flavoursome, local and organic food was something Patten admired, Leith said. “She very much approved of all that, because she kept up to date with trends in cooking,” Leith said. “We need many more of her kind.” </p> \n<p>Shaun Hill, the Michelin-starred chef of the Walnut Tree, said Patten’s influence had been “undervalued”.</p> \n<p>“Her books were immensely authentic and eminently practical, and I don’t think she gets the credit for the influence she had,” he said. </p> \n<p>Hill said Patten had the aura of coming from “a more courteous era”, adding: “She was genteel, without any of the negative associations of that word, an unfailing polite and charming woman.”</p> \n<p>Among those to pay tribute to Patten were two hosts of BBC Woman’s Hour, a programme where the chef had been a regular guest. A tribute will be broadcast on Thursday, presenter Jenni Murray said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/janegarvey1/statuses/608603667491614720\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Before everyone else there was Marguerite Patten.

They’re honking with hilarity, phones clicking like dolphins. Who knows what’s causing the mirth – maybe the Buckfast ice-cream (notorious fortified wine, known locally as “Electric Soup”), or the burger topped with Smith’s bacon crisps, or the Irn-Bru pork. The “Mad Chef” at <a href=\"http://bloc.ru/\">Bloc</a> specialises in OTT food designed not so much to be savoured as to cause a commotion. Especially online. His Pot Noodle burger might be revolting, but it is a wholly successful piece of attention-grabbing. Love it or loathe it – and there is a startling number for whom the very idea causes a foam of fury – the marriage of food and social media isn’t going away any time soon.</p> \n<p>The internet has become increasingly food-obsessed since the early days when a slightly fetishistic subculture known as “foodies” would post pictures of <a href=\"http://www.tayyabs.co.uk/\">Tayyabs</a>’s legendary lamb chops on hilariously clunky sites such as <a href=\"http://forums.egullet.org/\">eGullet</a>. Today, it is impossible to scroll through any timeline without encountering other people’s lunches, and, worldwide, there is an increase in dishes that appear to be deliberately engineered to get you snapping before tucking in. Take the <a href=\"http://www.carmelwines.co.il/en/aboutus.aspx\">Carmel Winery</a> in Israel with its Foodography tasting menu, featuring as many flowers and twiddles as you can shake a tweezer at, and its “Limbo” crockery that incorporates a mobile-phone stand. The international chain <a href=\"http://www.chilis.com/EN/Pages/home.aspx\">Chili’s</a> has just appointed a consultancy that came up with egg wash to make its burger buns more photogenic and “shareable”; the cost – <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/instagram-food-taste-study-research/\">a cool $750,000</a>. You’re scoffing? Research suggests<a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CHILIS_PHOTOGENIC_BUNS?SITE=AP\"> that photographing your food makes it taste better</a> (it’s all to do with ritual and savouring).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e6b36a49dc96db131f97e3ef844fa7cafd7cae5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859293548/37b28b1e-82cb-448d-8f2d-096be9381abd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Meat fruit at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meat fruit at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashley Palmer-Watts</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It has been going on for a few years now. In 2011, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2010/dec/02/heston-blumenthal-christmas-canapes-meat\">Heston Blumenthal created his “meat fruit”</a>, a chicken-liver parfait coated in jelly and fashioned into a startling facsimile of a tangerine. This coincided with a massive spike in Twitter usage and, lo, the delicately dimpled orange was everywhere. In the US, Frankenstein creations such as the cronut were tweeted like the second coming. Earlier still, then-young gun David Chang’s nascent empire was fuelled by fans gibbering about his pork buns online. He played to the crowd, and suddenly everyone knew about Taiwanese-style buns. Soon diners were working as unpaid marketeers for their favourite restaurants, a paradigm fully exploited in the UK by clued-up new restaurateurs such as Russell Norman of <a href=\"http://www.polpo.co.uk/\">Polpo</a> and Scott Collins of <a href=\"http://meatliquor.com/\">MeatLiquor</a>.</p> \n<p>Now everyone’s at it. Are these chefs and restaurateurs pulling our strings? The more serious, cerebral types will deny there is any such manipulation at play. When the <a href=\"http://www.chilternfirehouse.com/\">Chiltern Firehouse</a> landed in London, a new star was born: chef Nuno Mendes’ crab doughnuts. Did he know that they were going to be as much of a draw as the chance of clocking Kate Moss? Not according to Mendes: “They were an experiment at [his previous restaurant] Viajante that only saw the light of day when we opened the Firehouse,” he says. “I just didn’t have the right space to serve them. Some ideas stay in your head for years before they find their way out.” I believe him, although I suspect he knows exactly what he’s doing at his new place, <a href=\"http://www.tabernamercado.co.uk/\">Taberna do Mercado</a>, with his twist on <em>abade de priscos</em>, a strikingly visual pudding – yellow and scarlet from its egg yolks and port caramel, given even more of a shareability factor by the addition of pork fat.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f08c80f893ede6e9acc194e7ee4e408e23e4b68e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859101483/397f38d1-2c3b-444d-9363-b0b33c4bdaa2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nuno Mendes' abade de priscos, or pork fat pudding\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nuno Mendes’ abade de priscos, or pork fat pudding.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most of the chefs and restaurateurs I speak to are coy about the idea that they would do anything so calculated. When I ask Jonathan Downey, the orchestrator of a sprawling street-food collective, if any of his team deliberately creates dishes in the hopes of online cult status, he laughs. “My God. I thought I was cynical, but <em>you</em> …” Most profess to be taken aback by the sudden stardom. A contender for the most-Instagrammed dish in the UK at the moment must be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/28/french-toast-the-pudding-of-2015\">Shackfuyu’s <em>kinako</em> french toast</a>; general manager Alina Sann says the sheer popularity of this simple dessert took them completely by surprise. “We have quite a small menu and kitchen, so we wanted something easy to make – but it has taken us way beyond what we ever expected,” she says. So why the fandom? “It looks quite cool, especially with the <em>matcha</em> soft-serve on the side. People started posting pictures … it started getting all the hype, and it’s an easy sell for our waiters because they know everyone will love it.”</p> \n<p>The spectacular confit potatoes at the <a href=\"http://thequalitychophouse.com/\">Quality Chop House</a> are another internet smash (and something <a href=\"https://instagram.com/marinagpoloughlin/\">I’m guilty of Instagramming</a> more than once). Chef Shaun Shearly also credits necessity for their genesis: “They were born on the back of really wanting to stay away from a conventional chip – mostly because of space in my little kitchen, and because people expect that fried carb.” What are the downsides of having such a labour-intensive “star” dish? “With potatoes being so variable in water due to their starch levels, they need constant attention. And I can never take them off the menu, despite them being a complete pain in the arse during service. We can only cook three portions at a time, and they take about four minutes to cook. Most tables order at least three portions at a time.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dfd439fb35da835d580ce3bedd3b289da721ba4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859160488/aece8a5b-676d-4af3-8ee9-3552ae8da1a0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Confit potatoes at the Quality Chop House\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Confit potatoes at the Quality Chop House.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patricia Niven</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So it’s all a happy accident, right? Speak to the publicists, however, and a different story emerges. When I ask Hannah Norris, the PR for a number of the capital’s hottest restaurants, if she advises chefs to deliberately devise dishes to grip the internet by the throat, she says: “Yes, I’d encourage it for sure. Content is key – and having a ‘hero’ dish to shout about is often the difference between a stonking launch and a lukewarm one. If a restaurant asks me to do their PR, one of the first questions is, ‘What’s the glory dish? What’s our <a href=\"http://duckandwaffle.com/\">Duck &amp; Waffle</a>?’ If there isn’t one, I often make my excuses and scurry away.”</p> \n<p>With all the chefly coyness, it is refreshing to speak to Stevie Parle, the owner of the newly opened <a href=\"http://craft-london.co.uk/\">Craft</a> in Greenwich, who is pragmatic about the value of the cult dish. His clay-baked duck actively encourages sharing, not only over dinner but, with his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IZMNy3quzA&amp;feature=youtu.be\">hypnotic video of the bird’s serving ritual</a>, online too. “The duck [served in clay to be smashed at the table] was very conscious,” he says. “Most chefs have always thought about ‘signature’ dishes and generally end up hating them, but now there is an added element of them going viral too.” So they are stuck with them? Yes, says Parle: “I love the duck but it isn’t ever going to be able to come off the menu. And people get really cross if I start smashing it before they’re ready with their cameras.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IZMNy3quzA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4IZMNy3quzA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Franco Sotgiu of Solita in Manchesteralso acknowledges the internet effect. “It pains me to say, but when creating specials I’ve learned that anything with ‘big, fried, bacon or cheese’ in the title sells well. The better they look in a photo on Twitter and Facebook, the more RTs and likes they get, the better they sell.” He is rueful about the side-effects: “In Manchester, ‘dirty’ still sells well, and even though I’ve tried relentlessly to push more grill items and less calorific dishes, the stuff that looks sloppy-great in a photo can often achieve 500-plus RTs on Twitter. So it makes sense from a business point of view to lead with these.”</p> \n<p>It is as simple as bums on seats, then. Instagram snaps are the restaurant’s equivalent of an Amsterdam-style shop window. Viewers scroll through pic after pic, the squelchier, more drooling meat juices on show the better, frequently tagged – ugh – #foodporn. Petra Barran of streetfood collective Kerb says: “Anything oozing melted cheese does really well.” Neil Rankin of the Smokehouse and Bad Egg takes it even further: “Burgers, as long as they are oozy and wet, are a sure thing. Food gets people off without the guilt of objectifying the opposite sex.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2588e7ba41865c8556c05af17f0aa0695968fe57\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859493093/0bc4a537-124b-4c6b-8c4e-b6c6dcb6053b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"St John's doughnuts\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St John’s doughnuts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patricia Niven</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But what’s in it for the tweeters and Instagrammers? The anonymous <a href=\"https://instagram.com/clerkenwellboyec1/\">Clerkenwell Boy</a>, a hugely followed Instagrammer whose account has contributed to the fetishisation of what is frequently dubbed *that* burger or *those* wings, says: “I think there is something fundamentally satisfying about sharing a photo of a brilliant dish with others. I’m no psychologist, but it probably also has links to ‘social proof’ – so posting photos of *that* dish is like providing (and receiving) a universal seal of approval. I guess you could liken it to the way that tourists react when they see a major landmark in a foreign city. Just like the Eiffel Tower or Big Ben, a photo of *that* signature dish means that you’ve arrived.” What does he think it is that captures the imagination so fiercely? “People suffer from massive food envy and fear of missing out. Ordering *that* dish becomes a failsafe way to ensure we don’t make the wrong choice.”</p> \n<p>Not only is there the serotonin rush from watching the likes mount up, but there is the chance of catching the celebs’ eye: a #followoftheday from Nigella or a regram by Jamie. (Nigella’s Instagram of Stevie Parle’s clay duck video has, at the time of writing, more than 2,300 likes.) It creates a circle of validation: the restaurants get the punters, the punters get the likes – behavioural economics. The problem, of course, is that social media is driven by the thrill of the new. Tweeters move on to the next big thing without a backward glance. Six months down the line, there’s a chorus of “we’ve all seen that bloody pithivier”, a mindset that compels chefs and restaurateurs to reach ever more attention-seeking heights, dreaming up the culinary equivalent of Kim Kardashian’s bottom to penetrate the noise. The internet’s appetite for the food rush is insatiable; and if you don’t post that snap of your <a href=\"http://www.crumbsanddoilies.co.uk/\">Crumbs &amp; Doilies</a> cupcake, or doughnut from <a href=\"https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/\">St John</a>, it might not taste as sweet.</p> \n<h2>Eight of the best cult dishes</h2> \n<h2>1. Stevie Parle’s clay-baked duck, <a href=\"http://craft-london.co.uk/\">Craft</a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd08b5a59ed5ae1218edd55b3c579dc514f0c6b7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858033459/33c4b4c8-a8a3-4c71-bcda-193abfbabd18-460x346.jpeg\" alt=\"Clay-baked duck\" width=\"460\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clay-baked duck.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Parle wanted a duck dish to rival the <em>canard &agrave; la presse</em> at <a href=\"http://ottos-restaurant.com/food.html\">Otto’s</a> in terms of occasion and fun. Based on an ancient Celtic cooking technique, it is glazed in honey, and wrapped in cabbage leaves and hay before being roasted in a clay wrapper, then delivered on a bed of pine twigs. It is then smashed open at the table and served with broad bean and barley miso, and salted carrots. Much videoed.</p> \n<h2>2. Shaun Searley’s confit potatoes, <a href=\"http://thequalitychophouse.com/\">Quality Chop House </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a88bd2bde8a07bf8f830021740d3f40ec05bc507\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858093982/f0ceeeb9-4bfc-4b0e-8f3c-8669aa2d4864-460x459.jpeg\" alt=\"Confit potatoes.\" width=\"460\" height=\"459\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Confit potatoes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Thinly sliced potatoes, baked like <em>pommes anna</em> but with dripping instead of butter, then sliced, fried and drizzled with mustard vinaigrette – as delicious as they are complex. Apparently, Shearley played about with a version featuring tunworth cheese and shaved truffle, the sort of thing that may cause one to emit a small moan. The subject of many posts captioned *those* potatoes.</p> \n<h2>3. Wild muntjac biryani, <a href=\"http://www.gymkhanalondon.com/\">Gymkhana </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5036863980e80bf78e840dbd1a39016691c4cb5c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858314804/7aa0f0d1-d790-4fd1-916d-c9cd573e7ac3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Wild muntjac biryani\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wild muntjac biryani.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is the all-action videos of this ravishing creation that add to its shareable appeal. It arrives with a flaky, domed dough lid, studded with <em>kalonji</em>, to be slit open at the table, releasing the bewitching aromas of spiced deer and buttery basmati rice. If only there were Smellagram too. An uncommon, upscale cult dish.</p> \n<h2>4. Blood cake, <a href=\"http://www.baolondon.com/\">Bao</a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a866d88f63f8bca70236b17883bd8ca52658cea1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858459407/06703ddd-2755-4c4f-8e40-4bc5f57f0328-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Blood cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blood cake.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another one Instagrammed by Nigella, thereby assuring its must-eat status. This is a traditional Taiwanese streetfood made from pig’s blood and glutinous rice. Instead of the usual peanut and coriander condiments – which feature in their classic bao – it is topped with a just-wobbling, soy-cured egg yolk. The Bao owners welcome their dishes’ “Instagrammability”, saying it provides immediate, important feedback. But they insist taste is paramount.</p> \n<h2>5. Bacon naan, <a href=\"http://www.dishoom.com/\">Dishoom </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b697a68b737006eb3c201cc65c07e07ee668842a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858515916/97d655a3-3ab3-472d-bd50-5c9789680c54-460x353.jpeg\" alt=\"Bacon naan.\" width=\"460\" height=\"353\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bacon naan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This beauty more than deserves its online fame: a pillowy, gently charred bread stuffed with crisp bacon, cream cheese and tangy chilli-tomato jam. Some add an egg. (A fork piercing yolks in slow-motion is a meme: there are currently 63,307 Instagram post for #eggporn. Sigh.)</p> \n<h2>6. Duck and waffle, <a href=\"http://duckandwaffle.com/\">Duck &amp; Waffle </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3caa3bf3f149e00e3a65c19079e17149d88156e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858581182/3f34216b-67f2-4e76-8382-9a018d74b32b-460x418.jpeg\" alt=\"Duck and waffle\" width=\"460\" height=\"418\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duck and waffle.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nothing ensures hero status so much as calling your whole restaurant after one dish. If diners at this City smash aren’t tweeting the view, they’re Instagramming the crisp, fluffy waffles, flanked with confit duck and fried duck egg, the whole to be drenched with mustard maple syrup. The restaurant goes through a reported 7,000 duck legs a month.</p> \n<h2>7. The dead hippy, <a href=\"http://meatliquor.com/\">MeatLiquor </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73d550ee8c1add432be4f4fbae22af88023f78a5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858663845/5c6747cc-a0c0-45d9-a139-1a1915e3a627-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"Dead Hippy burger\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dead Hippy burger.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MeatLiquor/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>From the early days of Yianni Papoutsis’s MeatWagon burger van in London pub car parks to ambitious worldwide burger domination with MeatLiquor, this is a tribute to – depending on who you believe – <a href=\"http://www.in-n-out.com/\">In-N-Out Burger</a>’s secret, off-menu “double double cheeseburger animal-style” or, more prosaically, the Big Mac. No looker – this brute is downright ugly – but wow, it does the job. One of the UK’s first cult burgers.</p> \n<h2>8.

Not given to restraint, their version is fried in parmesan-laced panko breadcrumbs, topped with bechamel and melted cheese, loaded with meatballs marinara and stuffed into a brioche bun. With chips.

Drinking early in the day doesn’t usually come with such official approbation. We tend to think of morning drinks in extremes – a bloody mary or swift half to provide a much-needed quick fix after a long night, or perhaps bubbles for special occasion breakfasts. However, in many parts of the world, booze at breakfast is seen as a perfectly normal way to start the day. </p> \n<p>The weisswurst fr&uuml;hst&uuml;ck Obama was enjoying is a beery Bavarian stalwart: boiled sausages with mustard, freshly baked pretzels and a cold weissbier, the operative word here being cold. Alcohol in the morning must be fresh and zippy. A bit of fizz, something dry, a hint of sweetness, a sharp kick – as drinks writer <a href=\"https://worldofbooze.wordpress.com/\">Henry Jeffreys</a> puts it, “it’s the pick-me-up that makes you mellow”. Beer or ale for breakfast is not uncommon in the rest of northern Europe, particularly in Belgium – and even, until as late as the 1980s, in England, where breweries would give free drinks to their workers. While this was probably to counter pilfering, it also continued a long tradition of brewers enjoying a hearty brew to start the day, harking back to the “liquid bread” of 16th-century friars. It would seem there is more to an early-morning pint than just hair of the dog.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/may/02/how-to-make-perfect-bloody-mary\">How to make the perfect bloody mary</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Around the Mediterranean, you’ll often see older patrons having a <em>caff&egrave; corretto</em>, the espresso quite literally “corrected” with a shot of something stronger: grappa, sambuca or brandy. It is a habit Mitch Tonks and Mat Prowse adopted at a fish market in Spain 15 years ago; they call it their morning fire. The grappa is sometimes substituted with armagnac, Fernet-Branca or whatever other local spirit the two chefs encounter on their travels. “It takes the body by surprise,” writes Tonks in his new cookbook, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/296071/\">The Seahorse</a>. “We have found that in this moment of lightness and clarity we have made our best decisions.” Which makes <a href=\"http://www.seahorserestaurant.co.uk/\">the Seahorse restaurant</a> staff living proof that drinking in the day might not actually render working minds as useless as you’d think. It’s all about being restrained: “The trick is to have just one glass,” says Tonks, “otherwise the surprise is spoiled.”</p> \n<p>London wine bar Vinoteca has just opened <a href=\"http://www.vinoteca.co.uk/kingscross/\">a Kings Cross branch</a>, the first to serve breakfast. “You don’t have to not drink wine early in the day,” counsels co-owner Brett Woonton. Woonton and his partner, Charlie Young, focused on bottles that would work best with breakfast, plumping for lightness and freshness over full-bodied heft; drinks that would be accessible and approachable. So they have got a pink moscato, the sweet, fruity fizz of which sits handsomely with a plate of pancakes; a slightly frizzante, dry red bonarda that cuts judiciously through the richness of a meaty breakfast; and a German riesling to pair with fresh fruit or muesli.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef460f8300fa256902c808d156f0c0a9ff52dbdb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433841844221/1ca0baaa-cd7b-47fa-9815-e6370aab6346-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Vinoteca in Kings Cross, London, advertises its breakfast wines\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vinoteca in King’s Cross, London, advertises its breakfast wines.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For Woonton, a good breakfast wine should be the oenological equivalent of an early-morning swim: invigorating and enlivening. And that is a strategy tried and tested in Sicily. Food writer <a href=\"https://racheleats.wordpress.com/\">Rachel Roddy</a>, the author of <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/290678/\">Five Quarters</a>, says her partner’s grandfather, a Sicilian farmer, “drank a litre of white with his breakfast of bread and caponata every single morning at six”. That would be followed by a whole lemon, eaten like an apple, before he left the house. “He also drank a litre for lunch,” she continues “and never drank water. He was tiny, without fat, as strong as a horse and he lived until 95.”</p> \n<p>The thought of all that wine, particularly without water, is a terrifying prospect, but there may well be something in it in moderation.

Pod 400g of broad beans (you will probably get about 100g of beans). Bring a deep pan of water to the boil, salt it lightly, then add the beans. Cook for 5-8 minutes depending on size, then drain them and refresh under cold running water.</p> \n<p>Put 150g of white basmati rice in a bowl, cover it with warm water, then rinse it using your fingertips, and pour off the water. Put the rice in a saucepan, add a bay leaf, eight black peppercorns and a couple of cloves. Tuck in a peeled clove of garlic, then cover with twice the volume of water and bring to the boil. Add a little salt, cover tightly and leave to simmer for 10 minutes or until small, deep holes have appeared in the surface. Remove from the heat and leave, covered, for 5 minutes.</p> \n<p>Roughly chop three tablespoons of dill fronds. Remove the lid from the rice, remove the bay leaves and cloves and stir in two-thirds of the chopped dill. Pour four tablespoons of olive into a bowl and season. Add the rest of the dill. Transfer the rice on to a serving plate, add the thick-cut slices of lamb then spoon over the dill dressing. Serves 2.</p> \n<h2>The trick</h2> \n<p>Cold roast meats are best served at room temperature, so remove them from the fridge at least half an hour before serving. Rinse the rice thoroughly in warm water to wash away any loose starch. I do this three times, ensuring the rice grains do not stick. The rice is cooked when deep holes have appeared on the surface and the water has disappeared. Run a fork through the rice before serving to separate the grains.</p> \n<h2>The twist</h2> \n<p>Any cold meat will work here. Add herbs to suit what you have: swap the dill for basil if using roast beef, and use young tarragon leaves for chicken. For pork, try half parsley and half basil with a splash of cider vinegar or lemon juice in with the olive oil.</p> \n<p><br /><em>Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></em></p> \n<p><em>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433252204694/Nigel-Slaters-lamb-with-b-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Have a rice day: Nigel Slater's lamb with basmati rice and dill recipe.

Probably just as well she wasn’t in Uzbekistan</p>","byline":"Leo Benedictus","body":"<p>Sylvie-Agn&egrave;s Bermann must be beginning to wonder why she bothers talking to people from Britain’s opposition parties. Mme Bermann is, you may remember, the French ambassador to this country who was apparently <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/SNP/11515276/Revealed-Full-text-of-Nicola-Sturgeon-memo.html\">told by Nicola Sturgeon that she “didn’t see Ed Miliband as PM material”</a>, according to a leaked memo. Now it emerges – or apparently emerges – that Bermann herself has <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3113894/It-s-biscuitgate-French-diplomats-turn-noses-afternoon-tea-visit-Commons-Labour.html\">put some backs up in the office of Hilary Benn</a>, Labour’s foreign affairs spokesman.</p> \n<p>According to “a well-placed source”, the Mail on Sunday assures us, Bermann and her team were unhappy with the refreshments during a recent visit. “It was incredible,” the unidentified person says. “Hilary’s team could not have been more polite but the French kicked up a fuss because they were served biscuits.” A spokesperson at the French embassy denied the story with the rather underwhelming words: “She remembered the biscuits and told me they were fine.” A Labour Party spokesperson also denied the incident happened: “No such comment was made.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6ec98b63450b97ed34a0a0dd78424a07c5db801\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433775221548/d4992416-cc28-4161-9ba2-e0b299d8497b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The French ambassador to Britain, Sylvie-Agn&egrave;s Bermann\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The French ambassador to Britain, Sylvie-Agn&egrave;s Bermann, ‘remembered the biscuits’.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What the report leaves out, however, is how unreasonable serving biscuits to an ambassador, or complaining about them, would actually be. Really, the rules are the same as for any guest: you politely accept whatever your host gives you, according to <a href=\"https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/about-craig-murray/\">Craig Murray</a>, Britain’s former ambassador to Uzbekistan. Even so, it does make a difference what time of day the meeting took place, and whether it covered a mealtime. “Ambassadors, if they are given lunch, expect to be given an extremely good lunch, and extremely good wine,” Murray says. “But if it’s purely a working thing, tea and biscuits happened to me many times. There’s not anything strange about it.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, the real test for ambassadors all over the world is not the meagre snacks they must put up with, it is the great banquets they have to eat. Last year, Matthew Barzun, the US ambassador in London, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/us-ambassador-to-britain-gets-roasting-from-chefs-after-banning-lamb-and-potatoes-9704719.html\">complained that, “I must have had lamb and potatoes 180 times since I have been here.”</a> He might crave a 181st, however, should he ever be posted to Tashkent. “I recall a lamb foetus,” Murray says. “And also a sheep’s head and being told, ‘You should take out the eye and eat the eye as the first thing.’ Those kinds of things happen all the time.” And how do you handle them? “With the eye, I explained that this was culturally very difficult for me and excused myself, which is probably terribly bad behaviour on my part. The foetus, I just kind of picked at.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> This article was amended on 9 June 2015 to add a Labour party statement that no complaint was made about the biscuits.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433775347388/f1dbc6d9-6de8-43d2-b3cf-2ec34b69180e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"mug of tea and biscuits","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433775222880/d4992416-cc28-4161-9ba2-e0b299d8497b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The French ambassador to Britain, Sylvie-Agnès Bermann, ‘remembered the biscuits’.
