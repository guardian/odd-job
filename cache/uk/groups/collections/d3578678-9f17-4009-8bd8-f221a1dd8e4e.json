How times have changed. We mention this reminiscence not to waste your time, readers, but to make a point (see, times really have changed), although the point has already been made much more eloquently by others (OK, OK, times haven’t changed).</p> \n<p>The point, in case you’re interested, is that it’s hard doing something for the first time. The footballers of the Federated States of Micronesia have been putting forward that case well this week at the Pacific Games in Papua New Guinea. Sadly, that is about all they’ve been doing well. Because after a 30-0 defeat to Tahiti in their opening match at a tournament that doubles as the qualifiers for Big Sports Day, Micronesia lost 38-0 to Fiji and then, this morning, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/07/micronesia-defeat-46-vanuatu-pacific-games\">were edged out 46-0 by Vanuatu</a>, although, in fairness, there was a suspicion of offside about Vanuatu’s 27<sup>th</sup> goal and it looked like there could have been a foul in the buildup to their 43<sup>rd</sup>. But Micronesia coach Stan Foster, betraying his inexperience, refused to blame the referee.</p> \n<p>“It was boys against men,” confessed Foster, who may (or may not) have frizzy hair and a headband but is not a famous former Luton Town centre-half. Instead he is the manager of a hastily-assembled bunch of players who until this tournament had never played on a full-size pitch. “Most of these have never been out of their villages let alone on to another island,” shrugged Foster. “I took them to Guam the other day [and it was] the first time they’ve been on an elevator or an escalator. It’s been a huge step up for these guys and they’ve just been overawed really.” As the Fiver was waiting for Brendan Rodgers to venture that apart from conceding 114 goals in three games, Micronesia’s performances have been outstanding, Foster added: “It’s just so hard at this early stage – this is kindergarten for us. We have to learn and to know that when we go back we have to train harder and learn more skills.”</p> \n<p>Vanuatu’s win, in which striker Jean Kaltack put in a strong bid for the Golden Boot award by plundering 16 goals, including three in first-half stoppage time, is being hailed by organisers as the biggest in international football history, but it is unlikely to be counted as such officially, since the tournament is only for U-23s and Micronesia are not affiliated to Fifa. So, officially, the highest international score remains the 31-0 soccerooing that flamin’ Australia inflicted on American Samoa in 2001. The Samoans learned the lessons from that defeat and later registered their first-ever victory against Tonga – 10 years later, admittedly, but still, it suggests that what looks like an utterly senseless massacre is in fact a platform on which to build. And rest assured, if ever there was a far-flung archipelago nation that resembled a fearsome indestructible cyborg, it’s the Federated States of Micronesia. They will be back. “I’ve been assured that we’ll be allowed to come back and that they’re aware that this is a development squad,” hurrahed Foster after hearing that tournament organisers have not written off an entire 607-island country on the basis of three bad results and no footballing infrastructure to speak of. “That was a big relief for me because I was really worried the organisers would take us out of the competition because of our scores.”</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bffdbbe95a693be8f7f1f1962c7cf4588bfe19c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436278916721/2ec88306-88a6-4555-8d38-6dd7e0678bfa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Luis\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I fell into him!’</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“When I was writing the book Luis Su&aacute;rez had been in trouble again for biting another opponent.

You are Oblivious to the fact that I feel as though you’ve plunged a Knife into my back but fortunately Somewhere in my Heart I can find forgiveness for you (I could go on, but will spare you)” – Mark Oliver. </p> \n<p>“Your Charlie Adam/Aztec Camera comparison is spot on (yesterday’s Fiver). Roddy Frame is delicate, profound, light of touch and a joy to behold and should be held up as a thing of beauty. Just like … oh” – Sam Carpenter.</p> \n<p>“Re: 4,000 year-old kanji (yesterday’s Quote of the Day). As always, we can expect the very best of research from The Fiver. As anyone interested in languages (or 30 second Google search) could tell you, Kanji is the name given to the Chinese ‘hanzi’ adopted by Japan around 1,500 years ago. The initial representations that became hanzi actually started around 3,200 years ago. It almost feels like you just make it all up as you go along (or do it deliberately just to fill the letters section)“ – Craig Hills (and no others).</p> \n<p>“I’m sorry Graham Smith seemed quite so angry (yesterday’s letters), and I worry that my email on Friday may have pushed him over the edge. A couple of points of order, though. Firstly, although comic understatement is one of my many gifts, I would suggest it’s a substantial leap from ‘Supporting Liverpool has had its ups and downs’ to ‘A lifetime of pain and misery’. Secondly, I didn’t deny that Liverpool’s success had anything to do with my fandom. In fact, the <em>whole point of my email</em> was that we had no geographical or any other ties to these teams, so picking a team involved a certain amount of glory hunting. Thirdly, well, actually, I agree with his other point. His email wasn’t funny. So, inaccurate and unfunny? Maybe he should start writing for the Fiver” – Matt Dony.<br /></p> \n<p>‘Send your letters to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@theguardian.com\">the.boss@theguardian.com</a>.

Kevin De Bruyne to Manchester City? James McCarthy to Spurs?","standFirst":"Today’s Mill is awash with treasure stashes","byline":"Paul Doyle","body":"<p>The Mill has never paid much attention to <strong>&Aacute;ngel Di Mar&iacute;a</strong>’s tattoos and nor, presumably has Louis van Gaal. And that might just be where we’re both going wrong. Because suspicions have been aroused this morning that there is more to the Argentinian’s inkwork than meets the eye, which is just as well because all that meets the eye is a collection of stars, numbers and smudges that look awfully like nearly everyone else’s tattoos. But here’s the thing: when Di Mar&iacute;a is placed under a special infra-red light, his body art actually contains coded clues to the location of an unimaginably vast treasure stash that hunters have been seeking for centuries.</p> \n<p>That, at any rate, is what the Mill has deduced from reports that <strong>Bayern Munich</strong> have grown so desperate to get their clutches on Di Mar&iacute;a that, in return, they are willing to offer Manchester United a large sum of cash, <strong>Arjen Robben</strong> and <strong>Thomas M&uuml;ller</strong>! And some reports go so far as to claim that the German club may even throw <strong>Bastian Schweinsteiger</strong> into the deal, too! Heck, if United stand their ground they may even be able to get Bayern to add Manuel Neuer, Pep Guardiola, a fleet of BMWs and the Hofbr&auml;uhaus.</p> \n<p><strong>Manchester City</strong>, meanwhile, are going to have to fork out a small treasure stash of their own if they are to land <strong>Kevin De Bruyne</strong>, especially now that Paris Saint-Germain have made the Belgian their No1 target. PSG are also complicating City’s quiet pursuit of <strong>Hachim Mastour</strong>, with the French club now the favourite to prise the 17-year-old Moroccan from Milan. But City aren’t going to dwell on that disappointment, instead they’re going to engage in more retail therapy and return to Anfield to give Liverpool the &pound;50m they want for Raheem Sterling. Better batten down the hatches, Southampton.</p> \n<p>Chelsea, Arsenal and Real Madrid are all linked with the Napoli left-back <strong>Faouzi Ghoulam</strong>, who has shown the skills he learned at the ever popular Footballer Media Training course by giving a textbook recital of the “flattered to hear about it, but just concentrating on my job” response to such speculation.</p> \n<p>Question: if Ryan Mason is as good as some fans claim, how come <strong>Spurs </strong>are plotting a bid of &pound;20m plus Aaron Lennon for <strong>Everton’s James McCarthy</strong>? And here’s another question: is the Mill right to be utterly bemused by reports that at least five clubs are preparing bids of up to &pound;15m for <strong>Andros Townsend</strong>? Explanations have yet to be provided by West Ham, Aston Villa, Swansea, Newcastle or Sunderland. One report this morning has gone so far as to claim that Spurs are unwilling to let the winger go for so little. The Mill has obviously drunk too much. Or not enough.</p> \n<p>Everton, meanwhile, fancy the Juventus centre-back <strong>Angelo Ogbonna</strong>, but will have to do battle with West Ham to get him.</p> \n<p>That David De Gea-Hugo Lloris chain reaction might be about to kick in, as <strong>Iker Casillas</strong> is poised to leave Real Madrid for Porto. Lyon are lining up another offer for the Marseille centre-back<strong> Nicolas N’koulou</strong>. West Ham’s <strong>Stewart Downing</strong> is heading northwards, either to Sunderland or Middlesbrough.</p> \n<p><strong>Esteban Cambiasso</strong>, who has yet to sign a new deal with Leicester, could soon be part of Mark Hughes’s Stoke revamp. And so could Reading’s Ali al-Habsi, who will be drafted in as Jack Butland’s deputy if <strong>Asmir Begovic</strong> gets his dream move to become Thibaut Courtois’ deputy at Chelsea.</p> \n<p>Finally, goodbye.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/7/7/1436254461008/Angel-Di-Mar-a-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ángel Di María launches his come-and-get-my-tattoos plea.

Farah has bullishly maintained his cleanness and is sticking by Salazar for now, and no doubt Britain’s double Olympic champion will be happy to focus firmly on the track as he prepares for next month’s world championships. The men’s 100m will still be fascinating without Bolt, with Justin Gatlin, Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay lining up.</p> \n<h2>ROSE’S DEFENCE …<br /></h2> \n<p>Gullane is the venue for this year’s <strong>Scottish Open</strong>, beginning on Thursday (Sky Sports 4). Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickleson, Ian Poulter and Luke Donald will all compete, along with last year’s champion, Justin Rose. The Englishman Rose has had an up and down year, with his runners-up place at the Masters being counterbalanced by a disappointing showing at the US Open, and he will hope to ensure he is in form for the Open at St Andrews by picking up his second title of the year, following his Zurich Classic triumph in April. Also competing will be the 1999 champion, Colin Montgomerie, who will hope the familiarity of his home tournament will wash away the memory of his failed attempt to qualify for the Open.</p> \n<h2>YET MORE FOOTBALL …<br /></h2> \n<p>The close season no longer means a footballing famine for supporters desperately staring at their calendars, trying to will the new season into existence. Instead, those who will follow the Women’s World Cup to its conclusion tonight (midnight, BBC Two) will be pleased to hear there is more footballing action from North America with the first game of the <strong>Gold Cup</strong> on Wednesday (midnight, BT Sport 2) with the glamour tie of... Panama v Haiti. Yes, really: those in the know when it comes to Concacaf have Panama (pop. 3.6m) down as the region’s rising force. Finalists in 2013, <em>Los Canaleros </em>(you guessed it, the Canalmen) are hotly tipped to go one better this time.</p> \n<h2>CRICKETING MINNOWS …<br /></h2> \n<p>English (and Welsh) focus will be squarely on Cardiff this week, but it is an important time for Scottish cricket too, as they begin their <strong>qualification campaign for the ICC World T20 </strong>on Thursday against the United Arab Emirates (10am, Sky Sports 3 HD). The tournament is co-hosted by Scotland and Ireland, meaning they will start as favourites to reach the finals tournament in India next year. Of the 14 nations taking part, six will make it. Among those nations in with a sniff of glory are some more recognisable minor cricketing nations, such as Afghanistan and the Netherlands, but also Oman, Papua New Guinea and Jersey.</p> \n<h2>BROLLY SELLERS …<br /></h2> \n<p>Few fans had a more chastening season last year than Newcastle’s. But after Alan Pardew (hounded out) and John Carver (hapless) comes Steve McClaren (brolly at the ready) and perhaps a new era for football on the Tyne. A <strong>friendly against Gateshead </strong>at the International Stadium on Friday (8pm) should feature a raft of new young blood in the old black and white stripes, including Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles. The appointment of the ex-England manager has divided opinion on Tyneside, so here is a chance to make a favourable first impression. Just pray it doesn’t rain.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435925838066/Mo-Farah-and-Usain-Bolt-F-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mo Farah will be at Zurich for the Diamond League meet on Thursday but Usain Bolt is missing from a strong 100m field.

You’ve never seen anything like it.”</h2> \n<p><em>Don Bradman to his team-mates, Trent Bridge, 1938</em></p> \n<p>The 29-year-old Donald Bradman was as giddy and restless as a newborn pup. Stanley Joseph McCabe, his Australia team-mate, was giving a demonstration of rare genius in the first Ashes Test at Trent Bridge, and Bradman urgently implored the rest of the team to take the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to watch his innings. It was almost too much for Bradman. “Towards the end I could scarcely watch the play,” he said. “My eyes were filled as I drank in the glory of his shots.”</p> \n<p>Australia were in significant trouble after slipping to 194 for six, still 464 runs behind, but McCabe was easing into the innings that would define him. He scored 232 out of 300 while at the wicket, including 72 in the final 28 minutes and 44 off three overs from the leg-spinner Doug Wright. Neville Cardus said he “batted with the ease of a man using a master key … McCabe demolished the English attack with aristocratic politeness, good taste and reserve. Claude Duval never took possession of a stagecoach with more charm of manner than this.” McCabe scored 127 runs in a single session, still an Ashes record.</p> \n<p>“I gripped his hand, wet with perspiration,” said Bradman. “He was trembling like a thoroughbred racehorse. I can recall saying to him after expressing my congratulations: ‘I would give a great deal to be able to play another innings like that.’ No skipper was ever more sincere in his adulation of another’s skill.” Bradman was still raving about it over a decade later. “I firmly believe it to be the greatest innings ever played,” he said in Farewell to Cricket. “Such cricket I shall never see again.”</p> \n<h2>2) “Ashes to Ashes, dust to dust, if Thomson don’t get ya, Lillee must.”</h2> \n<p><em>A Sydney Daily Telegraph cartoon caption during the 1974-75 Ashes</em></p> \n<p>Dennis Lillee didn’t have a face like thunder; he had a face like the apocalypse. Seconds earlier he had been on his backside on the Brisbane pitch, having lost both his wicket and his dignity when he fell over as he top-edged a Tony Greig bouncer. As Lillee started to stomp off, a picture of affronted pride, Greig reminded him where the facilities were and how appropriate a refreshing shower might be in the circumstances. Lillee looked at him and barked: “Just remember who started this.”</p> \n<p>For the next few minutes Lillee was like a stuck record. “Just remember who started this,” he hissed repeatedly at his captain, Ian Chappell, who had no idea what Lillee was talking about. It became clearer when Lillee announced: “Just remember who started this: those bastards. But we’ll finish it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99d0a6310d042ed9a4df40a12ae650f964241c1a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435920374755/813c8fa0-f0e3-4cdb-85ae-a83ed97e3fcd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dennis Lillee has always been keen to point out that England started the bouncer war of 1974–75.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Lillee has always been keen to point out that England started the bouncer war of 1974–75.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lillee has always been keen to point out that England started the bouncer war of 1974–75. “It’s like the song We Didn’t Start the Fire,” he later said, continuing a long line of Billy Joel references in Ashes cricket. “People often remember who did the damage, not who started the fire.”</p> \n<p>In the first Test of the series at Brisbane, more than half the Australia team were out hooking in the home side’s first innings of 309, though it was Greig’s decision to bounce Lillee, a lower-order batsman, that really stirred the hornets’ nest. Lillee, who had clearly been intending to diligently bowl line and length until then, took the first ball of the England innings, and his runup began from somewhere inside the sightscreen. “Mate, it was full-on war,” said Jeff Thomson, “and we gave it to them.”</p> \n<p>The original plan was for Lillee to share the new ball with Max Walker, so that the tearaway Thomson could bowl with the wind after Lillee. But Chappell, sensing something in the air, decided at the last second to let Thomson share the new ball.</p> \n<p>“For the next few overs,” said Chappell, “I looked on in awe.” When Rodney Marsh leapt to claim a Thomson bouncer, the wicketkeeper started wringing his hand in pain before realising the implications for England. “Hell, that hurt,” he said to Chappell, “but I love it.”</p> \n<p>England were soon 57 for four and in trouble; the captain, Mike Denness, upon being dismissed, took off his shirt and discovered that a bouncer had actually embedded his St Christopher medallion in his chest. Dennis Amiss had a thumb cracked by Thomson and John Edrich a hand broken by Lillee.</p> \n<p>As would happen in 2013–14, a group of experienced batsmen never recovered from the shock of being assaulted so savagely in the first innings of the series at Brisbane.</p> \n<p>“Thommo was by far the quickest bowler I’ve ever seen or opposed,” said his future team-mate Kim Hughes. “Thommo didn’t go to any academy, he just grabbed the ball and wanted to kill some prick … he was as far ahead of any other bowler for sheer speed as [Don] Bradman was for runs.”</p> \n<p>With his mustachioed fellow-assassin Lillee, Thommo simply brutalised England in 1974–75. “Lillee and Thomson remain a combination to conjure with, as sinister in England as Burke and Hare, or Bismarck and Tirpitz,” Gideon Haigh has written. They will always tell you they didn’t start the fire, but they sure as hell poured industrial quantities of petrol on to it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTaVRuxje80\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTaVRuxje80?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>3) “Let’s give it some humpty”</h2> \n<p><em>Ian Botham to Graham Dilley, Headingley, 1981</em></p> \n<p>It was only because England had lost the Headingley Test of 1981 that they were able to win it. They had given up, and with that came the blessed freedom of the damned. The miracle started not when Ian Botham came to the crease in the second innings, but when he was joined soon after by the startlingly blond Kent fast bowler Graham Dilley. On a wicket full of booby traps, England trailed Australia by 92 with three wickets remaining, having been forced to follow on. They had already booked out of the team hotel and Ladbrokes had offered 500-1 on an England victory.</p> \n<p>With England already 1-0 down in the six-match series, the noble thing might have been to knuckle down and lose with a bit of honour. That was also the boring option, and after the year he’d had, Botham was due a bit of fun. “You don’t fancy hanging around on this wicket for a day and a half, do you?” he said to Dilley, who concurred. “Right. Come on, let’s give it some humpty.”</p> \n<p>Before the humpty had come the great fall, with Botham resigning as England captain after the drawn second Test at Lord’s. Mike Brearley came out of international retirement to become England’s emergency captain. He found out that he had been chosen via a reverse-charge phone call, because the chairman of selectors, Alec Bedser, had run out of coins. Botham, without the psychological backpack weighing him down, started to enjoy his cricket again. His relationship with Brearley certainly helped. If Brearley had a degree in people, then he had a PhD in Botham. “He needs a father figure, and I need a younger brother,” said Brearley.</p> \n<p>Although Botham struck an unfettered 50, England were dismissed for 174 in reply to 401 for nine declared and forced to follow on. That Saturday evening, with the rest day to follow, Botham invited both sides to his house at Epworth, near Doncaster, for a barbecue. An epic night’s drinking – led by Botham, whose form in this sphere never fluctuated – ended with the players of both sides having a rugby scrum on the lawn in the small hours.</p> \n<p>When play resumed on the Monday, Australia looked set for a quick kill. England were 105 for five when Botham came to the wicket and 135 for seven soon after. By then, Dennis Lillee and Rodney Marsh had famously bet against their own team, putting a small wager on England. “Being a small-time punter, I had been unable to resist the juicy 500-1,” Lillee would say. “It was as simple as that. I have never had any qualms over the matter and I have never lost a moment’s sleep because of it.”</p> \n<p>He’ll have lost plenty of sleep over what happened once England started to give it some humpty. “I guess I never will come to terms with it,” Lillee has said. Botham mixed agricultural mows with classical batsmanship. At times he played in the V – the V between third man and fine leg, as the ball flew off the edge of another lusty yahoo. “Bloody lucky innings,” sniffed Lillee. “I expected to get him out virtually every ball.”</p> \n<p>What started as a bit of fun for England imperceptibly morphed into something more serious as the day progressed, but by then Botham had no inclination or need to sober up his approach. He made a cathartic century, with vital support from Chris Old, and overall his 149 not out from 148 balls included 27 fours and one unforgettable six.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkvgiZJkhM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkkvgiZJkhM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Botham dragged England back into the game off his own bat – or rather Graham Gooch’s. Botham had borrowed Gooch’s bat on the spur of the moment, fancying a heavier weapon than usual. “He hadn’t used it much in the match, and I thought there were a few runs left in it.” With his borrowed bat, he hit the ball like he wanted to kill it.</p> \n<p>In the final session on the fourth day England plundered 175 runs in 27 overs. At the close, the England wicketkeeper Bob Taylor went into the Australia dressing room with some bats for them to sign, only to be told: “Fuck off with your fucking bats.”</p> \n<p>Even with Botham’s heroics, Australia needed only 130 to win and go 2–0 ahead with three to play. At 56 for one, they were cruising. Willis was preoccupied with no-balls – he had bowled 32 in the previous Test at Lord’s – and did not enjoy bowling up the hill. Brearley allowed him to switch ends so that he was going downhill with the wind at his back. “Let me worry about the no-balls,” he told Willis. “Just run up and bowl fast and straight.”</p> \n<p>Willis soon dismissed Trevor Chappell, caught behind fending off a throat ball. There was no celebration, just a quick turn and walk back to his mark. Even when he picked up Hughes and Graham Yallop for ducks in the same over soon after, there was not a hint of joy. Every sportsman dreams of being in the zone; Willis was, but this was a different kind of zone. “I looked into his eyes and it was like there was nobody there,” said Dilley.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-02e50ce8-8017-4bef-83d6-ce318edf3c55\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435889255591/d49c5615-6e50-4cf2-9797-42ae91097a43-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Graham Dilley is congratulated by Ian Botham\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham Dilley is congratulated by Ian Botham after reaching his fifty during England’s second innings.

After lunch he continued to charge in – “I don’t go as far as that on my holidays,” said one former Test bowler of his runup – and, before anybody knew what was happening, Australia were 75 for eight. Across the nation it had become an unofficial bank holiday. The Stock Exchange stopped, while the best vantage points outside Headingley were the ones by the windows of Radio Rentals stores, where groups of people watched the developing drama.</p> \n<p>Lillee and Ray Bright fought against the rising tide with a quick-witted partnership of 35 in four overs. Australia were 110 for eight, 20 from victory, when Lillee mis-hit Willis towards mid-on. Mike Gatting, not necessarily the man you would want in such circumstances, ran in and took a fine low catch. In the next over, from Botham, Old dropped two sharp chances at slip. It did not matter: Willis pegged back Bright’s middle stump to complete the most famous victory in Ashes history. He finished with figures of eight for 43.</p> \n<p>Finally there was a celebration, as Willis thrust his hands in the air, but even then it was more a kind of dead-eyed relief than an expression of joy. He turned on his heels to run back to his mark, realised there was no more work to do and ran in a circle before haring for the pavilion.</p> \n<p>Later that day Brearley received a telegram from Spike Milligan. “Marvellous – have my ticket for the wedding,” it read, in reference to the marriage of Charles and Diana a week later, to which the Goons-fan groom had invited him. The match was later voted Britain’s favourite sporting moment. England, 500-1 at one stage, had won by 18 runs. They had not just come back from the dead; they had come back from a cremation.</p> \n<h2>4) “In my day 58 beers between London and Sydney would have virtually classified you as a teetotaller.”</h2> \n<p><em>Ian Chappell on David Boon’s drinking, 1989</em></p> \n<p>There was an abnormal amount of travel sickness on the Qantas flight to London, and approximately 99.94% of it was self-inflicted. As it descended towards Heathrow airport, the plane’s captain addressed his passengers in the usual style. “Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to London where it is six degrees outside,” he said. “I want to wish the Australian team all the best. I know they’ll do very well because David Boon has just broken the record, 52 cans from Sydney to London.”</p> \n<p>Boon has always denied the story – “If people haven’t got something else to talk about they have led a fucking boring life,” he said in 2006 – but there are enough witnesses, one or two of them sober, to suggest that it happened. The teetotal Geoff Lawson, who kept score on the back of some sick bags, wished he had kept what would have been the ultimate in alternative Ashes memorabilia. Some were not worth keeping. “The very instant we pulled up at our allotted gate,” recalled Steve Waugh, “Tim Zoehrer lurched forward and filled up the sick bag to christen our tour.”</p> \n<p>Boon was aiming to beat the record of 45 cans, established by Rodney Marsh on the way to the World Cup in 1983. He didn’t just take the record; he obliterated it. And he obliterated himself. The middle-order batsman Dean Jones acted as pace-setter for much of the 24-hour flight. His father had told him to spend the journey picking the brain of somebody who had already played in England. The only thing Jones soaked up were about 25 cans on the way to the first stop-off in Singapore. At that point he was helped into an impromptu bed, “pissed as a fart”. With Jones out of action, a number of other players took turns to sit alongside Boon and sink a few to help him on his way. It was a very early example of squad rotation.</p> \n<p>When Australia landed, Merv Hughes gave a radio interview back home and jauntily informed everyone of what had occurred. “The big news is that Boonie’s cracked the first 50 of the tour!” This did not please the coach, Bob Simpson, who had hoped that what happened on the plane would stay on the plane. “I got in more trouble than the protagonist,” Hughes said. “I was shitting myself that I’d be sent home.”</p> \n<p>Boon, who became known as the “Keg on Legs”, was fined $5,000 – a lot for an international cricketer in 1989 – and put on probation. Simpson was not the only Australian who was unimpressed. Ian Chappell had been informed that Boon had drunk 58 cans, rather than 52, yet even that was not enough. “What is the world going to think? That Australia has become a namby-pamby nation which doesn’t know how to drink? For God’s sake, in my day fifty-eight beers between Sydney and London would virtually have classified you as a teetotaller.”</p> \n<p>Throughout the 1989 tour of England, Australia were emphatic proof that there are no team-bonding agents as powerful as alcohol and victory. A number of the players get almost misty-eyed when they talk about 1989. Ian Healey said: “The spirit in the team was as good as anything I’ve ever been involved in.”</p> \n<h2>5) “All the palaver caused me to burn my toast”</h2> \n<p><em>Duncan Fletcher on the Trent Bridge Test of 2005</em></p> \n<p>Ricky Ponting was chuntering to everyone and no one, his face a picture of affronted dismay. As he walked off the field, absent-mindedly removing his gloves while swearing in all directions, it was as much as he could do not to grit his teeth to breaking point. When he reached the pavilion steps, Ponting – still with his helmet on, as if he couldn’t quite bring himself to take off his work clothes and fully acknowledge his innings was over – snapped his head and started shouting abuse in a specific direction, and at a specific person on the England balcony. In a series full of symbolic moments, this was the biggest of all; the moment England knew Australia had cracked.</p> \n<p>After making Australia follow on for the first time in 17 years, England were having a tougher time getting them out a second time. Australia were 155 for two, 104 behind, and Ponting was looking ominously set on 48. Damien Martyn called Ponting for a tight single on the off side, and the substitute Gary Pratt – on for the injured Simon Jones – threw down the stumps with dead-eyed certainty. Ponting’s exasperation at getting out in such a manner at such a time was great enough, even before he realised he had been run out by a substitute.</p> \n<p>Australia had been irritated throughout the series by England’s habit of using substitute fielders, apparently to give their bowlers a rest after a long spell; it was a legitimate complaint – England clearly bent the rules – but in this case Jones was genuinely injured.</p> \n<p>Ponting did not know that and all the frustration and pressure came out in five seconds of ranting at Fletcher on the balcony. Fletcher was sufficiently distracted by events that he burnt his toast in the dressing room, though it was clear he loved every second of Ponting’s outburst. “If you want to take a run to the cover fielder and get out, whose fault is that?” he said at the close of play.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nofkoClevE\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9nofkoClevE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The tourists battled on to 387 – Simon Katich got an appalling lbw decision after resisting over four hours for 59 – which left England needing 129 to go ahead in the series. It turned into the kind of run-chase that ages people by 10 years. Shane Warne raged majestically against the dying of the light, reducing England to 57 for four. Kevin Pietersen and Flintoff calmed things down with a partnership of 46 before Lee dismissed both, with Flintoff bowled by a stunning delivery.</p> \n<p>England, in control throughout the match, now faced the very real prospect of losing – which would have ended the drama at a stroke, because Australia would have gone 2–1 up with one to play and retained the urn.</p> \n<p>When Geraint Jones skied Warne to mid-off, England were 116 for seven, 13 short of victory. Hoggard loafed out to join Ashley Giles and said: “Come on, let’s me and you get it done.” Giles’s reply – “It’s reversing at 95mph” – did not quite maintain the mood of cheery certainty. But they did get it done, just about. The crowd greeted Hoggard’s cover-driven four off Lee like the announcement of world peace, and soon after Giles hit the winning runs. “Whether we win or lose, we relish creating a bit of an arse-nipper,” he said. The biggest of them all, the series decider, was yet to come.</p> \n<h2>6) “Get ready for a broken fucking arm”</h2> \n<p><em>Michael Clarke to James Anderson, Brisbane, 2013-14</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f9fb877e-ed9a-4629-8c5d-678aab8b7c60\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435889771565/37ece762-5780-4770-90ef-f61dc73e9552-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Michael Clarke and James Anderson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Clarke and James Anderson exchange words during the first Ashes Test between Australia and England on 24 November, 2013 in Brisbane.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mitchell Johnson waited at the end of his mark. And waited some more. James Anderson, the batsman in his sights, moved out of his crease to prepare himself for the imminent assault. As he did so, he began to exchange unpleasantries with George Bailey, Australia’s short leg. Michael Clarke, the Australia captain, walked towards the incident and was met halfway by Anderson, where they had a full and frank exchange of views. After a few seconds, Clarke began to walk backwards to his position and uttered the words that would shape an Ashes series.</p> \n<p>Clarke’s threat to Anderson, which was picked up by the stump mic, cost him 20% of his match fee. It was worth every penny. It changed the way he was perceived by many among the Australian public; more important, it told England that Australia would stop at almost nothing to regain the Ashes. They were about to go 1–0 up in the series, and Clarke sensed the opportunity to score some points for the four remaining Tests.</p> \n<p>The tenor of the contest had changed so much from the previous series that Clarke wanted to ram home the point that England were now on Australia’s manor, and were playing by their rules. It might have backfired; Anderson might have taken 10-for in the next Test, but Clarke’s instinct told him that England were vulnerable.</p> \n<p>Shane Warne later said that the stump mic was switched off – but still accessible for the commentators – seconds earlier when Anderson told Bailey that he wanted to punch him in the face. “Anderson brought it on himself,” said the Australia bowler Peter Siddle after the game, without going into specifics. “So fair’s fair.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtA6laeJBts\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RtA6laeJBts?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In a match that cemented the tone of the series, England had been taken apart by Mitchell Johnson. The phrase “shock bowler” has become a cliche for those who bowl short, sharp spells, but Johnson fulfilled the role in the truest sense. An experienced, battle-hardened side were so shocked that they never recovered. Before he was a shock bowler, Johnson had been not a stock bowler but a laughing stock, certainly to the Barmy Army.</p> \n<p>The team who played that first Test were the second most experienced in England’s history. They had 649 caps and around 649GB of data based on those appearances and on study of the Australians. This was a grizzled, gnarled team, who thought they had seen everything and were prepared for anything. They had no idea. No computer could have prepared them for the way Johnson spooked them. He no longer bowled to the left and the right; he bowled at the stumps and the head. Modern batsmen, not just England’s, were lulled into a false sense of security by years of mollycoddling; when they were then exposed to extreme pace and aggression, they had about as much idea how to survive as rich kids dropped into the meanest streets of the Bronx.</p> \n<p>Johnson’s impact was similar to that of the West Indian quicks in the 1980s – but there were four of them. He had emphatically got his mojo back, and a combination of his surname and Movember moustache made MoJo an inevitable nickname. And though he never appeared with a low-buttoned shirt exposing enormous clumps of chest hair, his moustache was an inadvertent tribute to the hirsute brutes of 1974–75, the last time England were assaulted so extremely in Australia.</p> \n<p>The Guardian’s Andy Bull, in reference to Johnson’s impact, cited the old Mike Tyson line: “Everybody has a plan, until they get punched in the face.” Bull’s Guardian colleague Mike Selvey referred to Johnson’s as “bare-knuckle bowling”. And yet in this game there was no merciful knockout or stoppage. England had to continue to take the blows for five whole Test matches.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> These are edited extracts from </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/283992/\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Gentlemen and Sledgers: A History of the Ashes in 100 Quotations and Confrontations</em></strong></a><em>, published by Head of Zeus.</em></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435888900929/Ian-Botham-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Giving it some humpty: Ian Botham hooks Geoff Lawson on his way to 149 not out during the historic third Test at Headingley in 1981.

He cannot be run out like this – the wicket has to be broken by the ball having been thrown, or by the hand or arm holding the ball. And for hit-wicket, it must be put down by the striker in the act of playing a stroke, avoiding being hit by a delivery, or setting off for a run. <em>Thanks to Peter Grant</em>. <br /><strong>2)</strong> In this situation the batsman should not attempt to play the ball, and should pull away – at which point you can call and signal dead ball. There is no dismissal here – it's a clear case of gamesmanship by the bowler and is unfair. Yes, the striker should always be ready when the bowler is about to deliver, but this is clearly a deliberate ploy to catch him unawares. Warn the bowler's captain that this unfair play will be reported. <em>Lewis Stowe wins the shirt</em>.<br /><strong>3)</strong> The batsman is run out on appeal. No part of his bat or person was grounded behind the popping crease when the wicket was thrown down. There are no other issues to deal with here: the collision between him and the bowler was accidental, and the bowler did not deliberately fall under the batsman. If it had been clear that either striker or bowler had been injured in the collision, though, you would call and signal dead ball to prevent any further development, such as runs, wickets or controversy. <em>Thanks to Alex Durie</em>.</p>\n<h2>Competition: win a T-shirt of your choice</h2>\n<figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-457409932\">\n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434012947688/Cricket-shirt-002.jpg\" alt=\"Cricket shirt\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" />\n <figcaption> \n </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>For a chance to win a sporting T-shirt of your choice from the <a href=\"http://entertainment.guardianoffers.co.uk/search/results/?search=cricket\">Guardian range</a> send us your questions for You are the Umpire to <a href=\"mailto:you.are.the.umpire@observer.co.uk\">you.are.the.umpire@observer.co.uk</a>.
