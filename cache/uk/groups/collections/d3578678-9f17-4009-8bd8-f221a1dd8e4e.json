He’s “furious”, having been “betrayed” by Louis van Gaal. Penny for the thoughts of Ars&egrave;ne Wenger. Anyway, United ideally want Bayern Munich’s <strong>Thomas M&uuml;ller</strong>, Real Madrid’s <strong>Karim Benzema</strong>, Paris Saint-Germain’s <strong>Edinson Cavani</strong> or Tottenham Hotspur’s <strong>Harry Kane</strong>. But failing that, West Ham United’s <strong>Diafra Sakho</strong> will suffice.</p> \n<p>United are also planning to offload Javier Hern&aacute;ndez, who will go much more quietly than rantin’ Robin. He could serenely head off to West Ham as part of a deal for Sakho, or join Sevilla instead.</p> \n<p>Newcastle United were the last English club to break the world transfer record, causing headlines around the globe as they splashed &pound;15m on the Blackburn Rovers striker Alan Shearer in 1996. The best part of two decades on, and that sort of money only gets you a passing mention in a poor rumour round-up. Newcastle will spend that sum on the PSV Eindhoven midfielder and Brazil botherer <strong>Georginio Wijnaldum</strong>, and again on either the Anderlecht striker <strong>Aleksandar Mitrovic</strong> or QPR’s <strong>Charlie Austin</strong>. Times change, and the Mill feels so very old.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/09/liverpool-raheem-sterling-misses-training-again-sick\" title=\"\"><strong>Raheem Sterling</strong> to Manchester City saga</a>, which had its world premiere at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham in October 1952, opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in London the following month, and moved to St Martin’s Theatre in 1974, could finally be coming to a close. City are going to offer Liverpool a take-it-or-leave-it &pound;40m deal plus &pound;5m in add-ons.</p> \n<p>Acceptance of this deal will allow Liverpool to go and buy Borussia Dortmund’s <strong>Marco Reus</strong>, apparently. And there was us, thinking they’d already spent the money.</p> \n<p>Manchester City have also been pursuing <strong>Fabian Delph</strong> but this particular rumour hasn’t totally ruined what could have been a lovely summer. Aston Villa will bolster their depleted midfield with <strong>Andros Townsend</strong>, unless Sunderland get in the way.</p> \n<p>Stoke City have not given up on the Internazionale winger <strong>Xherdan Shaqiri</strong>, in case anyone had forgotten about that. Also their goalkeeper <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/09/asmir-begovic-chelsea-8m-transfer-stoke-city-marco-van-ginkel\" title=\"\"><strong>Asmir Begovic</strong> will sign for Chelsea</a>, with the midfielder <strong>Marco van Ginkel</strong> moving the other way. Jos&eacute; Mourinho’s been very quiet so far this summer, which suggests he’s either up to something, or that he’s completely happy with his squad. The rest of the Premier League stand at a fork in the road, with both routes leading to a world of pain.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436514306239/Edinson-Cavani-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Edinson Cavani, who recently played at the Copa América with Uruguay, is said to be one of a number of targets for Manchester United.

The column is taking a break in the off-season but you can still send questions to <a href=\"mailto:knowledge@theguardian.com\">knowledge@theguardian.com</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theknowledge_gu\">on Twitter</a>.</p>","byline":"Guardian sport","body":"<p><strong>“Cochabamba’s Club Jorge Wilstermann is named after Bolivia’s first commercial pilot,”</strong> wrote John Wilson back in 2010. <strong>“Are there any other teams out there named after individuals?”</strong><br /></p> \n<p>This question had the Knowledge inbox bulging at the seams, with the names pouring in of a deluge of men (and a couple of women) who have the privilege of a team named in their honour. We decided to discount teams named after saints (because there are so many of them) and those that reside in towns and cities already named after the great and the good – Milton Keynes Dons, for example. Here, then, are a few of our then-favourites:</p> \n<p><strong>Vasco da Gama </strong>Formed out of a rowing club already named after the famous Portuguese explorer.</p> \n<p><strong>Willem II </strong>The Eredivisie side from Tilburg are named after King Willem II of the Netherlands. Tilburg housed his military headquarters.</p> \n<p><strong>Newell’s Old Boys </strong>Isaac Newell came into the world in Strood, Kent, on 24 April 1853. By the time he left it, on 16 October 1907, he had created what would go on to be one of Argentinian football’s most famous clubs.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Club Atl&eacute;tico Aldosivi </strong>Another side from Argentina. “The name originates from the first two letters of the last names of the four original founders,” writes Russell Yong. “Allard, Dollfus, Sillard and Wiriott – the W changing to a V due to there being no W key on the telegraph that originally announced the club’s formation.”<br /></p> \n<p><strong>CD O’Higgins </strong>Born in Chile, Bernardo O’Higgins Riquelme was the illegitimate son of Ambrosio O’Higgins – a future governor of Chile and viceroy of Peru, born to Spanish parents in Sligo in Ireland. He grew up to be a leader of the home side in the Chilean War of Independence and is seen as one of the country’s founding fathers. When two clubs in the city of Rancagua merged in 1955 they kept the prefix of one of the clubs, O’Higgins Braden.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Club Presidente Hayes </strong>One of the few clubs – if not the only one – named after a US president. Hayes was apparently very merciful towards Paraguay after taking charge of peace talks after the War of the Triple Alliance (which sounds like it should be in Star Wars, but was actually an exceptionally bloody affair in the 1860s involving Paraguay, Argentina, &shy;Uruguay and Brazil). Hayes’s role led to a number of institutions being named in his honour, including this football club from Asunci&oacute;n.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>CD Luis Angel Firpo </strong>The oldest club in El Salvador. Originally named Tec&uacute;n Um&aacute;n but changed to CD Luis Angel Firpo in honour of the Argentinian boxer’s epic bout and narrow defeat to the heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey in 1923.</p> \n<p><strong>Renato Curi Angolana </strong>“An amalgamation of two clubs: dell’Angolana and Renato Curi,” wrote Fergal Hunter. “The latter was created in honour of Renato Curi who played for Perugia in the 1970s. He was a midfielder who joined them when they were in Serie B, helped get them promoted to Serie A and led them to sixth place. He died in October 1977 of a heart attack on the pitch during a Serie A match with Juventus. He was 24. Perugia’s stadium is also named after him.”<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Club Atl&eacute;tico Douglas Haig </strong>Why would a club from Pergamino, just north of Buenos Aires, name itself after a British first world war Field Marshall? According to the club: “On 18 November 1918 after the resounding victory of the Allied forces, a group of British workers on the Argentinian central railroad decided to start a club to participate in the local soccer championship. This required the consent and support of the chief of the railway, Ronald Leslie, who, as a condition, requested that the club take the name of General Douglas Haig.”<br /></p> \n<p><strong>CD Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba</strong> “Named after not one, but two individuals,” wrote Tim Dockery. “They are the result of a 1930 compromise when Sportivo Godoy Cruz (named after a signatory of the Argentinian Declaration of Independence, Tom&aacute;s Godoy Cruz) merged with Deportivo Bodega Antonio Tomba (Tomba’s store was a sponsor of that club).”<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Colo-Colo </strong>The only Chilean side to have won the Copa Libertadores were named after Colocolo, a Mapuche chief of the 16th century. The name translates as ‘mountain cat’.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Deportivo Walter Ferretti </strong>Ferreti was a Sandinista comandante known as “Chombo” who was killed in a road accident in 1991. The old ministry of the interior team (where he used to work) is named after him.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Joe Public FC </strong>The Trinidad and Tobago club, once home to Kenwyne Jones and former Dundee and Gillingham defender Brent Sancho, is named after, well, everybody basically.<br /></p> \n<h2>WHICH PLAYERS HAVE MOVES NAMED AFTER THEM?</h2> \n<p><strong>“In France, a powerful acrobatic volleyed goal is referred to as ‘Une Papinade’ after Jean-Pierre Papin scored many in his time,”</strong> observed Nick Dunmore in 2007. <strong>“Apart from the Cruyff turn, what other moves across the world are named after players?”</strong></p> \n<p>Many players have lent their names to particular moves, though as you’d imagine, not all of them are cap-doffingly positive paeans like the one afforded to Cruyff. But let’s start with the positives, because we’re all about spreading the love.</p> \n<p>The sauciest penalty of all - the sort Zin&eacute;dine Zidane so nearly jiggered up in the 2006 World Cup final, the cheeky chip down the middle - is known the world over as a Panenka, after Czechoslovakia’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp2HZNheCZ8\">Antonin Panenka</a>, who clipped the ball straight down the middle at 1mph past Sepp Maier in the final of the 1976 Euros against West Germany.</p> \n<p>There is real debate, however, when it comes to the 360-degree turn, often referred to as the ‘Garrincha turn’. As Paul Doyle noted in his <a href=\"http://football.guardian.co.uk/theknowledge/story/0,,1725658,00.html#article_continue\">Sprechen sie Fu&szlig;ball?</a> article of 2006, “PlayStation games refer to it as the Marseille turn, also known in English as the double drag-back, Zidane turn, Maradona turn and, according to earlier computer games, the [David] Rocastle 360. Zidane himself calls it la roulette.”</p> \n<p>Norwegians meanwhile refer to the ‘Flopasning’ - literally ‘the Flo pass’ - named after Jostein Flo, formerly of Sheffield United. “This was the favourite tactic of the national side in the first half of the 90s,” explained David Glass. “The move involved one of the full-backs, usually Liverpool’s Stig Inge Bjornebye, hoofing a long diagonal ball up to the giant Flo. He would then knock the ball down to one of the midfielders who would be steaming in. Pretty basic, but quite effective before opposing sides worked out what was going on. The term is still used in Norway.”</p> \n<p>Jack Robinson, Southampton’s goalkeeper of 1899 vintage, was similarly honoured after showing some Austrians how to tackle low shots by diving to stop or catch the ball. “That type of save was referred to as ‘a Robinsonade’ in Austria and some parts of Central Europe until the middle of the 20th century,” explained Pete McAuliffe. “Robinson was also an England international. It is perhaps worth asking whether the term still exists on the continent given the plight of the current England No1, though with a different meaning for any element of hapless goalkeeping.”</p> \n<p>Whoosh! There goes the love! So we might as well move on to more derogatory terms - and, speaking of hapless goalkeeping, the case of Franck Grandel. Peter de Koning explained: “Grandel, a Guadeloupe-born goalkeeper, made some comical mistakes during his first season in the Dutch league at FC Utrecht. So much so that fans started referring to mistakes leading to goals as ‘Grandelletje’.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile in Denmark, a hospital pass is known as a ‘rigtig Jesper Olsen’ (‘a real Jesper Olsen’). “It’s named after Olsen’s square ball across his own defence that set up Spain’s equaliser in Denmark’s 1986 World Cup match,” explained Aidan Curran. “Having been 1-0 down, Spain went on to destroy the Danes 5-1. Sometimes Danish politicians use the term to mock an opponent’s blunder or gaffe.”</p> \n<h2>WHICH FOOTBALL CLUBS HAVE HAD SHIPS NAMED AFTER THEM?</h2> \n<p> \u0012<strong>“On a recent tour of Rotterdam Docks I noticed a container ship called Borussia Dortmund, painted, of course, in garish yellow and black,” </strong>wrote Paul Corrigan, also in 2010.<strong>”Do any other clubs have ships named after them?”</strong></p> \n<p>“As a seaman, I know of the ship that Paul is referring to,” writes Roland de Boer. “Whilst working aboard another vessel I have passed it in the North Sea on a few occasions recently. I have also encountered the ‘Borussia M&ouml;nchengladbach’ which is green and white, the ‘AT Bilbao’, the ‘Kaizer Chiefs’, and the ‘Juventus’. No doubt there are many others. Vessels are named by their owners or holding companies. Sometimes the name seems random but some vessels are named after famous figures (real, literary or mythical), places, song titles or for family members. Of course, the odd wealthy football fan can also pay homage to his team in this way.”</p> \n<p>Well let’s take a look at the good ship Borussia Dortmund. Built in 1998, she’s currently stationed in St Petersburg, though seems set to head to Hamburg this week (<a href=\"http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/datasheet.aspx?SHIPNAME=Borussia+Dortmund&amp;TYPE_SUMMARY=&amp;PORT_ID=&amp;menuid=&amp;datasource=SHIPS_CURRENT&amp;app=&amp;mode=&amp;B1=Search\">you can follow her progress on this brilliant tool here</a>). <a href=\"http://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/showallphotos.aspx?mmsi=210001000#top_photo\">More than 20 photos of her in all her glory can be found here</a>, as she flits from port to port. There’s also <a href=\"http://www.vesseltracker.com/en/ShipPhotos/558058-Juventus-I289973.html\">the aforementioned Juventus</a> and a couple of <a href=\"http://www.vesseltracker.com/en/VesselArchive/All/All.html?search=arsenal+\">Arsenals</a> too.</p> \n<p>Incidentally, while on the subject of Dortmund, it would be remiss of us not to recall the instance when an investigation by the German consumer TV show Plusminus in 2000 claimed to have found tributyltin - a toxic anti-bacterial chemical that can cause health problems in humans - in the club’s replica Nike shirts. Tributyltin is more commonly used as a paint on ships to protect them from barnacle damage. “We knew that the substance was still used in coatings for ships, but it shouldn’t be in textiles that people wear,” said scientist J&uuml;rgen Kundke. Dortmund pulled the shirts from their club shop, as did the Kaufhof, Karstadt and Hertie department stores, though Nike were quick to insist: “Small doses of TBT when used in textiles are not normally dangerous to humans.”</p> \n<p>Moving on, Michel van der Velde notes that<strong> “</strong>a towage company from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IJmuiden\">IJmuiden</a>(close to Amsterdam) re-named one of their ships after the local second division football club two months ago. Telstar, whose famous players include Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Arjan de Zeeuw, Heinz Stuy and Louis van Gaal, <a href=\"http://www.iskestugs.nl/fleetlist/\">can be seen here</a> [not any more it can’t - Archive Ed].” And Nick Tolerton adds that “there was a whole fleet of ships named after teams, the Consolidated Fisheries Ltd fleet of deepwater Grimsby steam and motor trawlers”. He goes on to add:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>In the 1960s this ran to more than 20 ships named after football teams, and over the decades from the first in the early 1930s nearly 30 clubs were represented. Inevitably there was a Grimsby Town. However, as well as ships named after the more glamorous clubs of the 50s and 60s - an Arsenal, Aston Villa, Everton, Spurs, and Wolverhampton Wanderers (the last of those must have been a tight squeeze to paint up on the stern) - the smaller clubs were well-represented, including an Aldershot, Gillingham, Port Vale, and, generously considering their rivalry with Grimsby, a Lincoln City. The one foreign team, inevitably at that time, was the Real Madrid of 1961.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>More information about Grimsby Trawlers of the day, including the Consolidated Fisheries Ltd ‘football fleet’ and details of them getting in trouble for calling a ship “Notts County” (a schoolboy error) <a href=\"http://homepage.ntlworld.com/grimsby.trawlers/consolship1.htm\">can be found here</a>.</p> \n<p>Switching to tourist boats, Justin Horton offers word of the Spanish ferry company Iscomar, which “repainted its vessel Isabel Del Mar with the badge of RCD Mallorca as part of <a href=\"http://www.diariodeibiza.es/pitiuses-balears/2009/09/20/iscomar-retira-barco-reducir-gastos/360434.html\">a sponsorship deal</a>. It is to be hoped that neither party to the agreement goes down.” And Genoa resident Michael Nimmo adds that “one of the companies (Rimorchiatori Riuniti) where I work, organises boats in the harbour here. A lot of their workers are Genoa fans, and in honour of one of our star players two years ago, Thiago Motta (formerly of Bar&ccedil;a and now of Inter) the company called one of their boats The Brazilian, and gave it No88 (his squad number). He came down and signed autographs and had his photo taken, but needless to say he left shortly after.”</p> \n<p>While we’re on the subject of football’s seafaring links, it is worth digging into the history of Boca Juniors. After losing a play-off against local rivals Boedo for the right to their black-and-white-striped kit in March 1907, Boca agreed to visit Buenos Aires harbour and take the colours of the first foreign ship to come in.

Managing a team, yes. Owning a club, sure. Being involved in any form of governance of the game, absolutely. But where does it stop? Can you have a kickabout in the back garden? Is the odd season of Sensible Soccer allowed? Where does Subbuteo fit in? It’s a minefield. </p> \n<p>And stepping into it is Chuck Blazer. The former Fifa executive will be looking over his shoulder nervously whenever he’s tempted into a game of <a href=\"http://www.branchofscience.com/wp-content/uploads/supercupbox1.jpg\">Super Cup Football</a> thanks to a lifetime ban from all football-related activity due to bribery and corruption.</p> \n<p>“Blazer committed many and various acts of misconduct continuously and repeatedly during his time as an official in different high-ranking and influential positions at Fifa and Concacaf,” OMGed Fifa in a statement. “In his positions as a football official, he was a key player in schemes involving the offer, acceptance, payment and receipt of undisclosed and illegal payments, bribes and kickbacks as well as other money-making schemes.”</p> \n<p>So backslaps all round. Though, given that Blazer pleaded guilty to the FBI and agreed to turn informer, Fifa feeling in any way smug about booting Blazer out of football is rather like congratulating yourself on having cleaned up those baked beans that you spilled on the patio when all you’ve actually done is left them and allowed wind erosion, rain and the neighbourhood’s cats to do what wind erosion, rain and the neighbourhood’s cats do. Those beans? Yeah, sorted them. No more beans on my patio, no sirree. </p> \n<p>But then what can you do? The world is full of thieves, murderers, murderous thieves and thieving murderers and we can’t catch ’em all. And that’s exactly the same as rampant corruption among members of the Fifa executive committee, isn’t it Uncle Sepp? “It is impossible to stamp out robbery and murder, even with a functioning courts system down to community level,” Blatter told Swiss newspaper Weltwoche. “Football is not better than our society.”</p> \n<p>And it’s not like you can hold the president of Fifa responsible for any of this, is it Uncle Sepp? “I not only see everything, I’m responsible for everything, even for the English women’s own goal at the World Cup recently,” he added, introducing sarcasm to his big bag of unpleasant personality traits. “Am I responsible for climate change too?”</p> \n<p>No, Sepp – you’re responsible for Fifa. Though not for much longer, and for that we can be thankful.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d7ae1874e60491072055423f8866d82fbb071e1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436445521477/be0a5a1b-ed6c-4b22-8d87-e0f2c508929c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lionel Messi\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Look at him sitting down.

I played for a pub with two teams in different tiers of the local Sunday League. The Division 3 team were in danger of relegation which meant playing with no refs next season, whereas the Division 1 team were safe in mid-table obscurity. So the manager decided to switch our teams for the last two games. I was a Division 3 defender against strikers reported to be semi-pro, and we were losing 30-0 after an hour when the referee called it. The defeat itself didn’t hurt as much as hearing one of them say to his strike partner, ‘It’s like playing Pro-Evo on the PlayStation, with no one else on the other controller’” – Brian Saxby.</p> \n<p>“When did Fabian Delph leave the Villa? Have you been in the Doc’s time machine? Did he go to Manchester City, has he been to any other club before thinking about a return to the Villa? So many questions but if you have been in the Delorean can I have this week’s lotto numbers (normal and Euro) please? (Email it to me direct - I don’t want to share the loot between all 1,057 Fiver readers). Oh, one last thing, did England win the 2022 World Cup? Actually don’t bother answering that” – Ian Henderson (and 1,056 others).</p> \n<p>“Steve Gaw has certainly helped to keep the ‘Kana-based anecdotes’ theme going (Fiver passim) by – deliberately? – incorrectly stating ミルク(milk) as the katakana for ‘hotel’ (or was the Fiver again deliberately altering letters in an attempt at pedant baiting?) Should anyone be interested (probably not), milk would actually be 牛乳 in kanji (gyuunyuu in romaji, i.e. the Romanisation of the Japanese word)“ – Craig Hills (and, weirdly, 1,056 others). </p> \n<p>Send your letters to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@theguardian.com\">the.boss@theguardian.com</a>.
