We’re demob happy – it’s holiday time now and the reason for holiday time is that the season ended on Monday night with its customary curtain-downer. The only news that could clear our mind of all earthly distractions for the next six weeks was the final, clinching piece of news that <strong>Arsenal</strong> had launched their kit and the newly-vacant space inside our brain is nothing to do with hearing H&eacute;ctor Bellerin’s reaction, probably an exclusive hot take to somebody, that: “It’s really nice, obviously red and white like people like it!” No, the Mill does not feel any the less intelligent for that; it’s a cue for us to be ourselves, so we’re off to buy <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/15/jack-grealish-aston-villa-pictures-tenerife\">whichever travel guide Jack Grealish purchased</a> and have ourselves a nice time.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/15/chelsea-homeless-two-seasons-stamford-bridge\">Chelsea may have to leave Stamford Bridge for at least two seasons</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Must have been a relief, though, for Arsenal to struggle through and get that launch over the line because things like signing footballers can get in the way slightly. Perhaps they won’t have to worry about such inconveniences for a while, though – there are suggestions that their move for <strong>Petr Cech </strong>might be hijacked by <strong>Paris Saint-Germain</strong>, who, like a highwayman at Turnpike Lane, have guns drawn and plan to gallop off with the goalkeeper after shoving a &pound;150,000-a-week, five-year contract in front of his disbelieving face. Cech is thought to favour a switch to the Gunners, but negotiations have foundered over his request to beatbox at next June’s big away kit reveal.</p> \n<p>The heart is a funny thing and apparently <strong>Paul Pogba</strong> has his set firmly on <strong>Barcelona</strong> ahead of Manchester. That still won’t deter <strong>Manchester City</strong>, who have been making eyes at the Juventus midfielder since the dawn of time but deny having made an &pound;82m bid just yet, but will their doggedness be enough to persuade the Frenchman that the Etihad is nicer than the <em>Eixample</em>?</p> \n<p>What else? Surely everyone else is now knocking off too. Apparently not, because <strong>Real Madrid </strong>are still nibbling away at <strong>David de Gea</strong> in the continuation of a saga that should ensure the Mill stays fed this summer – but <strong>Manchester United </strong>are to reject the cheapskates’ measly first offer. There remain suggestions that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/gallery/2015/jun/16/hugo-lloris-the-gallery\">a United deal for <strong>Hugo Lloris</strong></a> could expedite the whole thing and leave us out on the street, though.</p> \n<p>United might put up rather less of a struggle if <strong>Newcastle </strong>front up some cash for <strong>Jesse Lingard</strong>, with Steve McClaren looking to sign a player he brought to Derby on loan during the season that finished on Monday. But perhaps Louis van Gaal could use the cash – they’d been hoping to sign the <strong>Valencia </strong>defender <strong>Nicol&aacute;s Otamendi </strong>for a perfectly reasonable &pound;25m but have been told to go a whole &pound;10m higher and meet the Argentinian’s release clause.</p> \n<p>Far closer to completion, though, is <strong>Southampton’s</strong> move for the <strong>M&aacute;laga</strong> forward <strong>Juanmi, </strong>who told Ronald Koeman his name with a slightly upwards inflection and was greeted with the reply “Yes, we do”. Apparently &pound;5.1m would see that through, although there are other vultures hovering – including McClaren.</p> \n<p>A couple more Arsenal bits to finish with. The release of next season’s training jerseys is being complicated by their interest in <strong>Karim Benzema</strong>, whose Real Madrid future seems in doubt once more, while reports in Germany say <strong>Julian Draxler</strong>, the <strong>Schalke </strong>midfielder who was heavily linked with them a year or two back, would not mind slipping on their new red and white outfit next season. Red and white. Like people like it.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/16/1434440181991/Petr-Cech-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Diving on that big fat PSG contract, or staying in London?

Summer in this part of the world is here and so too is The Fiver’s yearly dose of happiness. Mind, happiness is relative. Some are happy at foam parties in Miami surrounded by some southern bounce and red cups, while others are happy with just an index finger in their nose hole. The Fiver is just happy because, with the final whistle in the Euro qualifiers, the mad moustachioed, purple-hued maltworm that is football has stopped.</p> \n<p>Mr Roy’s boys are sitting pretty on top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group. Six games played, six wins collected. Brave England. Brilliant England. World-beaters England. The best there ever was and will be England. Just-give-them-the-trophy-now-and-call-off-the-tournament England. It’s all true, of course, once you disregard the fact that that they were trailing 1-0 at half-time to a side behind the Cape Verde Islands, Iran and Norn Iron in the world rankings after their defence gave the best impression of narcolepsy since River Phoenix in My Own Private Idaho. And you forget that that goal was scored by a 36-year-old who rocks up in the J-League and whose turn of pace makes the average sloth look like Usain Bolt.</p> \n<p>But never mind that, just put it to the back of your mind. They are best and they deserve credit. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/wayne-rooney-strength-character-roy-hodgson-england\">Here is Mr Roy with the science</a>. “It’s a good achievement completing a season of 10 games with eight wins and two draws,” he tooted. “That’s not been done for over 20 years. The players deserve some credit for that, and get plenty of credit from me. Now we have to keep building on it. We want to keep that unbeaten run going.” Given that three of their next four games come against sides ranked outside the top 90 in the world, that shouldn’t be too hard, eh?</p> \n<p>One person who won’t be getting credit, however, is Martin O’Neill. Oh Martin. It’s almost impressive that you have taken a side managed by Trap and made them look more agricultural than the Great Yorkshire Show. The draw with Scotland means O’Ireland’s chances of making the trip to France are about as great as The Fiver being named poet laureate. But who is to blame for this mess? John Delaney? The bankers? The Catholic Church? Eh, no. According to Martin, it’s the midfield and the forwards. “We have to try to become more creative,” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/republic-of-ireland-martin-oneill-advantage-scotland\">he roared after Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Scotland</a>. “We have to have midfield players trying to get goals. Players have played a lot of international matches and we don’t score a lot of goals. We don’t score them.” </p> \n<p>Of course, what the O’Ireland manager did not mention is that his side would have had a much better chance of being creative and scoring more if he’d managed to get his most creative player and his best strikers on the pitch at the same time rather than starting one from the bench and hauling another off with 20-odd minutes to go. Still Wee Gordon Strachan <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/12/gordon-strachan-scotland-ireland-qualifier\">was happy</a> and so too was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/chris-coleman-wales-belgium-euro-2016\">Chris “I don’t see us choking” Coleman</a>. (Don’t think for a minute that The Fiver hasn’t jotted that down in its comments-that-come-back-to-haunt file). But they couldn’t outdo The Fiver in the happiness stakes. Until someone mentioned the Women’s World Cup and the Copa Am&eacute;rica. Curse those canker blossoms!

A junior edition takes place on Monday at the <strong>World U20 Championship </strong>where the cadet versions of the above heavyweights collide. The top-seed Springboks face the defending champions in a repeat of the 2014 final in Calvisano (7.30pm, BT Sport 1). Coached by the former international full-back Jon Callard, England must shrug off the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/10/england-france-world-under-20s-championship\" title=\"\">30-18 defeat by France</a> in their final group match in Viadana. Meanwhile, looking ahead to next season, British and Irish sides can map out their European campaigns on Wednesday when the pool draws for the <strong>European Champions Cup and Challenge Cup </strong>take place in Neuch&acirc;tel, Switzerland (1.30pm BT Sport). The 20 clubs involved in the senior tournament include the Premiership contingent of Bath, Saracens, Northampton, Exeter and Wasps, who be will divided between the five pools.</p> \n<h2>SADDLING UP …<br /></h2> \n<p>Included in a world-class field for the second edition of the <strong>Friends Life Women’s Tour of Britain </strong>is Lizzie Armitstead, Britain’s 2014 World Cup winner. There is plenty of home interest in the 18 teams with Wiggle Honda, Pearl Izumi Sports Tours and Matrix Fitness among the squads. The race starts on Wednesday, in Bury St Edmunds, and finishes in Hemel Hempstead on Sunday. One notable absentee, however, will be the world’s greatest female road racer, Marianne Vos. The 28-year-old three-times road world champion, who won last year’s race, is recovering from injury.</p> \n<h2>MATE HITS MATE …<br /></h2> \n<p>For sheer sporting spectacle, for ferociously internecine rugby league played in an atmosphere of seething antipathy, look no further than Australia’s<strong> State of Origin</strong>. Game Two of the three-match series takes place on Wednesday (11am Premier Sports). Game One ended in a 11-10 victory for Queensland over New South Wales and the Blues will encounter a hostile atmosphere at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (capacity 100,024), where much of the local support will be backing the Maroons, thanks to a liberal seeding of Melbourne Storm players in their side<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2>LONG JOURNEY HOME …<br /></h2> \n<p>The chequered flag comes out on Sunday in perhaps the greatest motor race of them all, the gruelling examination of man and machine that is the <strong>Le Mans 24 hours</strong>.<strong> </strong>With Porsche posting record times in practice it promises to be a vintage race. One to watch is Nissan’s 23-year-old British driver Jann Mardenborough, who rose from obscurity after outfoxing 90,000 online racers to win Nissan’s GT Academy in 2011. Mardenborough makes his debut in LMP1 after impressing last year at the circuit in the LMP2 race.</p> \n<h2>START PLANNING …<br /></h2> \n<p>Bournemouth v Manchester United anyone? No sooner does the domestic football season end than the next comes rumbling into view.

The last time the US Open was held on the notoriously tough Pennsylvania track, in 2007, five over par won it for &Aacute;ngel Cabrera. The one before that, in 1994, was another grind. Ernie Els was one of only three players to end the week having broken par – just the one under par, mind. He triumphed in the play-off thanks to a round of three over, and then par on the second sudden-death hole. You really do have to earn it at Oakmont. </p> \n<p>Johnny Miller shot 63 on his way to victory at the 1973 US Open, it’s true, but there’s a textbook example of the exception proving the rule. Miller’s round is often cited as the greatest ever; given that figure has since been matched 25 times in the majors, its continued exalted status says just as much about the notoriety of the course as the brilliance of the player and his score. </p> \n<p>Good luck identifying Oakmont’s biggest threat. Some will point to the bunkers, and they can thrust their finger in pretty much any direction, for there are nearly 200 of the buggers. That total includes one of the most famous around: the Church Pews, a behemoth to the left of the 3rd fairway. The eponymous Pews are eight parallel grass ridges laddering a long trap; if your ball lands up against them, you’ll be playing out sideways or possibly even backwards. Keep your ball out of trouble and, well, congratulations, but don’t slap yourself on the back too soon, because they’re in play again as you come back down 4. It never stops. </p> \n<p>Others will bemoan the greens, which are huge, sloping and treacherously fast. “I only had six three putts in nine holes,” quipped a weary Tom Watson during the 1994 US Open. And then there are the tight fairways: the one ribboning its way down the 1st is a mere 24 yards wide. That opening tee shot is considered by many pros, including Miller and Els, to be the hardest start to a round in golf, and it doesn’t get easier quickly: even if you find the fairway with your drive, having avoided the bunkers guarding the landing zone on either side, you’re faced with a blind downhill second into a green which slopes away severely. Par, please!</p> \n<p>The US Open’s coming back to Oakmont next year. Can’t wait? Same here.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4df4b1c67e98339ab881d281a84cb31bb9ea722d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433417938278/31b9a139-72a9-47ad-ab66-edc38c03838f-460x308.jpeg\" alt=\"The church pew bunkering on the third hole at Oakmont, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"460\" height=\"308\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The church pew bunkering on the third hole at Oakmont, Pennsylvania.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Stewart/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>2) 10th at Pine Valley</strong></h2> \n<p>Pine Valley has a fearsome reputation as one of the most difficult golf courses in the world. It’s never held a big tournament, but that’s no reflection on its quality, merely the result of a lack of practical spectator space and the club’s unwillingness to compromise the course’s integrity by clearing some. </p> \n<p>The 10th hole is just 146 yards long. By this point in the round, a player’s nervous system will have been comprehensively shredded by a course which doesn’t really have fairways as such, more a series of landing zones around which one must plot. Golf as Frogger. A short par-three should offer some comparative relief, then. </p> \n<p>Ah but no. Anything other than a perfect tee shot into the heart of the green is a formal application for trouble, forms filled out in triplicate. The putting surface slopes outwards, an upturned saucer, so anything landing near the edge is going straight back off. Huge sand pits surround the green. And front right is a pot bunker from which escape onto the green is impossible, so steep is the face. Going out backwards is the only solution, and there goes that scorecard! </p> \n<p>The bunker is known, with a lyrical flourish, as The Devil’s Asshole. Robust nomenclature, but sometimes you need to get to the heart of the matter fast, no messing. Actually, we should have just started and ended this entry with those three little words. You’d have worked it all out for yourselves soon enough.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dad1b11864ed7b817d2659f609fa2fa2190392ff\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433418003776/a2106add-d7ab-468e-8613-85866be18354-277x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Bushes and shrubs in the rough near the green for the 10th hole at Pine Valley.\" width=\"277\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bushes and shrubs in the rough near the green for the 10th hole at Pine Valley.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Roberts/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>3) 15th … no, the 16th … no, the 17th at Cypress Point</strong></h2> \n<p>The four-time Masters champion Jimmy Demaret once described Cypress Point as “the best seventeen-hole course in the world”. Designed by Alister Mackenzie – also on his CV, Augusta National – it’s one of the most spectacular golfing arenas on earth, balanced precariously atop Californian cliffs, the Pacific crashing in, whales and sea-lions rolling in the deep blue below, deer cavorting inland among Monterey cypress trees. But the 18th is reckoned to be a bit dull, a workaday anti-climax, so there you go. Nothing’s perfect.<strong> </strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2012/apr/06/joy-of-six-golf-holes\">The Joy of Six: great golf holes | Scott Murray</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Not that it matters too much, because 15, 16 and 17 make up arguably the greatest run of holes in all golf. The 15th is a short par three, a gentle iron over the raging surf of an inlet cutting across the front of the tee to a heavily bunkered and undulating green. The rugged and exhilarating 16th is one of the most famous in the sport, another par three over water, perched high over the ocean, though in blustery conditions this one often requires a driver as the carry is over 230 yards with rocks staring at you and next to no escape on either side. (Unless you aim miles left towards a bail-out fairway and lay up, which kind of defeats the point of playing Cypress Point at all.) Possibly the most dangerous hole in the world. Bing Crosby once made hole in one. Straight down the middle. </p> \n<p>However there’s no decision to be made on 16; it’s either San Francisco or bust. The dogleg par-four 17th, however, messes with your mind. It’s not the longest, at just under 400 yards, but once again the player needs to carry the water from an elevated tee. With the Pacific hugging the right side of the hole, the choice is stark: she either cuts off a chunk of yardage by driving close to the shore, or plays it safe by aiming down the left. Only if she does that, a long second shot awaits, with one of those goddamn cypresses getting in the way. And the ocean on the right isn’t going anywhere. </p> \n<p>The 18th probably needs to be a bit boring after all that, doesn’t it. Alister Mackenzie knew exactly what he was doing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52ac98322ce2ae48d2ddc6db8b7461aa5b9b463f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433418125587/07420260-f293-44a7-aa67-7e23219d7964-460x311.jpeg\" alt=\"An aerial view of the 15th, 16th and 17th holes at Cypress Point.\" width=\"460\" height=\"311\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of the 15th, 16th and 17th holes at Cypress Point.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Sheldon/Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>4) 18th at St Andrews</strong></h2> \n<p>Regular readers will, of course, have <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2012/apr/06/joy-of-six-golf-holes\">played a few holes with the Joy of Six before</a>. Some of golf’s most notorious tests were mentioned that day – 12 and 13 at Augusta National, 18 at Carnoustie, 17 at Sawgrass, the Postage Stamp at Troon – because to be honest, we were hardly likely to wax lyrical about a short par four with a motorway-wide fairway straighter than a Roman road and no deep rough, trees or bunkers anywhere in sight. </p> \n<p>But, well, y’know. That JOS also considered the Road Hole at St Andrews, the connoisseur’s choice as the greatest hole in golf, with the famous bunker in which Tommy Nakajima crumbled to dust at the 1978 Open, and the iconic road behind the green that did for Tom Watson in 1984. But we’ve been there, taken 13 strokes on that. Instead, let’s consider the relatively simple closing hole, named after Tom Morris, the four-time Open champion who designed its deceptively tricky green. It’s 357 yards short. Tiger Woods drove the green in 2010 and nearly made a hole in one, before missing the relatively short eagle putt. Old Tom 1, Tiger 0. </p> \n<p>The 18th’s difficulty is all about context, all in the mind. It’s where the greats close the deal, and the dreams of nearly men fade and die. Leave your drive short and left, and you’re faced with the Valley of Sin, a clutch of undulations and dips guarding the green. God speed getting through that. And there’s no escaping it. Costantino Rocca’s arms turned to jelly as he tried to lob over it at the 1995 Open, needing to get up and down for birdie to force a play-off with John Daly. Chyip! The ball flopped pathetically into the Valley and into a deep depression. As, momentarily, did the player. The dangers of Tom Morris right there. The fact that Rocca famously rolled in the monster putt he left himself is neither here nor there; drained of emotional energy, his play-off bid ended in the Road Hole bunker, from which he’s still trying to escape today. </p> \n<p>Yes, objectively, 17 is the harder hole. But then look at poor Doug Sanders in 1970 to see how context is king. He was so nervous coming up 17, that after addressing the ball to take his second shot, he looked up the fairway an astonishing 29 times before going through with his swing, at one point stepping out of his stance and beginning again. Yet after dumping his ball in the Road Hole bunker, he so nearly splashed out for birdie. Par saved on the famously difficult hole, he went to 18 just needing par. Pulling his drive in front of the Valley of Sin, he then hit a hot chip 30 feet past the flag, before three putting on Old Tom’s subtly crafted green. There’s been no more hellish end to an Open than Sanders’ infamous short, tentative miss on what the locals call “the amateur’s side”. So, you see, appearances can be deceptive; 18 is a hell hole indeed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b9fb2bd18bba1e2f83a98ca34bd6dc1249eef36\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433418249147/c5fadc85-a308-4edd-98a8-97e344e9fbe4-460x305.jpeg\" alt=\"A look up the short, yet potentially nightmarish 18th hole on the Old Course at St Andrews.\" width=\"460\" height=\"305\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A look up the short, yet potentially nightmarish 18th hole on the Old Course at St Andrews.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>5) 18th at Whistling Straits</strong></h2> \n<p>Another hole where the clue is in the name. Pete and Alice Dye’s most famous creation is the aforementioned 17th island green at Sawgrass. Yet perhaps this one – the puntastic Dyeabolical – is the most notorious. A 500-plus-yard par-four finishing hole, it’s designed for drama. The safe line from the tee is down the right, but that leaves a long second into the green over Seven Mile Creek. The risky line from the tee is down the left, but that requires the best part of a 300-yard carry over sand dunes. </p> \n<p>At the 2010 PGA Championship, title-chasing Dustin Johnson took the safe line down the right, but drove wildly into the gallery, finding a patch of dusty ground which local rules designated as a bunker. Unaware of the ruling, he grounded his club, and the resulting penalty cost him a precious place in a play-off. In that play-off, Bubba Watson put his ball in the creek; Martin Kaymer won the title with a bogey. It’s a conundrum all right. </p> \n<p>“It’s a joke, there’s nothing good about it,” the 1979 Masters champion Fuzzy Zoeller once said of the hole, failing to understand that watching professionals thrash about like weekend hackers is one of the few pleasures we golfing mortals have in life.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e86ddcc49bd6cb241ea8c99505c7760c46b9d7c5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433418701652/d39e2743-ff23-4264-9189-c0da74e906ed-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"'Dyeabolical'.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Dyeabolical’.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>6) 18th at Doral</strong></h2> \n<p>The Blue Monster can devour the best of them: witness Rory McIlroy <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/mar/06/rory-mcilroy-club-water-doral\">launching his club into the azure vagueness</a> running down the left of the 8th back in March, having sent his ball in there with a shot that was 40 yards offline. “It felt good at the time,” admitted McIlroy, who thankfully couldn’t be bothered to kowtow to the pious moralisers. Of <em>course</em> it felt good at the time! </p> \n<p>The signature hole at Doral is the 484-yard par-four 18th, water running all the way down the left, trees and rough the other side of a tight, 32-yard-wide fairway. Attempt to blooter a drive down the left-hand side and you’ll need to carry it 300 yards to avoid some water kinking in. Too far to the right, and you’re faced with a lengthy second from the long stuff, towards a green guarded at the front by water and two large bunkers. “The hardest driving hole we face all year,” according to Jordan Spieth. “It is impossible,” adds Bubba Watson. Spieth and Bubba!</p> \n<p>So Blue Monster puts the fear up the best of them. And then Dustin Johnson, who has melted down in big tournaments more often than anyone cares to remember, stood on the tee in March requiring a par to win the WGC Cadillac. He calmly creamed it over the corner of the water on the left, leaving his ball in perfect position for a routine par, the most composed and measured closing out of a tournament you’re ever likely to witness. Calm. Composed. Measured. Dustin Johnson. Ah the beautiful, infinite absurdities of golf.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a14344172f51304d15c1d1614dbf282db33b39cb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433418433947/f4b20655-da64-4837-9639-3cf50a8df711-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"A scenic view of the 18th green on the Blue Monster Course at Doral in Florida.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scenic view of the 18th green on the Blue Monster Course at Doral in Florida.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keyur Khamar/US PGA Tour</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433418646584/f2d4eda6-ace9-4a6b-86de-b83e70816695-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Cannon/Getty Images","altText":"All 520 yards of the par-four 18th at Whistling Straits.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433417938630/31b9a139-72a9-47ad-ab66-edc38c03838f-2060x1378.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1378,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The church pew bunkering on the third hole at Oakmont, Pennsylvania.
