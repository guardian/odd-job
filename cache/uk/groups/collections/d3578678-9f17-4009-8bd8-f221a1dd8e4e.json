Things really have sunk to a sorry state when the Selecao’s best player can’t even land a headbutt. How the great Samba stars of the past must have cringed – heroes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfuD282WiWM\">like the lads of ‘74</a> – as they watched Brazil’s feeble attempt to batter Colombia into submission this morning! And how they must have launched themselves two-fisted into fearsome rages at Neymar’s restrained nodding during a token post-match jostle that sullied the good name of Copa Am&eacute;rica brawls.</p> \n<p>Neymar was sent off following his bloodless act and he deserved all the criticism that came his way – except none came, at least not from Dunga, the manager who was supposed to be restoring Brazilian pride following last year’s World Cup, during which they endured a humiliating debagging by Germany but at least managed to kick Colombia out of the tournament. “Colombia showed that it is a very experienced team,” mourned Dunga after a loss that leaves Brazil needing to give Venezuela a proper hiding if they are to avoid an early elimination from the continental showpiece. But Dunga does not seem to be very optimistic, as he confessed that the current generation of Brazilian players just might not have what it takes: “Brazil have to play football, Brazil can’t go to war,” he sobbed.</p> \n<p>“We have to focus on what we do best,” concluded Dunga, seemingly suggesting that Brazil just give up trying to nurture footballers and warriors and instead just remain a slickly-marketed cabaret act that tours the monied footballing outposts of the world, racking up lucrative victories over Qatar, Macau and Las Vegas. </p> \n<h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT</h2> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Paul Doyle at 7.45pm BST for England’s glorious 1-0 victory over Portugal in the European Under-21 Championship.</a></p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0c5dc29b-706c-4daf-a01a-c88faab6e4fd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434641513561/8b25e57f-8de6-4542-8e70-07d21143d82f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"\" please=\"\" don't=\"\" make=\"\" me=\"\" the=\"\" guy=\"\" responsible=\"\" for=\"\" fact=\"\" that=\"\" fifa=\"\" is=\"\" rotten\"=\"\" ...=\"\" director=\"\" frederic=\"\" auburtin=\"\" talks=\"\" about=\"\" united=\"\" passions,=\"\" starring=\"\" gerard=\"\" depardieu=\"\" in=\"\" a=\"\" scene=\"\" from=\"\" \"united=\"\" passions.\"=\"\" (david=\"\" koskas=\"\" creen=\"\" media=\"\" films=\"\" via=\"\" ap)\"=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gerard Depardieu stares into the middle distance in a scene from United Passions.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Koskas/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I’m a victim of the game.

Does the Fiver need somewhere to hide until the heat dies down? Will the Fiver confirm or deny any wrongdoing?” – Grant McPhee. </p> \n<p>“Pertaining to Allastair McGillivary’s use of ‘apropos’ in yesterday’s letters, I recently had a debate about the legitimacy of this word with my boss while using it in a reply to a client of ours and was told not to use this jargon and to plump for something a bit simpler. I being a small and petty man was overjoyed to highlight the use of this word in yesterday’s Fiver to said boss. This led to me being questioned as to whether I was aware that subscribing to such newsletters was against company IT policy and that I would have to unsubscribe. I may have won the battle but I fear I’ve lost the war” – Owen Keating .</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Send your letters to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@theguardian.com\">the.boss@theguardian.com</a>.

There’s the disarming little question, snuck in around a third of the way through, that is ostensibly about the things that you enjoy but is in fact a thinly-veiled attempt to shine light on the darker recesses of your soul. A little economy with the truth can take you a long way, we’re told, but an honest question deserves an honest answer and we’ve got ours prepared for when our interviewer, all bonhomie and rictus grin, tries to relax us a little with this one: “What do you think of <strong>Manchester United?”</strong></p> \n<p>That might be the question if we were <strong>Jack Wilshere</strong> and our prospective employer was <strong>Manchester City. </strong>If Manuel Pellegrini gets his way, Wilshere will be offering his professional take on the services offered by a rival company from the eyrie of a sky blue-coloured victory parade next season – and that’s largely because Liverpool just won’t play ball over <strong>Raheem Sterling. </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/liverpool-reject-manchester-citys-40m-bid-for-raheem-sterling\">They’re after a princely &pound;50m</a> for him, and that might prove rather too rich for City’s blood – in which case they’re prepared to make a strong play for the <strong>Arsenal </strong>midfielder, despite Wilshere’s recent claims that he has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/12/jack-wilshere-premier-league-arsenal\">no intention of going anywhere</a>.</p> \n<p>What would an interviewer ask <strong>Romelu Lukaku</strong>? How about: “Would you leave <strong>Everton</strong> for Old Trafford?” Call it a Reverse Gibson. And call it completely hypothetical for now, but Louis van Gaal is said to be monitoring the Belgian – which presumably, at this time of year, entails bugging an apartment in Tenerife – as he looks to fill the yawning crevice left by Radamel Falcao and perhaps <strong>Robin van Persie</strong>, who is interesting <strong>Galatasaray</strong>.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Mill is aware of people who believe Tim Sherwood has little grasp of tactics, but it has no truck with these people and particularly not after hearing about the new sleight of hand he’s got up his sleeve for next season: give the ball to <strong>Andros Townsend</strong>, let him cut inside and watch him rattle the advertising hoardings with a fizzing 25-yard shot. It’s been written up on the board, and everything, but now <strong>Aston Villa</strong> have to get their man and <strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong>, who rejected offers from other Premier League clubs last summer, might find that their elastic-limbed winger is tempted by a reunion with his former mentor.</p> \n<p>An altogether more reliable finisher is <strong>Troy Deeney, </strong>and Steve McClaren rather fancies making the <strong>Watford</strong> player <strong>Newcastle’s</strong> Preferred Strike Partner for ... well ... probably nobody who’s there at the moment but we wanted to get the gag in. McClaren wants to get him in, anyway, and has &pound;10m at the ready with which to do so.</p> \n<p>About time a defender featured on this list so here’s one: <strong>Baba Rahman</strong>. The <strong>Augsburg</strong> left-back, who shone for Ghana at the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year, has taken <strong>Chelsea’s </strong>fancy although they may face some competition from <strong>Juventus</strong>. The Old Lady might need to cheer herself up a bit, because she’s preparing to let <strong>Carlos Tevez</strong> return home to Argentina and sign for <strong>Boca Juniors</strong>. A step down in quality for a player who scored 29 goals last season, but apparently he’s itching for home and the parties are in talks.</p> \n<p>There is a risk that <strong>Ga&euml;l Kakuta </strong>would not remember his name is Ga&euml;l Kakuta if asked at a job interview, but the out-of-contract Chelsea forward seems about to settle down now – signing a contract with Europa League winners <strong>Sevilla</strong>. But what does he think of Betis?</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434613240856/7a22f019-ddb7-4acd-870c-79d4b24200c5-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"John Sibley/Action Images via Reuters","altText":"Jack Wilshere","cleanCredit":"Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images via Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T08:07:18Z","lastModified":"2015-06-18T08:09:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Nick Ames","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nick-ames"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Manchester City","Arsenal","Football","Sport","Transfer window"],"tags":[{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City"},{"id":"football/arsenal","webTitle":"Arsenal"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"football/transfer-window","webTitle":"Transfer window"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Nick Ames","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/nick-ames"}}],"series":{"title":"Rumour Mill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/series/rumourmill"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#005689","matchStatusPre":"#676767","matchStatusDuring":"#4bc6df","matchStatusAbandoned":"#da1d1d","matchStatusPost":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"football"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/18/football-transfer-rumours-manchester-city-to-swoop-for-jack-wilshere","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49qyj","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/18/football-transfer-rumours-manchester-city-to-swoop-for-jack-wilshere","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/18/football-transfer-rumours-manchester-city-to-swoop-for-jack-wilshere"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434613240856/7a22f019-ddb7-4acd-870c-79d4b24200c5-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jack Wilshere gears up to give some forthright views on Manchester United.

He looks so unlikely. Battered white hat, sleeves rolled, trousers tugged high and of course that great salt and pepper beard, hanging down to his chest. He sets himself in front of a single stump. Back foot parallel to the crease, front foot angled both out at 45 degrees and up, cocked. As the bowler approaches he lowers it down, moving his weight from the heel to the toe. At the same time he brings the bat up, waggles it once in mid-air, then lofts it again, to the top of his backlift. Six balls, that’s all. And soft ones, intended only to give the batsman the best chance to show off his shots.</p> \n<p>And so he does. Three easy drives to the on-side, another to the off, two glances towards mid-wicket. He’s defending a single stump, there, really, only for orientation. Behind him, a small crowd, which hardly seems to move. Look closely, however, and you’ll see one old man lean out from around another to catch a good look, and a small boy snap his head around in excitement and talk to his friend. Then the camera cuts and the batsman is gone. That’s it, <a href=\"http://www.britishpathe.com/video/cricket-giants-of-the-1890s/query/wg+grace\">all the footage we have</a> of one of the greatest, perhaps the very greatest, careers in English sport. The Champion, the Doctor, the Grand Old Man. WG. It gives us the beginnings of an idea about his style – but no more than that.</p> \n<p>This month marks the 150th anniversary of Grace’s first-class debut, which falls on Monday 22 June, for the Gentlemen of the South against the Players of the South. He was 16. This year also marks the 100th anniversary of his death, on 23 October 1915. He was 67 and had been playing as recently as the year before, his final innings an undefeated 69 out of Eltham’s total of 155 for six against Grove Park. His career as a competitive cricketer spanned six decades and, most likely, he played more innings and scored more runs across all levels of the game than anyone else in history.</p> \n<p>A rough sum that, since hard numbers are impossible to come by. But there were 870 first-class matches, for sure, which puts him third to Wilfred Rhodes and Frank Woolley, and countless more that didn’t carry that status. For 50 years, he bestrode what was then the national game, much as Nelson looks down on London from his column, leaving the best of his contemporaries like Landseer’s bronze lions, lying beneath his feet. Certainly Donald Bradman is the only cricketer who could be said to have made anything like such an impact on the public consciousness.</p> \n<p>We are still writing about Grace now, still reading about him, still learning about him. There have been three major biographies of him in the last 15 years alone. This summer, BBC Radio Bristol are running <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02rbx9g\">a series of documentaries on him</a>. And yet, somehow, the more detail we uncover, the more the man himself seems to recede from view. The more we learn, the less we understand.</p> \n<p>There are too many contradictions. Grace was the champion of the sport and yet also “a shameless cheat” as Geoffrey Moorhouse wrote in Wisden. (“They’ve come to see me bat,” and all that). Grace was the supreme cricketer, “an all-round athlete of the highest calibre”, according to Simon Rae. And he was also a roly-poly figure, almost 15 stone as a teenage and 22 stone as an adult. Grace was an amateur and he earned more from the game than any professional of his era. It is hard to knit together what we know.</p> \n<p>And so to a rather brilliant new novella by Charlie Connelly, called, quite simply, <a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/gilbert-9781472917591/\">Gilbert</a>. Because, as the blurb says, “to the public he was The Doctor, The Champion and WG, but to those who knew him best he was simply Gilbert.” Gilbert is an intimate portrait, slim and sparely written but full of detail. It takes us through the final years of Grace’s life, from 1898 to 1915. It begins with the famous story about his being dismissed three times in three balls by Charles Kortright, the first leg before, and the second caught behind. Grace stood his ground. The third, of course, bowled him. And so Kortright offered the send-off: “Surely you’re not leaving us, Doctor? There’s one stump still standing.”</p> \n<p>As Connelly imagines it: “Grace paused briefly as if he was about to turn and respond but instead marched off at a quickened pace, announcing to the waiting members as he strode up the steps that he had never been so insulted in his life.” You know the stories but you’ve never heard them told quite like this.</p> \n<p>Connelly explains his game in an entertaining early chapter that captures a conversation between Grace and his ghost writer, Arthur Porritt. Poritt hopes to write a book that will “look behind the curtain of the public face and share the real man with the reading public”, but finds himself frustrated by Grace’s incomprehension that there is anything to explore beyond the “bare facts of his achievements”.</p> \n<p>“I think your readers would very much enjoy any insight you can give them into what the experience actually felt like. People want to put themselves in the place of WG Grace as he was making that 100th century, what thoughts were in his mind, what the whole experience of such a big innings and extraordinary landmark means to WG Grace as a man and a batsman.”</p> \n<p>Grace was silent for a few moments.</p> \n<p>“I want to help you, Porritt, truly I do,” he said, “but to be perfectly honest with you I did not feel anything. I had too much to do watching the bowling and seeing how the fieldsmen were moved about to think anything. It’s as simple as that.”</p> \n<p>The facts lack. Connelly has taken that gap in our understanding of Grace and filled it from the well of his own imagination. He shows us the Grace who gave away his wicket so he could skip away from a match to take his very first ride in a motor car; the Grace who would stand in his garden and shake his fist at the Zeppelins flying overhead; the Grace who had to bury his daughter and his eldest son, both parents, and both brothers.</p> \n<p>What emerges is a portrait of a man who lived for the moment when the ball leaves the bowler’s hand and “absolutely nothing mattered other than his duel with it. The years fell away, the occasion melted to nothing and there was just him and the ball, locked in a duel”. It is a wonderful book, and though it’s a fiction, it brings us closer to an understanding of the man than any number of facts or any amount of film footage.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://id.theguardian.com/email/list\"><strong><em>This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.
