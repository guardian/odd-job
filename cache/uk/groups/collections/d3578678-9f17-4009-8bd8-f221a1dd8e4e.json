The world isn’t fair. So you can quit that delusion right now. If anyone tries to tell you that you’ll achieve your dreams through talent and hard work, ignore them. They’re just trying to make you feel better about the inherent awfulness of existence. It’s not a meritocracy, life. The top gigs don’t necessarily go to the best, and life’s silt and sediment often rises to the top, leaving the cream frustrated and cross somewhere around the middle. The Fiver didn’t get the plum gig of writing a witty and satirical tea-timely email by being witty and satirical, after all. We got it because there was literally nobody else here who could type and The Man found us hiding under the desk, pushing processed ham and peach liqueur into our mouths in an effort to forget about the inherent awfulness of existence.</p> \n<p>Anyway, apropos of nothing at all, we bring you news that Philip Neville, famous of course for being the brother of both that bloke who does banter with Jamie Carragher on the telly and the coach of the England netball team, has landed a pretty sweet posting as assistant manager of Valencia. The Spanish club, we assume, were most impressed with the way our hero Phil Nealed his way to helping David Moyes post the most grindingly mediocre season in Manchester United’s recent history, and reasoned that’s exactly the sort of sweet style they need at the Mestella.</p> \n<p>“Philip Neville has great experience at the top level of competition,” Valencia boss Nuno Esp&iacute;rito Santo intoned from a cue card of generic talking points. “But above all he has knowledge and values that fit perfectly with our team and our club. He has always been a team player, and our philosophy is based on teamwork. We are – and want to continue to be – a group.”</p> \n<p>“I am convinced,” Nuno continued, funnily enough sounding not at all convincing, “he is going to help us a lot.” Nuno was very much on message, as was whoever wrote the announcement for the Valencia official website, describing Philip as a “real English football legend”, inviting us to ‘take a look at the numbers’ for proof. Quite so.</p> \n<p>Still, it looks like Valencia have got a definite strategy in mind. Philip replaces Ian Cathro, the upsettingly young Scottish coach purloined to make Second Choice Steve’s decisions for him at Newcastle, presumably indicating that Valencia reckon Britain is where it’s at as far as coaching is concerned. And from a land that has produced upwards of one FA Cup, Premier League or Champions League-winning manager not called Lord Ferg in the last 20 years, you can definitely see what they’re getting at.</p> \n<p>An amusing side note is that, despite Valencia officially announcing the appointment themselves officially on their official website, complete with that welcoming statement by their manager, assorted English journalists piped up to tell them that no, actually, as it turns out they hadn’t appointed Philip just yet after all, and that discussions were actually ongoing. Which will presumably have been a surprise to Valencia. The Fiver will therefore seek confirmation from the press pack whether we actually have drunk the last dregs of this peach liqueur or whether we merely think we have, after placing the bottle to our lips, tilting it in the traditional manner and pouring the sickly sweet booze down our throat.</p> \n<p>Incidentally, in completely unrelated news, among Valencia owner Peter Lim’s other business interests is a 50% stake in Salford City FC. The other half is owned by a collection of former Manchester United players, including one P.Neville.

No arguments, no squabbles, no petty he-said-she-said stuff. A nice, peaceful world. Actually, what is the Mill saying – that would be awful. How tedious. A world without bickering? How would siblings spend their time? How would unhappily married couples express their profound dissatisfaction with their lot? How would neighbours communicate?</p> \n<p>In that spirit, it’s nice to see Manchesters City and United at each other’s throats, scrapping over that most traditional of things, the transfer target. And in this case it’s a doozy, a whopper, a tussle of the first water, for City have apparently joined United in the chase for one <strong>Sergio Ramos</strong>. Whether it’s because they think they need another centre-back is unclear and frankly unimportant. In fact, the Mill hopes they don’t need him, that they’re just in the bidding to annoy the lot across town and if they do buy him they put him to work handing out flyers in Piccadilly Gardens. That would be super.</p> \n<p>Other United targets – or, as we should probably call them now, ‘players City haven’t made a bid for yet’ – include <strong>Bastian Schweinsteiger</strong> and <strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/28/manchester-united-seamus-coleman-everton-no-formal-approach\">Seamus Coleman</a></strong>. The former is said to be up for it if only because he’ll play every week, something that is by no means a guarantee at Bayern Munich, while the latter may well be up for it too but that looks like being moot, on account of Everton not being up for it themselves. All the transfer window hinges on is people being up for it, see. Like that old MTV show presented by Eddy Temple-Morris that spawned the career of Zane Lowe. </p> \n<p>One man not at all up for sitting on the bench at Old Trafford is <strong>Robin van Persie</strong>, and it says here that the gradually getting more handsome as he gets older Dutchman will hold CRUNCH talks with Louis van Gaal over his future. Big Louis might have to break off from those talks to take a call regarding <strong>Morgan Schneiderlin</strong>, who may or may not be signing on at Old Trafford, or Leicester’s <strong>Jeffrey Schlupp</strong>, who may or may not be signing a new contract with the Foxes.</p> \n<p>The word very much around the campfire is that <strong>Nathanial Clyne</strong> will complete his move to Liverpool at some point this very day, but their summer business won’t be over there, no way no how. Obviously they never wanted <strong>Carlos Bacca</strong> anyway, and have graciously pulled out of the race for the Colombian forward, something that may or may not be linked to his imminent arrival at Milan, so instead they’re going to give Aston Villa a bell to see if <strong>Christian Benteke</strong> is bored with the banter on offer from Tim Sherwood and fancies the more subtle comedy of Brendan Rodgers. There are only so many times you can laugh at a dirty pint or a joke about someone’s mum, after all. Also on the lookout for some more high-brow humour is <strong>Fabian Delph</strong>, whose canny fox of a Mr 15% had a clause inserted in his recently-signed contract that allows him to hop aboard the Do One bus for a mere &pound;8million, a price Manchester City would be delighted to pay so that they can leave Delph on the bench for the next 18 months before loaning him to Sunderland.</p> \n<p>Nobody is safe in Chelsea’s attacking midfield, it seems. To go with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/27/fiorentina-chelsea-mohamed-salah-insane-offer\">talk that both <strong>Mo Salah</strong></a> and <strong>Juan Cuadrado</strong> might be on their respective bikes after heartbreakingly brief spells at Stamford Bridge, Juventus are said to be most enamoured with <strong>Oscar</strong> and could make a bid post-haste. In response, Jos&eacute; Mourinho will hire his latest version of the Spinal Tap drummer <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/28/arda-turan-talks-potential-transfer\">in the shape of <strong>Arda Turan</strong></a>, and hope he doesn’t spontaneously combust or die in a bizarre gardening accident. </p> \n<p><strong>Stewart Downing</strong> clearly hasn’t done much to impress Slaven Bilic, because the England man has been dumped somewhere on Green Street with a sign around his neck marked ‘&pound;6million O.N.O’ – Newcastle, Leicester and Sunderland have all been spotted in the area wondering if he’s worth the dough. Elsewhere it’s <strong>Erik Lamela</strong> out, Monaco’s <strong>Yannick Ferreira Carrasco</strong> in at Tottenham, the only minor formalities on that score being finding someone to buy the former and finding an extra &pound;8million to go with the first &pound;8million they bid for the latter. Swansea are set to pip Bournemouth and Southampton to the signing of Braga forward <strong>Eder</strong>, but the Saints won’t let that sort of gazumping become a habit by wrapping up deals for Marseille’s <strong>Gianelli Imbula</strong> and Juventus’s <strong>Angelo Ogbonna</strong> as soon as they can. </p> \n<p>Finally, there’s been plenty of talk around Arsenal have wrapped up a deal for <strong>Arturo Vidal</strong> from Juventus, but as it turns out that may all have stemmed from some bloke on Twitter inventing quotes from a Chilean journalist.

There is other football, too, with Slaven Bilic making his bow as the West Ham manager in the Europa League","byline":"Observer sport","body":"<h2>INTERNATIONAL FINALS…</h2> \n<p>A big week for football finals. England’s early exit from the European Under-21s Championship means they will not be involved in the final on Tuesday (7pm, BT Sport 1). However, dependent on the outcome of their match against the hosts, Canada, in the wee hours of this morning - too late for a Sunday newspaper deadline –the Women’s World Cup may yet feature an England side. The final on Friday (11.30pm, BBC2) should provide further evidence of why the women’s game is fast emerging from the shadow of its male counterpart. Elsewhere South America’s finest will be on show on Saturday in the Copa Am&eacute;rica final (8.00pm, Premier Sports and Xbox Live). Even though football is in its off-season there’s plenty to get stuck in to.</p> \n<h2>BILIC MAKES HIS BOW…</h2> \n<p>Wait, there’s more football. Among the 102 teams named in the first round of Europa League qualifying were West Ham, who made it to the foothills of the competition by virtue of their fair play. Having had little more than a month since the Premier League ended with a defeat at Newcastle and then rolling out the welcome mat to former defender Slaven Bilic as their manager, West Ham now find themselves facing the mighty Andorran outfit FC Lusitans on Thursday. This is where the prefix “minnows” invariably appears but the team from the tiny Iberian principality – population: 85,500; motto: “United virtue is stronger” – are perhaps feebler than minnows (mini-minnows?), having lost their last European tie 7-3 on aggregate to Streymur of the Faroe Islands – pop: 50,000 – nearly two years ago. Bilic will hope for sterner tests before the Premier League starts in August, but the first game of Upton Park’s final season is a good match to ease him in.</p> \n<h2>ROAD RACE CLIMAX…</h2> \n<p>Cycling is in full cry as anticipation mounts for the Tour de France and today sees the culmination of the British Road-Race National Championships (11.30am, Eurosport 1). Laura Trott and Peter Kennaugh both return to defend their titles, hoping to be first through the finish line in Lincoln’s Castle Square.</p> \n<h2>SPEED MERCHANTS…</h2> \n<p>The British Athletics Championships get underway on Friday as the country’s athletes chase qualification for August’s world championships. The controversy surrounding the eligibility of the Anguillan-born sprinter Zharnel Hughes will add a tense backdrop to the blockbuster 100m and 200m events, with rival Richard Kilty tweeting his displeasure at Hughes’s place in Team GB. However the 19-year-old has openly targeted a place in Beijing so will need to show he is worth the hype to seal his spot. Expect fireworks.</p> \n<h2>SPEED MERCHANTS II…</h2> \n<p>After his starting grid error in Austria, Lewis Hamilton will be hoping he can make amends with a strong performance on home soil at Silverstone (BBC1 from Saturday). Hamilton still leads his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg by 10 points but with the pair’s rivalry simmering, the British Grand Prix will be compelling viewing. Let’s hope Hamilton forgets the Queen’s recent advice and turns right first.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435329157569/BC-PLACE-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Who will take to the field at BC Place, Vancouver for the final of the Women's World Cup?

Here are half a dozen examples","standFirst":"<p>From doing things normally after a tragedy, to overcoming entrenched sexism, to punching an armed mugger, bravery in sport takes many different forms</p>","byline":"Nick Miller","body":"<h2>1) Sean Abbott</h2> \n<p>In most walks of life, the disregard for personal safety or ignoring pain is your traditional barometer of bravery, like running into a burning building to save a puppy, or jumping on a land mine. Bravery is an emotional state, usually related to physical wellbeing. As is the case in sport; in cricket, for example, one might usually think of bravery as standing up to a fearsome bowling attack, or fielding at short-leg without a helmet on, having little regard for one’s own personal safety in the name of The Cause.</p> \n<p>Brian Close is the obvious name for both of those criteria – the old boy who of course famously stood and took the missiles of the West Indies on the chest at Old Trafford in 1976. Close, who curiously looked older than his 46 years then but these days barely seems to have aged at all, declared that a cricket ball couldn’t really hurt you because “it’s only on you for a second”, which was presumably his theory behind wearing a succession of bumpers from Andy Roberts and Michael Holding rather than swaying away, leaving a flamboyant tapestry of bruises on his torso. He also, as legend has it, once exclaimed “catch it” after the ball rebounded off his forehead while fielding at short-leg in a Yorkshire match. The catch was taken.</p> \n<p> However, there’s also a bravery in dishing out that sort of treatment, because while the intention (usually) isn’t to actually seriously hurt one’s opponent, it’s an inevitable hazard of hurling a hard object at someone from 22 yards away, at upwards of 95 miles an hour. It is, though, part of the sport, and obviously the instances of serious injury, or worse, are few and far between. But they do happen, and did to Phillip Hughes in November 2014, when he suffered a freak injury after being hit on the head by a bouncer, passing away a couple of days later.</p> \n<p> It was something that couldn’t have happened again if someone had taken the same blow another 1,000 times, but part of human nature is, when something like this is shown to be possible, to be afraid. Many remain terrified of flying despite the millions of planes that land safely every year, and so you can only imagine how terrified Sean Abbott, the man who delivered the fateful bouncer that struck Hughes, must have been when he returned to cricket.</p> \n<p> It took some bravery to even come back to cricket at all, even in the certain knowledge that Hughes’ death absolutely was not his fault, but even more to play on using the logic that it couldn’t happen again and he must play normally, and for a fast bowler like Abbott, ‘normally’ means short-pitched bowling. In his first over back, for New South Wales against Queensland, less than three weeks after Hughes’ death, Abbott bowled a bouncer, which batsman Joe Burns ducked underneath. The psychological barrier was hurdled, although it took courage to even let go of the ball under those circumstances. Abbott took two wickets in that innings, but in the second ran through the Queensland order to claim figures of 6-14 off seven overs and was named man of the match. He was given the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year award in January.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7V6heKr8E8Y\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7V6heKr8E8Y?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>2) Kathrine Switzer</h2> \n<p> And then there’s political bravery. Kathrine Switzer was an amateur runner at Syracuse University in 1967, when she decided to challenge herself by running the Boston Marathon. Thing was, no woman had ever run the Boston Marathon before, and even her own coach didn’t believe it was possible for a poor, fragile, weak little woman to run 26.2 miles (“No dame ever ran the Boston Marathon!” he told her), but once she proved to him she could in a training run (with an extra five miles thrown in, just for yucks), they entered the race. Apparently there was nothing official in the rules preventing a woman from registering, but she wrote her name down as KV Switzer on the entry form anyway, just to be sure. Switzer, coach Arnie Briggs, her boyfriend (a 235-pound hammer thrower who didn’t bother training because if a woman could run a marathon, he could too) and another friend all piled into a car and headed to an unseasonably cold Boston.</p> \n<p> All was going well until around the four-mile mark, when Switzer heard leather-soled footsteps behind her. “Instinctively I jerked my head around quickly and looked square into the most vicious face I’d ever seen,” <a href=\"http://kathrineswitzer.com/about-kathrine/1967-boston-marathon-the-real-story/\">she wrote in ‘Marathon Woman’</a>, her memoir. “A big man, a huge man, with bared teeth was set to pounce, and before I could react he grabbed my shoulder and flung me back, screaming, ‘Get the hell out of my race and give me those numbers!’ Then he swiped down my front, trying to rip off my bib number, just as I leapt backward from him. He missed the numbers, but I was so surprised and frightened that I slightly wet my pants and turned to run. But now the man had the back of my shirt and was swiping at the bib number on my back.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/gallery/2014/apr/11/10-best-marathon-moments-in-pictures-london\">The 10 best marathon moments – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> The outraged man in question turned out to be Jock Semple, the marathon director, who was promptly barged out of the way by the macho boyfriend. Switzer finished the race in four hours twenty minutes, but caused a press sensation for the eyebrow-raising feat of ‘running a long way while in possession of ovaries’, batting off the questions from journalists (“Are you a suffragette?” asked one hack with his finger firmly on the political pulse) about why she had entered the race with a Forrest Gump-esque “I like to run.” </p> \n<p> She wrote: “I’ve stepped into a different life, I thought. To the guys it was a one-off event. But I knew it was a lot more than that. A lot more.” Switzer campaigned for women to be officially admitted to the race, which they eventually were in 1972, and went on to be a TV journalist.</p> \n<p> Incidentally, the boyfriend hit the wall at about 13 miles and staggered home an hour after Switzer.</p> \n<h2>3) Leonardo Bonucci</h2> \n<p>This is cheating slightly, because it displays bravery away from the field of play. The more obvious route would be to comment on the many examples of those who went to war, from the likes of Donald Bell, the only professional footballer to ever be awarded the Victoria Cross, to great baseball slugger Ted Williams, who interrupted his career twice to fly in World War Two then the Korean War. However, there are too many sportsmen who have fought in assorted wars to select just one, so how about a slightly different example of off-pitch bravery.</p> \n<p> Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci was car shopping (at a Ferrari dealership – he is a professional footballer) with his wife and infant son in 2012, when an opportunistic mugger decided that this was the perfect mark, a wealthy man who was distracted and, given that he was with his family, would most likely hand over the demanded trinkets with the minimum of fuss. The villain in question approached the Bonuccis and demanded Leonardo hand over his watch (not, one suspects, a Casio), brandishing a firearm by way of persuasion. </p> \n<p>Bonucci, though, was having little of it. The mugger reportedly grabbed him by the wrist but Bonucci, sensing an opening where most would sense a troubling churning of the stomach, punched his assailant with his free hand. The startled criminal made his escape on an accomplice’s moped, only for Bonucci to chase after him. To repeat: he chased after an armed mugger who was retreating on a moped. “What are you doing? Are you mad? I’ll shoot you!” the mugger quite reasonably noted. </p> \n<p> There’s a fine line between bravery and stupidity. Speaking of which …</p> \n<h2>4) John Terry</h2> \n<p> There must be a good reason to be a jockey. The synergy between man and beast; the competitive instinct; the racing despite not being of the traditional athletic physique; the sensation of being of diminutive stature but controlling such a large animal; the money, if you turn out to be really good. All of those might do it.</p> \n<p> But when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/24/tony-mccoy-broke-bones-heart-sandown-retires\">even the very best break every bone in their body,</a> thrown from the horse and with very little chance to do anything about it, you do wonder whether it’s worth all the trouble. You have to be seriously sturdy up top to mentally shake all of that off and quite literally get back on the horse; that, or be wired slightly differently to most other people. You have to basically be impervious to pain.</p> \n<p> Of the various forms of moral fortitude, bravery is not one that you’d necessarily ascribe to John Terry the man. John Terry the defender, football player and thrower of body onto line, however, is a different matter. There’s no horse involved, but you sometimes wonder whether Terry is actually made of fragile flesh, the sort that reacts to sensations like heat, cold, pain, sunlight etc, and is rather a theoretical humanoid, hewn from rubber and kevlar, like a sentient and hard-wearing crash test dummy. How else would one explain his insistence on throwing everything in the way of the ball when propelled at speed? </p> \n<p> Terry is far from the first or only footballer to determine that his skin and bones are worth sacrificing to prevent a goal being scored (Kevin Moran, Terry Butcher, Colin Hendry and Nemanja Vidic all spring to mind), but it seems as if he has appointed himself as a sort of central defensive member of the secret service, diving in front of a bullet to keep the president from harm, in his case the Chelsea or England goal playing the part of commander in chief. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GEB-TYLMmQ\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8GEB-TYLMmQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p> The incident that readily springs to mind is in the 2007 League Cup final, when Terry attempted to compete for the ball (in attack, this time) with Abou Diaby’s swinging right boot. Perhaps Terry reasoned that Diaby is so injury-prone that his own bonce was more than a match for a full-blooded kick, and skull would overcome leather boot. It didn’t, as it turned out, Terry knocked unconscious and immediately taken from the field. “I remember walking out for the second half and nothing else until waking up in the ambulance on the way to the hospital,” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2007/feb/26/newsstory.carlingcup06072\">Terry said</a> after returning to the dressing room from hospital to celebrate with his teammates. Probably for the best.</p> \n<h2>5) David Purley</h2> \n<p> Motor racing was not a safe business in years gone by. Mercifully, there have been no fatalities at a Formula One Grand Prix since Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger in 1994, but between 1953 and 1982, 27 drivers died at races, which isn’t even including the assorted deaths at other forms of motor sport. </p> \n<p> There wasn’t a Dutch Grand Prix at Circuit Park Zandvoort in 1972, after it was left off the schedule while safety upgrades were made to the track, a development that was at least in part inspired the death of Piers Courage in 1970, his car veering off at a fast bend and catching fire. They were back in 1973, but just as three years earlier, at the same corner on which Courage perished, Roger Williamson crashed, his car flipped over and caught fire, trapping him in the blazing vehicle. </p> \n<p> David Purley, Williamson’s March-Ford teammate, was not far behind him when the accident took place. Remarkably, Purley stopped his own car, pulled to the side of the track and rushed over to try and help his colleague, desperately trying to extricate Williamson from the upside-down, burning vehicle. The marshals that arrived on the scene to help Purley were not wearing fire retardant clothing, and there was just one fire extinguisher in the immediate area, meaning the frenzied attempts to at least right the car and put out the flames were in vain. </p> \n<p> Eric Dymock wrote in the Guardian at the time: “Purley said that when he got to the car, Williamson was trying to reach the fire extinguisher button on the car itself, and undo his seat belts to get out. Yet still the marshals held back for fear, no doubt, of an explosion or the fierceness of the fire they felt sure was to follow.”</p> \n<p> Many, including the race controllers, assumed that it was Purley’s car that was ablaze and he had safely escaped, so the race continued. A fire crew eventually arrived eight minutes later, but by that time Williamson had suffocated. “You would have thought after Piers’s accident, they’d have got hold of the best fire-fighting equipment in the world,” an unnamed driver told the Guardian at the time, “but they haven’t.”</p> \n<p> Purley was awarded the George Medal for his efforts, and appeared only sporadically in Formula One over the following few years. He died in a plane crash in 1985.</p> \n<h2>6) Cathy Freeman</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tslYPALKWO0\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tslYPALKWO0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p> Of course, all sportspeople are brave in one respect, as much as anyone is for getting up and doing anything in front of thousands of people. The expectation at the highest level is such that you’d would forgive anyone under that sort of pressure for running away and curling up in a dark room somewhere for the duration. Many of us hyperventilate if we have to give a presentation or go on a first date, and that’s just (unless either go really well) talking for a little bit. </p> \n<p> And the pressure obviously grows when it becomes about more than just the sport. Cathy Freeman was a symbol of the Sydney Olympics in a way that few others have been throughout history; not only was she the host nation’s best and most prominent track and field athlete, but an Aboriginal in a nation desperately trying to make up for its long racist past. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/gallery/2012/jan/11/olympic-cathy-freeman-in-pictures\">50 stunning Olympic moments: Cathy Freeman's gold – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> Freeman ran for Australia, but wasn’t afraid to speak about the crimes her nation had committed. She carried an Aboriginal flag around the track after winning gold at the 1994 Commonwealth Games for which, remarkably, she was reprimanded by the Australian Commonwealth Association. “You have to understand that when you have a government that is so insensitive to the issues that are close to people’s hearts, that have affected so many lives for the worse, people are going to be really angry and emotional,” she told the Daily Telegraph before the Olympics in 2000. “I’ll never know who my grandfather was. I didn’t know who my great-grandmother was. And that can never be replaced. All that pain. It’s very strong. And generations have felt it.”</p> \n<p> So when the final of the 400m came around, it was as if she had the expectation of two countries on her shoulders, as well as the simple pressure of 112,524 people watching her try to run around a track as fast as possible. Oh, and it was the Olympic final. It’s enough to make anyone go away and never come back.</p> \n<p> But Freeman won, and with some style too, running a remarkably controlled race before storming down the home straight to take gold. After the race, she didn’t celebrate wildly or even smile, but simply unzipped the hood of her bodysuit and sank to the floor – the realisation that she had coped with the pressure and won simply too much for her to do anything else. “I was totally overwhelmed because I could feel the crowd all around me,” she said after the race. “All their emotions, all that happiness and joy. I just had to sit down.”</p> \n<p> “What a legend! What a champion!” said Australian commentator Bruce McAvaney after she crossed the finish line. “What a relief,” Raelene Boyle, the former Olympic sprinter, sighed alongside him. </p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435154948971/4257ee95-12e4-4c39-9bc0-29f6f34c2bc5-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Nick Wilson/Getty Images","altText":"25 Sep 2000:  Cathy Freeman of Australia is elated after winning Gold in the 400m Final during the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games at Stadium Australia in Sydney, Australia.

What? No?! Of course, you do! He was the one who said: “Let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball. They could, for example, have tighter shorts. Female players are pretty, if you excuse me for saying so.” The same lad who advised any gay fans travelling to Qatar (the place where homosexuality is punishable by death and the same place for the 2022 World Cup) to “refrain from any sexual activities”. The dude who, when asked about John Terry’s alleged special cuddling with his ex-team-mate’s ex-other half, said: “If this happened in, let’s say Latin countries, then I think he would be applauded.” Ringing any bells? What? Still not? Pfff. This is like dealing with Dougal here. Ah wait, this will jog the memory. He is the one who dances like a drunk grandda at a wedding, the same grandda who thinks he jives like one of those Brazilian dancers at Carnival but who actually jives like a hippo trying to do the hokey cokey despite a recent hip replacement. Now, you know who the Fiver means, right? Right.</p> \n<p>Well, you may or may not know this, dear reader, but old Sepp was also the head of Fifa. But, and this is where the tale takes a sad turn, the poor sod had to give up his job a few weeks ago. It seems some members of Fifa have been more than a bit naughty under his watch. So off he went with these words reverberating around the world: “I have decided to lay down my mandate at an extraordinary elective congress ... I shall not be a candidate [for the election] ... We need deep-rooted structural change”. Now the Fiver is simple folk and usually finds it difficult to follow Postman Pat plots but even <em tabindex=\"-1\">it</em> could work out that all this meant Sepp was about to become a fully paid-up member of Club du One, right? Eh, kinda.</p> \n<p>You see, last night, Sepp stepped out for a topping out, the topping out of the new Fifa museum. (Presumably this museum will skip over the organisation’s last few weeks). Here are some snippets from what he said: “I have not resigned. I am making my mandate available at an extraordinary congress ... Only those who know the past can understand the present and shape the future. Or in other words: the ball is round – but only those who come from outer space know the actual dimensions of our sport … For me personally, the museum is a labour of love. But do not get me wrong: I’m not ready for the museum nor for a waxwork yet.”</p> \n<p>Wait! What? Did the Fiver just read that right? The ball is round? Sepp is not a waxwork? Could have fooled us. And the same Sepp is about to do the biggest U-turn since, well, um, ever? Sweet, merciful, Yeezus. This might be one of the worst things he has said yet.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY 1</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70d8532618e3cc0a79e9d2d456cda9fa24a5bc56\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435326128977/8e1d6578-69cb-41e1-8d73-bba85e94c093-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Roy Keane\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wait, there’s more …</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“We got a lecture from the medical team that because of the weather we had to drink these drinks. ‘If you don’t take these drinks, you might die …’ That’s what we were told.
