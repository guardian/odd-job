He looks so unlikely. Battered white hat, sleeves rolled, trousers tugged high and of course that great salt and pepper beard, hanging down to his chest. He sets himself in front of a single stump. Back foot parallel to the crease, front foot angled both out at 45 degrees and up, cocked. As the bowler approaches he lowers it down, moving his weight from the heel to the toe. At the same time he brings the bat up, waggles it once in mid-air, then lofts it again, to the top of his backlift. Six balls, that’s all. And soft ones, intended only to give the batsman the best chance to show off his shots.</p> \n<p>And so he does. Three easy drives to the on-side, another to the off, two glances towards mid-wicket. He’s defending a single stump, there, really, only for orientation. Behind him, a small crowd, which hardly seems to move. Look closely, however, and you’ll see one old man lean out from around another to catch a good look, and a small boy snap his head around in excitement and talk to his friend. Then the camera cuts and the batsman is gone. That’s it, <a href=\"http://www.britishpathe.com/video/cricket-giants-of-the-1890s/query/wg+grace\">all the footage we have</a> of one of the greatest, perhaps the very greatest, careers in English sport. The Champion, the Doctor, the Grand Old Man. WG. It gives us the beginnings of an idea about his style – but no more than that.</p> \n<p>This month marks the 150th anniversary of Grace’s first-class debut, which falls on Monday 22 June, for the Gentlemen of the South against the Players of the South. He was 16. This year also marks the 100th anniversary of his death, on 23 October 1915. He was 67 and had been playing as recently as the year before, his final innings an undefeated 69 out of Eltham’s total of 155 for six against Grove Park. His career as a competitive cricketer spanned six decades and, most likely, he played more innings and scored more runs across all levels of the game than anyone else in history.</p> \n<p>A rough sum that, since hard numbers are impossible to come by. But there were 870 first-class matches, for sure, which puts him third to Wilfred Rhodes and Frank Woolley, and countless more that didn’t carry that status. For 50 years, he bestrode what was then the national game, much as Nelson looks down on London from his column, leaving the best of his contemporaries like Landseer’s bronze lions, lying beneath his feet. Certainly Donald Bradman is the only cricketer who could be said to have made anything like such an impact on the public consciousness.</p> \n<p>We are still writing about Grace now, still reading about him, still learning about him. There have been three major biographies of him in the last 15 years alone. This summer, BBC Radio Bristol are running <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02rbx9g\">a series of documentaries on him</a>. And yet, somehow, the more detail we uncover, the more the man himself seems to recede from view. The more we learn, the less we understand.</p> \n<p>There are too many contradictions. Grace was the champion of the sport and yet also “a shameless cheat” as Geoffrey Moorhouse wrote in Wisden. (“They’ve come to see me bat,” and all that). Grace was the supreme cricketer, “an all-round athlete of the highest calibre”, according to Simon Rae. And he was also a roly-poly figure, almost 15 stone as a teenage and 22 stone as an adult. Grace was an amateur and he earned more from the game than any professional of his era. It is hard to knit together what we know.</p> \n<p>And so to a rather brilliant new novella by Charlie Connelly, called, quite simply, <a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/gilbert-9781472917591/\">Gilbert</a>. Because, as the blurb says, “to the public he was The Doctor, The Champion and WG, but to those who knew him best he was simply Gilbert.” Gilbert is an intimate portrait, slim and sparely written but full of detail. It takes us through the final years of Grace’s life, from 1898 to 1915. It begins with the famous story about his being dismissed three times in three balls by Charles Kortright, the first leg before, and the second caught behind. Grace stood his ground. The third, of course, bowled him. And so Kortright offered the send-off: “Surely you’re not leaving us, Doctor? There’s one stump still standing.”</p> \n<p>As Connelly imagines it: “Grace paused briefly as if he was about to turn and respond but instead marched off at a quickened pace, announcing to the waiting members as he strode up the steps that he had never been so insulted in his life.” You know the stories but you’ve never heard them told quite like this.</p> \n<p>Connelly explains his game in an entertaining early chapter that captures a conversation between Grace and his ghost writer, Arthur Porritt. Poritt hopes to write a book that will “look behind the curtain of the public face and share the real man with the reading public”, but finds himself frustrated by Grace’s incomprehension that there is anything to explore beyond the “bare facts of his achievements”.</p> \n<p>“I think your readers would very much enjoy any insight you can give them into what the experience actually felt like. People want to put themselves in the place of WG Grace as he was making that 100th century, what thoughts were in his mind, what the whole experience of such a big innings and extraordinary landmark means to WG Grace as a man and a batsman.”</p> \n<p>Grace was silent for a few moments.</p> \n<p>“I want to help you, Porritt, truly I do,” he said, “but to be perfectly honest with you I did not feel anything. I had too much to do watching the bowling and seeing how the fieldsmen were moved about to think anything. It’s as simple as that.”</p> \n<p>The facts lack. Connelly has taken that gap in our understanding of Grace and filled it from the well of his own imagination. He shows us the Grace who gave away his wicket so he could skip away from a match to take his very first ride in a motor car; the Grace who would stand in his garden and shake his fist at the Zeppelins flying overhead; the Grace who had to bury his daughter and his eldest son, both parents, and both brothers.</p> \n<p>What emerges is a portrait of a man who lived for the moment when the ball leaves the bowler’s hand and “absolutely nothing mattered other than his duel with it. The years fell away, the occasion melted to nothing and there was just him and the ball, locked in a duel”. It is a wonderful book, and though it’s a fiction, it brings us closer to an understanding of the man than any number of facts or any amount of film footage.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://id.theguardian.com/email/list\"><strong><em>This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.

The Fiver has sleepless nights worrying about this, so how about a straw poll? Is it Jos&eacute;? Pep? Carlo? Ars&egrave;ne? ‘Arry? We went to school with all of them, even if we’re just that faintly remembered kid at the back of the photo who cowered in the toilets at break, so we can’t claim complete professional distance. But in fact, our favourite at the moment is Gary. Gary is the best manager in the world.<br /></p> \n<p>Gary is Gary White – one of the dying breed of managers to have been born with a surname, and the English coach of Guam. And Guam (population: 165,000) did something pretty special on Tuesday morning – or Monday night if you’re reading in, er, Guam – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/guam-beat-india-world-cup-qualifier\">by beating India (population: 1.3 billion) 2-1</a> in the World Cup qualifiers. It was Guam’s second win in a week, after Turkmenistan were also beaten last Thursday, and marks a staggering turnaround from the previous time they had braved a match at this level, losing 16-0 in Tajikistan 15 years ago.</p> \n<p>The Fiver spent most of the morning rapping its fingers on the desk waiting for a Fifa proclamation about this firm evidence of the enduring heath of its Football Family, but <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/fifa-nobel-handshake-for-peace-termination-fair-play\">it seems a little occupied in Zurich today</a> [if only Fifa and the Nobel Peace Centre could settle their differences with an internationally recognised symbol of goodwill? – Fiver Ed] so we’ll do it ourselves: results like this are good news. Even if Indian football has been an utter shambles for years – and won’t the person who, one day, hits upon the idea that sorts it out make themselves a nice little sum? – it’s a result to make you sit up and rejoice that, with the right organisation, the little guy can stick it to The Man.</p> \n<p>If it were an FA Cup first-round tie, we might be trotting something out about the various butchers, bakers and estate agents who’d dished out a bloodied nose. But The Fiver is like, er, um … loads more imaginative than that, so what about the teams they play for? Guam can call upon number of USA! USA!! USA!!!-based players but others in their squad are signed to local sides Quality Distributors, Guam Shipyard and – best of all – Payless Supermarket Strykers. It cannot be long before Aldi buy up a few Football League grounds but for now there’s a degree of novelty that Guam, certainly not a pub team, are at least in part a composite of some supermarket ones.</p> \n<p>Behind all this is Gary, who some might remember coached the British Virgin Islands to decent effect at the age of 24 just before a certain AVB’s short stint with the Caribbean side. The two have gone in different directions since then but maybe Gary, still only 40, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/12/guam-soccer-dream-fifa-world-cup\">deserves a shot at something bigger now</a> – perhaps a chance to shop in a supermarket even more bountiful than Payless. It might come to a pretty pass before he gets Jos&eacute; booted out of Harrods, but there’s something to be said for giving chances to an English manager who has been willing to get his hands dirty – really dirty – improving tiny nations from such a young age. Either that, or give him the India job. We know who would manage our Football Family XI and it won’t take an official press release to cure our insomnia.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>“Now the women are getting more beautiful, putting on makeup. They go in the field in an elegant manner. Women’s football used to copy men’s football. Even the jersey model, it was more masculine. We used to dress the girls as boys. So the team lacked a spirit of elegance, femininity. Now the shorts are a bit shorter, the hairstyles are more done up. It’s not a woman dressed as a man” – Marco Aur&eacute;lio Cunha, the head of coordination for women’s football in Brazil, reveals himself to be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/make-up-shorts-improving-womens-game-brazil\">just the 11 years behind Sepp Blatter</a> when it comes to boneheaded, stone-age statements.

OK, England aren’t going to win Euro 2016 (necessarily), but six wins out of six ain’t bad (yesterday’s Fiver). So, other sides score against us (twice in one game … three times in six games!). Cynicism only works when it correlates with reality you know” – Mark Dawson.</p> \n<p>“I have a plan to save Fifa. Instead of this Qatar nonsense, let’s stage the world’s first global cup. Have 128 teams in a felt bag and the thrill of international one-game knockout football. Trevor Brooking and Shakira to draw the balls, we can do away with the nonsense of qualifying for the top 64 teams, it would still take seven games to win it and properly involve the world. Imagine Azerbaijan’s incredible run to the semi-finals! By the way, please also consider this my official bid to become head of Fifa. #reaneyforfifa” – Paul Reaney.</p> \n<p>“Just found out the Stanley Cup finals are still going: pub not showing Canada’s World Cup game. It is mid-June! #StopHockey” – Scott Colbourne.</p> \n<p>“So you expect readers to believe that letters for yesterday’s Fiver were ‘just not very good’? Deluded we may be for subscribing to the piffle that salaried journos conjure up about the beautiful game between the lunchtime pint. But stupid we ain’t. It’s been obvious for some time that all the original and thought-provoking nonsense published in this column is the work of unpaid contributors, who can only dream of athlete’s foot and the smell of horse liniment. Their efforts are obviously casting the incumbent hacks into the fringes of mediocrity, with protectionist censorship the consequence. We deserve to be heard, or in fact, read” – Ian Tasker.</p> \n<p>“Amy Lawrence can’t have taken that photo (yesterday’s Still Want More).

We’re demob happy – it’s holiday time now and the reason for holiday time is that the season ended on Monday night with its customary curtain-downer. The only news that could clear our mind of all earthly distractions for the next six weeks was the final, clinching piece of news that <strong>Arsenal</strong> had launched their kit and the newly-vacant space inside our brain is nothing to do with hearing H&eacute;ctor Beller&iacute;n’s reaction, probably an exclusive hot take to somebody, that: “It’s really nice, obviously red and white like people like it!” No, the Mill does not feel any the less intelligent for that; it’s a cue for us to be ourselves, so we’re off to buy <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/15/jack-grealish-aston-villa-pictures-tenerife\" title=\"\">whichever travel guide Jack Grealish purchased</a> and have ourselves a nice time.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/15/chelsea-homeless-two-seasons-stamford-bridge\">Chelsea may have to leave Stamford Bridge for at least two seasons</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Must have been a relief, though, for Arsenal to struggle through and get that launch over the line because things like signing footballers can get in the way slightly. Perhaps they won’t have to worry about such inconveniences for a while, though – there are suggestions that their move for <strong>Petr Cech </strong>might be hijacked by <strong>Paris Saint-Germain</strong>, who, like a highwayman at Turnpike Lane, have guns drawn and plan to gallop off with the goalkeeper after shoving a &pound;150,000-a-week, five-year contract in front of his disbelieving face. Cech is thought to favour a switch to the Gunners, but negotiations have foundered over his request to beatbox at next June’s big away kit reveal.</p> \n<p>The heart is a funny thing and apparently <strong>Paul Pogba</strong> has his set firmly on <strong>Barcelona</strong> ahead of Manchester. That still won’t deter <strong>Manchester City</strong>, who have been making eyes at the Juventus midfielder since the dawn of time but deny having made an &pound;82m bid just yet, but will their doggedness be enough to persuade the Frenchman that the Etihad is nicer than the <em>Eixample</em>?</p> \n<p>What else? Surely everyone else is now knocking off too. Apparently not, because <strong>Real Madrid </strong>are still nibbling away at <strong>David de Gea</strong> in the continuation of a saga that should ensure the Mill stays fed this summer – but <strong>Manchester United </strong>are to reject the cheapskates’ measly first offer. There remain suggestions that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/gallery/2015/jun/16/hugo-lloris-the-gallery\" title=\"\">a United deal for <strong>Hugo Lloris</strong></a> could expedite the whole thing and leave us out on the street, though.</p> \n<p>United might put up rather less of a struggle if <strong>Newcastle </strong>front up some cash for <strong>Jesse Lingard</strong>, with Steve McClaren looking to sign a player he brought to Derby on loan during the season that finished on Monday. But perhaps Louis van Gaal could use the cash – they’d been hoping to sign the <strong>Valencia </strong>defender <strong>Nicol&aacute;s Otamendi </strong>for a perfectly reasonable &pound;25m but have been told to go a whole &pound;10m higher and meet the Argentinian’s release clause.</p> \n<p>Far closer to completion, though, is <strong>Southampton’s</strong> move for the <strong>M&aacute;laga</strong> forward <strong>Juanmi, </strong>who told Ronald Koeman his name with a slightly upwards inflection and was greeted with the reply “Yes, we do”. Apparently &pound;5.1m would see that through, although there are other vultures hovering – including McClaren.</p> \n<p>A couple more Arsenal bits to finish with. The release of next season’s training jerseys is being complicated by their interest in <strong>Karim Benzema</strong>, whose Real Madrid future seems in doubt once more, while reports in Germany say <strong>Julian Draxler</strong>, the <strong>Schalke </strong>midfielder who was heavily linked with them a year or two back, would not mind slipping on their new red and white outfit next season. Red and white. Like people like it.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/16/1434440181991/Petr-Cech-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Diving on that big fat PSG contract, or staying in London?

The last time the US Open was held on the notoriously tough Pennsylvania track, in 2007, five over par won it for &Aacute;ngel Cabrera. The one before that, in 1994, was another grind. Ernie Els was one of only three players to end the week having broken par – just the one under par, mind. He triumphed in the play-off thanks to a round of three over, and then par on the second sudden-death hole. You really do have to earn it at Oakmont. </p> \n<p>Johnny Miller shot 63 on his way to victory at the 1973 US Open, it’s true, but there’s a textbook example of the exception proving the rule. Miller’s round is often cited as the greatest ever; given that figure has since been matched 25 times in the majors, its continued exalted status says just as much about the notoriety of the course as the brilliance of the player and his score. </p> \n<p>Good luck identifying Oakmont’s biggest threat. Some will point to the bunkers, and they can thrust their finger in pretty much any direction, for there are nearly 200 of the buggers. That total includes one of the most famous around: the Church Pews, a behemoth to the left of the 3rd fairway. The eponymous Pews are eight parallel grass ridges laddering a long trap; if your ball lands up against them, you’ll be playing out sideways or possibly even backwards. Keep your ball out of trouble and, well, congratulations, but don’t slap yourself on the back too soon, because they’re in play again as you come back down 4. It never stops. </p> \n<p>Others will bemoan the greens, which are huge, sloping and treacherously fast. “I only had six three putts in nine holes,” quipped a weary Tom Watson during the 1994 US Open. And then there are the tight fairways: the one ribboning its way down the 1st is a mere 24 yards wide. That opening tee shot is considered by many pros, including Miller and Els, to be the hardest start to a round in golf, and it doesn’t get easier quickly: even if you find the fairway with your drive, having avoided the bunkers guarding the landing zone on either side, you’re faced with a blind downhill second into a green which slopes away severely. Par, please!</p> \n<p>The US Open’s coming back to Oakmont next year. Can’t wait? Same here.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4df4b1c67e98339ab881d281a84cb31bb9ea722d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433417938278/31b9a139-72a9-47ad-ab66-edc38c03838f-460x308.jpeg\" alt=\"The church pew bunkering on the third hole at Oakmont, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"460\" height=\"308\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The church pew bunkering on the third hole at Oakmont, Pennsylvania.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Stewart/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>2) 10th at Pine Valley</strong></h2> \n<p>Pine Valley has a fearsome reputation as one of the most difficult golf courses in the world. It’s never held a big tournament, but that’s no reflection on its quality, merely the result of a lack of practical spectator space and the club’s unwillingness to compromise the course’s integrity by clearing some. </p> \n<p>The 10th hole is just 146 yards long. By this point in the round, a player’s nervous system will have been comprehensively shredded by a course which doesn’t really have fairways as such, more a series of landing zones around which one must plot. Golf as Frogger. A short par-three should offer some comparative relief, then. </p> \n<p>Ah but no. Anything other than a perfect tee shot into the heart of the green is a formal application for trouble, forms filled out in triplicate. The putting surface slopes outwards, an upturned saucer, so anything landing near the edge is going straight back off. Huge sand pits surround the green. And front right is a pot bunker from which escape onto the green is impossible, so steep is the face. Going out backwards is the only solution, and there goes that scorecard! </p> \n<p>The bunker is known, with a lyrical flourish, as The Devil’s Asshole. Robust nomenclature, but sometimes you need to get to the heart of the matter fast, no messing. Actually, we should have just started and ended this entry with those three little words. You’d have worked it all out for yourselves soon enough.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dad1b11864ed7b817d2659f609fa2fa2190392ff\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433418003776/a2106add-d7ab-468e-8613-85866be18354-277x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Bushes and shrubs in the rough near the green for the 10th hole at Pine Valley.\" width=\"277\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bushes and shrubs in the rough near the green for the 10th hole at Pine Valley.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Roberts/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>3) 15th … no, the 16th … no, the 17th at Cypress Point</strong></h2> \n<p>The four-time Masters champion Jimmy Demaret once described Cypress Point as “the best seventeen-hole course in the world”. Designed by Alister Mackenzie – also on his CV, Augusta National – it’s one of the most spectacular golfing arenas on earth, balanced precariously atop Californian cliffs, the Pacific crashing in, whales and sea-lions rolling in the deep blue below, deer cavorting inland among Monterey cypress trees. But the 18th is reckoned to be a bit dull, a workaday anti-climax, so there you go. Nothing’s perfect.<strong> </strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2012/apr/06/joy-of-six-golf-holes\">The Joy of Six: great golf holes | Scott Murray</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Not that it matters too much, because 15, 16 and 17 make up arguably the greatest run of holes in all golf. The 15th is a short par three, a gentle iron over the raging surf of an inlet cutting across the front of the tee to a heavily bunkered and undulating green. The rugged and exhilarating 16th is one of the most famous in the sport, another par three over water, perched high over the ocean, though in blustery conditions this one often requires a driver as the carry is over 230 yards with rocks staring at you and next to no escape on either side. (Unless you aim miles left towards a bail-out fairway and lay up, which kind of defeats the point of playing Cypress Point at all.) Possibly the most dangerous hole in the world. Bing Crosby once made hole in one. Straight down the middle. </p> \n<p>However there’s no decision to be made on 16; it’s either San Francisco or bust. The dogleg par-four 17th, however, messes with your mind. It’s not the longest, at just under 400 yards, but once again the player needs to carry the water from an elevated tee. With the Pacific hugging the right side of the hole, the choice is stark: she either cuts off a chunk of yardage by driving close to the shore, or plays it safe by aiming down the left. Only if she does that, a long second shot awaits, with one of those goddamn cypresses getting in the way. And the ocean on the right isn’t going anywhere. </p> \n<p>The 18th probably needs to be a bit boring after all that, doesn’t it. Alister Mackenzie knew exactly what he was doing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52ac98322ce2ae48d2ddc6db8b7461aa5b9b463f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433418125587/07420260-f293-44a7-aa67-7e23219d7964-460x311.jpeg\" alt=\"An aerial view of the 15th, 16th and 17th holes at Cypress Point.\" width=\"460\" height=\"311\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of the 15th, 16th and 17th holes at Cypress Point.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Sheldon/Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>4) 18th at St Andrews</strong></h2> \n<p>Regular readers will, of course, have <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2012/apr/06/joy-of-six-golf-holes\">played a few holes with the Joy of Six before</a>. Some of golf’s most notorious tests were mentioned that day – 12 and 13 at Augusta National, 18 at Carnoustie, 17 at Sawgrass, the Postage Stamp at Troon – because to be honest, we were hardly likely to wax lyrical about a short par four with a motorway-wide fairway straighter than a Roman road and no deep rough, trees or bunkers anywhere in sight. </p> \n<p>But, well, y’know. That JOS also considered the Road Hole at St Andrews, the connoisseur’s choice as the greatest hole in golf, with the famous bunker in which Tommy Nakajima crumbled to dust at the 1978 Open, and the iconic road behind the green that did for Tom Watson in 1984. But we’ve been there, taken 13 strokes on that. Instead, let’s consider the relatively simple closing hole, named after Tom Morris, the four-time Open champion who designed its deceptively tricky green. It’s 357 yards short. Tiger Woods drove the green in 2010 and nearly made a hole in one, before missing the relatively short eagle putt. Old Tom 1, Tiger 0. </p> \n<p>The 18th’s difficulty is all about context, all in the mind. It’s where the greats close the deal, and the dreams of nearly men fade and die. Leave your drive short and left, and you’re faced with the Valley of Sin, a clutch of undulations and dips guarding the green. God speed getting through that. And there’s no escaping it. Costantino Rocca’s arms turned to jelly as he tried to lob over it at the 1995 Open, needing to get up and down for birdie to force a play-off with John Daly. Chyip! The ball flopped pathetically into the Valley and into a deep depression. As, momentarily, did the player. The dangers of Tom Morris right there. The fact that Rocca famously rolled in the monster putt he left himself is neither here nor there; drained of emotional energy, his play-off bid ended in the Road Hole bunker, from which he’s still trying to escape today. </p> \n<p>Yes, objectively, 17 is the harder hole. But then look at poor Doug Sanders in 1970 to see how context is king. He was so nervous coming up 17, that after addressing the ball to take his second shot, he looked up the fairway an astonishing 29 times before going through with his swing, at one point stepping out of his stance and beginning again. Yet after dumping his ball in the Road Hole bunker, he so nearly splashed out for birdie. Par saved on the famously difficult hole, he went to 18 just needing par. Pulling his drive in front of the Valley of Sin, he then hit a hot chip 30 feet past the flag, before three putting on Old Tom’s subtly crafted green. There’s been no more hellish end to an Open than Sanders’ infamous short, tentative miss on what the locals call “the amateur’s side”. So, you see, appearances can be deceptive; 18 is a hell hole indeed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b9fb2bd18bba1e2f83a98ca34bd6dc1249eef36\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433418249147/c5fadc85-a308-4edd-98a8-97e344e9fbe4-460x305.jpeg\" alt=\"A look up the short, yet potentially nightmarish 18th hole on the Old Course at St Andrews.\" width=\"460\" height=\"305\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A look up the short, yet potentially nightmarish 18th hole on the Old Course at St Andrews.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>5) 18th at Whistling Straits</strong></h2> \n<p>Another hole where the clue is in the name. Pete and Alice Dye’s most famous creation is the aforementioned 17th island green at Sawgrass. Yet perhaps this one – the puntastic Dyeabolical – is the most notorious. A 500-plus-yard par-four finishing hole, it’s designed for drama. The safe line from the tee is down the right, but that leaves a long second into the green over Seven Mile Creek. The risky line from the tee is down the left, but that requires the best part of a 300-yard carry over sand dunes. </p> \n<p>At the 2010 PGA Championship, title-chasing Dustin Johnson took the safe line down the right, but drove wildly into the gallery, finding a patch of dusty ground which local rules designated as a bunker. Unaware of the ruling, he grounded his club, and the resulting penalty cost him a precious place in a play-off. In that play-off, Bubba Watson put his ball in the creek; Martin Kaymer won the title with a bogey. It’s a conundrum all right. </p> \n<p>“It’s a joke, there’s nothing good about it,” the 1979 Masters champion Fuzzy Zoeller once said of the hole, failing to understand that watching professionals thrash about like weekend hackers is one of the few pleasures we golfing mortals have in life.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e86ddcc49bd6cb241ea8c99505c7760c46b9d7c5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433418701652/d39e2743-ff23-4264-9189-c0da74e906ed-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"'Dyeabolical'.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Dyeabolical’.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>6) 18th at Doral</strong></h2> \n<p>The Blue Monster can devour the best of them: witness Rory McIlroy <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/mar/06/rory-mcilroy-club-water-doral\">launching his club into the azure vagueness</a> running down the left of the 8th back in March, having sent his ball in there with a shot that was 40 yards offline. “It felt good at the time,” admitted McIlroy, who thankfully couldn’t be bothered to kowtow to the pious moralisers. Of <em>course</em> it felt good at the time! </p> \n<p>The signature hole at Doral is the 484-yard par-four 18th, water running all the way down the left, trees and rough the other side of a tight, 32-yard-wide fairway. Attempt to blooter a drive down the left-hand side and you’ll need to carry it 300 yards to avoid some water kinking in. Too far to the right, and you’re faced with a lengthy second from the long stuff, towards a green guarded at the front by water and two large bunkers. “The hardest driving hole we face all year,” according to Jordan Spieth. “It is impossible,” adds Bubba Watson. Spieth and Bubba!</p> \n<p>So Blue Monster puts the fear up the best of them. And then Dustin Johnson, who has melted down in big tournaments more often than anyone cares to remember, stood on the tee in March requiring a par to win the WGC Cadillac. He calmly creamed it over the corner of the water on the left, leaving his ball in perfect position for a routine par, the most composed and measured closing out of a tournament you’re ever likely to witness. Calm. Composed. Measured. Dustin Johnson. Ah the beautiful, infinite absurdities of golf.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a14344172f51304d15c1d1614dbf282db33b39cb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433418433947/f4b20655-da64-4837-9639-3cf50a8df711-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"A scenic view of the 18th green on the Blue Monster Course at Doral in Florida.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scenic view of the 18th green on the Blue Monster Course at Doral in Florida.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keyur Khamar/US PGA Tour</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433418646584/f2d4eda6-ace9-4a6b-86de-b83e70816695-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Cannon/Getty Images","altText":"All 520 yards of the par-four 18th at Whistling Straits.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433417938630/31b9a139-72a9-47ad-ab66-edc38c03838f-2060x1378.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1378,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The church pew bunkering on the third hole at Oakmont, Pennsylvania.
