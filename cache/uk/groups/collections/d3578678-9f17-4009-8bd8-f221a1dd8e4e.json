With their hairlines and their laughter and their optimism and their prospects and their intact morals and their ability to get to the point. People are getting younger and we’d better start getting used to it for when it happens to us too. Look at Mark Sampson, for instance. It’s happened to him. Sampson is about to lead England into their Women’s World Cup campaign – which begins against France exactly one hour after a certain newsletter lands [in theory – Fiver Ed], so let’s hope you’re rattling through this – at the disgustingly young age of 32. Presumably he was 55 once but here he is, 32 if a day, cajoling his troops along at a major tournament while some other 32-year-olds blunder along doing things like writing earnestly about a 32-year-old at a major football tournament.</p> \n<p>Sampson says he was “born to do this job” and destiny will smack him in his fresh-ish young face on Tuesday in Moncton, a place The Fiver had never heard of either, but is almost as close to England as a Canadian city can possibly be. “The players keep reminding me about my bald patch and how much the stress is ageing me but being 32 is certainly not a problem,” he continued, and once we’ve put raw envy to one side we can’t help finding his presence rather welcome. Perhaps the greyness of the men’s draw with O’Ireland just shows everything else in a sickly-positive hue, but any kind of fresh approach in England’s football set-up is to be applauded and here, in a tournament that should be regarded as a bounty-laden parallel universe rather than something to be tiresomely compared with the men’s game, it comes in the form of a young boss who was managing surely-fictitious Welsh second-tier side Taff’s Well FC only five years ago.</p> \n<p>Goals have been fairly easy to come by in this tournament although Sampson’s baptism of fire against France, who England have had no joy playing since time immemorial, should be an altogether tighter affair. His team will be worth watching and, whatever the outcome, seeing a British coach receive this kind of chance feels like taking a leap through the looking glass. Much rather this than watching Mr Roy explain away post-season drudgery at the Aviva, and much rather watching the development of a sport that continues to find its feet – with or without <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/07/germany-celia-sasic-womens-world-cup-ivory-coast\">the occasional 10-goal drubbing</a> – than poring over the endeavours of 16 young men who somehow manage, in a reversal of today’s trend, to seem very old indeed.</p> \n<p>All of which only makes Sampson, along with everyone else, appear younger still. If he is a footballing Benjamin Button then soon enough we’ll see whether he came from Bobby Robson or Kevin Keegan, but at least he is an open book. The Fiver will be tuning in to watch later, while taking the selfies to prove it and listening to whatever kids listen to in preparation for our own shot at international glory in years to come. If everyone else is getting younger then there’ll be nothing at all embarrassing about making sure we’re ready to as well.</p> \n<h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT</h2> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Nick Ames from 6pm BST for MBM coverage of England 0-2 France in the Women’s World Cup</a>.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>“They couldn’t believe what they were seeing. I did one [joke] on [Roberto] Di Matteo. I went back to the villa and there was a little snake. I went back to training in the afternoon and put the snake in his pocket. When we came back in after training I asked him if he had any money. He put his hand in his pocket and nearly sh@t himself … Once [Dino] Zoff said [Sepp] Blatter was coming. He wanted us on time in the Lazio suit. I turned up 30 minutes later in a Santa Claus outfit. I sat next to Blatter and said: ‘Hello, I’m Santa, ho, ho, ho.’ The security wanted to get rid of me and Zoff wasn’t happy and made me train morning and afternoon for a week” – just one of the tales told by Paul Gascoigne <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/live/2015/jun/09/paul-gascoigne-webchat-live\">during an entertaining live webchat with Big Website earlier</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fb5f942febe9f034a6166e21904b2bc6e67661c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433853374433/dee9905c-f24e-4bd4-87f3-d07e4734e9b7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Gascoigne.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘BTL, you say?’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>FIVER LETTERS<br /></h2> \n<p>“On Sunday afternoon I was enjoying the sunshine while painting the side gate a particularly ‘interesting’ single shade of grey. My next-door neighbour, Pete, poked his head out and expressed his surprise that I wasn’t watching the O’Ireland v England bore-fest. ‘I didn’t even know it was on,’ I replied, cheerfully returning to my work. It was a good five minutes before I realised I was literally choosing to watch paint dry. I regret nothing” – Rob Coke.</p> \n<p>“Re: that one $9 ticket sold at Phoenix’s FilmBar cinema for United Passions (yesterday’s Bits and Bobs). Phoenix hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit over the weekend and the cinema is air-conditioned, so perhaps the sole ticket purchaser was simply looking for a place to cool off for a few hours. Of course [Snip – Fiver Lawyers] may wind up in the cooler themselves” – Christopher Smith.</p> \n<p>“I stumbled across you by accident. I think I was drawn to your name because it sounds a little like the mouse from An American Tail. Obscure (not that obscure) Spielberg references aside, I’m drawn by Barry Glendenning’s idea of loaning fans (yesterday’s Still Want More?). I’m an Arsenal fan and, whenever I visit my parents in Devon, I try to catch a Barnstaple Town FC match. We were there for the Toolstation First Division Championship celebrations.

According to the Mirror, Ars&egrave;ne Wenger has decided <strong>Jackson Mart&iacute;nez </strong>could be the man to provide the goals that fire the Gunners up the table and he’ll pay &pound;25m for Porto’s Colombian striker, who bookies have made an odds on favourite to make the move to the Emirates despite interest from Tottenham Hotspur, Valencia, Milan and Atl&eacute;tico Madrid.

It’s frustrating but I am a professional. Even if you lose your place, you must still be prepared because the situation can change. I’ll start the summer preparation with Arsenal and that’s the whole of my plan for the time being.”</p> \n<p>The Napoli striker <strong>Gonzalo Higua&iacute;n </strong>could be Stamford Bridge-bound, with reports suggesting that Jos&eacute; Mourinho is prepared to stump up &pound;30m to organise a reunion with the Argentinian striker he managed for three seasons at Real Madrid. Higua&iacute;n has long been admired at Juventus and Arsenal, but would almost certainly move to Chelsea should the opportunity arise to team up with his former boss.</p> \n<p>Chelsea are also prepared to sell <strong>Patrick Bamford</strong>, who enjoyed a successful loan spell at Middlesbrough last season. &pound;10m is the asking price and both Sunderland and Newcastle are reported to be interested in securing the England U-21 international’s scrawl. Sunderland are also hoping to tempt Celtic to part with centre-back <strong>Virgil van Djik </strong>and have attached striker <strong>Steven Fletcher</strong> to a big hook which they’re dangling over Celtic Park as bait. With Aston Villa and Southampton also interested in the Dutchman, Sunderland are hoping the offer of cash plus a goal-shy striker who runs around a lot will appeal to the Scottish champions.</p> \n<p>Juventus like the cut of <strong>Robin van Persie</strong>’s jib and hope to prise the 31-year-old away from Old Trafford with a bid of &pound;10m, while elsewhere in Italy, Internazionale might take <strong>Nani </strong>off the Manchester United payroll should they fail to persuade Chelsea to part with their misfiring January signing <strong>Juan Cuadrado</strong>.

But here are six other stars who did it all on their own</p>","byline":"Les Carpenter","body":"<p>No team is truly a one-man team, of course. But not all teams are equal and not all great players are, either. Sometimes a superstar has to be more than just a team’s best player: he has to become the team itself.</p> \n<p>As LeBron James pulls what is left of the Cleveland Cavaliers toward the franchise’s first championship, he is adding what might be the greatest chapter to his legacy – a title with little assistance.</p> \n<p>When James won two finals in Miami, he did so with roster that included Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and Ray Allen. Without Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving – the two players who were supposed to help James deliver a title in his return to Cleveland – James is trying to win with what might be one of the worst supporting casts of any NBA champion.</p> \n<p>If James does, he will join a small list of basketball superstars who became one-man teams in the modern NBA and college era. Ironically, enough, he will be much like the player who led Golden State to the 1975 NBA title …</p> \n<h2>1) Rick Barry</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd66aef0d5204403e41e90164008d9831583a373\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433898295073/dd006095-eaf2-4bf6-a1da-49fa2d754a89-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rick Barry: grumpy but brilliant.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rick Barry: grumpy but brilliant.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Of the men who were named to the NBA’s 50 greatest players in 1996, none might be more complicated than Barry, whose brilliance was often muddied by his grumpiness. Former teammate Billy Paultz has been quoted as saying: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/03/magazine/hoop-is-thicker-than-water.html\">“Half of the players disliked Rick Barry. The other half hated him.”</a> A reputation that later in life he has <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2013/06/01/rick-barry-realizes-his-strong-opinions-may-have-cost-him-shot-nba-coaching-job/K9ki4tTq9tW3eiuH8xIUBJ/story.html\">come to regret.</a></p> \n<p>He is also perhaps the greatest player to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU88dxJKTHI\">shoot his free throws underhand.</a></p> \n<p>By the spring of 1975 he was in the middle of a career that had seen him go from being an all-star who played close to the basket to someone who played outside, handling the ball and shooting jump shots. In one amazing finals run, he dragged the Warriors to a four-game sweep of the Washington Bullets, who had the league’s best record that season.</p> \n<p>In the sweep he averaged 29.5 points, 4.0 rebounds and 5.0 assists. The Warriors’ second-leading scorer, Jamaal Wilkes, averaged just 11.5 points a game. That’s how dominant Barry was.</p> \n<p>But perhaps his biggest legacy is the one he left in his sons Jon and Brent, who played in the NBA, and Scooter, who played on Kansas’s 1988 National Championship team with …</p> \n<h2>2) Danny Manning</h2> \n<p>By his last year at Kansas, Manning was already considered the best player in college basketball. But his 1987-88 team was not one of the school’s best. The team finished third in a strong Big Eight with a 9-5 conference record. An 11-loss regular season earned the Jayhawks a sixth-seed in the Midwest Region. After an easy win over 11th seed Xavier in the first round and a hard-fought three-point victory against Murray State in the second, Kansas rolled over Vanderbilt in the Sweet 16 and defeated conference rival Kansas State 71-58 to wind up in the Final Four, played in Kansas City, just a 40-minute drive from campus.</p> \n<p>Manning scored 25 points and had 10 rebounds in beating Duke on the first night of the Final Four, and then delivered 31 points, 18 rebounds and two blocks against Oklahoma <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/05/sports/ncaa-championship-manning-is-magnificent-as-kansas-wins-title.html\">in one of the greatest championship game performances ever.</a>That team is forever known as “Danny and the Miracles,” which is perhaps the best nickname of a one-man team until a player later spawned the name Jordanaires …</p> \n<h2>3) Michael Jordan</h2> \n<p>Six times Jordan’s Bulls won NBA titles– but his greatest performance was his last. Chicago’s 1997-98 team was not nearly as dominant as even those that had won in prior years. Jordan was 34, Scottie Pippen, was 32 and after two straight championships following Jordan’s return to basketball in 1995, there was a sense this was indeed the end of the Bulls’ run.</p> \n<p>But for one last time, Jordan dominated a finals opponent. This one was Utah, with John Stockton and Karl Malone both in their prime. Jordan scored 33 and 37 points in the first two games. </p> \n<p>Then in game six, Jordan <a href=\"http://www.si.com/nba/point-forward/2013/04/23/phil-jackson-michael-jordan-push-off-bryon-russell\">gently nudged Utah’s Bryon Russell,</a>and dropped the jump shot that finished the Jazz, in a finals run that was the finest until a player who grew up in Chicago went on a tear of his own …</p> \n<h2>4) Dwyane Wade</h2> \n<p>At 24 years old in 2006, Wade was at the peak of his professional career. James and Bosh were still four seasons away from joining him in Miami. The Heat was Wade’s team, and it seemed he did everything on it. But it was in the finals against Dallas that he really took off. From games three to five he scored a total of 121 points and almost single-handedly destroyed the Mavericks.</p> \n<p>He wrapped up the championship scoring 36 in game six with 10 rebounds, five assists and four steals. It solidified his reputation as perhaps the game’s best player at the time and <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=aw-wade110106&amp;soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma\">one of its most likeable superstars.</a></p> \n<p>Lost in Wade’s brilliance was an outstanding Finals run by a Dallas opponent who would come to overwhelm Wade’s Heat five years later …</p> \n<h2>5) Dirk Nowitzki</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d2489ca1c5eda2fde31c2ffc916d435951041ac\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/5d2489ca1c5eda2fde31c2ffc916d435951041ac/0_31_2463_1479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dirk Nowitzki was unstoppable in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dirk Nowitzki was unstoppable in 2011.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Year after year Nowitzki delivered superstar seasons for the Dallas Mavericks while never winning the biggest games. Then in the year of LeBron, Wade and Bosh, that changed. Over a six-game finals he was unstoppable.</p> \n<p>With Miami leading the series 2-1, Nowitzki scored 21, 29 and 21 points in three-straight games to lead Dallas to its elusive championship. He also averaged 9.7 rebounds in the Finals and made 45-of-46 free throws. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/13/dirk-nowitzki-cries-alone-interview_n_875999.html\">Then he wept.</a> Yet it might not have been the best postseason run in 2011.</p> \n<p>That came from …</p> \n<h2>6) Kemba Walker</h2> \n<p>Connecticut’s 2010-11 team was not one of its best. Walker, a junior guard from New York, was the Huskies’ best player. As UConn struggled through the regular season there was a thought it might not even make the NCAA Tournament. At 9-9 in the Big East, the Huskies came into the Big East tournament as a ninth-seed and had to beat DePaul and Georgetown to even hope for an NCAA bid. Then Walker <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyF6amZw82M\">hit a shot at the buzzer</a> to beat Pittsburgh. Two games later, he scored 19 to lead UConn to the tournament title.</p> \n<p>In the NCAAs he had 33 in the second round against Cincinnati and 24 in a Sweet 16 win over San Diego State. He scored 18 in the first game of the Final Four against Kentucky and 16 in the championship winner over Butler.</p> \n<p>A year later he was named the <a href=\"http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball/story/2012-12-11/top-75-players-ncaa-tournament-history-lew-alcindor-christian-laettner-top-list\">28th-best NCAA Tournament player ever.</a> </p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433897726312/05935b67-05fd-4922-bfff-8092d92565f0-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"AP","altText":"Michael Jordan shoots against the Jazz in 1998.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: AP"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433898295620/f6136a21-e45f-4ba4-a13a-e87a8d39aa64-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rick Barry: grumpy but brilliant.

made Sepp Blatter’s 17-year presidency so special</p>","byline":"David Hills","body":"<p><strong>Fifa congress, 29 May 2015: </strong>Sepp reflects on his era’s “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/27/us-indicts-fifa-officials-rampant-systemic-deep-rooted-corruption\">deep-rooted, rampant</a>” racketeering problem with a message to the world outside: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnwrvlctMMs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1h12m35s\"><em>You can’t ask people to behave ethically, just like that</em></a>.” The key qualities that made Sepp special:</p> \n<h2>1) Staying even-handed</h2> \n<p><strong>November 2013: </strong>Uneasy with the one-eyed “racist” British press coverage of Qatar as a slave state, Sepp <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2013/nov/09/said-and-done-awards-season\">pledges a personal inquiry</a>. “My grandmother always said a clock rings ding and dong, not ding-ding-ding. You have to listen to ding and to dong, and for now I only hear ding. So I go there, and listen to the dong.” He reports back after meeting the Emir: “Qatar will be wonderful hosts.”</p> \n<h2>2) Driving the agenda</h2> \n<p><strong>August 2014: </strong>Steps up as host of the first <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2014/m=8/news=fifa-to-host-landmark-conference-on-sporting-ethics-2423590.html\">World Summit on Ethics in Sport</a>, “a mix of inspiring keynote addresses” and “dedicated breakout sessions”: “Ethics and integrity are essential. We look forward to fruitful debate.” Among other key initiatives: <strong>2013’s </strong>Concacaf Sports Summit at the Cayman Islands’ Ritz-Carlton resort – speakers including Sepp and Qatar’s Hassan Abdullah al-Thawadi celebrating “the profound impact of football on society”; and his Fifa Fair Play Days, “encapsulating the sporting, moral and ethical principles for which Fifa has always stood”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"651374455461801ffcc9af7244eac4a6a1a3d572\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/6/1433614580319/73936f49-7005-4e33-91b0-e07440db6c82-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"\" we=\"\" will=\"\" dealing=\"\" with=\"\" our=\"\" 'mr=\"\" clean'\"\"=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dealing with ‘Mr Clean’</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>3) Setting boundaries</h2> \n<p><strong>June 1998: </strong>In his debut press conference as president, Sepp rejects questions over claims that <a href=\"http://observer.theguardian.com/sport/issues/story/0,,676074,00.html\">20 voters were handed $50,000 each in cash</a>. “This game is over. I will not respond.” Nine months later he rules out an inquiry: “Why should I have one? I cannot open an inquiry into myself.” <strong>2000: </strong>Defends the voting for the 2006 World Cup hosting rights after Asian delegates switch sides at the last minute and one delegate abstains citing multiple “intolerable” bribe attempts - including a hoax bribe offering him a cuckoo clock and some Black Forest ham: “We work with transparency at Fifa.” <strong>2002: </strong><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/2017855.stm\">Ousts his general secretary</a> Michel Zen-Ruffinen for trying to unseat him with a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2002/may/06/newsstory.sport2\">21-page dossier alleging corruption</a>. Sepp says the dossier “put the nail in his coffin. The executive committee will deal with our ‘Mr Clean’.”</p> \n<h2>4) A keen sense of humour</h2> \n<p><strong>June 2014: </strong>Delivers a keynote speech at Fifa’s congress to an audience of Fifa delegates all wearing Longines watches worth a total of &pound;90,000: “Football as a catalyst for social change: <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2014/m=6/news=football-as-a-catalyst-for-social-change-no-football-without-ethics-an-2368340.html\">no football without ethics and integrity</a>.”</p> \n<h2>5) Leading on women’s issues</h2> \n<p><strong>May 2013: </strong>Nine years after he urged female players to wear tighter shorts, Sepp announces Fifa’s equality-first agenda. “People criticised us for years, but now I am very happy that we have one full [female] member and have co-opted another two. We call them ladies.”</p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span></strong> His other key messages on women’s lib in <strong>2013 </strong>as he looked to move on from his past as <strong>1971’s </strong>president of the <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=1996/m=4/news=the-other-sepp-blatter-71466.html\">World Society for Friends of the Suspender Belt</a>: a public welcome for Fifa’s first female executive as “good and good-looking”, and a question to delegates: “Are there ladies in the room? Say something! You are always speaking at home, now you can speak here.”</p> \n<h2>6) Staying engaged</h2> \n<p><strong>June 2010: </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/seppblatter\">@SeppBlatter</a> makes his debut on Twitter. “Thank you very much for all your supportive messages ... Please send me your questions.” Among the first: “How much money has Jack Warner made by selling tickets compared with 4 yrs ago?”</p> \n<h2>7) Knowing the enemy</h2> \n<p><strong>May 2011: </strong>Sets out what it will take to restore Fifa’s tainted image: <strong>a) </strong>more transparency: “I’m fighting to clean Fifa, zero tolerance is my battle horse”; and <strong>b) </strong>less press scrutiny: “The British press have always been critical. They have a sort of stubbornness.” He later <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBtzGxbvAw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=14m24s\">deals with hecklers at a Fifa HQ press event</a>: “Listen, gentlemen, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBtzGxbvAw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m19s\">we are not in a bazaar</a>. We are in Fifa house.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGBtzGxbvAw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OGBtzGxbvAw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed&amp;start=864\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  ‘You can laugh ... Elegance is an attitude’\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>8) Picking perfect partners</h2> \n<p><strong>November 2007: </strong><a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2007/m=11/news=satyam-signs-first-indian-fifa-world-cuptm-sponsor-644235.html\">Unveils a “historic partnership”</a> with Indian IT provider Satyam, who “share Fifa’s ideals, and identify with our mission to use football as a tool to touch the world and build a better future for all” – two years before Satyam founder Ramalinga Raju admits an “unprecedented” &pound;1bn fraud, dubbed “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2009/jan/08/satyam-fraud-industry\">India’s Enron</a>”. Raju: “I reveal this with regret. It got out of control. It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ce6db612891a66a9fdedd61a08ef80a24a6a5310\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/6/1433616383598/91a25a10-4f5d-4f6e-b552-e1c543df5d26-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Sepp with colleague Tokyo Sexwale\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sepp with colleague Tokyo Sexwale </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>9) Strong crisis management</h2> \n<p><strong>November 2011: </strong>After sparking a racism storm by telling black players there is “no racism, just maybe a word or gesture … those affected should say ‘this is a game’ and shake hands” - solves it by publishing a photo of himself <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2011/m=11/news=blatter-committed-fight-against-racism-1544067.html\">hugging a black colleague</a>.</p> \n<h2>10) Battling avarice<br /></h2> \n<p><strong>October </strong><strong>2005: </strong>Writes for the <em>Financial Times</em>, attacking the “<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/1/7110585c-3a81-11da-b0d3-00000e2511c8.html#axzz3cGDj79fi\">wild west capitalism</a>” ruining football: “This cannot be the future of our game. Fifa cannot sit by and see greed rule the football world. Nor shall we.” In <strong>2009 </strong>he <a href=\"http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11661/5104569/blatter-slams-premier-league\">assesses the Premier League’s culture</a>: “Richard Scudamore is working to make money, while I’m working to have football as a social, cultural event for the world, being a school of life, bringing hope, bringing emotions. That’s the difference.”</p> \n<h2>11) Fixing gaffes quickly</h2> \n<p><strong>2 January 2011: </strong>Promises a new Fifa anti-corruption unit in response to Swiss government threats. “This unit will strengthen our credibility.
