It’s called <strong><a href=\"http://theoldbatsmanonsport.blogspot.co.uk/\">The Old Batsman on Sport</a>. </strong>Thankfully his writing is more imaginative than the name of his new website. Jon is one of the most fluent storytellers working today – and you don’t even have to buy a newspaper to read his stuff. This recent piece – entitled “<a href=\"http://theoldbatsmanonsport.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/ronnie-osullivan-and-normal-shoes.html\">Ronnie O’Sullivan and normal shoes</a>” – shows off his easy, winning style. </p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2015-06-17/how-maria-sharapova-became-the-world-s-wealthiest-female-athlete\">9) How Maria Sharapova became the world’s wealthiest female athlete</a></h2> \n<p>If you take a trip to Wimbledon this summer you will probably stumble upon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MariaSharapova/status/611594882826784769\">Sugarpova</a>, the local pop-up sweet shop that belongs to Maria Sharapova – see what she did there? – in the village. The place is a rip-off but it’s hard to walk past it without delving inside for a nosey. The sweets are preposterously overpriced but Sharapova must be doing something right. She’s worth $110m and I’m baulking at the price of confectionery. As <strong>Ashlee Vance</strong> notes in this piece for <strong>Bloomberg</strong>, Sharapova cannot match Serena Williams on the court, but she blows her away off it:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Williams continues to break records. With 19 career Grand Slam titles, she’s tied for the third most of all time. She’s recently had the second-longest winning streak of her career, with 27 in a row. If she keeps it up, Williams could snag every major title this season. Second place has its consolations, though, especially if you are tall and blonde. Sharapova is the highest-paid female athlete in the world, according to Forbes, and she’s topped the list for the past decade. She made $22m from endorsements in 2014, including an eight-year, $70m deal with Nike, a five-year contract with Evian, and deals with Cole Haan, Tag Heuer, and other brands. Williams, who also has a deal with Nike, as well as one with Gatorade, lags behind by more than $10m each year.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02tmstn\">10) Paul Gascoigne on the Stephen Nolan show</a></h2> \n<p>Paul Gascoigne has been doing the rounds recently to promote a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMjmApzOo0A\">new documentary</a> about his life.

Above a picture of a grieving, defeated Norwegian were the words: “Finally, some good news.” (The words were in Swedish, obviously.) They weren’t simply revelling in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/womens-world-cup-norway-england-match-report\">their neighbours’ misfortune</a> – delicious as that kind of celebration can be – but delighting in their own Olympic qualifying boost. For, had England lost, Sweden’s women would have had no chance at all of being in Rio. Now they could make that journey after all, just as long as Japan beat Holland and the Swedes then win a play-off competition later this year also involving the Dutch, the Norwegians and Switzerland. In other words they still probably won’t go to Rio, but England’s victory at least gave them a kind of giant national straw, which they are now clutching with such gleeful desperation it’s as if they’re used to anything decent coming flat, boxed, and requiring eight and a half hours of frustrating self-assembly.</p> \n<p>Despite their excitement and profound gratitude Sportbladet were composed enough to seek exclusive reaction from England’s match-winner, Lucy Bronze. (And isn’t it strange, incidentally, that British phonebooks are dripping in Golds, have long chains of Silvers and are occasionally stabbed by a Steel, but after that nobody has any other metal names except Freddie Mercury, Lucy Bronze and Tintin. And two of those names are made up.) Asked how she felt about the hope she had given to the entire nation of Sweden, Bronze enthused: “Oops, I didn’t know.”</p> \n<p>Things looked bad for England as they laboured through a disappointing first half, which somehow ended goalless and, when Solveig Gulbrandsen headed Norway into the lead from a 54th-minute corner, Mark Sampson’s side looked not so much Lionesses as Lioness-oh-esses. Fortunately, captain Steph Houghton answered the mayday, and with 14 minutes to go Bronze completed the comeback with a brilliant 20-yard top-corner-bound thundercracker.</p> \n<p>It was a tough chance, but then tough is her middle name (it actually is), and Bronze celebrated with an unusually lengthy choreographed fist-bump routine – also involving unused substitute Jordan Nobbs – of such extravagance that, had it only been done by two men at the men’s World Cup, it would have absolutely guaranteed a lucrative advertising deal for a large pizza chain and a post-retirement invite to Strictly Come Dancing.</p> \n<p>Onwards, then, to the quarter-finals, where England face Canada on Saturday night. As for Norway, it’s the long trip home. As it happens, it’s the birthday of their striker Isabell Herlovsen, who won her 104th cap in Monday’s defeat. “I told the girls I’d be spending my birthday on a plane to Vancouver, not on the way back to Norway,” she sobbed afterwards. “Now it’s going to be a crappy day.” But hang on a minute, Norway – just like Sweden – have been guaranteed a spot in that possible Olympic play-off thanks to England win. And one of them gives us gleeful front-page expressions of eternal gratitude, while the other heaves up foul-mouthed misery. Honestly, there’s no pleasing some people.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>“It’s not bad, it’s actually quite fine. I had some work done on it and I feel a lot better. But this is a bit different for me compared to previous years – I’m not stressed out. Normally you’re getting ready for pre-season, looking to get one or two in and preparing a trip away. Until the season starts up, you don’t know how much you’ll miss it. I missed it a bit when I left but I needed a break. I was struggling. I spent most of the time at training sitting down and that wasn’t enjoyable. I want to be hands on. It was frustrating, it drove me mad. But the break has done me good – I needed it” – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/harry-redknapp-qpr-sharp-as-ever-break\">here comes ‘Arry</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a33a5a9a-3f01-435f-a13a-40a9f1af2921\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435072520732/dda626b7-9c8f-4032-9fa8-32f97304f58b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Harry Redknapp\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> \n<p>“Surely Partick Thistle’s mascot (yesterday’s Bits and Bobs) should be a thistle called Patrick? Am off to sleep with the lights on. For the rest of my life” – Dan Davies.</p> \n<p>“My favourite day of the year is when the draws for the opening round of Big Vase come out. Quite a thrill to read all the tiny, obscure teams that have a chance for greatness, like Cukaricki Belgrade, Rabotnicki Kometal, Jagiellonia Bialystok and West Ham. But my favourite this year is Sheriff v Odd. I think I saw that movie a few years ago, one of those comic-book things Hollywood puts out for the summer. Right?” – Jerry Slaff.</p> \n<p>“A and B are two players who played for club X together after 2000. A went on to play for club Y in another league and even won the league title there. B later on went to play for club Z (league rival of Y) and he too won the league title there. Soon afterwards, A and B were reunited at club W for two seasons after which A left club W. Before retiring, A returned to play for club X again. Interestingly, both A and B have won just one Big Cup for different clubs.

Ah, yes, silly question. </p> \n<p>Elsewhere, <strong>Manchester City</strong>’s interest in Fabian Delph appears to have cooled, but the club continues to have the hots for <strong>Jack Wilshere</strong> and, if they fail to land Paul Pogba, will submit an offer for the midfielder that Ars&egrave;ne Wenger cannot refuse. Hmm, something about that last sentence doesn’t feel quite right. Reckon it’s that bit about Ars&egrave;ne Wenger, Earth’s most stubborn man, not being able to refuse an offer. Never underestimate Wenger’s powers of refusal. If the man were not a football manager, he would be a record-breaking fakir, capable of lying on beds of nails for years while refusing to acknowledge any pain. Having said that, Wenger’s concentration may be weak at the moment, as word is he’s deliberating over what to do now that Geoffrey Kondogbia has left Monaco for Inter rather than London. Having failed to take the player from <strong>Monaco</strong>, perhaps Wenger will take inspiration from them? For the Ligue 1 club are planning to re-invest some of the Kondogbia windfall in <strong>William Carvalho</strong>. Milan, who had been even more interested in Kondogbia than Arsenal were, are also eyeing up Carvalho, but may plump for Marseille’s <strong>Giannelli Imbula</strong> or Zenit’s <strong>Axel Witsel </strong>instead. Lots of names for you there, Ars&egrave;ne. </p> \n<p>No excuses. <strong>Juventus</strong> want to prise <strong>Yannick Ferreira Carrasco</strong> from Monaco, and there is not much Liverpool can do about that no matter what they think. Meanwhile, <strong>New York City</strong> are to offer <strong>Andrea Pirlo</strong> a holiday in the USA. </p> \n<p><strong>Newcastle </strong>hope that offering <strong>Charlie Austin</strong> the No9 shirt could be the key incentive that will make the striker choose to go to St James’ Park. And if that doesn’t work, maybe the club will throw in a biscuit or a shiny sticker album, too. </p> \n<p>Tottenham hope that holding the door open for <strong>Roberto Soldado</strong> and handing him his suitcases will help convince the former striker to leave White Hart Lane for <strong>Galatasaray</strong>. Also Turkey-bound, if Manchester United’s wishes come true, is <strong>Nani</strong>, in whom <strong>Fenerbahce</strong> are interested. </p> \n<p><strong>Javier Hern&aacute;ndez</strong>, meanwhile, is on his way back to Madrid, not to Real but to <strong>Atl&eacute;tico</strong>. <strong>Sevilla</strong> want <strong>Steven Nzonzi</strong> and are prepared to help <strong>Stoke</strong> keep up the ‘z’ quotient on their team-sheet by giving them the Polish midfielder <strong>Grzegorz Krychowiak</strong> in return. </p> \n<p>And <strong>Sunderland</strong> are chasing <strong>Stewart Downing</strong>, whom they fear may be tempted to rejoin <strong>Middlesbrough</strong> instead. </p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/121079f2e745b4d030a0d25a263492bfb4e4aa86/0_127_1929_1158/1929.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1158,"width":1929,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alan Walter/Action Images","altText":"Charlie Austin","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alan Walter/Action Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T07:33:08Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T09:29:54Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Paul Doyle","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/pauldoyle"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Football","Transfer window","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"football/transfer-window","webTitle":"Transfer window"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Paul Doyle","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/pauldoyle"}}],"series":{"title":"Rumour Mill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/series/rumourmill"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/football-transfer-rumours-charlie-austin-newcastle-united","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a37m","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/23/football-transfer-rumours-charlie-austin-newcastle-united","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/23/football-transfer-rumours-charlie-austin-newcastle-united"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/121079f2e745b4d030a0d25a263492bfb4e4aa86/0_127_1929_1158/1929.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1158,"width":1929,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Is Charlie Austin set to sneak off to Tyneside?
