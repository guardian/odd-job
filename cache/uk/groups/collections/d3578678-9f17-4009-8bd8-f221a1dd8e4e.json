There is an art, we hear, to doing something very right while appearing to get it all wrong, and last season Nigel Pearson was to football management what an angry reincarnation of Les Dawson would be to the piano. So it’s a darn shame that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/30/nigel-pearson-leicester-sacked\">we’ll be denied entertainment like that in the Premier League next season</a>: we can only hope that the job description for the new Leicester City manager includes, in addition to an ability to survive despite an epic winless streak, a knack for escalating innocent collisions into furious throttling and innocent questions into tense and prolonged ostrich-themed interrogations.</p> \n<p>That’s right, Pearson has been sacked by Leicester. He was dismissed last night because, incredibly, “the club believes that the working relationship between Nigel and the board is no longer viable.” Since several hours have gone by and the club has not reversed its decision, it looks like this time Pearson may actually have to clear his desk and take all his belongings to the corrugated iron bunker that the Fiver likes to imagine he lives in, surrounded by a large supply of tinned aubergines, two bazookas and a lightly-thumbed compendium of ornithology. </p> \n<p>Leicester have so far not been very forthcoming about the reasons for the split, referring only to “fundamental differences of perspective”, which the Fiver had long assumed was a given. Perhaps some deep footballing disagreement suddenly emerged between Pearson and Leicester, but all seemed to be looking up on that front, as earlier this week the club showed its intention to build on last season’s great escape by signing the Japanese international striker Shinji Okazaki. </p> \n<p>So in the search for an explanation, minds venture reluctantly back to that despicable film made by three young Leicester players during the club’s goodwill tour to Thailand this summer. All three players, one of whom is Pearson’s son, James, have since been sacked by the club. It is not known at this stage whether that sordid disgrace put intolerable strain on the relationship between Nigel and Leicester’s Thai owners, but it hardly brought them closer. More details will doubtless emerge at some point, but at the moment the end to the essentially good news story of Nigel Pearson at Leicester seems to have been laced with unwelcome nastiness and stupidity, which is sad. We’d almost feel sorry for Pearson Snr if it weren’t for the fact that we know – after he announced it to us all for no particular reason – that he can look after himself. </p> \n<h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT</h2> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Tim Hill in the MBM hot seat for England 1-1 Japan (3-4 pens) in the Women’s World Cup semi-final</a>.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-cc866304-900f-47e6-98f4-0632758a8cc6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435759573220/b362b0bf-82eb-405b-b28e-2eab3bad56d9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"laura bassett\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Day 42 in the Big Brother House.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hewitt - Fifa/FIFA via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“We’ve been together here for six weeks now, working and living with the same people, day-in day-out, it’s like being in the Big Brother house” – except, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/01/england-women-canada-world-cup-big-brother-japan-semi-final\">England defender Laura Bassett</a>, for the fact you haven’t been on the front page of The Daily Star every single day.

Here they are: “We were happy to do the thing at first, naturally, but then I realised it would involve missing the match, which I didn’t really feel comfortable about.” He and bassist Neil Crossley were the ones who didn’t want to miss the match (“the others weren’t arsed about football much”). Channel 4 offered to fetch the band to Prenton Park in a helicopter, but they would still have to miss the first half. “We weren’t particularly sold on the idea of what may have been perceived as the antics of big-time Charlies.”<br /></p> \n<p>Sticking to the 80s, here’s John Wray with a delightful story about John Peel. “In 1985, Peel booked a DJ gig in Southampton knowing that Saints only had to get past Barnsley in an FA Cup tie at the Dell to make it a Southampton v Liverpool game in the next round. Sadly for John, Barnsley beat Southampton 2-1 and on the evening of John’s gig in Southampton, his beloved Liverpool FC travelled to Oakwell instead. Happily for John it was on telly and Liverpool won 4-0.”<br /></p> \n<p>Sticking to games on the box: “In 1998, James were second on the bill on the main stage at Glastonbury,” recalls James Kirk. “They asked to cut short their set, in order that they (and the crowd, for whom it was on the big screens) could watch the second half of England v Colombia at the World Cup.” And quite right, too – they’d have missed a couple of corking goals, otherwise.<br /></p> \n<p>Sticking to … nope, not going to work, this one – we’re going back to the 1980s. “Damian Lovelock, lead singer of Sydney band The Celibate Rifles, was a football tragic – very unusual for a 1980s Australian,” begins Rob Moline. “I remember him on (Aussie) TV once telling of arranging an unlikely Sicilian or Sardinian tour date, in exchange for the promise of meeting Gianni Rivera. Probably Sardinia – can’t find any back-up for this story, but the web says he’s a Cagliari fan.” </p> \n<p><strong>Email us more details on this, we requested and lo, came there a reply from Rifles’ guitarist Kent Steedman.</strong></p> \n<p>“I be Kent, the guitarist in The Celibate Rifles. I was forwarded the article on bands touring for sport. Damian was/is a football tragic, the rest of us just like it to varying degrees. All over Europe on our tours, whenever we could, we had a game with the locals before soundcheck – it was a good way to shake off the drive of the day and get to know the people working the show and have a bit of fun. We did tour Sardinia a couple of times; can’t say wholly for Damian to meet Mr Rivera but I suspect it was part of it. We also toured Italy when the World Cup was on there – didn’t make any games as we were either in different towns or didn’t have the right connections. Hope that clears it up a bit. The Rifles still play from time to time, and will happily have a kick against any band for fun. Might be time for a football and rock festival.”</p> \n<p><strong>GRAND ABANDONMENTS</strong></p> \n<p><strong>“Following a recent spate of abandoned games in England, can you tell me what is the latest abandonment (eg 85 minutes into the game) ever?”</strong> asked Francis Spicer in January 2007.</p> \n<p>Diligent reader Marcos Garcia has dug up one case where a game was called off <em>after</em> the full 120 minutes. “The Maltese island of Gozo’s GFA Cup game between Gharb Rangers and SK Victoria Wanderers on September 21 1997 was abandoned during the penalty shootout,” says Marcos. “Apparently the floodlights failed after the scores were tied at 0-0.”</p> \n<p>Marcos pointed us in the direction of a couple of higher-profile examples, too. Crystal Palace’s 1946 FA Cup third-round replay against Queens Park Rangers was stopped due to bad light (Selhurst Park didn’t have floodlights at that time) after 117 minutes with the game goalless, though the match was taken as completed rather than played again. More recently, Paris Saint-Germain’s 2001 Uefa Cup first-round second leg at Rapid Bucharest was abandoned after 103 minutes when the floodlights cut out. Bucharest, who had been trailing 1-0, were later forced to forfeit the game 3-0 by Uefa as they had not prepared an emergency back-up power source.<br /></p> \n<p>More agonising, however, was Norwich’s experience in their League Cup semi-final against Chelsea in 1972. After grabbing a surprise 2-0 away win in the first leg, the Canaries were 3-2 ahead in the return fixture and all set for their first ever trip to Wembley when the game was called off with six minutes remaining. “Grown men cried as the fog lifted shortly after the match was stopped,” recalls Gary Southwell, though Norwich did eventually win the replayed second leg 1-0, before losing the final 1-0 to Tottenham.</p> \n<p><strong>SHARING THE PLAUDITS</strong></p> \n<p><strong>“How common is it for both the player and manager of the month to come from the same club?”</strong> demanded Alex Daly in September 2007. <strong>“It seems to happen more often than not.”</strong></p> \n<p>It may seem that way Alex, but – statistically speaking – it actually only happens just over a quarter of the time.

Nothing to get alarmed about just yet and, hey, at least they have some top-quality reading material with them, isn’t that right Mill readers? Oh. Anyway, United’s negotiations with Real Madrid over <strong>Sergio Ramos</strong> and <strong>David de Gea</strong> have hit a logjam, with Real not prepared to smooth the defender’s passage to Old Trafford and United scrunching up their faces and clinging on to the goalkeeper for all he’s worth.</p> \n<p>City, meanwhile, continue to woo <strong>Paul Pogba</strong> but, despite the prospect of the entire output of an Abu Dhabi oil well being pumped directly into his piggy bank, the Frenchman is waiting for the outcome of Barcelona’s presidential elections before deciding where to go. At the same time, Wolfsburg are waving their fists at City and telling them where to go if they think they can make off with <strong>Kevin De Bruyne</strong>. The German club are proving they’re no sheep in Wolfburg’s clothing, as they’re also baring their teeth at Newcastle, who rather fancied picking up the striker <strong>Bas Dost</strong> for &pound;9m but have, according to other reports, been told that Wolfsburg will not let him go for less than &pound;30m.</p> \n<p>But there will at least be a some arrivals at City over the coming days: a delegation from Milan, for a start, as Internazionale seek to buy <strong>Steven Jovetic</strong>. Meanwhile, Milan will bid for Schalke’s <strong>Matija Nastasic, </strong>once of City’s parish.</p> \n<p>Stoke will continue their attempts to creep furtively towards the top four by nicking the Ghanaian midfielder <strong>Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu</strong> from Udinese for &pound;4m. Now you might think that if the Udinese player was really any good, he’d be playing for Watford this season, but Mark Hughes thinks you’re wrong. Meanwhile, near enough everyone thinks <strong>Asmir Begovic</strong> would be wrong to join Chelsea just to become a glorified Hil&aacute;rio, but the keeper reportedly disagrees and is deadset on going to Stamford Bridge.</p> \n<p><strong>Arda Turan</strong> is not so keen. Atl&eacute;tico Madrid’s Turkish winger is said to be about to eschew the advances of Chelsea and United to enrol with Barcelona instead. But <strong>Radamel Falcao</strong> will join Chelsea this week so that’s something. Something, in fact, that will convince Lo&iuml;c R&eacute;my to head to West Ham.</p> \n<p>Liverpool’s apparent plan to conceal the holes in their defence by sneaking 15 forwards on to the pitch will move closer with a bid for <strong>Christian Benteke</strong>, who is so convinced that Brendan Rodgers will come calling that he has reportedly told Aston Villa he will turn down Spurs even if the club accepts an offer from the north Londoners. <strong>Rickie Lambert</strong> may miss out on all the fun, however, as West Brom, Queens Park Rangers and Bournemouth are all weighing up bids for the 33-year-old.</p> \n<p>Paris Saint-Germain are poised to strengthen their goalkeeping options by springing <strong>Kevin Trapp</strong> from Frankfurt. Marseille, meanwhile, are jostling with Crystal Palace and West Ham for the services of Lille’s Senegalese midfielder <strong>Idrissa Gueye</strong>.</p> \n<p>Finally, soon you should refer to the Swansea full-back <strong>Jazz Richards</strong> as the Fulham full-back Jazz Richards. That “finally” was not meant to suggest that that was the move for which we’d all been waiting, just that the Mill has nothing more to say to you right now. Except goodbye. Oh, and Sevilla want <strong>Leroy Fer</strong>. And Inter want to buy <strong>Juan Cuadrado</strong> and/or <strong>Mohamed Salah</strong> from Chelsea.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435737211383/Kevin-De-Bruyne-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kevin De Bruyne is in Manchester City's sights but Wolfsburg are playing hardball.

It wasn’t at Lord’s, or any other cricket ground, but in a sideroom at the offices of the Terrence Higgins Trust in King’s Cross. And he wasn’t playing a cover drive, or diving to take a catch, but interviewing HIV and Aids workers about their day jobs. Sangakkara was, still is, an ambassador for the ICC’s <a href=\"http://www.thinkwisecricket.com\" title=\"\">Think Wise campaign</a>, run in partnership with Unaids and Unicef. He had asked the ICC to arrange a roundtable chat with experts in the field. A couple of journalists had been invited along to provide, I assumed, a little positive publicity, to watch him pose for a photo, pass on a couple platitudes, then pop off in his limousine.</p> \n<p>Turned out Sangakkara couldn’t have cared less whether the press were there or not, and had little interest in talking cricket. Instead, he spent an hour at the head of a long table, listening to representatives from various charities, some of whom had only a vague idea who he was. “I am here to learn,” he told them, “I am very privileged to be here among you, to talk to you and, more than that, to listen to you. Because when I do put my face out there for the ICC I would like to be informed as much as possible, to be able to back up what I say with factual knowledge.” The only photos he posed for were the ones the staff asked him to be in. “Whatever you do it is not about doing it in front of 20 cameras,” he said. “It is when there are no cameras and no one there to write about it or talk about it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/jason-gillespie-australia-ashes-england\">Jason Gillespie: Australia start as Ashes favourites in England – and rightly so</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Afterwards, I asked Sangakkara why he had spent so long inside. “If I do something I make sure I try and seriously commit to it. With time, with effort, with knowledge, whichever way I can.” Later that same summer, he gave <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNB15w--u4U\" title=\"\">his famous Spirit of Cricket lecture</a>, besides which all others since have paled in comparison. I was there then too, lucky enough to be in the audience to hear him say: “My loyalty will be to the ordinary Sri Lankan fan … they are my foundation, they are my family. I will play my cricket for them. Their spirit is the true spirit of cricket. With me are all my people. I am Tamil, Sinhalese, Muslim and Burgher. I am a Buddhist, a Hindu, a follower of Islam and Christianity. I am today, and always, proudly Sri Lankan.” By the time he had finished, I was completely smitten.</p> \n<p>Sangakkara has announced that he will retire from international cricket later this summer. This although his game is, and has been for some time, on a high plateau, one approached by only the very finest players in history. Last year he made 2,868 runs in international cricket, at an average of 53. No one has ever scored more in a calendar year. This year he became the first man in history to score centuries in four consecutive ODI innings, and during the World Cup too. At the age of 37, Sangakkara sometimes seems to have solved cricket, as a computer solves checkers or a bright child a Rubik’s Cube.</p> \n<p>Time was when they said Sangakkara’s problem was that he was such a better batsman at home, and of course he is, but he will still finish with (all-format) averages of 49 in Australia, 49 in New Zealand 44 in England, 43 in India. He is the only man in each of Test cricket’s top ten lists of <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/282910.html\" title=\"\">highest averages</a>, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/223646.html\" title=\"\">most runs</a> and <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/227046.html\" title=\"\">most centuries</a>. Which means that he’s one of the greatest batsmen of all time by any measure you’d care to take. Another year like this last one, and he would sit second to Sachin Tendulkar as Test cricket’s leading run-scorer, and overtake Don Bradman as the man who has scored the most Test double-hundreds. But he’s not interested. He says he would have quit sooner if his great mate Mahela Jayawardene hadn’t beaten him to it. He thought the team would suffer if they both left at the same time.</p> \n<p>“I’ve been told if I play another year or two years, I could score another 1000 runs. I might be the second highest run scorer, or I might be able to break the Don’s double-century record. But if you really think about it, if that’s the only reason you want to prolong your career, then it is really time to say, ‘thank you very much,’” Sangkkara said. “I’ve always prided myself on performing well for the side as an individual, but at the end of the day I want to be able to look my team-mates in the eye and say I went out there because I really wanted to do well for the side, and it was nothing to do with individual records. I can do that right now.”</p> \n<p>A gent to the very end. Seems that Sangakkara is surely one of those rare players cricket fans all around the world can agree on. A shock then, to see one of my very favourite contemporary cricket writers, Osman Samiuddin, <a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/sport/cricket/kumar-sangakkara-sri-lankas-paul-mccartney-was-too-perfect-a-batsman-and-man-to-warm-to\" title=\"\">admit in print</a>: “I am not a fan of Kumar Sangakkara. I never have been.” Too perfect, too earnest, too bloodless, Osman explained. He was more of a Mahela man.</p> \n<p>We all have our favourites, especially those of us who fell in love with the game through watching it from beyond the boundary. I can list those of many of my friends in the game, and I love what each person’s choice says about them (Rob Smyth &amp; Martin McCague, Lawrence Booth &amp; Allan Lamb, Emma John &amp; Mike Atherton, Andrew Miller &amp; Angus Fraser, Gideon Haigh &amp; Chris Tavar&eacute;, Kevin Mitchell &amp; Doug Walters. I could go on). If pushed, I’d plump for Shahid Afridi, with Peter Trego and Sangakkara both in close running for the second spot.</p> \n<p>Osman’s feelings about Sanga are the flip side of that favouritism. This is one of those cases, just as common, but expressed less often, where a fan feels impervious to the charms of an indisputably great player. Just as we all have our own heroes, so most of us have our own blindspots, players who leave us cold, however adored they are, however acclaimed they may be. Jacques Kallis is a common one. So is Graeme Smith. Must be something about South Africans. For me, it was Ricky Ponting, whose batting always felt so charmless, so ruthlessly efficient, that it seemed to me to be almost too mechanical to admire. Wrong, I know, but there was just no getting around it.</p> \n<p>With Sanga, I bend the other way. I can understand the criticisms. Certainly he was <a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/sport/cricket/kumar-sangakkara-sri-lankas-paul-mccartney-was-too-perfect-a-batsman-and-man-to-warm-to\" title=\"\">once a merciless sledger</a>, and perhaps that made him something of a hypocrite. They say too that he has a politician’s sensibility, and loves to sweet talk the media. If they’re right, it worked with me. I can swallow all that and smile. In my eyes, to my ears, the man is a marvel, and the game will be poorer for his going.</p> \n<p><em>This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, to subscribe just visit</em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/signin?returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fprofile.theguardian.com%2Femail-prefs%3FCMP%3DEMCSPTEML942\" title=\"\"><em> this page</em></a><em>, find ‘The Spin’ and follow </em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/signin?returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fprofile.theguardian.com%2Femail-prefs%3FCMP%3DEMCSPTEML942\" title=\"\"><em>the instructions</em></a><em>.</em></p> \n<p><em> </em></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Cricket/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435663559100/Kumar-Sangakkara-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kumar Sangakkara will be missed by Sri Lanka but retires as one of the greatest batsmen of his generation.

There is other football, too, with Slaven Bilic making his bow as the West Ham manager in the Europa League","byline":"Observer sport","body":"<h2>INTERNATIONAL FINALS…</h2> \n<p>A big week for football finals. England’s early exit from the European Under-21s Championship means they will not be involved in the final on Tuesday (7pm, BT Sport 1). However, dependent on the outcome of their match against the hosts, Canada, in the wee hours of this morning - too late for a Sunday newspaper deadline –the Women’s World Cup may yet feature an England side. The final on Friday (11.30pm, BBC2) should provide further evidence of why the women’s game is fast emerging from the shadow of its male counterpart. Elsewhere South America’s finest will be on show on Saturday in the Copa Am&eacute;rica final (8.00pm, Premier Sports and Xbox Live). Even though football is in its off-season there’s plenty to get stuck in to.</p> \n<h2>BILIC MAKES HIS BOW…</h2> \n<p>Wait, there’s more football. Among the 102 teams named in the first round of Europa League qualifying were West Ham, who made it to the foothills of the competition by virtue of their fair play. Having had little more than a month since the Premier League ended with a defeat at Newcastle and then rolling out the welcome mat to former defender Slaven Bilic as their manager, West Ham now find themselves facing the mighty Andorran outfit FC Lusitans on Thursday. This is where the prefix “minnows” invariably appears but the team from the tiny Iberian principality – population: 85,500; motto: “United virtue is stronger” – are perhaps feebler than minnows (mini-minnows?), having lost their last European tie 7-3 on aggregate to Streymur of the Faroe Islands – pop: 50,000 – nearly two years ago. Bilic will hope for sterner tests before the Premier League starts in August, but the first game of Upton Park’s final season is a good match to ease him in.</p> \n<h2>ROAD RACE CLIMAX…</h2> \n<p>Cycling is in full cry as anticipation mounts for the Tour de France and today sees the culmination of the British Road-Race National Championships (11.30am, Eurosport 1). Laura Trott and Peter Kennaugh both return to defend their titles, hoping to be first through the finish line in Lincoln’s Castle Square.</p> \n<h2>SPEED MERCHANTS…</h2> \n<p>The British Athletics Championships get underway on Friday as the country’s athletes chase qualification for August’s world championships. The controversy surrounding the eligibility of the Anguillan-born sprinter Zharnel Hughes will add a tense backdrop to the blockbuster 100m and 200m events, with rival Richard Kilty tweeting his displeasure at Hughes’s place in Team GB. However the 19-year-old has openly targeted a place in Beijing so will need to show he is worth the hype to seal his spot. Expect fireworks.</p> \n<h2>SPEED MERCHANTS II…</h2> \n<p>After his starting grid error in Austria, Lewis Hamilton will be hoping he can make amends with a strong performance on home soil at Silverstone (BBC1 from Saturday). Hamilton still leads his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg by 10 points but with the pair’s rivalry simmering, the British Grand Prix will be compelling viewing. Let’s hope Hamilton forgets the Queen’s recent advice and turns right first.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435329157569/BC-PLACE-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Who will take to the field at BC Place, Vancouver for the final of the Women's World Cup?

That person cannot have bowled the previous over and in a limited-overs match where bowlers are restricted to a set number of overs, that person must not have bowled his allowance of overs. <em>Thanks to Peter Lockwood</em>. <br /><strong>2)</strong> The Laws do not specify what clothing a player must or must not wear. A male player could wear a dress if he wanted. However the preamble to the Laws states that participants should respect the traditions of the game and one tradition is that all players wear long trousers. The image of the game is important so I would consult with my colleague, then speak to the player and his captain also. If they refuse to comply I would allow the cricketer to play but would report it to the executive. <em>Thanks to Jon Miles</em>. <br /><strong>3)</strong> If that player's name was on the team sheet when captains nominated their teams at the toss, there can be no objection from the fielding captain as to where he bats, even though he has arrived late at the ground. <em>Will Harrison wins the shirt</em>.</p>\n<h2>Competition: win a T-shirt of your choice</h2>\n<figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-457293909\">\n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434012947688/Cricket-shirt-002.jpg\" alt=\"Cricket shirt\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>For a chance to win a sporting T-shirt of your choice from the <a href=\"http://entertainment.guardianoffers.co.uk/search/results/?search=cricket\">Guardian range</a> send us your questions for You are the Umpire to <a href=\"mailto:you.are.the.umpire@observer.co.uk\">you.are.the.umpire@observer.co.uk</a>.
