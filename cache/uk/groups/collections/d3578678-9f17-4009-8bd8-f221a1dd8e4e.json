Oh we just don’t know anymore","standFirst":"Today’s gossip comes standfirst-free","byline":"Scott Murray","body":"<p>Manchester United are in the market for a striker now Robin van Persie <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/09/robin-van-persie-fenerbahce-manchester-united\" title=\"\">is leaving Old Trafford for Fenerbahce</a> in high dudgeon. He’s “furious”, having been “betrayed” by Louis van Gaal. Penny for the thoughts of Ars&egrave;ne Wenger. Anyway, United ideally want Bayern Munich’s <strong>Thomas M&uuml;ller</strong>, Real Madrid’s <strong>Karim Benzema</strong>, Paris Saint-Germain’s <strong>Edinson Cavani</strong> or Tottenham Hotspur’s <strong>Harry Kane</strong>. But failing that, West Ham United’s <strong>Diafra Sakho</strong> will suffice.</p> \n<p>United are also planning to offload Javier Hern&aacute;ndez, who will go much more quietly than rantin’ Robin. He could serenely head off to West Ham as part of a deal for Sakho, or join Sevilla instead.</p> \n<p>Newcastle United were the last English club to break the world transfer record, causing headlines around the globe as they splashed &pound;15m on the Blackburn Rovers striker Alan Shearer in 1996. The best part of two decades on, and that sort of money only gets you a passing mention in a poor rumour round-up. Newcastle will spend that sum on the PSV Eindhoven midfielder and Brazil botherer <strong>Georginio Wijnaldum</strong>, and again on either the Anderlecht striker <strong>Aleksandar Mitrovic</strong> or QPR’s <strong>Charlie Austin</strong>. Times change, and the Mill feels so very old.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/09/liverpool-raheem-sterling-misses-training-again-sick\" title=\"\"><strong>Raheem Sterling</strong> to Manchester City saga</a>, which had its world premiere at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham in October 1952, opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in London the following month, and moved to St Martin’s Theatre in 1974, could finally be coming to a close. City are going to offer Liverpool a take-it-or-leave-it &pound;40m deal plus &pound;5m in add-ons.</p> \n<p>Acceptance of this deal will allow Liverpool to go and buy Borussia Dortmund’s <strong>Marco Reus</strong>, apparently. And there was us, thinking they’d already spent the money.</p> \n<p>Manchester City have also been pursuing <strong>Fabian Delph</strong> but this particular rumour hasn’t totally ruined what could have been a lovely summer. Aston Villa will bolster their depleted midfield with <strong>Andros Townsend</strong>, unless Sunderland get in the way.</p> \n<p>Stoke City have not given up on the Internazionale winger <strong>Xherdan Shaqiri</strong>, in case anyone had forgotten about that. Also their goalkeeper <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/09/asmir-begovic-chelsea-8m-transfer-stoke-city-marco-van-ginkel\" title=\"\"><strong>Asmir Begovic</strong> will sign for Chelsea</a>, with the midfielder <strong>Marco van Ginkel</strong> moving the other way. Jos&eacute; Mourinho’s been very quiet so far this summer, which suggests he’s either up to something, or that he’s completely happy with his squad. The rest of the Premier League stand at a fork in the road, with both routes leading to a world of pain.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436514306239/Edinson-Cavani-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Edinson Cavani, who recently played at the Copa América with Uruguay, is said to be one of a number of targets for Manchester United.

Managing a team, yes. Owning a club, sure. Being involved in any form of governance of the game, absolutely. But where does it stop? Can you have a kickabout in the back garden? Is the odd season of Sensible Soccer allowed? Where does Subbuteo fit in? It’s a minefield. </p> \n<p>And stepping into it is Chuck Blazer. The former Fifa executive will be looking over his shoulder nervously whenever he’s tempted into a game of <a href=\"http://www.branchofscience.com/wp-content/uploads/supercupbox1.jpg\">Super Cup Football</a> thanks to a lifetime ban from all football-related activity due to bribery and corruption.</p> \n<p>“Blazer committed many and various acts of misconduct continuously and repeatedly during his time as an official in different high-ranking and influential positions at Fifa and Concacaf,” OMGed Fifa in a statement. “In his positions as a football official, he was a key player in schemes involving the offer, acceptance, payment and receipt of undisclosed and illegal payments, bribes and kickbacks as well as other money-making schemes.”</p> \n<p>So backslaps all round. Though, given that Blazer pleaded guilty to the FBI and agreed to turn informer, Fifa feeling in any way smug about booting Blazer out of football is rather like congratulating yourself on having cleaned up those baked beans that you spilled on the patio when all you’ve actually done is left them and allowed wind erosion, rain and the neighbourhood’s cats to do what wind erosion, rain and the neighbourhood’s cats do. Those beans? Yeah, sorted them. No more beans on my patio, no sirree. </p> \n<p>But then what can you do? The world is full of thieves, murderers, murderous thieves and thieving murderers and we can’t catch ’em all. And that’s exactly the same as rampant corruption among members of the Fifa executive committee, isn’t it Uncle Sepp? “It is impossible to stamp out robbery and murder, even with a functioning courts system down to community level,” Blatter told Swiss newspaper Weltwoche. “Football is not better than our society.”</p> \n<p>And it’s not like you can hold the president of Fifa responsible for any of this, is it Uncle Sepp? “I not only see everything, I’m responsible for everything, even for the English women’s own goal at the World Cup recently,” he added, introducing sarcasm to his big bag of unpleasant personality traits. “Am I responsible for climate change too?”</p> \n<p>No, Sepp – you’re responsible for Fifa. Though not for much longer, and for that we can be thankful.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d7ae1874e60491072055423f8866d82fbb071e1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436445521477/be0a5a1b-ed6c-4b22-8d87-e0f2c508929c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lionel Messi\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Look at him sitting down.

I played for a pub with two teams in different tiers of the local Sunday League. The Division 3 team were in danger of relegation which meant playing with no refs next season, whereas the Division 1 team were safe in mid-table obscurity. So the manager decided to switch our teams for the last two games. I was a Division 3 defender against strikers reported to be semi-pro, and we were losing 30-0 after an hour when the referee called it.

Free transfer you say? Oooof. A (former) England international in the prime of his career? Not half! A player with a point arriving with motivation to prove the doubters wrong. Suits you sir! Indeed, what could go wrong?</p> \n<p>Tim Sherwood signed Richards hoping to add a dash of claret to his sky blue heart but poor Tim has been the victim of a horrible Manuel Pellegrini trick. For 26-year-old Richards is in fact a double agent, sent into Villa’s ranks to for one purpose and one purpose only, to tap up <strong>Fabian Delph</strong>. You can take the boy of out Manchester …</p> \n<p>Up until now, Richards has played his role to perfection, grinning at press conferences with that Cheshire Cat smile, shaking hands, posing for photos with Birmingham babies. But at Villa’s new kit launch, Richards let slip to members of the press just what he had been up to, with all the subtlety of Richard Dunne wearing skis at an origami day class.</p> \n<p>“I told Fabian I can’t comment to be honest,” commented Richards, after Delph reportedly asked Richards about the possibility of moving to City. “If you’re good enough you’ll play. It’s just being given that chance. If he [Pellegrini] is going to give him the chance to play then it’s hard to turn down the chance of playing Champions League football. I don’t want to say go there and then he [Pellegrini] doesn’t play him – he’ll be ringing me up afterwards!” continued Richards, seemingly much more perturbed at the possibility of a slightly awkward phonecall from Delph in a few months than the prospect of his new club losing their talisman.</p> \n<p>Just how long Richards lasts in Birmingham now that the ruse is out remains to be seen. Let’s see how long the first own goal takes to arrive shall we?</p> \n<p>If City are conducting their summer business with espionage, Everton are following the more well-trodden route of simply offering large sums of money for their targets. <strong>Georginio Wijnaldum</strong> is the man, &pound;15m big ones is the cost, but they are not alone in their endeavours with Newcastle – yes Newcastle! – also in the hunt for the PSV captain. The new Newcastle manager Steve McClaren has yet to loosen Mike Ashley’s notoriously tight purse strings, but he is reportedly keen to capture last season’s Dutch footballer of the year, who is said to be keen to follow Memphis Depay from Eindhoven to Blighty.</p> \n<p>Chelsea have had a &pound;20m bid for disco star <strong>Isco</strong>. Quite right too, if you’re asking the Mill: the 23-year-old signed for Real Madrid <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2013/jun/27/isco-joining-real-madrid\" title=\"\">for &pound;23m two years ago</a> and has only become a better player since then. Jos&eacute; Mourinho and co are keen to have another go for the silky Spaniard but may well only increase their bid if <strong>Oscar</strong> leaves for Juventus, which he may well do.</p> \n<p>One man Chelsea are on the threshold of signing is the Internacional midfielder <strong>Charles Ar&aacute;nguiz</strong>, who recently impressed at the Copa Am&eacute;rica with Chile. Arsenal have also been tracking the 5ft 7in playmaker, who admitted earlier this year that plying his trade in the Premier League would be a “dream.”</p> \n<p><strong>Carlos Vela</strong> has decided that he loves David Moyes way too much to leave Real Sociedad for West Ham, even though the London club are willing to pay the Mexican’s &pound;21.4m release clause, according to Marca.</p> \n<p>Tottenham have been told that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/southampton-toby-alderweireld-atletico-madrid\" title=\"\">they’re not allowed to sign Atl&eacute;tico Madrid’s <strong>Toby Alderweireld</strong></a> because Southampton have first option on the player. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/07/toby-alderweireld-friends-spurs-atletico-madrid-southampton\" title=\"\">But Spurs don’t care about rules</a>, so &pound;11.4m should do just fine. Bleary-eyed Saints manager Ronald Koeman will make himself feel better by bringing in <strong>Jordy Clasie</strong>, who looks set to replace the outgoing Morgan Schneiderlin.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436344503024/Isco-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Let's all have a disco.

Farah has bullishly maintained his cleanness and is sticking by Salazar for now, and no doubt Britain’s double Olympic champion will be happy to focus firmly on the track as he prepares for next month’s world championships. The men’s 100m will still be fascinating without Bolt, with Justin Gatlin, Asafa Powell and Tyson Gay lining up.</p> \n<h2>ROSE’S DEFENCE …<br /></h2> \n<p>Gullane is the venue for this year’s <strong>Scottish Open</strong>, beginning on Thursday (Sky Sports 4). Rory McIlroy, Phil Mickleson, Ian Poulter and Luke Donald will all compete, along with last year’s champion, Justin Rose. The Englishman Rose has had an up and down year, with his runners-up place at the Masters being counterbalanced by a disappointing showing at the US Open, and he will hope to ensure he is in form for the Open at St Andrews by picking up his second title of the year, following his Zurich Classic triumph in April. Also competing will be the 1999 champion, Colin Montgomerie, who will hope the familiarity of his home tournament will wash away the memory of his failed attempt to qualify for the Open.</p> \n<h2>YET MORE FOOTBALL …<br /></h2> \n<p>The close season no longer means a footballing famine for supporters desperately staring at their calendars, trying to will the new season into existence. Instead, those who will follow the Women’s World Cup to its conclusion tonight (midnight, BBC Two) will be pleased to hear there is more footballing action from North America with the first game of the <strong>Gold Cup</strong> on Wednesday (midnight, BT Sport 2) with the glamour tie of... Panama v Haiti. Yes, really: those in the know when it comes to Concacaf have Panama (pop. 3.6m) down as the region’s rising force. Finalists in 2013, <em>Los Canaleros </em>(you guessed it, the Canalmen) are hotly tipped to go one better this time.</p> \n<h2>CRICKETING MINNOWS …<br /></h2> \n<p>English (and Welsh) focus will be squarely on Cardiff this week, but it is an important time for Scottish cricket too, as they begin their <strong>qualification campaign for the ICC World T20 </strong>on Thursday against the United Arab Emirates (10am, Sky Sports 3 HD). The tournament is co-hosted by Scotland and Ireland, meaning they will start as favourites to reach the finals tournament in India next year. Of the 14 nations taking part, six will make it. Among those nations in with a sniff of glory are some more recognisable minor cricketing nations, such as Afghanistan and the Netherlands, but also Oman, Papua New Guinea and Jersey.</p> \n<h2>BROLLY SELLERS …<br /></h2> \n<p>Few fans had a more chastening season last year than Newcastle’s. But after Alan Pardew (hounded out) and John Carver (hapless) comes Steve McClaren (brolly at the ready) and perhaps a new era for football on the Tyne. A <strong>friendly against Gateshead </strong>at the International Stadium on Friday (8pm) should feature a raft of new young blood in the old black and white stripes, including Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles. The appointment of the ex-England manager has divided opinion on Tyneside, so here is a chance to make a favourable first impression. Just pray it doesn’t rain.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435925838066/Mo-Farah-and-Usain-Bolt-F-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mo Farah will be at Zurich for the Diamond League meet on Thursday but Usain Bolt is missing from a strong 100m field.

You’ve never seen anything like it.”</h2> \n<p><em>Don Bradman to his team-mates, Trent Bridge, 1938</em></p> \n<p>The 29-year-old Donald Bradman was as giddy and restless as a newborn pup. Stanley Joseph McCabe, his Australia team-mate, was giving a demonstration of rare genius in the first Ashes Test at Trent Bridge, and Bradman urgently implored the rest of the team to take the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to watch his innings. It was almost too much for Bradman. “Towards the end I could scarcely watch the play,” he said. “My eyes were filled as I drank in the glory of his shots.”</p> \n<p>Australia were in significant trouble after slipping to 194 for six, still 464 runs behind, but McCabe was easing into the innings that would define him. He scored 232 out of 300 while at the wicket, including 72 in the final 28 minutes and 44 off three overs from the leg-spinner Doug Wright. Neville Cardus said he “batted with the ease of a man using a master key … McCabe demolished the English attack with aristocratic politeness, good taste and reserve. Claude Duval never took possession of a stagecoach with more charm of manner than this.” McCabe scored 127 runs in a single session, still an Ashes record.</p> \n<p>“I gripped his hand, wet with perspiration,” said Bradman. “He was trembling like a thoroughbred racehorse. I can recall saying to him after expressing my congratulations: ‘I would give a great deal to be able to play another innings like that.’ No skipper was ever more sincere in his adulation of another’s skill.” Bradman was still raving about it over a decade later. “I firmly believe it to be the greatest innings ever played,” he said in Farewell to Cricket. “Such cricket I shall never see again.”</p> \n<h2>2) “Ashes to Ashes, dust to dust, if Thomson don’t get ya, Lillee must.”</h2> \n<p><em>A Sydney Daily Telegraph cartoon caption during the 1974-75 Ashes</em></p> \n<p>Dennis Lillee didn’t have a face like thunder; he had a face like the apocalypse. Seconds earlier he had been on his backside on the Brisbane pitch, having lost both his wicket and his dignity when he fell over as he top-edged a Tony Greig bouncer. As Lillee started to stomp off, a picture of affronted pride, Greig reminded him where the facilities were and how appropriate a refreshing shower might be in the circumstances. Lillee looked at him and barked: “Just remember who started this.”</p> \n<p>For the next few minutes Lillee was like a stuck record. “Just remember who started this,” he hissed repeatedly at his captain, Ian Chappell, who had no idea what Lillee was talking about. It became clearer when Lillee announced: “Just remember who started this: those bastards. But we’ll finish it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99d0a6310d042ed9a4df40a12ae650f964241c1a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435920374755/813c8fa0-f0e3-4cdb-85ae-a83ed97e3fcd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dennis Lillee has always been keen to point out that England started the bouncer war of 1974–75.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dennis Lillee has always been keen to point out that England started the bouncer war of 1974–75.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lillee has always been keen to point out that England started the bouncer war of 1974–75. “It’s like the song We Didn’t Start the Fire,” he later said, continuing a long line of Billy Joel references in Ashes cricket. “People often remember who did the damage, not who started the fire.”</p> \n<p>In the first Test of the series at Brisbane, more than half the Australia team were out hooking in the home side’s first innings of 309, though it was Greig’s decision to bounce Lillee, a lower-order batsman, that really stirred the hornets’ nest. Lillee, who had clearly been intending to diligently bowl line and length until then, took the first ball of the England innings, and his runup began from somewhere inside the sightscreen. “Mate, it was full-on war,” said Jeff Thomson, “and we gave it to them.”</p> \n<p>The original plan was for Lillee to share the new ball with Max Walker, so that the tearaway Thomson could bowl with the wind after Lillee. But Chappell, sensing something in the air, decided at the last second to let Thomson share the new ball.</p> \n<p>“For the next few overs,” said Chappell, “I looked on in awe.” When Rodney Marsh leapt to claim a Thomson bouncer, the wicketkeeper started wringing his hand in pain before realising the implications for England. “Hell, that hurt,” he said to Chappell, “but I love it.”</p> \n<p>England were soon 57 for four and in trouble; the captain, Mike Denness, upon being dismissed, took off his shirt and discovered that a bouncer had actually embedded his St Christopher medallion in his chest. Dennis Amiss had a thumb cracked by Thomson and John Edrich a hand broken by Lillee.</p> \n<p>As would happen in 2013–14, a group of experienced batsmen never recovered from the shock of being assaulted so savagely in the first innings of the series at Brisbane.</p> \n<p>“Thommo was by far the quickest bowler I’ve ever seen or opposed,” said his future team-mate Kim Hughes. “Thommo didn’t go to any academy, he just grabbed the ball and wanted to kill some prick … he was as far ahead of any other bowler for sheer speed as [Don] Bradman was for runs.”</p> \n<p>With his mustachioed fellow-assassin Lillee, Thommo simply brutalised England in 1974–75. “Lillee and Thomson remain a combination to conjure with, as sinister in England as Burke and Hare, or Bismarck and Tirpitz,” Gideon Haigh has written. They will always tell you they didn’t start the fire, but they sure as hell poured industrial quantities of petrol on to it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTaVRuxje80\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTaVRuxje80?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>3) “Let’s give it some humpty”</h2> \n<p><em>Ian Botham to Graham Dilley, Headingley, 1981</em></p> \n<p>It was only because England had lost the Headingley Test of 1981 that they were able to win it. They had given up, and with that came the blessed freedom of the damned. The miracle started not when Ian Botham came to the crease in the second innings, but when he was joined soon after by the startlingly blond Kent fast bowler Graham Dilley. On a wicket full of booby traps, England trailed Australia by 92 with three wickets remaining, having been forced to follow on. They had already booked out of the team hotel and Ladbrokes had offered 500-1 on an England victory.</p> \n<p>With England already 1-0 down in the six-match series, the noble thing might have been to knuckle down and lose with a bit of honour. That was also the boring option, and after the year he’d had, Botham was due a bit of fun. “You don’t fancy hanging around on this wicket for a day and a half, do you?” he said to Dilley, who concurred. “Right. Come on, let’s give it some humpty.”</p> \n<p>Before the humpty had come the great fall, with Botham resigning as England captain after the drawn second Test at Lord’s. Mike Brearley came out of international retirement to become England’s emergency captain. He found out that he had been chosen via a reverse-charge phone call, because the chairman of selectors, Alec Bedser, had run out of coins. Botham, without the psychological backpack weighing him down, started to enjoy his cricket again. His relationship with Brearley certainly helped. If Brearley had a degree in people, then he had a PhD in Botham. “He needs a father figure, and I need a younger brother,” said Brearley.</p> \n<p>Although Botham struck an unfettered 50, England were dismissed for 174 in reply to 401 for nine declared and forced to follow on. That Saturday evening, with the rest day to follow, Botham invited both sides to his house at Epworth, near Doncaster, for a barbecue. An epic night’s drinking – led by Botham, whose form in this sphere never fluctuated – ended with the players of both sides having a rugby scrum on the lawn in the small hours.</p> \n<p>When play resumed on the Monday, Australia looked set for a quick kill. England were 105 for five when Botham came to the wicket and 135 for seven soon after. By then, Dennis Lillee and Rodney Marsh had famously bet against their own team, putting a small wager on England. “Being a small-time punter, I had been unable to resist the juicy 500-1,” Lillee would say. “It was as simple as that. I have never had any qualms over the matter and I have never lost a moment’s sleep because of it.”</p> \n<p>He’ll have lost plenty of sleep over what happened once England started to give it some humpty. “I guess I never will come to terms with it,” Lillee has said. Botham mixed agricultural mows with classical batsmanship. At times he played in the V – the V between third man and fine leg, as the ball flew off the edge of another lusty yahoo. “Bloody lucky innings,” sniffed Lillee. “I expected to get him out virtually every ball.”</p> \n<p>What started as a bit of fun for England imperceptibly morphed into something more serious as the day progressed, but by then Botham had no inclination or need to sober up his approach. He made a cathartic century, with vital support from Chris Old, and overall his 149 not out from 148 balls included 27 fours and one unforgettable six.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkvgiZJkhM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkkvgiZJkhM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Botham dragged England back into the game off his own bat – or rather Graham Gooch’s. Botham had borrowed Gooch’s bat on the spur of the moment, fancying a heavier weapon than usual. “He hadn’t used it much in the match, and I thought there were a few runs left in it.” With his borrowed bat, he hit the ball like he wanted to kill it.</p> \n<p>In the final session on the fourth day England plundered 175 runs in 27 overs. At the close, the England wicketkeeper Bob Taylor went into the Australia dressing room with some bats for them to sign, only to be told: “Fuck off with your fucking bats.”</p> \n<p>Even with Botham’s heroics, Australia needed only 130 to win and go 2–0 ahead with three to play. At 56 for one, they were cruising. Willis was preoccupied with no-balls – he had bowled 32 in the previous Test at Lord’s – and did not enjoy bowling up the hill. Brearley allowed him to switch ends so that he was going downhill with the wind at his back. “Let me worry about the no-balls,” he told Willis. “Just run up and bowl fast and straight.”</p> \n<p>Willis soon dismissed Trevor Chappell, caught behind fending off a throat ball. There was no celebration, just a quick turn and walk back to his mark. Even when he picked up Hughes and Graham Yallop for ducks in the same over soon after, there was not a hint of joy. Every sportsman dreams of being in the zone; Willis was, but this was a different kind of zone. “I looked into his eyes and it was like there was nobody there,” said Dilley.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-02e50ce8-8017-4bef-83d6-ce318edf3c55\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435889255591/d49c5615-6e50-4cf2-9797-42ae91097a43-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Graham Dilley is congratulated by Ian Botham\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham Dilley is congratulated by Ian Botham after reaching his fifty during England’s second innings.

After lunch he continued to charge in – “I don’t go as far as that on my holidays,” said one former Test bowler of his runup – and, before anybody knew what was happening, Australia were 75 for eight. Across the nation it had become an unofficial bank holiday. The Stock Exchange stopped, while the best vantage points outside Headingley were the ones by the windows of Radio Rentals stores, where groups of people watched the developing drama.</p> \n<p>Lillee and Ray Bright fought against the rising tide with a quick-witted partnership of 35 in four overs. Australia were 110 for eight, 20 from victory, when Lillee mis-hit Willis towards mid-on. Mike Gatting, not necessarily the man you would want in such circumstances, ran in and took a fine low catch. In the next over, from Botham, Old dropped two sharp chances at slip. It did not matter: Willis pegged back Bright’s middle stump to complete the most famous victory in Ashes history. He finished with figures of eight for 43.</p> \n<p>Finally there was a celebration, as Willis thrust his hands in the air, but even then it was more a kind of dead-eyed relief than an expression of joy. He turned on his heels to run back to his mark, realised there was no more work to do and ran in a circle before haring for the pavilion.</p> \n<p>Later that day Brearley received a telegram from Spike Milligan. “Marvellous – have my ticket for the wedding,” it read, in reference to the marriage of Charles and Diana a week later, to which the Goons-fan groom had invited him. The match was later voted Britain’s favourite sporting moment. England, 500-1 at one stage, had won by 18 runs. They had not just come back from the dead; they had come back from a cremation.</p> \n<h2>4) “In my day 58 beers between London and Sydney would have virtually classified you as a teetotaller.”</h2> \n<p><em>Ian Chappell on David Boon’s drinking, 1989</em></p> \n<p>There was an abnormal amount of travel sickness on the Qantas flight to London, and approximately 99.94% of it was self-inflicted. As it descended towards Heathrow airport, the plane’s captain addressed his passengers in the usual style. “Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to London where it is six degrees outside,” he said. “I want to wish the Australian team all the best. I know they’ll do very well because David Boon has just broken the record, 52 cans from Sydney to London.”</p> \n<p>Boon has always denied the story – “If people haven’t got something else to talk about they have led a fucking boring life,” he said in 2006 – but there are enough witnesses, one or two of them sober, to suggest that it happened. The teetotal Geoff Lawson, who kept score on the back of some sick bags, wished he had kept what would have been the ultimate in alternative Ashes memorabilia. Some were not worth keeping. “The very instant we pulled up at our allotted gate,” recalled Steve Waugh, “Tim Zoehrer lurched forward and filled up the sick bag to christen our tour.”</p> \n<p>Boon was aiming to beat the record of 45 cans, established by Rodney Marsh on the way to the World Cup in 1983. He didn’t just take the record; he obliterated it. And he obliterated himself. The middle-order batsman Dean Jones acted as pace-setter for much of the 24-hour flight. His father had told him to spend the journey picking the brain of somebody who had already played in England. The only thing Jones soaked up were about 25 cans on the way to the first stop-off in Singapore. At that point he was helped into an impromptu bed, “pissed as a fart”. With Jones out of action, a number of other players took turns to sit alongside Boon and sink a few to help him on his way. It was a very early example of squad rotation.</p> \n<p>When Australia landed, Merv Hughes gave a radio interview back home and jauntily informed everyone of what had occurred. “The big news is that Boonie’s cracked the first 50 of the tour!” This did not please the coach, Bob Simpson, who had hoped that what happened on the plane would stay on the plane. “I got in more trouble than the protagonist,” Hughes said. “I was shitting myself that I’d be sent home.”</p> \n<p>Boon, who became known as the “Keg on Legs”, was fined $5,000 – a lot for an international cricketer in 1989 – and put on probation. Simpson was not the only Australian who was unimpressed. Ian Chappell had been informed that Boon had drunk 58 cans, rather than 52, yet even that was not enough. “What is the world going to think? That Australia has become a namby-pamby nation which doesn’t know how to drink? For God’s sake, in my day fifty-eight beers between Sydney and London would virtually have classified you as a teetotaller.”</p> \n<p>Throughout the 1989 tour of England, Australia were emphatic proof that there are no team-bonding agents as powerful as alcohol and victory. A number of the players get almost misty-eyed when they talk about 1989. Ian Healey said: “The spirit in the team was as good as anything I’ve ever been involved in.”</p> \n<h2>5) “All the palaver caused me to burn my toast”</h2> \n<p><em>Duncan Fletcher on the Trent Bridge Test of 2005</em></p> \n<p>Ricky Ponting was chuntering to everyone and no one, his face a picture of affronted dismay. As he walked off the field, absent-mindedly removing his gloves while swearing in all directions, it was as much as he could do not to grit his teeth to breaking point. When he reached the pavilion steps, Ponting – still with his helmet on, as if he couldn’t quite bring himself to take off his work clothes and fully acknowledge his innings was over – snapped his head and started shouting abuse in a specific direction, and at a specific person on the England balcony. In a series full of symbolic moments, this was the biggest of all; the moment England knew Australia had cracked.</p> \n<p>After making Australia follow on for the first time in 17 years, England were having a tougher time getting them out a second time. Australia were 155 for two, 104 behind, and Ponting was looking ominously set on 48. Damien Martyn called Ponting for a tight single on the off side, and the substitute Gary Pratt – on for the injured Simon Jones – threw down the stumps with dead-eyed certainty. Ponting’s exasperation at getting out in such a manner at such a time was great enough, even before he realised he had been run out by a substitute.</p> \n<p>Australia had been irritated throughout the series by England’s habit of using substitute fielders, apparently to give their bowlers a rest after a long spell; it was a legitimate complaint – England clearly bent the rules – but in this case Jones was genuinely injured.</p> \n<p>Ponting did not know that and all the frustration and pressure came out in five seconds of ranting at Fletcher on the balcony. Fletcher was sufficiently distracted by events that he burnt his toast in the dressing room, though it was clear he loved every second of Ponting’s outburst. “If you want to take a run to the cover fielder and get out, whose fault is that?” he said at the close of play.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nofkoClevE\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9nofkoClevE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The tourists battled on to 387 – Simon Katich got an appalling lbw decision after resisting over four hours for 59 – which left England needing 129 to go ahead in the series. It turned into the kind of run-chase that ages people by 10 years. Shane Warne raged majestically against the dying of the light, reducing England to 57 for four. Kevin Pietersen and Flintoff calmed things down with a partnership of 46 before Lee dismissed both, with Flintoff bowled by a stunning delivery.</p> \n<p>England, in control throughout the match, now faced the very real prospect of losing – which would have ended the drama at a stroke, because Australia would have gone 2–1 up with one to play and retained the urn.</p> \n<p>When Geraint Jones skied Warne to mid-off, England were 116 for seven, 13 short of victory. Hoggard loafed out to join Ashley Giles and said: “Come on, let’s me and you get it done.” Giles’s reply – “It’s reversing at 95mph” – did not quite maintain the mood of cheery certainty. But they did get it done, just about. The crowd greeted Hoggard’s cover-driven four off Lee like the announcement of world peace, and soon after Giles hit the winning runs. “Whether we win or lose, we relish creating a bit of an arse-nipper,” he said. The biggest of them all, the series decider, was yet to come.</p> \n<h2>6) “Get ready for a broken fucking arm”</h2> \n<p><em>Michael Clarke to James Anderson, Brisbane, 2013-14</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f9fb877e-ed9a-4629-8c5d-678aab8b7c60\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435889771565/37ece762-5780-4770-90ef-f61dc73e9552-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Michael Clarke and James Anderson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Clarke and James Anderson exchange words during the first Ashes Test between Australia and England on 24 November, 2013 in Brisbane.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mitchell Johnson waited at the end of his mark. And waited some more. James Anderson, the batsman in his sights, moved out of his crease to prepare himself for the imminent assault. As he did so, he began to exchange unpleasantries with George Bailey, Australia’s short leg. Michael Clarke, the Australia captain, walked towards the incident and was met halfway by Anderson, where they had a full and frank exchange of views. After a few seconds, Clarke began to walk backwards to his position and uttered the words that would shape an Ashes series.</p> \n<p>Clarke’s threat to Anderson, which was picked up by the stump mic, cost him 20% of his match fee. It was worth every penny. It changed the way he was perceived by many among the Australian public; more important, it told England that Australia would stop at almost nothing to regain the Ashes. They were about to go 1–0 up in the series, and Clarke sensed the opportunity to score some points for the four remaining Tests.</p> \n<p>The tenor of the contest had changed so much from the previous series that Clarke wanted to ram home the point that England were now on Australia’s manor, and were playing by their rules. It might have backfired; Anderson might have taken 10-for in the next Test, but Clarke’s instinct told him that England were vulnerable.</p> \n<p>Shane Warne later said that the stump mic was switched off – but still accessible for the commentators – seconds earlier when Anderson told Bailey that he wanted to punch him in the face. “Anderson brought it on himself,” said the Australia bowler Peter Siddle after the game, without going into specifics. “So fair’s fair.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtA6laeJBts\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RtA6laeJBts?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In a match that cemented the tone of the series, England had been taken apart by Mitchell Johnson. The phrase “shock bowler” has become a cliche for those who bowl short, sharp spells, but Johnson fulfilled the role in the truest sense. An experienced, battle-hardened side were so shocked that they never recovered. Before he was a shock bowler, Johnson had been not a stock bowler but a laughing stock, certainly to the Barmy Army.</p> \n<p>The team who played that first Test were the second most experienced in England’s history. They had 649 caps and around 649GB of data based on those appearances and on study of the Australians. This was a grizzled, gnarled team, who thought they had seen everything and were prepared for anything. They had no idea. No computer could have prepared them for the way Johnson spooked them. He no longer bowled to the left and the right; he bowled at the stumps and the head. Modern batsmen, not just England’s, were lulled into a false sense of security by years of mollycoddling; when they were then exposed to extreme pace and aggression, they had about as much idea how to survive as rich kids dropped into the meanest streets of the Bronx.</p> \n<p>Johnson’s impact was similar to that of the West Indian quicks in the 1980s – but there were four of them. He had emphatically got his mojo back, and a combination of his surname and Movember moustache made MoJo an inevitable nickname. And though he never appeared with a low-buttoned shirt exposing enormous clumps of chest hair, his moustache was an inadvertent tribute to the hirsute brutes of 1974–75, the last time England were assaulted so extremely in Australia.</p> \n<p>The Guardian’s Andy Bull, in reference to Johnson’s impact, cited the old Mike Tyson line: “Everybody has a plan, until they get punched in the face.” Bull’s Guardian colleague Mike Selvey referred to Johnson’s as “bare-knuckle bowling”. And yet in this game there was no merciful knockout or stoppage. England had to continue to take the blows for five whole Test matches.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> These are edited extracts from </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/283992/\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Gentlemen and Sledgers: A History of the Ashes in 100 Quotations and Confrontations</em></strong></a><em>, published by Head of Zeus.</em></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435888900929/Ian-Botham-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Giving it some humpty: Ian Botham hooks Geoff Lawson on his way to 149 not out during the historic third Test at Headingley in 1981.
