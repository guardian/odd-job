Caroline Wozniacki and the reigning Wimbledon champion, Petra Kvitova, are joined in the draw by the defending champion, Madison Keys at the tournament that was first held in 1974. Elsewhere, the BBC celebrate Arthur Ashe in <em>More Than A Champion</em> (BBC2, Friday, 9pm), a documentary looking back at the great player on the 40th anniversary of his win at Wimbledon, with his story told by brother Johnnie and Ilie Nastase. They also begin the first of three programmes remembering some of the truly great finals with the absolute classic between Goran Ivanisevic and Pat Rafter (BBC2, Saturday, 9am) in 2001 – the year Ivanisevic, a three-times beaten finalist and past his best, entered as a wildcard.</p> \n<h2>CHAMPIONS DRAW ...</h2> \n<p>Uefa make the draw for the first and second qualifying rounds of the Champions League on Monday, (streaming at <a href=\"http://uefa.com\" title=\"\">uefa.com</a>, 11am) where Celtic (alongside Wales’s The New Saints and Northern Ireland’s Crusaders in the first round draw) will discover who they face in their first match set for 14 or 15 July. Victory over two legs will put them into the third round against clubs such as Ajax, Monaco and Shaktar Donestk before the play-off round, where Manchester United will begin their campaign, which is drawn on 22 August. It is followed by the Europa League draws, where West Ham and Aberdeen will be chosen among the first round qualifiers and Inverness in the second round.</p> \n<h2>ENGLAND’S BIG BASH ...</h2> \n<p>The rollercoaster ride of following England continues on Tuesday when they play a single T20 match with New Zealand at Old Trafford (Sky Sports 2, 6pm, Radio 5 Live), their final international before the Ashes begin on 8 July. After a disastrous World Cup, the short-form team has been transformed, not least in their record 350-run chase to beat New Zealand in the fourth ODI (the joint fourth-highest of all time). They had already bettered their best aggregate scoring rate in a five match series by the end of that match with 1,425 over the previous high of 1,399. It is a far cry from Test cricket but going in with a win after such a turnaround in one-day form will not hurt one bit. The Ashes are also considered in a live Flinters and Vaughan roadshow, looking back on cricket’s greatest competition (Thursday, 8pm, Five Live).</p> \n<h2><br />MOTORS MAGIC ...</h2> \n<p>Increasingly popular, the Goodwood Festival of Speed is once again sold out for the Friday and Saturday. Unsurprisingly this year with another stellar lineup, including Nico Rosberg, Felipe Massa, Anthony Davidson, Valentino Rossi and Casey Stoner in action. They are joined by Sir Stirling Moss celebrating his 1955 victory at the Mille Miglia in a Mercedes SLR 300 – and the show will feature seven of the last eight of the cars still in existence. Tickets are available for the Friday but fear not if you cannot make it, the entire event is streamed at <a href=\"http://goodwood.com/fos\" title=\"\">goodwood.com/fos</a>, with highlights on MotorsTV (Saturday, 12pm/Sunday 8.30am and Sky F1, Sunday 3pm).</p> \n<h2>ATHLETICS TEAM TEST ...</h2> \n<p>Dina Asher-Smith, one of Britain’s brightest sprinting talents competes again onSunday on the second day of the European Team Athletics Championship in Cheboksary, Russia (BBC2, 12.30pm). She has had quite a year, breaking Britain’s 100m record by running an 11.02sec in May and then two weeks later a 22.30 for the 200m, putting her at top of the European rankings. The sprinter, who is 19, runs the latter on Sunday in a chance to test herself against the best – Ukraine’s Nataliya Pohrebnyak, having run 22.98 this season and Russia’s Yekaterina Smirnova, who has recorded 23.04.<strong> </strong></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434759232558/Caroline-Wozniacki-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Caroline Wozniacki's Wimbledon preparations continue in Eastbourne alongside five other members of the world's top 10.

You see, The Fiver was excited, excited like a Fifa official with a brown envelope in their hands. Well, maybe not that excited, but pretty excited.</p> \n<p>Your interest is piqued, isn’t it? You know The Fiver to be a downbeat, downtrodden, downward-looking beast, one who is known more for being mired in morosity than leaden-down with happiness. So you want to know why. And The Fiver will tell you. Right after it puts in some long rambling sentences that are utterly pointless and go nowhere but take up some time and space and make The Fiver look denser – not like that – than it is, like the one you have just read, or the ones you are about to read. The year was 19-ought-six. The president is the divine Miss Sarah Bernhardt and all over America people were doing a dance called the Funky Grampa.</p> \n<p>OK, OK. That’s enough. Let’s get back to the source of the happiness. It was simple really: The Fiver had nothing to write about. Not one single thing. Nothing. Nada. Niente. Niks. A day off before <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/18/england-karen-bardsley-womens-world-cup\">the Women’s World Cup last 16</a>? Bah. England getting done at a tournament <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/18/england-portugal-european-under-21-championship\">by superior opposition</a>? Puh. One match at the Copa Am&eacute;rica and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/19/copa-america-peru-venezuela-match-report\">there was only one red card</a>? Do us a favour. So then, was this it? Had the day come? Should The Fiver get the six cans of Tin it had been saving for this very occasion? Eh, no. Thanks Harry Kane. Thanks a lot. Thanks for coming along and opening up your trap and ruining The Fiver’s big day. You’re just like the time someone handed The Fiver a delicious looking doughnut only for The Fiver’s chompers to bite in and discover mayonnaise, the vilest of all the condiments. Thanks, but no thanks, Harry Kane.</p> \n<p>Coincidentally, that is exactly what Harry has been saying to Manchester United. “I’ve seen there’s interest but that’s all I know,” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/19/harry-kane-flattered-manchester-united-tottenham\">he yakkety-yakked</a>. “It’s flattering for other clubs to maybe be interested but I’m happy at Spurs and I’m looking forward to the future … Tottenham are a big club and that’s the way people have got to see it. I’m at a big club now, I’m enjoying my football and I’m looking forward to next season.” Having read those words, The Fiver’s heart melted and those feelings of rage were transformed to sympathy, sympathy for the Red Devils. This is how low they have fallen, even a Spurs player won’t contemplate joining them. That’s bad. Very bad. Almost as bad as those 80s numbers or that doughnut. That damn doughnut.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>“Cut Warner and he probably bleeds brown envelopes, just waiting to be stuffed with US dollars.

So, when astronomers find a new star that is not quite so hot, rotates anti-clockwise about its central axis, and which loses considerable luminosity as smaller objects pass directly in front of it, will they name it Cosmos Redshift 8, inspired by $tevie Mbe?” – Phil West.</p> \n<p>“Re: Owen Keating and the apropos battle (yesterday’s Fiver letters). I’d say he’s actually bagged the perfect hat-trick: a) used The Fiver as legitimate (?) reference material to back up his position in his battle with The Man; b) been forced to unsubscribe from The Fiver, and therefore won’t have his inbox assaulted by such drivel any longer; c) had his letter published in The Fiver. Too bad he’s had to unsubscribe, and therefore won’t know that’s he’s won the metaphorical ‘match ball’. Good work” – Andy Milner.</p> \n<p>“Owen Keatings fears he won the apropos battle but lost the war with a forced unsubscription. I can’t help but feel that he has that the wrong way round” – Scott Crawford.<br /></p> \n<p>“Re: cool names (Fiver letters passim. I’m catching up, OK? I’ve been busy. Get off my back). I can thoroughly recommend pretentious parents for weirdly spelled first names. More importantly, thank you for validating the decision my husband and I made not to double barrel with ‘Rogers’ first.

Is winning really so important to the fielding side that they're willing to contravene that spirit to get a result? The bowling of wides is not against the laws but in this context it clearly seems unfair. I would allow the game to continue beyond the stated finishing time, as long as the batting side and my colleague were happy to do so. I have seen batsmen carry on batting in poor light when it has suited them, and, in this case, I am certain that they would happily continue with the prospect of winning. John Clegg wins the shirt. </p>\n<p>2) Out. There's no attempt at foul play here – the ball has struck the fielder and bounced to another without touching the ground. The fielder might very well have sunglasses for medical reasons, even though at that instant he was not wearing them over his eyes. It'd be no different if he was wearing spectacles. Thanks to Ian McGowan. </p>\n<p>3) The fielding captain has absolutely no right or authority to complain about what an incoming batsman was doing before going to the crease. How would he feel if his bowlers weren't allowed to warm up beforehand by bowling a few balls to the wicketkeeper, coach or another fielder? What a nonsense. Play on.

As you enter the surprisingly small room, you immediately notice that he has moved the book case from the right side of the room to the left and that he has borrowed that old trick from interior designers of painting the inside of the shelf some shades deeper than the colour of the room. The books have been organised, of course. This time in the order in which he bought them. That way he can write his own autobiography without picking up a pen. The desk, which oddly faced the wall under the previous regime, now looks out the window. On it are three framed photos. One of his wife and kids. One of a motivational quote from Oprah Winfrey. And one of the time he caught that wild brown trout in Cogra Moss. Next to that desk is a fax machine, containing a piece of paper that details <strong>Real Madrid</strong>’s offer for <strong>Sergio Ag&uuml;ero</strong>. The Spanish club are dangerously underweight when it comes to attackers and are determined to get their man who is determined to stay in Manchester. He may get his way and stay but <strong>Edin Dzeko </strong>won’t. He has been booked in for a one-way ticket to <strong>Roma</strong>.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Paul Pogba</strong> ... zzz ... <strong>Manchester City</strong> ... zzz ...<strong> Manchester United</strong> ... zzz ... &pound;70m ... zzz.</p> \n<p>Over in <strong>Chelsea</strong>, Jos&eacute; Mourinho has been looking in the mirror, both literally and metaphorically. When doing so, he stares deeply and rubs his sideboards and his chin with his right hand. He has been thinking about his image last season. Too serious, too po-faced, too austere, too forbidding, too somber. If only the world knew the real him. Thoughtful, happy, chirpy, playful and funny, really, really funny. Sides-hurting funny. Milk-exiting-the-nose-funny. ‘Damn, if only they could see that. How can I make them see that? There must be something I could do that would make the world see how funny I am. Think, Jos&eacute; think’. And then, ding. Off went the lightbulb in his head and in popped the idea. Sign <strong>Robert Green </strong>as a replacement for Petr Cech. Like all the best jokes, it was so simple, yet so clever. ‘You’re a genius, Jos&eacute;! Mwah!’ He wiped the excess saliva off the mirror before running up to Roman’s office to ask him if his credit card still worked.</p> \n<p><strong>Cech</strong>, in case you are wondering, will be boarding the Do One bus that will be making one stop and one stop only, <strong>Arsenal</strong>. Lucky for him, he won’t have to sit there all alone on the bus, looking out the window, with only his iPod and the Combat Jack Show for company. <strong>Gonzalo Higua&iacute;n</strong> and <strong>Edinson Cavani </strong>will also be there with him. <strong>Julian Draxler</strong> too. But that’s not all. <strong>Hatsune Miku</strong>, <strong>the Bogeyman </strong>and the entire cast of <strong>The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin</strong> will fill up the rest of the red double-decker as well as half of another bus following behind. Seriously.</p> \n<p>Up in <strong>Liverpool</strong>, Brendan Rodgers has just put down the phone. He did so with a polite goodbye but once the receiver was safely back in its cradle, he kicked the desk very hard. The result? A very sore big toe that led to Brendan hopping around the room and swearing like a sailor whose bezkozyrka has just been blown overboard. The reason? Southampton said that while a neatly-stacked pile of &pound;10m did look delightful, they believe that <strong>Nathaniel Clyne </strong>is worth another &pound;5m more. Brendan was sure that &pound;10m would be enough and that the extra could &pound;5m could be spent on having his best quotes painted onto the walls around Anfield. He may have to ditch that idea now. Sigh. Poor Brendan. </p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7e295521235e07563843d5914327b95e6f96c98a/0_60_4080_2450/4080.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2450,"width":4080,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Sergio Agüero","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T07:48:03Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T16:56:17Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian McCourt","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ian-mccourt"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Sergio Agüero","Real Madrid","Manchester City","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/sergio-aguero","webTitle":"Sergio Agüero"},{"id":"football/realmadrid","webTitle":"Real Madrid"},{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ian McCourt","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ian-mccourt"}}],"series":{"title":"Rumour Mill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/series/rumourmill"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#005689","matchStatusPre":"#676767","matchStatusDuring":"#4bc6df","matchStatusAbandoned":"#da1d1d","matchStatusPost":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"football"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/19/transfer-rumours-sergio-aguero-real-madrid","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avmx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/19/transfer-rumours-sergio-aguero-real-madrid","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/19/transfer-rumours-sergio-aguero-real-madrid"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7e295521235e07563843d5914327b95e6f96c98a/0_60_4080_2450/4080.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2450,"width":4080,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sergio Agüero reacts to the news that he is moving to Madrid.
