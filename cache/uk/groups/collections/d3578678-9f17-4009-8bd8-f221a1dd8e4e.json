Apparently, she also has some team-mates who aren’t Sone Aluko’s sister and don’t have law degrees, but The Fiver has been too busy demanding transfer speculation to be sure.</p> \n<p>Law degree or not, Aluko’s manager Mark Sampson is no fool. With his team, ranked sixth in the world, drawn against another, ranked 11th in the world, it makes perfect sense that – rather than acknowledge a nifty chance to reach the quarter-final – he sneak his retaliation in first. So his opponents are not, in fact, “Norway”, but “a Norwegian team whose world ranking probably doesn’t befit the team they’ve got”, and, of course, they are also “physically strong and tactically well organised” – or, put another way, cheats.</p> \n<p>Nor is that all. “When a major tournament comes round,” he said, Norway “do more than enough” – though whether this applies to England, and if not, why not, remains unclear. Instead, the game was proclaimed as a “big challenge for this England team”, Sampson’s own involvement in the enterprise suddenly unclear.</p> \n<p>But, England being England, the dreaded spot-kicks are also at the forefront of the his mind. “We’re in a good place with penalties,” he said, and penalties later confirmed itself to be a close personal friend and great friend of the squad. As such, planning has been meticulous. “We’ve got a very clear penalty strategy,” Sampson explained, without quite explaining what that means, also asserting that it’ll be the players’ responsibility to score them but his decision who takes them, which seems fair.</p> \n<p>England being England, there’s also a strong desire to relieve past failure – in particular, that at Italia ‘90. Accordingly and unsurprisingly, the management are “stoking-evoking those memories with the players”, more than half of whom were aged three or under at the time. Finally, eventually, and at long last, Sampson’s focus turned to himself. “Our team development guru is working hard with me,” he said, “on my breathing techniques and the ability to get myself in the right emotional state to make good decisions.”</p> \n<p>And with that, off he went to get his guitar.</p> \n<h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT</h2> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/women-s-world-cup-2015\">Join Daniel Harris from 10pm BST for MBM coverage of England 1-2 Norway in the Women’s World Cup last 16, before Les Carpenter is on hand for USA!

It was still there on Friday morning, surprisingly unclaimed by any local kids. Closer inspection revealed it had an MLS logo on it. Does this mean that $$$$tevie Mbe has started training with LA Galaxy, practicing those trademark Hollywood balls of his? It certainly wasn’t a corner-kick practice, which wouldn’t have cleared the first training cone” – Justin Kavanagh.</p> \n<p>“I understand and almost like the intellectual cynicism of The Fiver’s Stop Football campaign. But it’s not going to work and, more importantly, is probably not as funny as it once might have been. Watching the Copa Am&eacute;rica just reminds me of the need for a Stop Wrestling At Corners campaign. Apart from defenders and referees, no one associated with football approves of it. Come on.

That will mean that whole epic saga will have to be aborted and the young Spaniard will be forced to remain at United. Unless, that is, Real find some other token of exchange – and this is where the Daily Mail starts to get excited. “<strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong>, <strong>Gareth Bale</strong>, <strong>Karim Benzema</strong>, <strong>Luka Modric</strong>, <strong>Raphael Varane</strong> and <strong>Dani Carvajal </strong>could all come up in negotiations with United,” blurts the giddy organ before adding a disclaimer for the benefit of the light of head: “there are no guarantees that United will get their way.” </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/22/petr-cech-arsenal-chelsea\">Petr Cech closes in on Arsenal move after Chelsea reluctantly pave way</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Meanwhile the Daily Mirror reckons that if De Gea eventually move to Real, Louis Van Gaal will replace him with Ajax goalkeeper <strong>Jasper Cillessen</strong>. You may remember Cillessen as the keeper whom Van Gaal humiliated in the World Cup by hauling him off just before a penalty shootout and replacing him with Tim Krul, all of which raises an interesting issue: if Cillessen joins, what will happen when United concede a penalty at Old Trafford? Ah, yes, silly question. </p> \n<p>Elsewhere, <strong>Manchester City</strong>’s interest in Fabian Delph appears to have cooled, but the club continues to have the hots for <strong>Jack Wilshere</strong> and, if they fail to land Paul Pogba, will submit an offer for the midfielder that Ars&egrave;ne Wenger cannot refuse. Hmm, something about that last sentence doesn’t feel quite right. Reckon it’s that bit about Ars&egrave;ne Wenger, Earth’s most stubborn man, not being able to refuse an offer. Never underestimate Wenger’s powers of refusal. If the man were not a football manager, he would be a record-breaking fakir, capable of lying on beds of nails for years while refusing to acknowledge any pain. Having said that, Wenger’s concentration may be weak at the moment, as word is he’s deliberating over what to do now that Geoffrey Kondogbia has left Monaco for Inter rather than London. Having failed to take the player from <strong>Monaco</strong>, perhaps Wenger will take inspiration from them? For the Ligue 1 club are planning to re-invest some of the Kondogbia windfall in <strong>William Carvalho</strong>. Milan, who had been even more interested in Kondogbia than Arsenal were, are also eyeing up Carvalho, but may plump for Marseille’s <strong>Giannelli Imbula</strong> or Zenit’s <strong>Axel Witsel </strong>instead. Lots of name for you there, Ars&egrave;ne. </p> \n<p>No excuses. <strong>Juventus</strong> want to prise <strong>Yannick Ferreira Carrasco</strong> from Monaco, and there is not much Liverpool can do about that no matter what they think. Meanwhile, <strong>New York City</strong> are to offer <strong>Andrea Pirlo</strong> a holiday in the USA. </p> \n<p><strong>Newcastle </strong>hope that offering <strong>Charlie Austin</strong> the No9 shirt could be the key incentive that will make the striker choose to go to St James’ Park. And if that doesn’t work, maybe the club will throw in a biscuit or a shiny sticker album, too. </p> \n<p>Tottenham hope that holding the door open for <strong>Roberto Soldado</strong> and handing him his suitcases will help convince the former striker to leave White Hart Lane for <strong>Galatasaray</strong>. Also Turkey-bound, if Manchester United’s wishes come true, is <strong>Nani</strong>, in whom <strong>Fenerbahce</strong> are interested. </p> \n<p><strong>Javier Hern&aacute;ndez</strong>, meanwhile, is on his way back to Madrid, not to Real but to <strong>Atl&eacute;tico</strong>. <strong>Sevilla</strong> want <strong>Steven Nzonzi</strong> and are prepared to help <strong>Stoke</strong> keep up the ‘z’ quotient on their team-sheet by giving them the Polish midfielder <strong>Grzegorz Krychowiak</strong> in return. </p> \n<p>And <strong>Sunderland</strong> are chasing <strong>Stewart Downing</strong>, whom they fear may be tempted to rejoin <strong>Middlesbrough</strong> instead. </p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/121079f2e745b4d030a0d25a263492bfb4e4aa86/0_127_1929_1158/1929.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1158,"width":1929,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alan Walter/Action Images","altText":"Charlie Austin","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alan Walter/Action Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T07:33:08Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T07:38:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Paul Doyle","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/pauldoyle"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Football","Transfer window","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"football/transfer-window","webTitle":"Transfer window"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Paul Doyle","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/pauldoyle"}}],"series":{"title":"Rumour Mill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/series/rumourmill"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/football-transfer-rumours-charlie-austin-newcastle-united","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a37m","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/23/football-transfer-rumours-charlie-austin-newcastle-united","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/23/football-transfer-rumours-charlie-austin-newcastle-united"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/121079f2e745b4d030a0d25a263492bfb4e4aa86/0_127_1929_1158/1929.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1158,"width":1929,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Is Charlie Austin set to sneak off to Tyneside?

Caroline Wozniacki and the reigning Wimbledon champion, Petra Kvitova, are joined in the draw by the defending champion, Madison Keys at the tournament that was first held in 1974. Elsewhere, the BBC celebrate Arthur Ashe in <em>More Than A Champion</em> (BBC2, Friday, 9pm), a documentary looking back at the great player on the 40th anniversary of his win at Wimbledon, with his story told by brother Johnnie and Ilie Nastase. They also begin the first of three programmes remembering some of the truly great finals with the absolute classic between Goran Ivanisevic and Pat Rafter (BBC2, Saturday, 9am) in 2001 – the year Ivanisevic, a three-times beaten finalist and past his best, entered as a wildcard.</p> \n<h2>CHAMPIONS DRAW ...</h2> \n<p>Uefa make the draw for the first and second qualifying rounds of the Champions League on Monday, (streaming at <a href=\"http://uefa.com\" title=\"\">uefa.com</a>, 11am) where Celtic (alongside Wales’s The New Saints and Northern Ireland’s Crusaders in the first round draw) will discover who they face in their first match set for 14 or 15 July. Victory over two legs will put them into the third round against clubs such as Ajax, Monaco and Shaktar Donestk before the play-off round, where Manchester United will begin their campaign, which is drawn on 22 August. It is followed by the Europa League draws, where West Ham and Aberdeen will be chosen among the first round qualifiers and Inverness in the second round.</p> \n<h2>ENGLAND’S BIG BASH ...</h2> \n<p>The rollercoaster ride of following England continues on Tuesday when they play a single T20 match with New Zealand at Old Trafford (Sky Sports 2, 6pm, Radio 5 Live), their final international before the Ashes begin on 8 July. After a disastrous World Cup, the short-form team has been transformed, not least in their record 350-run chase to beat New Zealand in the fourth ODI (the joint fourth-highest of all time). They had already bettered their best aggregate scoring rate in a five match series by the end of that match with 1,425 over the previous high of 1,399. It is a far cry from Test cricket but going in with a win after such a turnaround in one-day form will not hurt one bit. The Ashes are also considered in a live Flinters and Vaughan roadshow, looking back on cricket’s greatest competition (Thursday, 8pm, Five Live).</p> \n<h2><br />MOTORS MAGIC ...</h2> \n<p>Increasingly popular, the Goodwood Festival of Speed is once again sold out for the Friday and Saturday. Unsurprisingly this year with another stellar lineup, including Nico Rosberg, Felipe Massa, Anthony Davidson, Valentino Rossi and Casey Stoner in action. They are joined by Sir Stirling Moss celebrating his 1955 victory at the Mille Miglia in a Mercedes SLR 300 – and the show will feature seven of the last eight of the cars still in existence. Tickets are available for the Friday but fear not if you cannot make it, the entire event is streamed at <a href=\"http://goodwood.com/fos\" title=\"\">goodwood.com/fos</a>, with highlights on MotorsTV (Saturday, 12pm/Sunday 8.30am and Sky F1, Sunday 3pm).</p> \n<h2>ATHLETICS TEAM TEST ...</h2> \n<p>Dina Asher-Smith, one of Britain’s brightest sprinting talents competes again onSunday on the second day of the European Team Athletics Championship in Cheboksary, Russia (BBC2, 12.30pm). She has had quite a year, breaking Britain’s 100m record by running an 11.02sec in May and then two weeks later a 22.30 for the 200m, putting her at top of the European rankings. The sprinter, who is 19, runs the latter on Sunday in a chance to test herself against the best – Ukraine’s Nataliya Pohrebnyak, having run 22.98 this season and Russia’s Yekaterina Smirnova, who has recorded 23.04.<strong> </strong></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434759232558/Caroline-Wozniacki-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Caroline Wozniacki's Wimbledon preparations continue in Eastbourne alongside five other members of the world's top 10.

Is winning really so important to the fielding side that they're willing to contravene that spirit to get a result? The bowling of wides is not against the laws but in this context it clearly seems unfair. I would allow the game to continue beyond the stated finishing time, as long as the batting side and my colleague were happy to do so. I have seen batsmen carry on batting in poor light when it has suited them, and, in this case, I am certain that they would happily continue with the prospect of winning. John Clegg wins the shirt. </p>\n<p>2) Out. There's no attempt at foul play here – the ball has struck the fielder and bounced to another without touching the ground. The fielder might very well have sunglasses for medical reasons, even though at that instant he was not wearing them over his eyes. It'd be no different if he was wearing spectacles. Thanks to Ian McGowan. </p>\n<p>3) The fielding captain has absolutely no right or authority to complain about what an incoming batsman was doing before going to the crease. How would he feel if his bowlers weren't allowed to warm up beforehand by bowling a few balls to the wicketkeeper, coach or another fielder? What a nonsense. Play on.
