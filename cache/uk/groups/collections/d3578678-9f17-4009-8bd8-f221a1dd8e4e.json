It might have been because the neighbours were blasting blasted 1980s pop tunes in an ironic fashion; or it might have been because of the two litres of tar-black coffee; but more than likely it was because of the butterflies fluttering and spluttering around its stomach. You see, The Fiver was excited, excited like a Fifa official with a brown envelope in their hands. Well, maybe not that excited, but pretty excited.</p> \n<p>Your interest is piqued, isn’t it? You know The Fiver to be a downbeat, downtrodden, downward-looking beast, one who is known more for being mired in morosity than leaden-down with happiness. So you want to know why. And The Fiver will tell you. Right after it puts in some long rambling sentences that are utterly pointless and go nowhere but take up some time and space and make The Fiver look denser – not like that – than it is, like the one you have just read, or the ones you are about to read. The year was 19-ought-six. The president is the divine Miss Sarah Bernhardt and all over America people were doing a dance called the Funky Grampa.</p> \n<p>OK, OK. That’s enough. Let’s get back to the source of the happiness. It was simple really: The Fiver had nothing to write about. Not one single thing. Nothing. Nada. Niente. Niks. A day off before <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/18/england-karen-bardsley-womens-world-cup\">the Women’s World Cup last 16</a>? Bah. England getting done at a tournament <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/18/england-portugal-european-under-21-championship\">by superior opposition</a>? Puh. One match at the Copa Am&eacute;rica and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/19/copa-america-peru-venezuela-match-report\">there was only one red card</a>? Do us a favour. So then, was this it? Had the day come? Should The Fiver get the six cans of Tin it had been saving for this very occasion? Eh, no. Thanks Harry Kane. Thanks a lot. Thanks for coming along and opening up your trap and ruining The Fiver’s big day. You’re just like the time someone handed The Fiver a delicious looking doughnut only for The Fiver’s chompers to bite in and discover mayonnaise, the vilest of all the condiments. Thanks, but no thanks, Harry Kane.</p> \n<p>Coincidentally, that is exactly what Harry has been saying to Manchester United. “I’ve seen there’s interest but that’s all I know,” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/19/harry-kane-flattered-manchester-united-tottenham\">he yakkety-yakked</a>. “It’s flattering for other clubs to maybe be interested but I’m happy at Spurs and I’m looking forward to the future … Tottenham are a big club and that’s the way people have got to see it. I’m at a big club now, I’m enjoying my football and I’m looking forward to next season.” Having read those words, The Fiver’s heart melted and those feelings of rage were transformed to sympathy, sympathy for the Red Devils. This is how low they have fallen, even a Spurs player won’t contemplate joining them. That’s bad. Very bad. Almost as bad as those 80s numbers or that doughnut. That damn doughnut.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>“Cut Warner and he probably bleeds brown envelopes, just waiting to be stuffed with US dollars.

So, when astronomers find a new star that is not quite so hot, rotates anti-clockwise about its central axis, and which loses considerable luminosity as smaller objects pass directly in front of it, will they name it Cosmos Redshift 8, inspired by $tevie Mbe?” – Phil West.</p> \n<p>“Re: Owen Keating and the apropos battle (yesterday’s Fiver letters). I’d say he’s actually bagged the perfect hat-trick: a) used The Fiver as legitimate (?) reference material to back up his position in his battle with The Man; b) been forced to unsubscribe from The Fiver, and therefore won’t have his inbox assaulted by such drivel any longer; c) had his letter published in The Fiver. Too bad he’s had to unsubscribe, and therefore won’t know that’s he’s won the metaphorical ‘match ball’. Good work” – Andy Milner.</p> \n<p>“Owen Keatings fears he won the apropos battle but lost the war with a forced unsubscription. I can’t help but feel that he has that the wrong way round” – Scott Crawford.<br /></p> \n<p>“Re: cool names (Fiver letters passim. I’m catching up, OK? I’ve been busy. Get off my back). I can thoroughly recommend pretentious parents for weirdly spelled first names. More importantly, thank you for validating the decision my husband and I made not to double barrel with ‘Rogers’ first.

The final scene was set in spring but filmed in autumn. That meant various members of the crew had to take spray paint to the yellowing leaves to give them a flush of spring. Rob Lowe, John Cusack, Jim Carrey, Johnny Depp, Tom Cruise, Robert Downey Jr and Michael J Fox were all considered for the role of Ferris Bueller. Ferris may not be happy that he does not have a car but that synthesiser he has in his bedroom – an E-MU Emulator II no less – cost $8,000 back in 1984. Why is the Mill telling you this, you’re wondering. Because it’s the Mill’s favourite film and it is so bursting with knowledge of it that it wants to share it all to the world? Eh, not quite (that’s The Guns of Navarone, by the way). Because it wants you to have a fact or two to please a companion around the fire at the club? Hmm, not really. Because it’s using it as useful bluster to fill up some space and cover up for the fact that there is not much tittle-tattle to tittle-tattle about? Bingo! You can see for yourself below.</p> \n<p>Rafael Ben&iacute;tez has spent the last few days rearranging the furniture in his office but he finally thinks he has got it. As you enter the surprisingly small room, you immediately notice that he has moved the book case from the right side of the room to the left and that he has borrowed that old trick from interior designers of painting the inside of the shelf some shades deeper than the colour of the room. The books have been organised, of course. This time in the order in which he bought them. That way he can write his own autobiography without picking up a pen. The desk, which oddly faced the wall under the previous regime, now looks out the window. On it are three framed photos. One of his wife and kids. One of a motivational quote from Oprah Winfrey. And one of the time he caught that wild brown trout in Cogra Moss. Next to that desk is a fax machine, containing a piece of paper that details <strong>Real Madrid</strong>’s offer for <strong>Sergio Ag&uuml;ero</strong>. The Spanish club are dangerously underweight when it comes to attackers and are determined to get their man who is determined to stay in Manchester. He may get his way and stay but <strong>Edin Dzeko </strong>won’t. He has been booked in for a one-way ticket to <strong>Roma</strong>.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Paul Pogba</strong> ... zzz ... <strong>Manchester City</strong> ... zzz ...<strong> Manchester United</strong> ... zzz ... &pound;70m ... zzz.</p> \n<p>Over in <strong>Chelsea</strong>, Jos&eacute; Mourinho has been looking in the mirror, both literally and metaphorically. When doing so, he stares deeply and rubs his sideboards and his chin with his right hand. He has been thinking about his image last season. Too serious, too po-faced, too austere, too forbidding, too somber. If only the world knew the real him. Thoughtful, happy, chirpy, playful and funny, really, really funny. Sides-hurting funny. Milk-exiting-the-nose-funny. ‘Damn, if only they could see that. How can I make them see that? There must be something I could do that would make the world see how funny I am. Think, Jos&eacute; think’. And then, ding. Off went the lightbulb in his head and in popped the idea. Sign <strong>Robert Green </strong>as a replacement for Petr Cech. Like all the best jokes, it was so simple, yet so clever. ‘You’re a genius, Jos&eacute;! Mwah!’ He wiped the excess saliva off the mirror before running up to Roman’s office to ask him if his credit card still worked.</p> \n<p><strong>Cech</strong>, in case you are wondering, will be boarding the Do One bus that will be making one stop and one stop only, <strong>Arsenal</strong>. Lucky for him, he won’t have to sit there all alone on the bus, looking out the window, with only his iPod and the Combat Jack Show for company. <strong>Gonzalo Higua&iacute;n</strong> and <strong>Edinson Cavani </strong>will also be there with him. <strong>Julian Draxler</strong> too. But that’s not all. <strong>Hatsune Miku</strong>, <strong>the Bogeyman </strong>and the entire cast of <strong>The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin</strong> will fill up the rest of the red double-decker as well as half of another bus following behind. Seriously.</p> \n<p>Up in <strong>Liverpool</strong>, Brendan Rodgers has just put down the phone. He did so with a polite goodbye but once the receiver was safely back in its cradle, he kicked the desk very hard. The result? A very sore big toe that led to Brendan hopping around the room and swearing like a sailor whose bezkozyrka has just been blown overboard. The reason? Southampton said that while a neatly-stacked pile of &pound;10m did look delightful, they believe that <strong>Nathaniel Clyne </strong>is worth another &pound;5m more. Brendan was sure that &pound;10m would be enough and that the extra could &pound;5m could be spent on having his best quotes painted onto the walls around Anfield. He may have to ditch that idea now. Sigh. Poor Brendan. </p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7e295521235e07563843d5914327b95e6f96c98a/0_60_4080_2450/4080.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2450,"width":4080,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Sergio Agüero","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T07:48:03Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T16:56:17Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian McCourt","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ian-mccourt"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Sergio Agüero","Real Madrid","Manchester City","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/sergio-aguero","webTitle":"Sergio Agüero"},{"id":"football/realmadrid","webTitle":"Real Madrid"},{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ian McCourt","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ian-mccourt"}}],"series":{"title":"Rumour Mill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/series/rumourmill"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#005689","matchStatusPre":"#676767","matchStatusDuring":"#4bc6df","matchStatusAbandoned":"#da1d1d","matchStatusPost":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"football"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/19/transfer-rumours-sergio-aguero-real-madrid","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avmx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/19/transfer-rumours-sergio-aguero-real-madrid","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/19/transfer-rumours-sergio-aguero-real-madrid"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7e295521235e07563843d5914327b95e6f96c98a/0_60_4080_2450/4080.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2450,"width":4080,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sergio Agüero reacts to the news that he is moving to Madrid.

He looks so unlikely. Battered white hat, sleeves rolled, trousers tugged high and of course that great salt and pepper beard, hanging down to his chest. He sets himself in front of a single stump. Back foot parallel to the crease, front foot angled both out at 45 degrees and up, cocked. As the bowler approaches he lowers it down, moving his weight from the heel to the toe. At the same time he brings the bat up, waggles it once in mid-air, then lofts it again, to the top of his backlift. Six balls, that’s all. And soft ones, intended only to give the batsman the best chance to show off his shots.</p> \n<p>And so he does. Three easy drives to the on-side, another to the off, two glances towards mid-wicket. He’s defending a single stump, there, really, only for orientation. Behind him, a small crowd, which hardly seems to move. Look closely, however, and you’ll see one old man lean out from around another to catch a good look, and a small boy snap his head around in excitement and talk to his friend. Then the camera cuts and the batsman is gone. That’s it, <a href=\"http://www.britishpathe.com/video/cricket-giants-of-the-1890s/query/wg+grace\">all the footage we have</a> of one of the greatest, perhaps the very greatest, careers in English sport. The Champion, the Doctor, the Grand Old Man. WG. It gives us the beginnings of an idea about his style – but no more than that.</p> \n<p>This month marks the 150th anniversary of Grace’s first-class debut, which falls on Monday 22 June, for the Gentlemen of the South against the Players of the South. He was 16. This year also marks the 100th anniversary of his death, on 23 October 1915. He was 67 and had been playing as recently as the year before, his final innings an undefeated 69 out of Eltham’s total of 155 for six against Grove Park. His career as a competitive cricketer spanned six decades and, most likely, he played more innings and scored more runs across all levels of the game than anyone else in history.</p> \n<p>A rough sum that, since hard numbers are impossible to come by. But there were 870 first-class matches, for sure, which puts him third to Wilfred Rhodes and Frank Woolley, and countless more that didn’t carry that status. For 50 years, he bestrode what was then the national game, much as Nelson looks down on London from his column, leaving the best of his contemporaries like Landseer’s bronze lions, lying beneath his feet. Certainly Donald Bradman is the only cricketer who could be said to have made anything like such an impact on the public consciousness.</p> \n<p>We are still writing about Grace now, still reading about him, still learning about him. There have been three major biographies of him in the last 15 years alone. This summer, BBC Radio Bristol are running <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02rbx9g\">a series of documentaries on him</a>. And yet, somehow, the more detail we uncover, the more the man himself seems to recede from view. The more we learn, the less we understand.</p> \n<p>There are too many contradictions. Grace was the champion of the sport and yet also “a shameless cheat” as Geoffrey Moorhouse wrote in Wisden. (“They’ve come to see me bat,” and all that). Grace was the supreme cricketer, “an all-round athlete of the highest calibre”, according to Simon Rae. And he was also a roly-poly figure, almost 15 stone as a teenage and 22 stone as an adult. Grace was an amateur and he earned more from the game than any professional of his era. It is hard to knit together what we know.</p> \n<p>And so to a rather brilliant new novella by Charlie Connelly, called, quite simply, <a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/gilbert-9781472917591/\">Gilbert</a>. Because, as the blurb says, “to the public he was The Doctor, The Champion and WG, but to those who knew him best he was simply Gilbert.” Gilbert is an intimate portrait, slim and sparely written but full of detail. It takes us through the final years of Grace’s life, from 1898 to 1915. It begins with the famous story about his being dismissed three times in three balls by Charles Kortright, the first leg before, and the second caught behind. Grace stood his ground. The third, of course, bowled him. And so Kortright offered the send-off: “Surely you’re not leaving us, Doctor? There’s one stump still standing.”</p> \n<p>As Connelly imagines it: “Grace paused briefly as if he was about to turn and respond but instead marched off at a quickened pace, announcing to the waiting members as he strode up the steps that he had never been so insulted in his life.” You know the stories but you’ve never heard them told quite like this.</p> \n<p>Connelly explains his game in an entertaining early chapter that captures a conversation between Grace and his ghost writer, Arthur Porritt. Poritt hopes to write a book that will “look behind the curtain of the public face and share the real man with the reading public”, but finds himself frustrated by Grace’s incomprehension that there is anything to explore beyond the “bare facts of his achievements”.</p> \n<p>“I think your readers would very much enjoy any insight you can give them into what the experience actually felt like. People want to put themselves in the place of WG Grace as he was making that 100th century, what thoughts were in his mind, what the whole experience of such a big innings and extraordinary landmark means to WG Grace as a man and a batsman.”</p> \n<p>Grace was silent for a few moments.</p> \n<p>“I want to help you, Porritt, truly I do,” he said, “but to be perfectly honest with you I did not feel anything. I had too much to do watching the bowling and seeing how the fieldsmen were moved about to think anything. It’s as simple as that.”</p> \n<p>The facts lack. Connelly has taken that gap in our understanding of Grace and filled it from the well of his own imagination. He shows us the Grace who gave away his wicket so he could skip away from a match to take his very first ride in a motor car; the Grace who would stand in his garden and shake his fist at the Zeppelins flying overhead; the Grace who had to bury his daughter and his eldest son, both parents, and both brothers.</p> \n<p>What emerges is a portrait of a man who lived for the moment when the ball leaves the bowler’s hand and “absolutely nothing mattered other than his duel with it. The years fell away, the occasion melted to nothing and there was just him and the ball, locked in a duel”. It is a wonderful book, and though it’s a fiction, it brings us closer to an understanding of the man than any number of facts or any amount of film footage.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://id.theguardian.com/email/list\"><strong><em>This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.
