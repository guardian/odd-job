Not from tyranny, persecution or oppression. But from truth. We’re fighting for our right to lie. From this day on, the third day of July will no longer be remembered as an the festival of Saint Heliodorus of Altino but as the day that all of mankind declared we will not vanish without a lie. We will lie on. We will lie. Speaking of which. Here is today’s fresh, pile of transfer boo-do.</p> \n<p>Over in<strong> Manchester United</strong>, Louis van Gaal has just put the phone down and is feeling a bit sheepish. He has been trying to get through to<strong> Seamus Coleman</strong> all week but he keeps getting his voicemail. At first, Louis was worried that he had written the number down wrong, then he worried that Seamus had blocked his calls, then he worried about whether or not the last voicemail he left was a bit too forward. “My name is Louis,” he said “usually I don’t do this but I see you and me Seamus. Louis will give you no worries, Louis got million stories about these players that Louis laughed at when they was boring. Louis gone fill your pockets, Louis gone move your mama out of Donegal inside the gigantic mansion like Louis promised, Louis just want your trust and loyalty. Avoiding Louis? It’s not so easy, Louis at these functions accordingly. Louis don’t slack a minute, Louis work harder, Louis gone call you, Louis don’t mind cause at the end of the day you’ll pursue me. Louis go get it, Louis not timid, Louis up front, Louis got paper work on top of paper work, I want you to know that Louis got you. All your life I watched you and now I want you to sign this contract if that’s possible.” With the worrying out of the way, Louis made himself a cup of green tea to go with the financier he bought earlier that day from his local bakery and wondered how he would break the news to <strong>Jonny</strong> <strong>Evans</strong> that he is moving to <strong>Everton</strong>.</p> \n<p>Louis is the only one to be wondering these days, Steve McClaren has been too. Steve has mostly been musing about the fate of Greece and the knock-on effect on the Eurozone, as well as what impact the endorsing of the yes vote by the former conservative leader Costas Karamanlis will have, but he has been wondering about other things too. What was his favourite incarnation of the Sugarbabes, would he look good with an ice-cream cone on his face like Gucci’s and what is the best way to bring stability to <strong>Newcastle</strong>. In case you haven’t noticed it, dear Mill readers, over the last few years, Newcastle have been more all over the place than a teenager’s emotions. But sweat not, sweet fans of Newcastle, Steve is tapping the right side of his nose with his right index finger and is flashing his freshly pained grill. He knows how to solve this problem, he knows what needs to be done. He is going to bring in a superstar, the type of buy that will have the fans sleeping outside the club shop for days just to get his name printed on their jersey; the type of buy that will have those not sleeping outside the club shop, sleeping outside the local tattoo parlour to get his name emblazoned just above where they have the picture of their kids; the type of buy that will bring a professionalism to the side and make the rest of players up their game and work ten times harder. Who could that buy be? Well <strong>Mario Balotelli</strong>, of course.</p> \n<p>Back to Everton for a moment. If you hear them laughing hysterically, it has nothing to do with them remembering their favourite Woody Allen joke, you know the one when he says he asked his mother where babies came from and she thought he said “rabies”. She said you get them from being bitten by a dog. The next week, a woman on his block gave birth to triplets and he thought she’d been bitten by a great dane. No, it has nothing to do with that at all and more to do with the call they have just got from <strong>Tottenham</strong>. The London lads were very polite and prim. They asked how Everton were doing and how the mother was and whether she had recovered from her fall and they did not forget to mention that they had enjoyed the sister’s ballet recital immensely. With the pleasantries out of the way, they soon got down to business. We’re interested in <strong>James McCarthy</strong>, they said. At this point, Everton knew this call was going nowhere but decided to reciprocate the politeness afforded to them and so they let Spurs natter on. We’re interested in James McCarthy, they repeated, and we are willing to offer you Aaron Lennon or Younes Kaboul in return. It was at this point, Everton could hold it in no more and the laughter burst forth like the morning.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, <strong>David de Gea</strong> ... <strong>Real</strong> ... zzz ...</p> \n<p><strong>Antonio R&uuml;diger</strong> has been up all night working, not on his ball control, or his positioning, or his heading, but on his art. You might not know this but R&uuml;diger is a big fan of the painted word. Not the old stuff like Johannes Vermeer, Frans Pourbus the Younger or Johann Michael Feuchtmayer the Elder – he can appreciate their work but it leaves him cold. No, he’s more into the new stuff – especially the lettering styles of Ben Eine, an artist he first came across during the three hour street art east London walking tour – and that’s what he has been up all night working on. This latest effort of R&uuml;diger’s contains just four letters. N. E. I. N. and he has told his Mr/Ms 10% to show it to <strong>Chelsea</strong> next time they come calling. (He has done a separate one with the letters J.A and he is going to show that to <strong>Stuttgart</strong>) Once he is done with it, he plans to lend it to Pep Guardiola and <strong>Bayern Munich</strong>, who wants to show it to <strong>&Aacute;ngel Di Mar&iacute;a</strong>’s 10%er. Can’t think why, can you?</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7b23460448ec78fcf64b8f49eb5df8b247b76801/0_202_3766_2262/3766.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2262,"width":3766,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Olly Greenwood/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Mario Balotelli","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Olly Greenwood/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T07:45:45Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T08:46:04Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian McCourt","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ian-mccourt"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Mario Balotelli","Newcastle United","Liverpool","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/mario-balotelli","webTitle":"Mario Balotelli"},{"id":"football/newcastleunited","webTitle":"Newcastle United"},{"id":"football/liverpool","webTitle":"Liverpool"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ian McCourt","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ian-mccourt"}}],"series":{"title":"Rumour Mill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/series/rumourmill"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#005689","matchStatusPre":"#676767","matchStatusDuring":"#4bc6df","matchStatusAbandoned":"#da1d1d","matchStatusPost":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"football"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/03/transfer-rumours-mario-balotelli-to-newcastle","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4abk5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jul/03/transfer-rumours-mario-balotelli-to-newcastle","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/03/transfer-rumours-mario-balotelli-to-newcastle"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7b23460448ec78fcf64b8f49eb5df8b247b76801/0_202_3766_2262/3766.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2262,"width":3766,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Is Mario Balotelli really on his way to Newcastle?

Hackers are at large. Either that, or even the most mean-spirited of Englanders are realising that being good at football means having deft feet, strong bodies, clever minds and big hearts. No langers required. That’s quite a liberating discovery for an awful lot of people, and a welcome blow to a lot of awful people.</p> \n<p>Not that England’s women reached the World Cup final last night. They lost to Japan. And a good thing they did, to be frank, because victory would have been undeserved. Not for the valiant players, but for the new followers of the women’s game in England. Glory would have been too easy for them. Just as a couple of trips to the gym aren’t enough to turn around years of slacking and quaffing Suddy Delight by the jerrycan, it takes much more than tuning into a couple of matches to watch England roar to global triumph. It takes several decades of watching – and hoping, wailing and swearing - and even that’s no guarantee. But it’s a step that can’t be skipped. </p> \n<p>So Laura Bassett’s stoppage-time own goal last night was a blessing in disguise, albeit a very convincing disguise, being that it couldn’t have looked crueller if it had been wearing a studded leather balaclava and a bloodthirsty leer. If England had prevailed last night and gone on to beat the USA! USA!! USA!!! in the final, then we all could have tuned back out, satisfied that it could never get better than this. Instead the Lionesses’ painful exit after a heartening campaign leaves us with the tantalising knowledge that English women have the potential to have even more fun, provide even more entertainment, and elevate the whole country even higher – if they start getting as much support as they deserve. This interest in women’s football must not be a summer fling, it needs to be maintained even when .... oooh, look, MANCHESTER UNITED HAVE A NEW AWAY KIT FOR NEXT SEASON!!!</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee5c2557399c78dae47fc8c5ca306efa29220740\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435848121993/9ac50522-bc46-4c47-b7dd-5f96179733ef-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ryan Babel\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Va va voom!</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Eisenhut/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Marco van Basten, June 2006:</strong> “Ryan Babel has all the potential to become the next Thierry Henry.”</p> \n<p><strong>Ryan Babel, July 2015:</strong> “I am very happy to move to Al Ain” – ah. <br /></p> \n<h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> \n<p>“Has the Fiver finally found a winning formula?

In theory. But <strong>Paul Pogba</strong>’s still not left Juventus, and <strong>Manchester City</strong> are still interested. Now it seems someone who knows Paul has had dinner in a fancy restaurant with a couple of people who have an expense account at <strong>Barcelona</strong>, and you know what that means. The capture of <strong>Kevin De Bruyne</strong> from Wolfsburg should soften the blow, but probably won’t. </p> \n<p><strong>Aston Villa</strong> are in the market for Ajax and Denmark full-back <strong>Nicolai Boilesen</strong>. They’ve also thrown the Big Bodyswerve to see off Southampton, West Ham, Crystal Palace and Marseille in the &pound;9m race for Lille midfielder<strong> Idrissa Gueye</strong>. Something of a coup for Villa, that, especially as Saints were able to offer Gueye a guaranteed starting place at Anfield for the 2016-17 season. </p> \n<p><strong>Everton </strong>are going all out for aesthetics. They’ve already landed Gerard Deulofeu and Tom Cleverley, and now they’re going for Internazionale winger <strong>Xherdan Shaqiri</strong> and Napoli wingman <strong>Dries Mertens</strong> too. <strong>Stoke</strong> were interested in Shaqiri, but may turn their attentions to <strong>Yevhen Konoplyanka </strong>instead. The Dnipro winger is already talking to <strong>Atl&eacute;tico Madrid</strong> and <strong>Sevilla</strong>, so Mark Hughes wants to get a wriggle on. </p> \n<p><strong>Robin van Persie</strong> is yesterday’s man at <strong>Manchester United</strong>. This news broke 18 months ago, but the bit about him moving to<strong> Besiktas </strong>is all new. Just to define our terms, “all new” being at least less than one month old. Maybe two months. Meanwhile United have presented Bayern Munich with a “package worth &pound;120m” for striker <strong>Thomas M&uuml;ller</strong>. The Mill very much hopes this is some sort of financial offer, and not Louis van Gaal making another of his grand, emotional gestures utilising the contents of his pocket as a prop. </p> \n<p>More transfer frustration for <strong>Crystal Palace</strong> and <strong>West Ham</strong>, still reeling from Tim Sherwood’s saucy shimmy of a few paragraphs ago. They both want, but are not getting, <strong>Loic Remy</strong>. Palace will console themselves with QPR’s <strong>Charlie Austin</strong>, while the Hammers make do with Dynamo Kiev defender <strong>Aleksandar Dragovic</strong>. </p> \n<p>Life also deals <strong>Southampton</strong>, similarly snubbed in paragraph two, blow after blow. They’re desperate to secure <strong>Toby Alderweireld</strong> on a permanent deal, but their old transfer nemesis <strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong> - kids, think Liverpool, but even less successful - are in with a late bid. </p> \n<p>And that’s your lot for today. Not a bad haul, all told, especially when you consider that the folk who usually make this stuff up are all swanning around Wimbledon, or on a beach somewhere eating oysters from the half shell.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/8/20/1408544538104/Bayern-Munichs-Thomas-Mul-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ina Fassbender/Reuters","altText":"Thomas Muller","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ina Fassbender/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T08:11:18Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T08:54:19Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Scott Murray","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/scottmurray"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Football","Sport","Transfer window"],"tags":[{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"football/transfer-window","webTitle":"Transfer window"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Scott Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/scottmurray"}}],"series":{"title":"Rumour Mill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/series/rumourmill"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/02/football-transfer-rumours-kevin-de-bruyne-manchester-city","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aayc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jul/02/football-transfer-rumours-kevin-de-bruyne-manchester-city","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/02/football-transfer-rumours-kevin-de-bruyne-manchester-city"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/8/20/1408544538104/Bayern-Munichs-Thomas-Mul-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Manchester-bound?

There is an art, we hear, to doing something very right while appearing to get it all wrong, and last season Nigel Pearson was to football management what an angry reincarnation of Les Dawson would be to the piano. So it’s a darn shame that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/30/nigel-pearson-leicester-sacked\">we’ll be denied entertainment like that in the Premier League next season</a>: we can only hope that the job description for the new Leicester City manager includes, in addition to an ability to survive despite an epic winless streak, a knack for escalating innocent collisions into furious throttling and innocent questions into tense and prolonged ostrich-themed interrogations.</p> \n<p>That’s right, Pearson has been sacked by Leicester. He was dismissed last night because, incredibly, “the club believes that the working relationship between Nigel and the board is no longer viable.” Since several hours have gone by and the club has not reversed its decision, it looks like this time Pearson may actually have to clear his desk and take all his belongings to the corrugated iron bunker that the Fiver likes to imagine he lives in, surrounded by a large supply of tinned aubergines, two bazookas and a lightly-thumbed compendium of ornithology. </p> \n<p>Leicester have so far not been very forthcoming about the reasons for the split, referring only to “fundamental differences of perspective”, which the Fiver had long assumed was a given. Perhaps some deep footballing disagreement suddenly emerged between Pearson and Leicester, but all seemed to be looking up on that front, as earlier this week the club showed its intention to build on last season’s great escape by signing the Japanese international striker Shinji Okazaki. </p> \n<p>So in the search for an explanation, minds venture reluctantly back to that despicable film made by three young Leicester players during the club’s goodwill tour to Thailand this summer. All three players, one of whom is Pearson’s son, James, have since been sacked by the club. It is not known at this stage whether that sordid disgrace put intolerable strain on the relationship between Nigel and Leicester’s Thai owners, but it hardly brought them closer. More details will doubtless emerge at some point, but at the moment the end to the essentially good news story of Nigel Pearson at Leicester seems to have been laced with unwelcome nastiness and stupidity, which is sad. We’d almost feel sorry for Pearson Snr if it weren’t for the fact that we know – after he announced it to us all for no particular reason – that he can look after himself. </p> \n<h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT</h2> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Tim Hill in the MBM hot seat for England 1-1 Japan (3-4 pens) in the Women’s World Cup semi-final</a>.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-cc866304-900f-47e6-98f4-0632758a8cc6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435759573220/b362b0bf-82eb-405b-b28e-2eab3bad56d9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"laura bassett\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Day 42 in the Big Brother House.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hewitt - Fifa/FIFA via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“We’ve been together here for six weeks now, working and living with the same people, day-in day-out, it’s like being in the Big Brother house” – except, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/01/england-women-canada-world-cup-big-brother-japan-semi-final\">England defender Laura Bassett</a>, for the fact you haven’t been on the front page of The Daily Star every single day.
