The following year at Royal Ascot Brown Jack triumphed in the first of his six consecutive Queen Alexandra Stakes, the longest race in the Flat racing calendar. His sequence of victories made him one of the most popular racehorses in the history of British racing, and he is described in the meeting’s official guide as “arguably Royal Ascot’s greatest equine legend”. A bronze statue of Brown Jack, by the equestrian painter Sir Alfred Munnings, can be found at Ascot.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ANL/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf786698aa21d5090c0e76796a3fdda1776fda9a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434712244602/e6a7871d-1970-4b53-90ab-d53067449f55-371x480.jpeg\" alt=\"1930 Racegoers walk through a field on their way from the railway station to the Royal Enclosure at Ascot\" width=\"371\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>1930</strong> Racegoers walk through a field on their way from the railway station to the Royal Enclosure at Ascot.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Topical Press Agency/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5ae231db2b50eeb87dfa7cbbc34a56463ca178a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434712573661/973fe844-578c-4b33-977f-3dbc424c89c6-620x400.jpeg\" alt=\"&lt;strong&gt;1931&lt;/strong&gt; Racegoers mingle around the paddock in front of the newly constructed Totalisator.
