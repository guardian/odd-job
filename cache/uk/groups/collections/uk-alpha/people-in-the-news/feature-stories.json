But I got a job in a veterinary clinic and a small woman came in with her golden retriever, and she ended up being my wife. Thirty years later Ben met his wife when their labradors started playing in the park. That’s two generations of the Fogle family who have met their partner courtesy of dogs.</p> \n<p>Initially we enrolled Ben at the <a href=\"http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.lyceefrancais.org.uk/&amp;prev=search\">Lyc&eacute;e Fran&ccedil;aise</a> – we planned to move back to Canada, and thought being bilingual would help him. But he hated French. Also, he was a wimpy kid and was overwhelmed by a school with 2,200 people.</p> \n<p>We had thought he would go to one of the London schools, but he wasn’t academic and went to board at <a href=\"http://www.bryanston.co.uk/\">Bryanston</a>. I worried that he would be taken advantage of, because he has such an altruistic nature. But, unbeknown to us, he joined the rugby team and, doing drama, found he could stand on stage and not be afraid. Bit by bit his confidence came out.</p> \n<p>I remember on a rafting holiday our guide said, “You can jump in, but it’s freezing.” I thought nobody would do it, but Ben jumped straight in.</p> \n<p>When he left school he asked me if he could take a gap year to go and teach in Quito, Ecuador. I thought, “Wow!” He had really grown up. I had always wanted my children to succeed academically, but Ben taught me what’s really important is that they are happy. He has created a life that’s based on his decent humility.</p> \n<p>Despite everything he’s achieved in his writing or on TV, I’m proudest of the type of father he has become. When he and his wife Marina lost their baby last year, it was devastating. But it’s like a soap opera – there are tragedies, but the positives outweigh them.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/gallery/2015/jun/21/heres-to-you-dad-readers-fathers-day-photos-and-stories\">Here's to you, Dad: readers' Father's Day photos and stories</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>HIS STORY <em>Ben Fogle, adventurer, 41</em><br /></h2> \n<p>Dad is Canadian by birth and is very proud of his heritage; he’s never lost his accent and wears plenty of sensible Canadian waterproof boots. Growing up, our life revolved around animals, with all the flashing green lights and the operating table. If I wanted to talk to him – or to get money for going out – I’d have to go into the theatre where he’d be doing a caesarean or an amputation, and pull a fiver out of his back pocket when he wasn’t looking. Growing up with animals teaches you to be responsible.</p> \n<p>He was always very supportive, although he never understood why I would want to go and live on a windswept treeless island [<em>Castaway 2000</em> was the programme that made Ben’s name]. I’ve always respected that he let me follow my own path after he worked so hard to provide an education. Even when I became a hippy, he never said no, though he wanted to sometimes. He has done some TV himself and he doesn’t like it very much, but I’d love to do a programme with him. He’s never been to Africa, and I’m doing a programme about wildebeest. Perhaps I’ll do a pincer movement without telling him.</p> \n<p>He is 71 now and still working, still very active. I’d love him to slow down a bit. It’s a physical job, lifting animals, bending up and down, and his hands look like he has worked in a field his whole life – scars on top of scars. But just as I could never retire from exploring, I can’t see him ever giving up. We’re peas in a pod. He repeats stories, and I’ve noticed it in myself. I don’t think I’m turning into him, but we share many qualities. </p> \n<p><em>In time for Father’s Day, Ben Fogle is championing the Dadpreneur initiative </em><a href=\"http://www.notonthehighstreet.com/pages/dadpreneur\"><em>notonthehighstreet.com/dadpreneur</em></a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434542769384/Ben-Fogle-and-his-dad-Bru-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Two generations of the Fogle family met their partner courtesy of dogs': Bruce Fogle with his son Ben and their labradors.

Is he sure he’s fine to talk media and politics so soon after treatment?</p> \n<p>“I’ve taken most of this week off, I’m off tomorrow and I’m off this evening but there are things that I want to do,” he says in a voice that, for the first 15 minutes at least, sounds clear and relatively strong. In two previous interviews since publication, the BBC’s political editor has talked openly about discovering <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/mar/30/bbc-nick-robinson-successful-op-lung-tumour\">he had a rare form of lung cancer</a> a few months before the general election and the subsequent horror of losing his voice post-surgery.</p> \n<p>He has redefined the idea of a workaholic journalist, convincing doctors that returning to the job he loves was important for his recovery and appearing live on the BBC News at Ten on the eve of the election just 90 minutes after leaving hospital. Besides, the meeting couldn’t be cancelled and he’s keen to talk about politics and the BBC and not just his own health.</p> \n<p>“Hilariously, although it was written as a political book, no one’s really interested in talking about anything other than my voice and cancer. Well, apart from Scotland where they want to talk about the SNP.”</p> \n<p>In a conversation that goes on past the point at which it should stop to rest his voice, Robinson talks about Scotland and the “cybernats” who have subjected him to online abuse as well as the relationship between powerful politicians and the BBC.</p> \n<p>There is a passage in the book which reports that David Cameron issued a veiled threat to the BBC on the campaign trial which was not included in two newspaper serialisations.</p> \n<p>During the incident, which reaches an ailing Robinson from several sources on the campaign bus, the prime minister called a BBC story about something he allegedly told his deputy Nick Clegg “rubbish” before going on to say “I’m going to close them down after the election!”</p> \n<p>Musing on what such a comment might mean, Robinson, 51, writes: “Joke? Expression of frustration? All three? No one could be sure. In a few weeks’ time working out which it was could really, really matter.”</p> \n<p>More than a month later, Robinson says he has “thought quite a lot about” why Cameron said this.</p> \n<p>“I can never see into his mind … but in a way it doesn’t really matter. What really matters is the impact it has on other people. Some people on the bus regarded it as funny but they generally didn’t work for BBC. The people who did [work for the BBC] regarded it as yet another bit of pressure and a sort of sense of ‘don’t forget who’s boss here’.”</p> \n<p>Referring to a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/02/bbc-news-chief-politicians-funding-james-harding\">recent speech by BBC director of news James Harding</a> about pressure on the corporation during the election, Robinson says: “He was careful to say and I would say that there is pressure from all sides. The difference of course is that the prime minister is the prime minister. We didn’t know at the time of course that he would carry on but given that that was a possiblity, given the timing of charter renewal … it’s quite a thing to say.”</p> \n<p>It would not be so important if such a statement were “an isolated incident”, but Robinson talks of comments “dropped into conversations publicly and privately”. There was former culture secretary <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/apr/29/bbc-today-show-debate-very-anti-tory-says-culture-minister-sajid-javid\">Sajid Javid’s remarks about BBC bias</a> before the election and the repeated private references to the imminence of licence fee renewal in comments made by Conservative spokesmen throughout, he says.</p> \n<p>While predicting a “tough negotiation” ahead of charter renewal before the end of 2016, he is sanguine about the corporation’s future. “The Tories’ attitude and Cameron’s in particular is … rather like their attitude to the Church of England; they are delighted it exists and regard it as vital to the fabric of England, but they also find it really annoying.</p> \n<p>“I’ve never met a senior Tory who wants to close down the BBC,” he adds. “I could be proved wrong … [but] I don’t think the BBC will get closed down.”</p> \n<p>A former president of the Oxford University conservative association, Robinson is not making an overtly political point. “This is not unique to the Tories.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, Robinson’s biggest personal bust-ups, detailed in the book, have been with the SNP and Alex Salmond, whom he accuses of “an utterly calculated attempt to put pressure on the week before the referendum” last year.</p> \n<p>The row flared up after his story about RBS’s threats to move out of Scotland. Salmond, then leader of the SNP, attacked Robinson at the start of a press conference which led to a BBC inquiry and Robinson admitting that he could have chosen his words “more carefully”.</p> \n<p>“What everyone was ignoring was that he picked the fight not me, it was a deliberate attempt to wrongfoot and unnerve, if not me, then my bosses in order to alter the coverage.”</p> \n<p>Scotland is a recurring theme in the interview. Relations between the BBC’s main political journalist and the nationalists became so bad during last year’s referendum that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2014/sep/17/scottish-independence-referendum-news-bbc\">he had a bodyguard</a>.</p> \n<p>“This burly bouncer ended up getting the teas and carrying the tripod,” laughs Robinson. “In reality I never felt under threat at all but the BBC were … probably more concerned about my crew getting beaten up than that I might get beaten up, which they probably thought I deserved!”</p> \n<p>Overwhelmed by messages of support from politicians, colleagues and viewers following his diagnosis, Robinson continued to receive online abuse from those he calls “cybernats” - saying it was “karma” or that he had “a Tory tumour”, while “someone who clearly thought he was being marginally more generous said he hoped I would recover and then get run over by a bin lorry. That actually made me cry with laughter.”</p> \n<p>There are signs that Nicola Sturgeon is anxious not to encourage such antipathy. “Every time I am subjected to more cybernattery ... Nicola Sturgeon tweets something really positive. I only mention this to say I’m pleased really.”</p> \n<p>The allegations of bias – whether too English, or too left or rightwing - will continue to be difficult for the BBC in the runup to licence renewal. Does the pressure not make BBC news more likely to toe the line? ”I’ve literally never felt it,” says Robinson, “it can be the opposite as people become bloody-minded about it.”</p> \n<p>Robinson’s early experience working with director general Tony Hall when he was head of news gives him confidence. He was “rock solid” in defence of his journalists, says Robinson. “That previous history as director of news leads me to believe he can withstand pressure.”</p> \n<p>Criticism about his own politics is not reflected in complaints from the Labour party itself, he says. Indeed, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/may/31/nick-robinson-labour-ed-miliband-spin-doctor\">he was sounded out as Labour party spin doctor</a> before the election.</p> \n<p>Yet worried that his student politics were becoming a problem at the last election he asked his BBC bosses and they told him that, when it came to complaints, he was receiving the same number as previous incumbents of the job.</p> \n<p>The difference over the past five years has been social media, he says, and everybody’s ability to check his past on wikipedia.</p> \n<p>“My rather crude pushback on Twitter is that I have been doing the job of journalism for 25 years. People have had a chance to find the evidence they want!” He has continued to work despite chemotherapy and the voice loss he describes as worse than cancer because “it’s not about illness. It’s not about pain. It’s about who I am.”</p> \n<p>“I’m not one of the world’s holiday takers after 15 years as a news junkie and a workaholic,” he admits. “I’m getting used to not waking bolt upright at 6.30 listening to the key news bulletins and checking Twitter front pages. It has been a really odd experience … it’s difficult to adjust to because the body and brain is just programmed to do that.”</p> \n<p>Growing more tired with each round of chemotherapy, he aims to work until the EU summit and the budget in July and “then try to pull up stumps a bit in the summer”. This means going to Suffolk to “drink Adnams”, listening to music, spending more time with the family and reading a few books.</p> \n<p>He struggled over what sort as he never bothers with political biographies, “I read the extracts and that will do.”</p> \n<p>His wife gave him the The Narrow Road to the Deep North about Burma’s infamous ‘death railways’. “Having read about someone with their guts hanging out with diptheria and diarrhoea I thought, “this is not the best way to feel better”, so he switched to latest David Nicholls novel about a marriage collapse. “She probably thought I was trying to tell her something,” he hoots of his wife of 24 years.</p> \n<p>If this had been a normal kind of six months he would now be asked what he will do next, given the reshuffle often expected among political editors after an election. “Who knows? I genuinely don’t know,” he says before laughing, “Guardian political editor I think, Patrick [Wintour]’s been there for a while.”</p> \n<p>With his voice waning, he adds more seriously: “After an election is a moment to pause and think but, to be honest, I’ve got quite a lot of other things to pause and think about first, getting better really. So … watch this space.”</p> \n<h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> \n<p><strong>Age </strong>51</p> \n<p><strong>Education </strong>Cheadle Hulme school; University College, Oxford</p> \n<p><strong>Career 1986 </strong>production trainee, BBC <strong>1993 </strong>deputy editor, Panorama<strong> 1996 </strong>political correspondent, BBC, presenter Weekend Breakfast and Late Night Live, Radio 5 Live <strong>1999 </strong>chief political correspondent, BBC News 24<strong> 2002 </strong>political editor, ITN <strong>2005</strong> political editor, BBC</p> \n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.transworldbooks.co.uk/editions/nick-robinsons-election-notebook-the-inside-story-of-the-battle-over-britains-future-and-my-personal-battle-to-report-it/9780593075180\">Election Notebook: The Inside Story of the Battle over Britain’s Future and my Personal Battle to Report It</a>, By Nick Robinson</em><br /></p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434724202535/Nick-Robinson-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nick Robinson interviews former SNP leader Alex Salmond during the Scottish referendum campaign.

Best known as the reticent partner of the larger-than-life architect <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2011/apr/02/james-stirling-architecture-exhibition-tate\" title=\"\">James Stirling</a>, Gowan was Stirling’s equal in the design of most of their early projects, culminating in the celebrated Engineering Building at the University of Leicester in 1963. But he rarely received the credit he was due; following the duo’s acrimonious split shortly after the building was completed, he worked alone in obscurity.</p> \n<p>Considered to be the first postmodernist building in Britain, the engineering faculty represented a violent shift away from the prevailing functionalist doctrines of the postwar era, instead celebrating dynamic structural feats and forceful geometries, in what became known as the “engineering style”. Steeply raked auditoria thrust out from beneath a pair of glazed towers, as great monolithic wedges clad in red tile, while a crystalline roof sails over the workshop building, like a row of glass Toblerones.</p> \n<p>There is an almost gothic sensibility to the design, with concrete columns ending in fattened haunches, gripping the tower of offices and labs like medieval flying buttresses. Gowan later said one of the inspirations for the startlingly unusual composition was “the Picasso profile with the big eye slapped on the front.”</p> \n<p>The building embodies what Gowan always referred to as “the style for the job”, an idea taken up by the critic Reyner Banham in his review of the project. “The building succeeds because job and style are inseparable,” he wrote. “The character emerges with stunning force from the bones of the structure and the functions it shelters.” It has since been Grade II*-listed and recognised as one of the most influential projects of the period.</p> \n<p>Stirling fell in love with this radical new engineering style, and he was determined to redeploy it in the following commission for the <a href=\"http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/building\" title=\"\">History Faculty Library</a> at the University of Cambridge – against all of Gowan’s protestations. “At Leicester we had found a vocabulary that was recognisably ours … and Stirling was enamoured of it,” Gowan told Ellis Woodman in his 2008 biography, Modernity and Reinvention: The Architecture of James Gowan. “I haven’t changed my opinion that [the Cambridge building] is a most unlikely college library and repeating the aesthetics was unwise.” It has proved famously dysfunctional ever since, overheating in summer and leaking in winter.</p> \n<p>The fierce ideological split over the design saw Stirling and Gowan’s fractious seven-year collaboration finally come to an end in 1963, with Stirling going on to complete the Cambridge history faculty and the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/oxford/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_9081000/9081522.stm\" title=\"\">Florey Building</a> in Oxford in the same manner, followed by a starry trajectory of galleries and museums. Gowan never enjoyed the same success, working on a few small housing projects and some healthcare buildings in Italy later in life.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40799d8db867c22c6c8bb5d80ed88b1478e829d3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434900135434/c50d5c5a-b57c-4b8a-98e2-ff693d95a50e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Structural feats and forceful geometries.

After studying architecture at the Glasgow School of Art, he went to Kingston School of Architecture, in Surrey. He was taught by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/2003/may/09/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Philip Powell</a> of Powell &amp; Moya, where he went on to be briefly employed, working on the winning entry to the <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/Explore/Buildings/SkylonTower.aspx\" title=\"\">Skylon</a> competition for the 1951 Festival of Britain.</p> \n<p>After a period working on Stevenage New Town, he joined Lyons Israel Ellis – mistakenly thinking it was the practice of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6129968.stm\" title=\"\">Eric Lyons</a>, whose Span housing he greatly admired – where he met James Stirling. Together they designed the seminal <a href=\"http://www.themodernhouse.net/past-sales/langham-house-close-richmond-upon-thames-3/history/\" title=\"\">Langham House Close</a> on Ham Common, west London, in 1958, which quickly established the pair as one of the most radical practices of their generation. The boxy brick and concrete creation was hailed by Ian Nairn in 1966 as “the first building in a new tough style which was as much a reaction against well-meaning vacuity as the Angry plays and novels. The fierce but not overbearing yellow brick and exposed concrete still make their protest straight.”</p> \n<p>It had a bluff, forthright feel that also characterised their <a href=\"http://www.msa.mmu.ac.uk/continuity/index.php/2007/08/20/stirlings-preston-housing/\" title=\"\">housing estate in Preston</a>, Lancashire, and Gowan’s later work in Greenwich, south-east London, as well as a house Gowan designed for his brother-in-law on the Isle of Wight. “We were reacting against the older generation,” he said, “setting up a critique of what might be done – a reaction against boredom, plainness and the mechanical nature of contemporary rationalism, of social rationalism and dainty well-produced things.”</p> \n<p>After separating from Stirling, he went on to design what Woodman has described as “the most significant London townhouse of the second half of the 20th century”. The <a href=\"http://www.ajbuildingslibrary.co.uk/projects/display/id/2026\" title=\"\">Schreiber House</a>, built in Hampstead in 1964 for a wealthy furniture manufacturer, stands like a forbidding brick castle from the outside, looking more like a local authority housing block than an opulent villa. But within, the four-storey building opens up to provide a luxurious open-plan world, lined with bespoke fittings in teak and bronze, along with what were the latest mod-cons of warm blown-air and a built-in vacuum cleaner system.</p> \n<p>While Gowan’s buildings often received lukewarm reviews in the press, his biggest influence could be said to be on his students. Teaching at the Architectural Association in London, he mentored Richard Rogers, Peter Cook, of Archigram, and the neo-classicist Quinlan Terry, among many others, a diversity matched by the range of his own work – he would go on to design a second, highly postmodern <a href=\"http://www.ajbuildingslibrary.co.uk/projects/display/id/2047\" title=\"\">Schreiber House, in Chester</a> (1982), and a colourful, toytown bookshop for the Royal College of Art (.</p> \n<p>It was this playful side to Gowan, and his little-known speculative projects, that drew me to meet him in 2011, while researching a series of articles on the weird and wonderful world of animal-shaped buildings. Reaching into the back of a deep drawer in his Notting Hill studio, he pulled out a sketchbook from the 1970s, full of gigantic bird buildings and portly pigs, as well as a giraffe-shaped skyscraper for the Thames at Greenwich Reach, whose long legs were suited to weathering the tidal conditions. For the Millbank housing competition, in 1977, he had sketched out a monumental howling dog, plated in gold, whose construction would have been funded by a massive levy on City bankers.</p> \n<p>“The quality I had in mind was the one that HG Wells describes in The War of the Worlds,” he said. “An object arrives in the middle of an English village and it is pretty fearsome. You can’t see a door. It just lies there smouldering and you are left guessing what it is until the hatch opens a couple of days later. It was that sense of wonder I was aiming for.”</p> \n<p>Gowan married Margaret Barry in October 1944. She died in 2001.

With them, everything she has worked for through her life is also under threat.</p> \n<p>She is <a href=\"http://www.utopialondon.com/page/kate-macintosh\" title=\"\">Kate Macintosh</a>, an architect who, working for local authorities in Southwark, Lambeth, East Sussex and Hampshire, designed buildings for public benefit that were at once bold, original and humane.

For Lambeth, Macintosh designed <a href=\"http://www.utopialondon.com/page/high-density-low-rise-lambeth\" title=\"\">269 Leigham Court Road</a>, sheltered housing for the elderly, which has <a href=\"http://list.historicengland.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1420292\" title=\"\">just been listed</a> as a building of historic and architectural importance. Here, two-storey blocks, spread about a gentle slope and connected by a slowly ascending covered walkway, alternate with planted courtyards and gardens. For East Sussex and Hampshire, she designed schools, fire brigade facilities and more sheltered housing. Finally, in private practice with her husband, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2013/feb/27/george-finch\" title=\"\">George Finch</a>, she created an <a href=\"http://www.architecture.com/RIBA/Awards/RIBANationalAwards/Winners2005/South/WestonAdventurePlayground.aspx\" title=\"\">adventure playground in Southampton</a>.</p> \n<p>Macintosh was raised in Edinburgh, her parents “committed socialists”, her father a project manager for <a href=\"http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200991\" title=\"\">Scottish Special Housing</a>, an association dedicated to providing good quality social housing. She worked in Scandinavia for a while, then for Denys Lasdun on the <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/discover-more/welcome-to-the-national-theatre/the-history-of-the-national-theatre/denys-lasdun%E2%80%99s\" title=\"\">early designs for the National Theatre</a> before, realising that this project would take a long time and impatient for experience of building sites, joining Southwark. Throughout, she believed that “one of the generators of our work was the search for social justice”. Others thought this too: there might have been some colleagues “looking for an easy ride, some careerists looking to move on before the mistakes crop up”, but the councils were “institutions that genuinely tried to meet the needs of their constituents”.</p> \n<p>She later saw such work of this era widely condemned, for forcing people to live in architects’ utopian dreams, and for creating impersonal and alienating places, but “I never reneged”. Which is not to say that Macintosh was uncritical of the work being put up by local authorities in the 1960s. Some of the larger-scale building of estates was “just dreadful… it was treated as an industrial process with no perception of what it is to be a human being”. She criticised the Greater London council’s formula of dividing estates into towers for small families and lower blocks for larger ones.</p> \n<p>A large part of her mission was to counter such sterility. Part of the idea of Dawson’s Heights was that it mixed up different types of home in an ingenious arrangement of interlocking shapes. At the same time there was logic to her decisions. The blocks are tall not only for their spectacular effect, but because the tricky ground conditions required deep foundations, which made height more cost-effective. She then wanted to break up their bulk so they could relate better to the lower houses around. The two main blocks are oriented to make the best use of sunlight, and their highest portions are offset so that they don’t get in the way of each other’s views.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81e21ec06d03299a324535c654efc960a52a8788\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434652562135/3b608225-0519-4f35-b72b-0b6e07ebb464-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Dawson’s Heights in Dulwich, south London, designed when Macintosh was just 28.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dawson’s Heights in Dulwich, south London, designed when Macintosh was just 28.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Grindrod</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Seen from a distance, Dawson's Heights is dramatic; up close it is protective</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The residents of her works seem to appreciate her efforts: when she revisited Dawson’s Heights for the film<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/15858101\" title=\"\"> <em>Utopia London</em></a>, a pastor of Caribbean origin told her that she was a genius. Deirdre Shaw, who lives in the Leigham Court Road development, is campaigning to have it renamed Macintosh Court. “This place is a haven,” she says, and invites me listen to its near-silence, despite the closeness of a road. “Like historic almshouses you have a community, you have gardens around it and you have your cells.”</p> \n<p>She likes the way that Macintosh placed a shop and a common room to encourage people to meet, but also the way that “this is my space. I don’t have to see anyone if I don’t want to.” Her friend Linda Lee agrees: “I like the silence: you’re surrounded by all this green. The fresh air makes you feel so good. I am one of those people who likes solitude, but you can relate as much as you like. You can choose.”</p> \n<p>The construction is plain, what Macintosh called a “restricted range of materials” – concrete block, dark timber, steel railings. It set out to be Lambeth’s first use of coordinated metric dimensions, a concept about which she had “considerable reservations”, but nonetheless gave “a thorough try”. Lee says that “it may not look the greatest thing on the outside, but if you live in it, it works.” Shaw is more positive about the appearance: “The contrast between the trees and birds and gardens and the concrete blocks is really nice: they counterpoint with each other.” Both appreciate the way the open spaces allow their loved ones to roam, Lee’s grandchildren and Shaw’s cat: “It’s pussy paradise,” she says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/15858101\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/15858101\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch a trailer for Utopia London, featuring Kate Macintosh.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Macintosh saw a similar interest in human qualities in the work of Finch, which she first encountered as drawings on the front cover of <em>Architects’ Journal</em>: “I realised he was a fellow spirit before I met him.” Then she contacted Finch, to see if he could give her boyfriend a job. Then they met, and the boyfriend “didn’t last long”. Finch, who died in 2013, was the architect of <a href=\"http://www.utopialondon.com/cotton-gardens\" title=\"\">Cotton Gardens</a>, a development in the London borough of Lambeth of rugged, characterful towers that are now praised by their residents, and low courtyard houses.</p> \n<p>One of these contains the garden in which Macintosh expresses her anger at plans to destroy it, to a gathering of local residents and campaigners against comparable proposals elsewhere in the borough. A similar danger to Shaw and Lee’s homes has been stayed, at least for now, by their listing. What really disgusts Macintosh is the complicity of Labour-run Lambeth in wrecking the legacy that they once created, “their eager cooperation with central government in the process of the privatisation of public assets”, their “sham consultations with residents, which are really exercises in hard-sell and bullying”, their “heartless eviction operations”.</p> \n<p>“I am old enough to remember the postwar Labour government,” she says, “which at a time when the national debt was 245% of GDP rebuilt the country, doubled living standards and established the welfare state and the NHS… If we could do so much in 1945, when the country was technically bankrupt – what might we now achieve with the political will, in building a more just society?”</p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2015/6/18/1434652431764/leigham-court-road-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘A haven’: 269 Leigham Court Road in south London, designed by Kate Macintosh, has just been grade II listed.

Not only is it an incredible storyline, but the shining star is Tilda Swinton: it’s such an incredible thing to do, to speak Italian with a slight Russian tinge, when you’re English. Apart from being amazed the entire time that she was able to do that, I also found it a heartwarming and heartbreaking story: the way that food and love are connected and depicted is very beautiful. Then there’s this incredible sadness at the end, and you get this wrenching feeling.The relationship between her and the maid and with her children – it covers so many family and class issues, and covers them so well. There are parts in it that have a slightly Hitchcocky feeling, especially when she’s walking through the Italian town. The first time I saw it was on a plane, which I then really regretted because it’s so visually stunning. But I’ve watched it a few times since and introduced lots of people to it. I may watch it again this week now that I’ve talked about it.</p> \n<h2><strong>3 | Gig</strong><br /><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2010/nov/21/warpaint-rumer-review-kitty-empire\" title=\"\"><strong>Warpaint</strong></a><strong> at Hammersmith Apollo</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce28a245ab91204b333a40d0aa371cd4b1c035a3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434639300912/03fad028-cc79-4890-abab-fb7ffc760fee-460x297.jpeg\" alt=\"Warpaint, l to r: Emily Kokal, Jenny Lee, Theresa Wayman and Stella Mozgawa\" width=\"460\" height=\"297\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warpaint, l to r: Emily Kokal, Jenny Lee, Theresa Wayman and Stella Mozgawa: ‘Their connection onstage is a joy to watch.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris /the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’ve seen [Los Angeles all-female four-piece] Warpaint live about five times now, and every time they’re better. Stylistically it’s not really the kind of music I listen to, but when I see them live it becomes something completely different for me. Having not been to loads of gigs as a child, especially band gigs – I was more into solo artists, and listening to music in private – I find gigs quite difficult to get really involved with. But with Warpaint I can feel like I’m on my own in a room full of thousands of people. They have this incredible energy, and their connection on stage is a joy to watch. There’s one track on their record I really like called Love Is to Die. I met them in the studio on the last record and we really got on – they’re very funny women.</p> \n<h2><strong>4 | Book</strong><br /><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/shortcuts/2013/dec/02/twelve-years-a-slave-book-inspired-film-solomon-northup\" title=\"\"><strong>12 Years A Slave</strong></a><strong>&nbsp; by Solomon Northup</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b842af3a6f56ab4e5e2fd4b8725e03782414397a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434639567807/08c97d9a-f4ca-4132-b503-f20dd1adb38d-270x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Solomon Northup's 12 Years a Slave: 'It’s amazing to read a memoir from 1863 and connect with it so much.'\" width=\"270\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Solomon Northup’s 12 Years A Slave: ‘It’s amazing to read a memoir from 1863 and connect with it so much.’</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I read this on holiday a couple of years ago, before the film came out. My mother had just read it and passed it on to me. I happened to be in the Caribbean at the time, near lots of sugar plantations, so it felt like the correct environment. I don’t think I’ve ever been so engrossed by anything in my life: it brought me to tears, it made me angry, I wanted to read it again straight away when I finished it. It’s amazing to read a memoir from 1863 and to understand the person writing it so well and connect with it so much. I loved reading it, as well as being very angry and sad. I don’t think the film gets across the weight of these 12 years, so I think anyone interested in that side of history should read the book.</p> \n<h2><strong>5 | Art</strong> <br /><strong>Gerald Laing’s Domestic Perspective</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e93e7d3785c5d1908274f5f16b04582e2de9af3c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434639691446/4c6d8e4f-c61d-49e2-ad58-eea2e8d11f7b-299x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Domestic Perspective by Gerald Laing: 'There's a cheekiness to it.'\" width=\"299\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Domestic Perspective by Gerald Laing: ‘There’s a cheekiness to it.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: oliviaconnelly.com</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pop art has been a huge influence on me – Hockney, Richard Hamilton, Rauschenberg – as you can see from my <em>Trouble in Paradise </em>album sleeve last year. I was at Christie’s a few years ago with a friend; it was quite soon after Amy Winehouse had died, and Gerald Laing also died around that time. I instantly loved this painting and its blocky, bright colours.&nbsp;I spent about an hour deciding whether I was going to buy it, and I did. It’s the only piece of art I own, but it’s hanging in my kitchen and I admire it every single day. There’s this incredible sadness when I look at it, but I also love how there’s a cheekiness to the painting and Amy Winehouse in it.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>6 | Restaurant</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.nonsolovinoltd.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Al Boccon Di’ vino in Richmond</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67c2fcc4f0f597b05b0f5ac397c5e0db2eaeeda2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434640797049/73ca5bb2-715b-46fa-bac8-1be90b673b40-460x329.jpeg\" alt=\"Al Boccon Di Vino in Richmond: one of the nicest afternoons I've had in years.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Al Boccon Di’vino in Richmond: ‘one of the nicest afternoons I’ve had in years’.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’ve only been there once, but it was the best meal I’ve ever had. I got taken there by a friend who I met in the Caribbean. It’s basically a shut-in: you book, you sit down at 1pm and you don’t leave till 5, and there’s no menu. I think we had 12 courses – three different kinds of pasta and 10 different kinds of meat, followed by potatoes and pork – it was quite difficult but I managed to find room for it. There was a blue cheese and pear pasta that was just amazing. It’s a very small restaurant, and because everybody’s in there for the same amount of time, people end up talking and laughing together. Just the best wine and food, and one of the nicest afternoons I’ve had in years.</p>","section":"Culture","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434638174412/la-roux-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Elly Jackson, aka La Roux: 'I may watch I Am Love again this weekend, now I've talked about it.'
