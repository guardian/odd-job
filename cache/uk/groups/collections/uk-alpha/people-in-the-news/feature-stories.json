I will miss the daily kick of a live programme, but you can’t do it forever. I’m 64 next month – I don’t feel anything like 64, but it’s time to move on.”</p> \n<p>Naughtie’s exit, announced on Tuesday, immediately fuelled speculation over his replacement, with Robinson, not yet back on full duties following surgery for lung cancer, believed to be the favourite.</p> \n<p>Should Robinson take the role, his position as the BBC’s political editor is expected to be filled by a woman, with Laura Kuenssberg, chief correspondent and occasional presenter of Newsnight, among the leading contenders.</p> \n<p>Naughtie said he was “a bit emotional” about the decision and said he would miss presenting alongside Humphrys, a fixture on Today since 1987.</p> \n<p>“When you have sat beside someone at four in the morning fairly regularly for 21 years, as John and I have done, you get to know them quite well,” said Naughtie.</p> \n<p>“It’s going to be very odd for the both of us. The same goes for the other presenters, but particularly John. In 21 years we have never had a cross word personally.”</p> \n<p>For his part, Humphrys described Naughtie as “irreplaceable, not just because of his huge knowledge of politics but his ability to cut to the chase in an interview. </p> \n<p>“We all get criticised and Jim has had his fair share of mickey-taking for allegedly long-winded questions, but the point is they were good questions that tested the interviewee.”</p> \n<p>Alongside Naughtie’s achievements, he will inevitably be remembered his slip on air five years ago when he inadvertently replaced the first letter of Jeremy Hunt’s surname with a C.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2010/dec/06/james-naughtie-today-jeremy-hunt\">James Naughtie blames Dr Spooner after renaming Jeremy Hunt</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I expect to get a text from Jeremy Hunt any moment wishing me well,” Naughtie joked on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>As Radio 4’s special correspondent, the BBC said Naughtie would have responsibility for “charting the course of the constitutional changes at the heart of the UK political debate”.</p> \n<p>He will also take on the role of books editor for BBC News, which will include a new book review slot on the Saturday edition of Today. </p> \n<p>He is currently one of five presenters on Today, alongside Humphrys, Sarah Montague, Justin Webb and its most recent recruit, Mishal Husain. The programme draws just over seven million listeners a week.</p> \n<p>Jamie Angus, editor of the Today programme, described Naughtie as an “editor’s dream”, and said the show would “still have plenty of Jim in years to come”.</p> \n<p>He paid tribute to the presenter’s “immense knowledge, skill and range as a live interviewer”, and also his “chronic reluctance to read the correct time, find the weather forecast, or stop a gale of suppressed laughter once he gets going”.</p> \n<p>Naughtie joined Today in 1994 following the death of Brian Redhead. He previously spent six years as presenter of the World at One, after a career in newspapers including a stint as chief political correspondent of the Guardian.</p> \n<p>BBC director general Tony Hall said: “Jim has been the emotional heart of the Today programme for a generation.<br /></p> \n<p>“His persistent and incisive questioning has given millions of listeners a greater understanding of the stories of our time.

And when you aren’t, well, enough.”</p> \n<p>She added: “It’s the science I trust to help me look like me. Nourish and indulge your skin, and show those age spots who’s boss. Grow another year bolder. Look and feel more radiant. Our perfect age is now. So are we worth it?

Age spots appear reduced. Radiance.”</p> \n<p>A press ad featured an image of Mirren’s face with a quote from her that stated “Age is just a number and maths was never my thing!” Text said “Age spots appear reduced. Skin feels nourished with moisture. Complexion looks more radiant.”</p> \n<p>A viewer complained that “post-production techniques” had been used to alter Mirren’s appearance, specifically the lines around her mouth, and claimed the ads misleadingly exaggerated the likely effect that could be achieved by consumers.</p> \n<p>L’Or&eacute;al said it wanted to ensure its depiction of Mirren was in keeping with her public image.

We considered this approach was acceptable so long as the resulting effect was not one which misleadingly exaggerated the effect the product was capable of achieving. </p> \n<p>“With regard to [the TV ad] … We noted that wrinkles were clearly visible on Ms Mirren’s face in both ads, including across her forehead and around her mouth. We considered that the recent press images of Ms Mirren would have reflected a similar degree of professional styling and makeup as the images in the ad, without any post-production amendments, and that her appearance in the ads was comparable to those more candid images. </p> \n<p>“We therefore considered that the ads had not altered Ms Mirren’s appearance in a way that would exaggerate the likely effect that could be achieved by consumers’ use of the product, and concluded that the ads were not misleading.”<br /></p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436261632511/2b3aa87f-14bd-4716-86f3-769ea1df96bf-1020x612.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Screengrab","altText":"Helen Mirren in L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect ad: cleared by the ASA","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Screengrab"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T23:01:01Z","lastModified":"2015-07-08T00:14:21Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Dugald Baird","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/dugaldbaird"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Advertising Standards Authority","Advertising","Media","Helen Mirren","Culture","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"media/asa","webTitle":"Advertising Standards Authority"},{"id":"media/advertising","webTitle":"Advertising"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"culture/helen-mirren","webTitle":"Helen Mirren"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"media"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Dugald Baird","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/dugaldbaird"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"media"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/08/loreals-helen-mirren-ads-cleared-over-airbrushing-claim","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ae73","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/media/2015/jul/08/loreals-helen-mirren-ads-cleared-over-airbrushing-claim","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/08/loreals-helen-mirren-ads-cleared-over-airbrushing-claim"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerEmbed":"<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZPIqfpM3-s\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ZPIqfpM3-s?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Helen Mirren in L’Or&eacute;al Paris Age Perfect ad\n </figcaption> \n</figure>"},"importance":5,"kicker":{"title":"Helen Mirren"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436261632511/2b3aa87f-14bd-4716-86f3-769ea1df96bf-1020x612.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Screengrab","altText":"Helen Mirren in L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect ad: cleared by the ASA","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Screengrab"}}]},{"title":"Shaggy / Isis would pack it in if they listened to reggae and got high","rawTitle":"Isis would pack it in if they listened to reggae and got high","item":{"type":"article","id":"music/2015/jul/08/shaggy-isis-should-listen-to-reggae-and-get-high","title":"Shaggy: Islamic State would pack it in if they listened to reggae and got high","trailText":"Reggae star outlines unconventional strategy for combatting jihadist group Isis","standFirst":"<p>Reggae star outlines unconventional strategy for combatting jihadist group Isis</p>","byline":"Guardian music","body":"<p>Shaggy has announced to the world the secret of defeating the Islamic State, the jihadist group intent on establishing a new caliphate in the Middle East: it is listening to his music and getting high. </p> \n<p>After describing their acts as “crazy shit … horrible”, the reggae star told the <a href=\"http://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/shaggy-shares-his-strategy-for-defeating-isis-7731392\">Miami New Times</a> that he believed the banning of music among certain Islamic sects contributed to the “evil” of Isis. “If you’re able to cut a man’s head off, you’re sick.

The two artists were instantly compared to each other when they reached mainstream success in 2012. They are both black men. They are both in their twenties and are creators of more experimental forms of R&amp;B music. But the similarities stop there. Miguel’s music is more rooted in rock. One listen to The Valley or Face of the Sun, featuring Lenny Kravitz, on Miguel’s new album, Wildheart, should convince audiences of this. The tracks are more indebted to the weird, half-songs of 90s indie rock than the vulnerability woven through Frank Ocean’s work. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/25/miguel-wildheart-review-alexis-petridis\">Miguel: Wildheart review – a genuine one-off finds his signature style</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I wouldn’t say we were friends. To be completely honest – and no disrespect to anyone – I genuinely believe that I make better music, all the way around,” Miguel said. Later, he added: “It’s interesting, but we’ll see who’s in it for the long haul. It’s like a marathon, you know?”</p> \n<p>Miguel didn’t need to say that he made better music than Frank Ocean and a part of me believes he probably didn’t want to, but with a new album released mere weeks before a new Frank Ocean album, Miguel had to say <em>something</em>. The time between when Miguel would maintain the public eye and when our focuses would shift to Frank Ocean in comparison are small. And by keeping the conversation open about the two artists, Miguel is fuelling interest in his own music. </p> \n<p>He later cleared the air after his statements caused an uproar online. “Yes, I am competitive, we ALL have to have a level of confidence and competitiveness to put ourselves on the line day in and day out,” Miguel began. “But I also believe there’s room for all artists.” </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2012/jul/21/frank-ocean-guardian-exclusive-interview\">Frank Ocean: the most talked-about man in music</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Rivalries, regardless of how they reduce artists, still fuel public interest, and most recent major artists have had to engage in controversies surrounding comparisons as a means of keeping themselves in the press and on top. Miguel, as an artist who must navigate his career in the public eye, understands this. But only a small number of artists can take rivalries as opportunities to actually advance their careers. </p> \n<p>Nicki Minaj was able to engage in (and ultimately dismiss) a potential rivalry with Lil’ Kim because it was clear that the Kim we once knew and loved was long gone. And Kim, who largely disappeared from the spotlight due to her arrest and jail sentence, seemed to fuel the chatter of an ultimately unsuccessful rivalry when it mattered most – during the rise of another black female rapper. There is a difference between notoriety and success, and artists engaging in rivalries should be well-equipped to maintain the latter. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"194461072727faf999a7b2111ae3a561533d1475\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/194461072727faf999a7b2111ae3a561533d1475/184_43_1143_1713/667.jpg\" alt=\"Britney: a mere pawn in the rivalry game\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Britney: a mere pawn in the rivalry game.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ACTION PRESS/REX/ACTION PRESS/REX</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Public, press-driven rivalries are largely unfounded in reality. Consider Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Both came out around the same time and both were blonde teenage pop singers, but Aguilera ended up being a much different artist from Spears. Aguilera branched out from the cookie-cutter mold, began writing most of her music and experimented in different genres. Their rivalry, while interesting at the start, was a distraction, at least for Aguilera, from her actual music, and it resulted in endless comparisons, despite growing aesthetic differences. In an even stranger way, it manifested outside of the music too, as when both Aguilera and Spears kissed Madonna at the MTV Video Music Awards, but only Spears made headlines for the act. </p> \n<p>In the same way that we would not compare two different rock bands to each other just because they both perform in the same genre of music, we shouldn’t compare Miguel and Frank Ocean to each other simply because they are both R&amp;B musicians. It is lazy. It reduces the musicians to quick talking points – alternative, indie, experimental – without looking closely at the kind of music they’re actually making. For Miguel, it’s an interesting merger of rock and pop and yes, R&amp;B.</p> \n<p>In 2015, artists are no longer individuals. Instead they are products of consumption to compare and ultimately, to dismiss. It comes as no surprise, then, that Miguel is upset about the comparison and has put both Ocean and other people’s opinions on blast. Although he is not explicitly asked to compare himself to Frank Ocean, Miguel speaks about their similarities and differences, seemingly throwing down the gauntlet as a means of establishing his musical identity in the public eye. </p> \n<p>Although manufactured rivalries might spark greater visibility among the public, they often distract from the music itself. There are of course exceptions to the rule – the Rolling Stones and the Beatles’ public rivalry never overshadowed the depth of their music, but that was likely because their music was impossible to ignore in the first place. Theirs was a rivalry that inspired greatness. Can most rivalries actually say the same? And few could forget the very intense, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/07/nme-smash-hits-reading-magazines-free\">very manufactured</a> rivalry between Britpop superstars Blur and Oasis of the mid 90s. But most “artistic” rivalries as we look at them in 2015 are merely marketing distractions meant to keep the conversation going in case it disappears altogether. They are cheap and boring and probably say little about the music. And in the end, what’s actually riveting about that?</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5349547f13ef6956e5410546b94b8a0bbb333d9b/0_0_2553_1536/2553.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1536,"width":2553,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty Images","altText":"Miguel and Frank Ocean\nGuardian composite","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/194461072727faf999a7b2111ae3a561533d1475/184_43_1143_1713/1143.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1713,"width":1143,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Britney: a mere pawn in the rivalry game.

In fact, his whole career seems to have emerged through a haze of cigar smoke and cocktails: he tended to favour the nostalgic, the old-fashioned, the sort of thing you can imagine being discussed in studio back offices by an earlier generation. In the 70s, when Weintraub began to make his mark in the film business, Hollywood was a wild west: the old studio system had collapsed, the old certainties had disappeared, new and strange forms of cinema had appeared – from the counterculture, from the B-movie ecologies of sex and horror. Weintraub was a graduate of the mailroom at William Morris agency, the kind of place where ambitious wannabes steamed open their bosses’ letters, before talking himself into an junior agent’s job at the MCA talent agency. It was the classic favour-for-a-favour route, and Weintraub ended up promoting successful concert tours in the 70s with the likes of Presley, Sinatra, Bob Dylan and John Denver: unhip but remunerative acts that allowed Weintraub to cross over into TV and other media. In fact, it was via Denver that Weintraub really got into the moving-image business, via a string of TV specials, and it was his louche, music-industry background that no doubt eased the path to his joining forces with Robert Altman for Weintraub’s first movie credit: legend has it they bonded over a joint, and Weintraub ended up getting the $2m backing for Altman’s 1976 country-music epic Nashville.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2002/feb/01/artsfeatures\">Swingers: the incredible allure of the Rat Pack</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In fact, Nashville, with its ironic tone and rambling structure, was not especially typical of the projects Weintraub sponsored. His next film was the John Denver vehicle, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEbM3tjV-3Y\">Oh God!</a>, with crotchety Borscht belt comic George Burns. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn31G2SHkVE\">Cruising</a>, directed by William Friedkin, the notorious gay serial killer film was a mis-step; it was an unlikely brush with gruesome thrillerdom that Weintraub never repeated.

Through all this Weintraub endlessly promoted his friendship with President George HW Bush (Weintraub’s wife Jane Morgan had been a girlfriend of Bush’s) and to some extent explains his survival as a Hollywood player during the bad times.</p> \n<p>Amazingly, Weintraub’s indefatigable attraction to backward-looking properties came up trumps with the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imm6OR605UI\">Ocean’s Eleven</a> series: a remake of the 60s heist film starring – yes – Frank Sinatra. By the early 00s, retro was in, and Weintraub could forget about another embarrassment: the feature film version of British TV spy show The Avengers, starring Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman, which completely failed to catch fire. But, led by an effervescent George Clooney, and orchestrated by a resurgent Steven Soderbergh, Ocean’s Eleven worked brilliantly; pitched at just the right level between slick hi-tech film-making and pre-Mad-Men Rat Packism. </p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-409224132__\n</div> \n<p>Ocean’s Eleven, and its two sequels, Twelve and Thirteen – sequels were a very Weintraub preoccupation – were huge worldwide hits, and put him back in the game. He had one more fantastic retro hit in him, the Soderbergh-directed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2013/jun/09/behind-candelabra-review-philip-french\">Behind the Candelabra</a>, which distilled the Vegas era in all its camp glory. Notoriously, neither Weintraub nor Soderbergh could get studios to back the film, supposedly because of its gay subject-matter; shamefully for Hollywood, TV operation HBO had to step in, a decisive changing-of-the-guard moment in the struggle between the small and big screens. At the same time, Weintraub’s franchising, money-chasing instincts led him to participate in the Karate Kid remake featuring Will Smith’s son; it dumped karate in favour of kung fu, presumably to get Chinese producers onside, and Weintraub refused to change the title. It was a mess. And in between the two he got his pal George Bush his own HBO documentary, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bUM6jgRUUA\">41</a>.
