Estelle, the author, is a 17-year-old from Aberdeen. So how did she do it?</p>","byline":"Estelle Maskame","body":"<p>I’ve always loved the satisfaction of having people read a story I wrote. All throughout school, there was nothing I enjoyed more than my teachers reading stories I’d scribbled down on scraps of paper, but by the age of 11, I was writing full-length novels alone in my room, storing them on my laptop, where no one else ever laid eyes on them. Yet I felt I was missing out on that excitement of hearing someone’s feedback, of finding out that someone had enjoyed what I’d written. It didn’t feel the same without sharing.<br /></p> \n<p>Eventually I decided that I needed a way to show my work to people. I’d left primary school and wasn’t comfortable enough to show it to any teachers at my new academy yet, and I was too embarrassed to show my parents and friends. One night, I did some research online and came across some writing websites where people could post their work and give each other feedback. At first, I was slightly apprehensive. There were a lot of people on these websites, of all different ages and nationalities, and I wasn’t sure if these strangers would like my writing or not. I was worried any negative comments would discourage me, but I thought I’d give it a shot anyway, and at the age of thirteen, back in 2010, I started posting my writing online.<br /></p> \n<p>I gained a few readers over time on the writing website that I was using, and I was content with the 50 or so that I had. Gaining instant feedback and hearing people’s comments on my work after posting a new chapter definitely helped motivate me to keep writing. It was nice knowing that there were people waiting to know what happened next.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e6c2198d0c33f7f9ad6325830fa232692a1b892\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435065217673/62f410e7-dcb1-4bdf-87dd-d9b7518a6f54-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"DIMILY 3 covers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The whole DIMILY trilogy has been written before publication of the first book next week.

And so during 2012, a year after DIMILY had been online, I decided to ask some of these Twitter friends to read my work. I’d never synced Twitter and my writing until then, but I gradually began to realise that using social media to promote my work could potentially be extremely beneficial.<br /></p> \n<p>These couple of friends agreed to read my work, and they loved it. All it took was for them to tweet about DIMILY a few times, and then I had people asking, “What’s DIMILY? Where can I read it?” I jumped at the chance to send these curious people the link, and they’d read it and tweet about it too. It was like a snowball effect. The more people tweeted about it, the more people wanted to read it, and the more people read it, the more people tweeted about it and so on.<br /></p> \n<p>Around the same time, I discovered <a href=\"https://www.wattpad.com/signup\">Wattpad</a>. It’s the largest online writing community by far and it was absolutely daunting at first, but I posted what was written of DIMILY so far. I let my readers on Twitter know that I’d moved websites, so I instantly had readers who bumped up the read count from the moment I posted it. Wattpad has millions of users and the hits started racking up quickly. I posted my work on Wattpad but promoted it on Twitter, directing people back to Wattpad.<br /></p> \n<p>Before I knew it, I had people tweeting me asking when I’d be posting the next chapter, people discussing the latest chapter with each other and others simply freaking out. I’d let people know what date and time the next chapter would be posted, and in the lead-up to it I’d post sneak peeks and hints about the chapter to get them excited. The hour before I was due to post a chapter, my mentions on Twitter were always full of people waiting and counting down, so the moment a chapter went up, everyone was reading it at the exact same time. Everyone would live-tweet their reactions while reading and would often discuss the chapter for hours after it was posted. </p> \n<p>This grew into what we called “update nights”, which really helped to motivate and inspire me to keep going. I never wanted to let my readers down by making them wait too long or by producing sloppy chapters, so it encouraged me to work harder so that it was worth it for them. People would create accounts dedicated to the novels. People even made fan trailers on YouTube. Sometimes we’d even come together to make trends, such as #DIMILYmemories, where everyone tweeted their favorite chapters, scenes or quotes from the books.<br /></p> \n<p>Using social media to promote my work means that I’ve got a close connection with my readers, especially now, because they’ve been with me since the early days. In a way, we’re all in this together, and ever since the start, I’ve always loved going on Twitter to interact with them. They love the books so much that they even help me promote it. Twitter also has an amazing community of other aspiring writers and book bloggers. It’s incredible the way people across social media can interact simply because of our love for writing and reading.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4acae58845daa6da31891c30e345af37f13c6372\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435065103196/c89785bb-a2cd-460a-a659-5be751c6495d-274x420.jpeg\" alt=\"DIMILY\" width=\"274\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So I ended up with four million hits on Wattpad. This soon caught the interest of the media, who were curious about all the commotion on Twitter. They began to write articles about the small-town Scottish teenager who was writing online. I did interviews and even appeared on TV, which felt insane, but it only got better. Black &amp; White Publishing came into the picture, and in December, I signed a book deal for my trilogy.</p> \n<p>Trending on Twitter? Most definitely my way into publishing. <br /></p> \n<p><strong>B</strong><strong>ook 1 of Estelle Maskame’s DIMILY series <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/313152/\">Did I Mention I love You is available from The Guardian bookshop</a>.

At the start of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Harry leaves his family behind for good - his cousin Dudley shakes his hand, his uncle Vernon roars “I thought we were on a tight schedule”, and his aunt gives him a final look. Rowling writes in the novel that “for a moment Harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him: she gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with a little jerk of her head, she bustled out of the room after her husband and son.”</p> \n<p>In her new piece for Pottermore, Rowling describes the Dursleys as “reactionary, prejudiced, narrow-minded, ignorant and bigoted; most of my least favourite things”, and says that she wanted to suggest that “something decent (a long-forgotten but dimly burning love of her sister; the realisation that she might never see Lily’s eyes again) almost struggled out of Aunt Petunia” during the final farewell, “but that she is not able to admit it, or show those long buried feelings”.</p> \n<p>Despite disappointment from some readers, Rowling writes on Pottermore, she believes that Petunia behaves in the novel “in a way that is most consistent with her thoughts and feelings through the previous seven books”.</p> \n<p>Petunia Dursley, the sister of Harry’s mother, and her husband Vernon take their nephew in when his parents are murdered, raising him alongside their own son Dudley, but forcing him to live in the cupboard under the stairs. Writing on Pottermore, Rowling explains how their cruel treatment dates back to Petunia’s jealousy of her sister Lily’s magical abilities when they were growing up, and Vernon’s dislike of anything out of the ordinary.</p> \n<p>“Vernon was apt to despise even people who wore brown shoes with black suits,” writes Rowling, so he was unimpressed to discover the existence of Petunia’s witch sister Lily.</p> \n<p>When Petunia and Vernon first met Lily’s boyfriend James, the couples fell out, Rowling reveals. Vernon attempted to patronise James by suggesting that wizards live on unemployment benefit, and grew angry when James told him of the solid gold his parents had in the wizarding bank Gringotts. They never made up, Vernon describing James as “some kind of amateur magician” and choosing not to attend the Potters’ wedding. </p> \n<p>When a letter arrived from Dumbledore with news of the Potters’ murder, Petunia “felt she had no choice” but to take Harry in, but did so grudgingly, writes Rowling, “and spent the rest of Harry’s childhood punishing him for her own choice”. Vernon’s dislike of Harry, she adds, “stems in part, like Severus Snape’s, from Harry’s close resemblance to the father they both so disliked”.</p> \n<p>Rowling also reveals where the characters’ names came from – Vernon being “a name I never much cared for”, and Petunia “the name that I always gave unpleasant female characters in games of make believe I played with my sister, Di, when we were very young”. </p> \n<p>The surname Dursley, meanwhile, is drawn from the Gloucestershire town of the same name, not far from where Rowling was born.</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435140321156/f5895850-8ea4-4c0b-baeb-039f444005a3-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Allstar/Warner Bros","altText":"The film of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-24T10:21:57Z","lastModified":"2015-06-24T10:57:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":282,"contributors":[{"name":"Alison Flood","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/alisonflood"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Harry Potter","JK Rowling","Books","Culture","Children and teenagers","Fiction"],"tags":[{"id":"books/harrypotter","webTitle":"Harry Potter"},{"id":"books/jkrowling","webTitle":"JK Rowling"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"books/booksforchildrenandteenagers","webTitle":"Children and teenagers"},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction"}],"section":{"id":"books"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Alison Flood","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/alisonflood"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"books"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jun/24/jk-rowling-reveals-history-dursleys-harry-potter","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a499","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/books/2015/jun/24/jk-rowling-reveals-history-dursleys-harry-potter","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/24/jk-rowling-reveals-history-dursleys-harry-potter"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435140321156/f5895850-8ea4-4c0b-baeb-039f444005a3-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Awkward relations ...

In 2010 he released Last Orders at the Journey’s End, followed by a live album recorded in Ireland in 2012 called Live at Croc an Oir.</p> \n<p>His final release, Songs of Exile, Love &amp; Dissent, came out this year, and was well received. His music showed traces of Christy Moore, Van Morrison and the Northern Irish band The Divine Comedy, but he had a style and voice that was unmistakably his own.</p> \n<p>Born in Coventry to Irish parents, Patrick and Ann (nee Behan), Rich moved to Ireland aged 10 when his parents eventually returned to their home country. He was educated at Carnew secondary school in County Wicklow, and we met each other in 1991 while we were studying as 18-year-olds at the Institute of Technology Carlow. Rich hadn’t even picked up a guitar in any serious way at that point, but was just on the brink of discovering literature and music.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTkyHTVDbgc\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RTkyHTVDbgc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Rich McMahon: a selection of clips from recent shows \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He qualified in accountancy and we moved together to Birmingham in 1995 to look for employment. He subsequently worked in finance positions for British Gas and Cadbury, as well as on a number of contract jobs, and was employed in a finance role at a sawdust factory when he finally decided to try music full-time in his 30s.</p> \n<p>Driven by a passion to write, play and share his music, it was his dream to make a living from doing so, and happily it was something he managed with great success. As an added bonus, his musical career also gave him the time to gain a first-class degree in English literature from the Open University.</p> \n<p>Rich’s songs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voMnfWRTGR4\">addressed themes of identity and borders</a>, the personal and the political, the mythical and the real. His mixed-media shows, The Imagined Nation and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpK5WUuMFMY\">Beyond Borders</a>, garnered praise for their variety, insight and humour. But it was as a live performer that Rich really came into his own, and he found himself bridging the generations, sharing a stage over the years with upcoming performers such as The Young Folk, Dan Walsh and Bellowhead’s Sam Sweeney, as well as veterans such as Davey Arthur, Martin Stephenson and the Dubliners’ Se&aacute;n Cannon.</p> \n<p>He also used his music to help others, often playing for free in aid of organisations such as Shelter, Crisis, the Moseley Day Centre and the Irish mental health charity Shine. Rich himself had been managing his mental health for most of his adult life, something that came as a surprise to people who knew him mainly as a fun-loving, outgoing performer. Rich was in his usual good form right up to the end, doing a storming support slot for Police Dog Hogan in Birmingham shortly before his death.</p> \n<p>He is survived by myself, by his three sisters, Sam, Sarah and Laura, and by his mother and father.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435165792596/a458aa24-ffaf-4fef-afb5-bd716a9fe114-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":279,"width":465,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Public Domain","altText":"Rich McMahon, who has died aged 42","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Public Domain"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-24T17:30:27Z","lastModified":"2015-06-24T19:01:55Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Music","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"Other lives","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/theguardian/series/otherlives"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/24/rich-mcmahon-obituary","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a4qm","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jun/24/rich-mcmahon-obituary","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/24/rich-mcmahon-obituary"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435165792596/a458aa24-ffaf-4fef-afb5-bd716a9fe114-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":279,"width":465,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rich McMahon was performing until shortly before his death, with a live gig in Birmingham","credit":"Public Domain","altText":"Rich McMahon, who has died aged 42","cleanCaption":"Rich McMahon was performing until shortly before his death, with a live gig in Birmingham"}},"importance":4,"kicker":{"title":"Other lives"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435165792596/a458aa24-ffaf-4fef-afb5-bd716a9fe114-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":279,"width":465,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Public Domain","altText":"Rich McMahon, who has died aged 42","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Public Domain"}}]},{"title":"Doom / Hip-hop's great pretender poised for another reinvention","rawTitle":"Hip-hop's great pretender poised for another reinvention","item":{"type":"article","id":"music/2015/jun/24/doom-hip-hops-great-pretender","title":"Doom: hip-hop's great pretender poised for another reinvention","trailText":"The mysterious rapper is rumoured to be returning to the stage, but is the exiled artist merely pulling our chain? <strong>Ben Westhoff</strong> asks if we should be preparing for the return of hip-hop’s great masked hope","standFirst":"<p>The mysterious rapper is rumoured to be returning to the stage, but is the exiled artist merely pulling our chain? <strong>Ben Westhoff</strong> asks if we should be preparing for the return of hip-hop’s great masked hope</p>","byline":"Ben Westhoff","body":"<p>For much of the last decade MF Doom was the great indie rap hope, the man who would save us from lazy metaphors and cliched similes. Three of his mid-noughties albums, Madvilliany (with Madlib), Mm..Food, and The Mouse and the Mask (with Danger Mouse), are about as intelligent and fun as rap can be. That’s why his fans remain devoted, and were likely excited by a pair of announcements this week: that he would debut music with Ghostface Killah at <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/60040-ghostface-and-doom-to-debut-new-music-via-star-trek-inspired-performance/\">Miami’s III Points Festival</a> in October, and that, further, their collaborative <a href=\"http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.34356/title.ghostface-killah-doom-to-premiere-new-music-later-this-year\">DOOMStarks album</a> is on the horizon.<br /></p> \n<p>But with all due respect, if you believe that, I’ve got a copy of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/27/dr-dre-2-night-kendrick-lamar-jeremih-detox?CMP=share_btn_tw\">Detox to sell you</a>. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2012/aug/16/doom-key-to-the-kuffs\">Doom: 'It's all new, all fun'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If you read the small print, you’ll see that Doom will not actually be appearing in person in Miami. That’s because he’s not allowed in the US (more on that in a minute). His slated “one-of-a-kind, interactive performance” sounds suspiciously like a live feed, the kind consultants use for conference calls. And as for DOOMStarks, that has supposedly been in the works since at least 2008 (when it was called <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ghostdoom\">GhostDoom</a>). An insider I talked to with knowledge of the project said that, if we ever see it, it won’t be anytime soon. Same with the perennially discussed new Madvillain project. </p> \n<p>Doom has long behaved like a man in the witness protection program, or, as he’d characterise it, like a super villain. Born Daniel Dumile, he came up as Zevlove X with New York-based, 3<sup>rd</sup> Bass affiliates KMD. (<a href=\"#imgrc=eunKXhkKe5zTIM%253A%3By0x-Eju8sfo-GM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252F41.media.tumblr.com%252Ftumblr_ls02lp3Ngv1qh9on4o1_1280.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Femperorbohe.com%252Fpost%252F89277700861%252Fpete-nice-of-3rd-bass-easy-e-zev-love-x-aka%3B1280%3B870&amp;usg=__NYJ-8gnq2-fPwI9rx9BKyBQZT6k%3D\">Here’s</a> a rare picture where you can actually see his face; to the right of Pete Nice, Eazy-E, and Dr Dre.) But after the death of his brother DJ Sub-Roc he retreated underground, only to return as MF Doom on his 1999 breakout Operation: Doomsday. </p> \n<p>By the next decade he was living in a secret location outside Atlanta somewhere – rumoured to be a farm – and wouldn’t be photographed without his trademark Gladiator mask. It was a good gimmick, and the backpackers ate it up. It also helped that the music was amazing. Specialising in clever-yet-poignant slices of life and pop cultural dicing, he had a much-venerated run using a number of different aliases (King Geedorah, Viktor Vaughn) on a series of indie labels (Stones Throw, Nature Sounds, Rhymesayers).</p> \n<p>No one could have predicted how quickly his career would stagnate; amid health scares and <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/music/from-madvillain-to-milli-vanilli-6424436\">(quite believable) accusations</a> that he was no longer appearing at his own concerts, his output slowed, and then around the turn of the decade Doom as we knew him was gone. Literally. Following a European tour he was refused entry into the US, and has been residing in London – the city where he was born – ever since. “Do I have a green card? I don’t know about that shit,” he told the Guardian in 2012. Sure, it sucked to be away from his wife and kids, he added, but it wasn’t all bad. In his new home he had even greater anonymity. </p> \n<p>In the 2000s he’d been as prolific as Tupac, which is part of the reason he’s still managed to put out albums in recent years, on London-based Lex Records. He had an all-star list of collaborators for 2009’s <a href=\"http://clatl.com/cribnotes/archives/2009/03/25/mf-dooms-new-album-is-fucking-ridiculous\">Born Like This</a> (Raekwon and Ghostface guest spots, plus J Dilla beats), as well as 2012’s Key to the Kuffs (Thom Yorke, Damon Albarn, Beth Gibbons), with producer Jneiro Jarel. How exactly all these snippets and contributors came together is a mystery along the lines of how <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/apr/29/gucci-mane-rap-music-surge\">Gucci Mane</a> records so much in jail, but the work was solid, if not his best. But the same could not be said of Doom’s most recent work, last year’s NehruvianDoom, with 18-year-old rapper Bishop Nehru. Doom was responsible for the beats on that one, some of which were leftovers from many moons ago, and his sparse verses barely had a pulse. </p> \n<p>What’s next for Doom? Clearly he doesn’t have the work ethic and/or inspiration that he once did. That’s understandable, and happens even to artists who aren’t estranged from the life they know.

Despite his unflamboyant nature – he could never be accused of courting publicity – he achieved unexpected distinction on two counts. First he appeared on a Bank of Scotland &pound;50 note celebrating “arts and culture”. Second, he featured in the acknowledgments of a Jilly Cooper novel, Appassionata, where he is described as “darkly urbane and charismatic”. Researching the world of classical music for her book, Cooper had spent a congenial week with Weller and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra on tour in Spain.</p> \n<p>Weller had begun his career as a violinist, having studied with Ernst Moravec and Franz Samohyl at the Music Academy in Vienna. He was born in the city to Anna and Walter senior, also a violinist, and at the age of 17 followed him into the Vienna Philharmonic, rising rapidly to occupy the seat of Konzertmeister, which he retained from 1961 to 1969, in conjunction with Willi Boskovsky. During the same period he was also achieving renown with his own Weller Quartet, which he had founded in 1958, continuing to play and record with them for over 10 years.</p> \n<p>But even while performing as a chamber and orchestral violinist, he was making the transition to the conductor’s podium. He had already learned the craft as assistant to Karl B&ouml;hm and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2008/aug/06/classicalmusicandopera.germany\" title=\"\">Horst Stein</a> (later he was also to receive coaching from George Szell and Josef Krips), and when the opportunity came to stand in as conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic at short notice for first B&ouml;hm and then, a few weeks later, for Krips, he seized it. For the B&ouml;hm concert he learned Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony and Schubert’s Ninth by heart in two hours, proceeding to conduct the concert from memory. He created a similarly favourable impression accompanying Claudio Arrau in Brahms’s First Piano Concerto in the second concert and it was not long before he was offered a conducting contract by the Vienna State Opera. In 1971 he was appointed general music director in Duisburg, north-west Germany, and from 1975 to 1978 was music director of the Tonk&uuml;nstler-Orchester of Vienna.</p> \n<p>Then came a succession of appointments to British orchestras: the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic (1977–80), the Royal Philharmonic (1980–85) and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra (1992-97). With those he became a familiar figure on the British orchestral scene, focusing on music of the Austro-German mainstream and Russian symphonies (especially Prokofiev, Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov), with occasional forays into Czech repertoire (Suk, Smetana and Jan&aacute;ček).</p> \n<p>Given his background, it is perhaps not surprising that Weller’s music-making, as both violinist and conductor, should be characterised by the well-upholstered string sound traditional in Vienna. The Haydn and Mozart recordings of the Weller Quartet, distinctive for the sweet tone of the first violin, were smooth and polished, to the extent that they often lacked vivacity. Their Beethoven, however, could be more demonstrative, even explosive.</p> \n<p>With his orchestras, too, Weller liked to construct a firmly based sound that was richly textured in the Viennese style. Placing first and second violins together on his left, with cellos and basses on his right, he made few concessions to historically informed practice. Sometimes roseate memories of tradition seemed to lead him astray, as in his inordinately sluggish recording of Richard Strauss’s Four Last Songs, with Catarina Ligendza and the Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra. But the warm, refined Viennese quality of playing by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in his cycle of Beethoven symphonies, enhanced by the full, glowing recorded sound provided by Chandos, made the set outstanding in sonic terms at the time (1989).</p> \n<p>The set also included recordings of Weller in rehearsal and of the realisation by Barry Cooper of Beethoven’s sketches for the first movement of a Tenth Symphony. The feeling for ensemble and the technical control demonstrated in this set – pianissimos were particularly remarkable – earned it approbation, even if it posed no serious challenge to the finest available.</p> \n<p>Also praised was his disc of Mendelssohn’s Italian and Scottish symphonies with the Philharmonia Orchestra, which projected vitality as well as amiability. A Prokofiev set for Decca, begun with the London Symphony Orchestra and continued with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, was accomplished and well executed, even if the abrasiveness of Prokofiev’s orchestral writing was played down.</p> \n<p>After his tenures with the orchestras in London, Liverpool and Glasgow, he spent periods with the Basel Opera, the Valencia Orchestra, the National Orchestra of Belgium and the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra. His forays into opera, which included Strauss’s Ariadne auf Naxos and Wagner’s Der Fliegende Holl&auml;nder for English National Opera, did not lead to prestigious engagements elsewhere. Returning latterly to the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, where he remained conductor emeritus, he was well known locally for his insistence on occupying the same hotel room for 20 years: it was in the Hilton in Great Western Road, Glasgow.</p> \n<p>He married Elisabeth Samohyl (“Sisi”), the daughter of one of his teachers, in 1966. He is survived by her and their son.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Walter Weller, conductor and violinist, born 30 November 1939; died 14 June 2015</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435162960048/03d1c083-3682-4c1e-b15b-5beb58448547-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter John for the Guardian","altText":"Walter Weller conducting","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter John for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-24T17:07:00Z","lastModified":"2015-06-24T17:07:50Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Barry Millington","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/barry-millington"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Classical music","Music","Culture","Vienna Philharmonic","Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra"],"tags":[{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","webTitle":"Classical music"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"music/vienna-philharmonic","webTitle":"Vienna Philharmonic"},{"id":"music/liverpool-philharmonic-orchestra","webTitle":"Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Barry Millington","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/barry-millington"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/24/walter-weller","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a4zx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jun/24/walter-weller","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/24/walter-weller"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435162960048/03d1c083-3682-4c1e-b15b-5beb58448547-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Walter Weller began his career as a violinist but made the transition to the conductor’s podium.
