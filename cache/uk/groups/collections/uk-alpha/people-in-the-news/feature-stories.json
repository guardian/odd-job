Has her fight against inequality made her too many enemies?","byline":"Chitra Ramaswamy","body":"<p>Another week, and another Silicon Valley-sized maelstrom. Ellen Pao, chief executive of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/technology/reddit\" title=\"\">Reddit</a>, the social news forum that bills itself as the front page of the internet (but is increasingly known for misogyny and porn), is under fire again. This time it follows the sudden departure of a popular employee at the site, which prompted volunteer moderators<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jul/03/reddit-ama-victoria-taylor-subforums-shut-down-protest-sacking\" title=\"\"> to shut down hundreds of communities – sorry, subreddits – in protest</a>. Reddit has been thrown into chaos and, although <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jul/04/reddit-subforums-ellen-pao-explains\" title=\"\">Pao has apologised for “letting down” users</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/ellen-k-pao-step-down-as-ceo-of-reddit-inc\" title=\"\">petition calling for her removal</a> – set up earlier this year by members unhappy at the company’s attempts to ban communities for harassing behaviour – has gained more than 100,000 signatures over the weekend.</p> \n<p>Why is the world so angry with Pao? Could it be because she is a woman in a position of power or is it infinitely more complicated? It goes back to the sex discrimination lawsuit that Pao brought against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, Caufield and Byers in March. The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/13/ellen-pao-gender-lawsuit-silicon-valley\" title=\"\">landmark trial that captivated Silicon Valley for a month</a> included details about all-male ski trips and Valentine’s gifts, and prompted former employees at Twitter and Facebook to file similar suits. In the process, Pao’s personal life, work habits, and emails were raked through the court. She was accused of being aggressive, timid, greedy, manipulative, and so on. You could say that the courtroom isn’t so different to the boardroom. Even though she lost – the jury sided with Kleiner Perkins’s case that Pao was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/27/ellen-pao-loses-landmark-sexual-discrimination-lawsuit\" title=\"\">“divisive and not a team player”</a> – the case shone a light on the lack of diversity in Silicon Valley.</p> \n<p>Since the trial, Pao has become either the <a href=\"http://www.returnofkings.com/67110/reddit-melts-down-due-to-incompetent-feminist-ceo-ellen-pao\" title=\"\">reckless CEO intent on destroying the freedom of the internet</a>, or the tech generation’s figurehead for speaking out against gender discrimination in the workplace, depending on who you talk to. “If I’ve helped level the playing field for women and minorities in venture capital, then the battle was worth it,” she told reporters outside the courtroom back in March. Her move to Reddit, at first glance, seemed incongruous. Maybe that was the point. After taking on Silicon Valley, where only 4% of senior investing partners at venture capital firms are women, could it be that Pao wanted to clean up what some regard as the biggest online mess of them all? Reddit, as well as being a breeding ground for memes and gifs, has a reputation, sometimes hard to square with site users used to its different face, for being <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/12/reddit-can-ceo-ellen-pao-clean-up-the-mess\" title=\"\">a toxic, misogynistic community</a>. A Chinese-American feminist in charge? That’s really interesting.</p> \n<p>It’s worth noting one complication: the employee fired by Reddit is a woman. But Pao was already in the limelight, and has a reputation for taking on sexual discrimination. In the six months since she has been in post, Pao has <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/04/06/ellen-pao-on-reaction-to-kleiner-case-workplace-sexism-and-running-reddit-qa/?mod=ST1\" title=\"\">removed negotiating – over cash salaries and equity – from Reddit’s recruitment process</a> because she felt men benefited more than women. “It’s an opportunity for me to try to put in things that I think are going to create this equal opportunity environment for everyone,” she said. She has banned “involuntary pornography” by ensuring people whose photos have been posted on Reddit without their consent can have them removed. And the company has introduced an anti-harassment policy: “We’re banning behaviour, not ideas.”</p> \n<p>It’s not exactly shocking yet Pao is accused of waging a war on freedom. The response to introducing some <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/14/reddit-anti-harassment-policy-cyberbullying\" title=\"\">basic principles of respect and tolerance</a> to a site used by more than 150 million people every month has been tellingly disproportionate. In fact, the language of the petition to oust Pao says it all. “A&nbsp;vast majority of the Reddit community believes that Pao, ‘a&nbsp;manipulative individual who will sue her way to the top’, has overstepped the boundaries and fears that she will run Reddit into the ground.” Some might say the boundaries should have been overstepped long ago.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436200777918/Ellen-Pao-Venture-Capital-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ellen Pao.

He had conducted the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra for 16 years, and was well-versed in the music of films. He and composer <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2013/oct/02/danny-elfman-tim-burton-singing\">Danny Elfman</a> had worked together when Mauceri had conducted the orchestra on some of Elfman’s work from his long, illustrious, almost symbiotic relationship with director <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/video/2014/dec/19/tim-burton-on-big-eyes-a-weird-symbolic-version-of-the-american-dream-video-interview\">Tim Burton</a>. The music got Mauceri thinking: what if they mixed Burton’s artwork, fresh from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2010/mar/11/tim-burton-moma-exhibition\">a retrospective at Museum of Modern Art in New York City</a>, with the music it inspired?</p> \n<p>According to Mauceri, Elfman had never been particularly comfortable with live performance of his orchestral works. “He records it, supervises it, produces it, and then moves on to something else.” But when they approached Elfman about the multimedia performance, to Mauceri’s surprise, Elfman said yes.</p> \n<p>Elfman says that when he was approached to do the stage concert, he was both excited and terrified. (A feeling he was used to: after he sent the score for Pee-wee’s Big Adventure – the first collaboration between Elfman and Burton – the composer was convinced Warner Brothers would simply throw his work in the trash never to be heard again.) “I had been approached about doing these concerts for 20 years, but I didn’t have time. It was too much work – I didn’t like thinking backwards,” Elfman said. “But then I finally thought: ‘It’s now or never.’”</p> \n<p>The resulting show, which is factually if not eloquently titled <a href=\"http://www.lincolncenterfestival.org/2015/danny-elfman-s-music-from-the-films-of-tim-burton\">Danny Elfman’s Music from the Films of Tim Burton</a>, had popular runs in London, Los Angeles and Tokyo, and will finally come to New York City, taking over Lincoln Center from 6-12 July. The show features music from <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/frankenweenie\">Frankenweenie</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/87108/beetlejuice\">Beetlejuice</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099487/reference\">Edward Scissorhands</a> and many more films rearranged by Elfman to be performed by a live orchestra, paired with a series of visual images chosen by Burton himself, and with the composer stepping into the limelight to sing highlights from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2006/nov/17/musical.timburton\">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>.</p> \n<p>For Mauceri, Elfman’s willingness to sing was a sign of his commitment to the project. “That changed everything,” Mauceri said. “It gave the concert a kind of imprimatur of the composer, who’s actually there, performing his music, and having arranged it, and trusting us to interpret it.”</p> \n<p>That wasn’t the only surprise that Elfman had in store for Mauceri. “Danny himself decided that he would create the orchestral suites that we would play. He did not farm it out to other people; he did not use pre-existing materials that orchestras might have played over the years.” </p> \n<p>The only problem was that Elfman had no idea how to compose an orchestral suite. That had never stopped him before, though. “I had no music lessons and no training. I came in out of the blue, which is why I caught so much shit in Hollywood for so many years,” Elfman said. “When I first started writing songs with Tim for Nightmare Before Christmas, neither of us had any clue how to make a musical. We just started doing some songs. Starting on this stage show was like that. I just started.”</p> \n<p>He carved out four months from his packed schedule and set about reconfiguring some of his best-known film scores – <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089791/reference\">Pee-wee’s Big Adventure</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096895/reference\">Batman</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2010/feb/25/alice-in-wonderland-film-review\">Alice in Wonderland</a> and The Nightmare Before Christmas among them – for the orchestra. “I didn’t know what the correct way to do anything was,” said Elfman, who transformed 15 film scores into suites to fill a two-hour performance. “It was a great challenge and the big surprise was that it wasn’t a disaster.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jMGp41cTEY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jMGp41cTEY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Danny Elfman and co perform.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As he worked, he quickly realised that some of his scores, like Alice in Wonderland, were easy to translate, but earlier works like Pee-wee’s Big Adventure and Beetlejuice were much more difficult to sculpt into orchestral suites. “They needed to be taken apart, because they didn’t work just being plunked on the stage,” said Elfman. “I had heard parts of Batman, Beetlejuice, and Pee-wee in other concerts and generally I hated them. The first time I heard Pee-wee live on stage, I realised half of it was piano and the strings were just sitting there. In the film it’s fine, but onstage there’s nothing happening. I had just never imagined playing it live.”</p> \n<p>Now Elfman knows there is a different way to approach writing for film as opposed to writing for concerts. “The best way I can describe it is if I have a whole orchestra playing, but I want to hear a single clarinet, on a film I just move up a microphone. In a concert, I have to carve out the space for it to play within the 85 pieces of orchestra surrounding it. I really had to reconceive each piece to get the energy of what we hear coming out of the speakers on the screen into the concert.”</p> \n<p>Finally, Elfman was done. With the show arranged, the team headed to London for the premiere. Elfman, though, had not been able to actually hear his suites performed yet. He finally heard an orchestra play his suites two days before the London premiere, but there was no time to make any changes other than to rectify a few printing errors. </p> \n<p>“I had no idea if it was going to work on any level. And I had flippantly agreed to sing. I hadn’t sung in 17 years! I had never even sung the songs all the way through,” he says. “It was the most intense fear I had ever felt in my career, but Helena Bonham-Carter was there to sing Sally’s song and she said: ‘I know what you’re thinking, but just fuck it.’ I thought about it and said: ‘Yeah, that’s what I’ve been doing my whole life,’ and I went out there and did it,” Elfman said. “I thought I would have to win over the London audience, but they were great. It is one of the most moving live experiences I’ve had.”</p> \n<p>When Danny Elfman’s Music from the Films of Tim Burton comes to Lincoln Center for its run of shows, opening night will mark his 25<sup>th</sup> concert. So Elfman has worked out his performance anxiety, although playing in front of a New York audience comes with its own set of nerves. “I haven’t played in New York since that USO show I did for the troops in world war two,” joked Elfman. “So I haven’t played in New York in a long time. I hope they’ll be kind.”</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Danny Elfman’s Music from the Films of Tim Burton conducted by John Mauceri will be part of <a href=\"http://www.lincolncenterfestival.org/2015/danny-elfman-s-music-from-the-films-of-tim-burton\">the Lincoln Center Festival</a> from 6-12 July<br /></li> \n</ul>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436198004999/2ffa278f-2f1d-4e0b-9909-8f9fba2579fd-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"DAN TUFFS/Dan Tuffs","altText":"Gong show: Danny Elfman in his studio in Los Angeles.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: DAN TUFFS/Dan Tuffs"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T17:04:30Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T17:25:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":11,"contributors":[{"name":"Melissa Locker","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/melissa-locker"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Film","Music","Culture","Tim Burton","Stage"],"tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"film/timburton","webTitle":"Tim Burton"},{"id":"stage/stage","webTitle":"Stage"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Melissa Locker","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/melissa-locker"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jul/06/danny-elfman-tim-burton-lincoln-center-festival","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4adjg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/jul/06/danny-elfman-tim-burton-lincoln-center-festival","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/06/danny-elfman-tim-burton-lincoln-center-festival"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436198004999/2ffa278f-2f1d-4e0b-9909-8f9fba2579fd-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Danny Elfman’s Music from the Films of Tim Burton, had popular runs in London, Los Angeles and Tokyo, and will finally come to New York City, taking over Lincoln Center this month.

They’re rapists and some, I assume, are good people.”</p> \n<p>Outrage has been widespread among the Mexican people, from those struggling to make a living on the streets to some of the richest businessmen in the world. In a country fraught with divisions over how to create the jobs and security necessary to make mass migration unnecessary, opposition to Trump’s remarks has provided rare unity.</p> \n<p>“If you offend us we come together, and what he said was very offensive. He has no respect for human beings,” said Rita Hern&aacute;ndez, sitting beside her stall, from which she sold brooms. </p> \n<p>“We have a lot of problems in our country and they hurt us a lot, but the migrants who go to the US are hardworking people looking for a way to support their families, and when American tourists come here we treat them with warmth.”</p> \n<p>Powerful Mexicans have sought to identify with such sentiments, severing business ties with the magnate and the Miss Universe pageant he owns. The TV giant Televisa said it was cutting all ties with Trump companies and would not be airing Miss Universe, in which he has a stake. The TV network Ora, owned by the telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim, announced it was also boycotting Trump and his competition.</p> \n<p>Mexican expressions of disgust over Trump’s bigotry have frequently been laced with pot shots at his appearance. Former actress Carmen Salinas, recently elected as a federal deputy, <a href=\"http://www.latintimes.com/pulse/carmen-salinas-has-message-donald-trump-324262\">released a YouTube video</a> urging the business mogul and reality TV star to recognise that he had “the face of a dried-up louse”.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/19/mexican-artisan-donald-trump-pinata\">Pi&ntilde;ata maker Dalton Ramirez</a> said a new model – with a shock of blond hair and a big mouth – was proving particularly popular.</p> \n<p>Bitter humour is, some say, the only recourse they have. Mauro Tlatengo recalled the 10 years he spent picking grapes, tending golf courses and working construction in California, Pennsylvania and New York, before returning to Mexico voluntarily because he missed his country. Trump’s comments made him angry but mostly, he said, they made him feel powerless.</p> \n<p>“He is a crazy idiot who we can’t do anything about,” Tlatengo said. “But we can laugh at him.”</p> \n<p>The comedian and filmmaker <a href=\"http://www.latintimes.com/pulse/eugenio-derbez-has-important-message-donald-trump-325762\">Eugenio Derbez</a> tapped into this feeling while accepting an award in Los Angeles. </p> \n<p>“You are wrong, Mr Trump. We are honest and hardworking people,” he said. “We are also waiters and cooks in all the restaurants of the United States. So take care the next time you eat at a restaurant, because it is possible that you might have to eat your words … and something else.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"673065c4a77803c06b657a4d8a39cacae13bc659\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/673065c4a77803c06b657a4d8a39cacae13bc659/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks at his campaign launch, in New York City in June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jul/05/donald-trump-republican-2016\">'This country's bankrupt': supporters keep Donald Trump in business</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Trump has drawn fire from other Latin American countries.
