While she assures me she’s improving, working with her “unpredictable” co-star Melissa McCarthy on their new movie Spy made it almost impossible. “She’ll go on these runs of her bits, so it’s pretty hard not to start laughing. Even the crew guys start laughing.” She adds quickly: “Jude [Law] broke a lot so that made me feel less self-conscious.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/mar/16/spy-review-paul-feig-melissa-mccarthy-jude-law\">Spy review –&nbsp;uproarious Paul Feig comedy tickles SXSW</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For Byrne, it’s an occupational hazard. The Sydney-born actor has made a slew of comedies since her 2010 role as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q2sUV_eHfI\">trashtastic popstar Jackie Q</a>, the girlfriend of Russell Brand’s character in Get Him to the Greek. Next came the wildly successful Bridesmaids, in which she played the insufferable Helen opposite Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph, followed by the bromance<a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/bad-neighbours\"> Bad Neighbours</a>, in which she played Seth Rogen’s wife and casually walked away with most of the kudos. </p> \n<p>Her fast track to funny girl is no accident. When I interviewed Byrne in 2010, before Greek, she spoke of a desire to do more comedy after a run of solemn-faced roles in the Asperger’s drama Adam, the horror flick 28 Weeks Later and the sci-fi thriller Sunshine. She said then: “Most of my stuff has been serious … but I definitely have a light-hearted side.” </p> \n<p>She has channelled it. Spy reunites her with the Bridesmaids director, Paul Feig, and co-star McCarthy. Billed as an action comedy, the film sees McCarthy’s mild-mannered CIA analyst Susan Cooper forced out into the field – in increasingly depressing cat-lady disguises – to stop an underworld nuclear arms deal. Byrne plays the dastardly Raina Boyanov, a mob boss’s daughter who is possibly the linchpin in the deal and the foil for McCarthy’s unfortunate character. The two banter and bounce off each other, locked in a tussle of wits and, occasionally, limbs. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"663d64cb3327dde9360a2f8c437f907473493f53\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/28/1432811966207/fda8bdda-972f-496f-9575-44772dc81672-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rose Byrne in Spy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose Byrne in Spy opposite Melissa McCarthy and Miranda Hart</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/jul/20/rose-byrne-this-much-i-know\">her growing assuredness</a>, she finds comedy challenging, particularly when working with “effortless” performers such as Wiig, Rudolph and McCarthy. “It’s like doing a drama but on top of that you have to get a laugh,” she says, “It’s scientific, it’s technical and it’s also like lightning in a bottle.” Her approach is different to that of her co-stars: “I could never do standup – my comedy comes from character stuff, not necessarily from jokes.” </p> \n<p>What makes her laugh in real life? “Fox news. That’s pretty funny.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/jul/04/two-hands-rewatched-heath-ledger-emerges-in-offbeat-caper\">Two Hands rewatched – Heath Ledger emerges in offbeat crime caper</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At 35, Byrne is one of Australia’s most successful actors. Audiences have watched her transform from the fresh-faced (albeit peroxided) 20-year-old in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/jul/04/two-hands-rewatched-heath-ledger-emerges-in-offbeat-caper\">Two Hands</a>, opposite Heath Ledger, through a blink-and-you-missed-it performance in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, a screen kiss with Brad Pitt in the forgettable Troy and a role as the extravagant Duchesse de Polignac in Sofia Coppola’s lightweight Marie Antoinette. </p> \n<p>Then came <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2010/may/28/damages-review\">Damages</a>, her breakout television role in which she played a law school graduate locked in a dysfunctional relationship with her mentor/tormentor, played by Glenn Close. The show premiered in 2007, the same year as Mad Men, and was one of the new breed of TV dramas, headed up by strong female leads. It ran for five seasons. Looking back, Byrne says she realises it was a seminal time: “I was lucky to be part of that really great writing that was returning to TV.” </p> \n<p>The role got her noticed – and two Golden Globe nominations. By 2013 she was one of LA’s most in-demand actors, reportedly having her pick of TV scripts during pilot season. Instead she focused on getting her funny on.<br /></p> \n<p>While more likely to be cracking a smile on screen, she’s getting more serious off screen. Until recently, Byrne could never have been accused of being outspoken but in 2014 she appeared in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd6VenJWz9A\">public service announcement</a> on US television about sexual assaults on college campuses. Inspired by the campaign, she followed it up by taking part in a women’s day at the UN in New York. “I thought it was a really hard subject to discuss that nobody really wants to.”</p> \n<p>She’s also entered the debate about sexism in the film industry. Byrne points to a push by the <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/biz/news/hollywoods-biased-hiring-practices-against-women-subject-of-a-c-l-u-inquiry-1201493101/\">American Civil Liberties Union</a> for a criminal investigation into gender discrimination. “It’s not being put down to good old-fashioned misogyny, it’s actually [asking] why is this quietly tolerated? Why has this been a silent agreement for the last however many years. </p> \n<p>“This is discrimination. And that’s illegal. It’s very interesting, long overdue and quite frankly exciting to see it being taken as seriously as it should be.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7afd609c42e9109c4a20d5a6549f1ead6c53b928\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/28/1432827099767/cc668fb2-5f9b-4e4a-a36c-a0bc0e85dd95-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Rose Byrne (second from left) and her Bridesmaids co-stars in Paul Feig's 2011 film.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose Byrne (second from left) with her Bridesmaids co-stars in Paul Feig’s 2011 film.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal Pictures/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Byrne and a group of close friends have taken matters into their own hands. Documentary film-maker Gracie Otto, actor and writer Krew Boylan, director Shannon Murphy, publicist Jessica Carrera and Byrne decided to band together to form <a href=\"http://www.filmink.com.au/news/welcome-to-the-dollhouse-/\">the Dollhouse Collective</a>, a production company with an emphasis on creating “complicated great lead roles for women”.</p> \n<p>The fivesome intend to mix and match duties, with Byrne keen to produce and direct. “As an actor, you have little control over your career, whereas you can exercise a little bit more of that when you are steering the ship.” She feels a responsibility to Australia. “You want to give back, to tell Australian stories and nurture the place where you are from.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It just seems to be more bad news with this government with the arts</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite></cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>She won’t say if the newly announced <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/australia-news/2015/may/12/budget-takes-100m-from-australia-council-to-establish-arts-excellence-program\">Screen Australia funding cuts </a>will affect the company’s first project Seriously Red, written by Boyland and executive produced by Byrne. But she was disappointed to hear about them. “It just seems to be more bad news with this government with the arts. It’s not a priority for them to cultivate our storytelling or our culture through artistic pursuits.”</p> \n<p>Still, she continues to enjoy the lighter side of her work. She’s pleased when I point out red carpet shots in which she looks increasingly chipper. “I’m used to people telling me I was miserable so it’s nice to have a change of tune.” </p> \n<p>Time to press her for a reason. Is it her increasingly comedic roles that are making her smile? Her confidence as a red carpet regular? Or perhaps the happiness she’s reportedly found with her partner, actor Bobby Cannavale? She laughs hard. “Maybe I’ve had a few glasses of wine before I got on there, that’s probably it.”</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/mar/16/spy-review-paul-feig-melissa-mccarthy-jude-law\">Spy</a> is out now in Australia and released on 5 June in the US and UK</em><br /></p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f64361ed845812b21f422655fad57b098c31e8ac/0_69_7119_4280/7119.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":4280,"width":7119,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chris Weeks/Getty Images","altText":"LOS ANGELES, CA - APRIL 16:  Actress Rose Byrne attends the Burberry \"London in Los Angeles\" event at Griffith Observatory on April 16, 2015 in Los Angeles, California.

She’s a delight.</p> \n<p>Amfo, 28, who last week took over the 10am-1pm Radio 1 Live Lounge slot from Fearne Cotton, has described herself as “radio-obsessed”. She started out as a marketing intern at London station Kiss FM, going on to present its drivetime show before BBC 1Xtra came calling. In January, she became host of the Official Chart Show on Radio 1. Her first Live Lounge showcased highlights from the Big Weekend: “Hello, new friends,” she said chirpily. “Hopefully we’re gonna be BFFs by the end of this week.” She wears her musical fandoms on her sleeve – a&nbsp;great pop song will send her giddy, and she’ll go into rhapsodies over a live performance by Rudimental. She’s all giggles and sighs over the music, in time with the listener at the other end, making the experience feel truly interactive.</p> \n<p>And speaking of interactive, her Twitter and Instagram accounts are full of photos of her studio: what’s coming up and what she’s into, usually alongside an enthusiastic “loooove” or two. Amfo might come in a shiny 2015 package, but at heart she’s an old-school broadcaster who sticks to core values: connect, roll with the punches of live radio, and bring it all home within the allotted time.

He was a merchant seaman and arrived in Liverpool in the late 1950s with a pocket full of change and a bag of records. They used to tell the story that they met outside a boarding house that said “No dogs, no Irish, no blacks”, but I am not sure if that’s true.</p> \n<p><strong>We moved to Cantril Farm</strong>, which later became notorious for violence and robbery, but back then Mum and Dad saw it as a chance to have a bigger house, a bathroom and a fresh start. Out of about 1,000 families, we were the only black family on the estate, and at that time it was quite racist. You would get on the bus and people would move as they didn’t want to sit next to you and kids would shout, “Nigger nigger, pull the trigger, bang bang bang!”</p> \n<p><strong>My mum wasn’t that warm a person.</strong> She was a white woman in the 60s with three black kids and it was tough. She was very ambitious for us and she showed her love by encouraging us to better ourselves rather than with a&nbsp;cuddle or a kiss on the cheek. I wanted to be a poet and you can imagine how that went down in a house where it was all about achieving.</p> \n<p><strong>I was the naughty child.</strong> My elder brother Dean did everything right. He was good at school and became a policeman, rising up though the ranks. I messed around at school but got the same grades as Dean at O-level.</p> \n<p><strong>My mum died when she was 46.</strong> My dad lived until he was 82, which is a&nbsp;grand old age with the lifestyle he led. He was a big drinker and I&nbsp;inherited his genes. I look like him and my constitution is very similar. He was very laid-back and I am becoming more easygoing as I get older. I think we all become our parents in the end.</p> \n<p><strong>I was 24 when my son Jack was born.</strong> I&nbsp;was very much a weekend father as his mum, Cathy, and I split up when he was just two months old. Later, though, he came to live with me as a young man and he is close to my daughters Anna-Jo and Nellie.</p> \n<p><strong>When my brother Dean died last year,</strong> aged 52, it was an absolute shock. When we were growing up, we shared a bedroom. I was the annoying younger brother and would get him to hit me and then I would tell Mum, but we would do anything for each other. We&nbsp;had not spoken for a while as we had a falling&nbsp;out. He called me, but I&nbsp;didn’t reply as I thought I could do it later. They say man makes plans and God&nbsp;laughs.</p> \n<p><strong>It’s been a big wakeup call</strong> and has brought the rest of the family together. I saw cousins I hadn’t seen for ages at the funeral and that tragic event has reconnected us. I don’t have many friends and I’m not into showbiz friends. When you have been through life’s ups and downs, family are the ones you can really trust.</p> \n<p><strong>I met my wife, Jackie, in a bar in Dublin</strong> when I was filming there. She was actually on a first date with another actor but we just got on like a&nbsp;house on fire, and within three weeks she had left her job and come to live with me, and that was 20 years ago.</p> \n<p><strong>I had quite a male upbringing,</strong> but now&nbsp;I am surrounded by women. Last&nbsp;year, Jackie’s sister and two daughters lived with us for a while, so then it was me and six women. When my mum died, my brothers didn’t talk much and I do think women knit families together. I am very lucky to have so many good, strong women in&nbsp;my life who tell me when I am getting too up myself – starting with my daughters!</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span><em> Craig Charles performs his BBC Radio 6 Music Funk and Soul Show live in Liverpool for BBC Music Day on Friday 5 June, </em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/exh2mb\" title=\"\"><em>bbc.co.uk/musicday</em></a><em>.</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432561567896/a398fb11-dfaa-44ce-8d16-98c8aa42fe11-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Levene/Guardian","altText":"Craig Charles: 'I was the naughty child.

The last time I was here, I left absolutely exhausted; I was sick for about three weeks afterwards. So I determined this time I was going to be zen. People keep telling me they have lost their minds. There are a lot of mislaid minds around the place.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/18/louder-than-bombs-review-muffled-english-language-debut-by-joachim-trier\"><strong>Louder Than Bombs</strong></a><strong> (2) is one of many suicide-themed movies at this year’s festival (3) …</strong></p> \n<p>The bigger world out there is always reflected in film. Youth is alienated; so are adults. We live in a less certain world. Technology is bringing people together and keeping them apart. I think it has had a huge effect on our social and spiritual lives. Traditional notions are beginning to crumble. Young people can’t look to the future with that certainty our parents or grandparents had, and adults are utterly confused because they think the disappearance of the old world somehow is a harbinger of the end of life as they know it. If you were a parent in 1963 <strong>(4)</strong>, think of what you would have had to deal with. Just imagine your daughter saying she was on the pill. For a generation raised on traditional courtship and marriage, it was the first time women had power over their own sexual lives. Also Vietnam, nuclear war, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/thebeatles\">the Beatles</a>, Martin Luther King, John F Kennedy – the world was in absolute tumult. That must have been so alienating. But life goes on, and this generation will meet somebody they fancy and get married and have kids.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/18/louder-than-bombs-review-muffled-english-language-debut-by-joachim-trier\">Louder than Bombs review: muffled English-language debut by Joachim Trier</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Is it a bad thing that young people disclose so much online? </strong></p> \n<p>Not necessarily. Privacy has more or less evaporated. There was a time when girls used to keep little diaries and they would have a lock and key on them and write their most intimate thoughts in them. Now they put them on the internet and many, many other people from all round the world identify. That gives you a sense of belonging. But your secrets are no longer your secrets. Your private life is no longer your private life. We have been invaded by all sorts of external forces. Is that necessarily a bad thing? I don’t know. I’m far more worried about the lies and secrets of governments and corporations than about people relating to each other over the internet.</p> \n<p><strong>But does it change people fundamentally? </strong></p> \n<p>I was reading about an experiment into the effect of pornography on the growing male, and they found exposure actually alters the chemistry of the brain. I remember the unbearable excitement of getting a Valentine’s Day card. And the sense of unimaginable romance of getting to know somebody and going out with them, and the journey one had to make to a place of intimacy. Now young girls are exposed to pornography as well, so they’re assuming the roles they see, and boys expect women to play those roles. On the other hand, I grew up in a place <strong>(5)</strong> where the notion of womanhood was a very conflicted one. A woman gave birth to Jesus without ever having had sex. But you could never reconcile this pure woman with human women, and that developed into a kind of madonna/whore complex for a lot of men.</p> \n<p><strong>So everything is changing.</strong></p> \n<p>I think we’re living through revolutionary times, driven principally by technology. But that was something <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/maryshelley\">Mary Shelley</a> was dealing with 250 years ago. We invent the monster – is it a kind one or something that will destroy us? I don’t know. The dinosaurs thought they were here for ever, as did the Greeks, the Romans, the Celts. There is no guarantee. We’ll come out of this like they came out of the printing press in the 14th century. Learning, which they all thought would be the end of life as they knew it, gave way to a new civilisation.</p> \n<p><strong>What do you think will happen? </strong></p> \n<p>I’m not a seer or a prophet, but it is conceivable that if we don’t get climate change under control, it doesn’t really matter what else we aspire to. The warning signs are there and I see that your editor <strong>(6)</strong> has taken a very firm stance on trying to make people aware of the real danger of annihilation. What is astonishing is how sentient adults who work in a business of information can either willingly ignore what’s happening or are ignorant of it.</p> \n<p><strong>Why are people not more worried? </strong></p> \n<p>I think that every tribe has an inbuilt sense of its own survival. But it is a very uncomfortable thing to think that the world could end fairly soon, not to mention that we have nuclear weapons all over the place. It’s not one army invading another; one guy coming into your cave to hit you with a stone – it is the possibility of universal annihilation. I really worry about that climate change thing.</p> \n<p><strong>Are people apathetic in order to dodge responsibility? </strong></p> \n<p>Apathy is a comforting place to be; it is when you decide to take action that it’s uncomfortable. But to do nothing is what happened in Germany in the 20s and 30s. Is there any bigger crisis facing us now? Resting nicely in a cocoon of apathy isn’t going to help anyone. It is such a betrayal of the people that come after us – if they come after us.</p> \n<h2><strong>Foot notes </strong></h2> \n<p><strong> </strong><strong>(1)</strong> He looks quite relaxed, though.

It’s Pacino’s best for years, and to make the most of our renewed respect for him, here are five of his greatest career highs:</p> \n<h2>The Godfather</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppjyB2MpxBU\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ppjyB2MpxBU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Watching a 31-year-old Pacino give such a confident performance in only his third film is a rather intimidating lesson for any actor still finding his or her feet. As Michael Corleone, Pacino found his footing impressively fast, and this scene, arguably the best of the entire trilogy, sees him transform into the gangster who will haunt him throughout the rest of the saga.<br /></p> \n<h2>Dog Day Afternoon </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYt24hq5nbM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kYt24hq5nbM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>His role in The Godfather gave his career an expected boost, but rather than sticking with the mob genre, Pacino branched out. After checking out life on the right side of the law in Serpico, he headed back to a life (or rather, a day) of crime in Sidney Lumet’s Oscar-winning drama. He played a desperate man who attempts to rob a bank to pay for his boyfriend’s sex-change operation – which was a daring storyline back in 1975. This scene shows him losing his cool and then winning over the crowd gathered outside the bank in the same breath.</p> \n<h2>Glengarry Glen Ross</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa9dttNx1S8\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qa9dttNx1S8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>While Pacino might have won the best actor Oscar in 1992 for his role in the saccharine mess that was Scent of a Woman, his other nominated performance from that year was more worthy of an award. In this adaptation of David Mamet’s swear-heavy office-based play, Pacino was arguably the standout member of an impeccable cast – and this monologue shows why.</p> \n<h2>Heat</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZjraQagtTo\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mZjraQagtTo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There was a great deal of hype about the prospect of Pacino starring alongside Robert De Niro in a second film – especially given that their first was The Godfather Part II, in which they never actually share a scene. Heat also kept them apart for most of the duration, but brought them together for this tense restaurant meeting which, as well as the novelty of having them onscreen together, bristles with tension. Sadly, the pair later expanded on this dynamic in the incompetent thriller Righteous Kill, an entire film in which they’re together, but which makes you wish they’d never even met.</p> \n<h2>Insomnia</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znc5Rj8xi-4\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/znc5Rj8xi-4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Pacino’s later performances became the stuff of parody, due to his frequent inability to control the VOLUME of his VOICE.

He’s <a href=\"http://www.fantagraphics.com/?option=com_myblog&amp;show=Daniel-Clowes-wins-PEN-Literary-Award.html&amp;Itemid=113\">won a PEN award for his body of graphic work </a>and an Oscar nomination for the screenplay to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2001/aug/13/1\">Ghost World</a>, but none of that would exist without <a href=\"http://www.danielclowes.com/eightball.html\">Eightball</a>, Clowes’s ongoing series that graced less reputable newsstands from the late 1980s onward. </p> \n<p>Eightball is where the Ghost World stories first ran, where Art School Confidential (the source material for his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9g_EheqtAOw\">second feature film</a>) first appeared, and where his graphic novels Ice Haven, David Boring and The Death Ray were serialised. Now, the lion’s share of that old material, from the religious tract parody to Clowes’ jokey ad for “hand-painted girlie ties” (which he <a href=\"http://www.comicartfans.com/gallerypiece.asp?piece=375012\">actually honoured</a>, if you sent him a hundred bucks) is getting the oversized, slipcased treatment from Fantagraphics. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA3q_PqVosw\">The Complete Eightball</a> is out 4 July.</p> \n<p><strong>Hi, are you free to talk? I’m not surprising you or anything?</strong></p> \n<p>Yes! I’m free. I think the worst moment of my life was once I was on a book tour and dead asleep and the phone rings. And I picked it up and it was a radio DJ who said: “Are you ready to go on the air in 30 seconds?” It was an AM American radio show and he was like “So! you do comics!” I was completely still in a dream world.</p> \n<p><strong>What’s it like looking through all this material from 25 years ago?</strong></p> \n<p>Luckily it’s been long enough that I don’t look at it and go: “Oh my god, I wish I’d fixed that face or rewritten that line of dialogue.” There was actually a typo that after all these years that no one had noticed. Multiple reprintings and it’s just always been there.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/28/woody-harrelson-laura-dern-wilson-daniel-clowes\">Woody Harrelson and Laura Dern set for Daniel Clowes' Wilson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>One thing I always stop on going through Eightball back issues is Devil Doll, the stapled-in parody of <a href=\"https://www.chick.com/\">Jack Chick’s famous Christian mini-comic tracts</a>.</strong></p> \n<p>When I was growing up you would see those lying around. You don’t really think of those as being part of the official canon of effective comics. And one day I sort of changed my mind. I thought: “These are really compelling and I’d rather read these than pretty much anything else published in 1985.” So I made a long trek out to a Christian bookstore in Queens and I bought every single one, which totaled I think $3 – they were each 10 cents. And I went home and read them all in one sitting, and it was maybe the most devastating comics-reading experience I’ve ever had. I really felt like he’d almost won me over by the end. I knew every single one of them almost by heart by the time I did that story. I was so obsessed.</p> \n<p><strong>It’s such an effective evocation of them that I’ve occasionally wanted to just buy an old issue of Eightball and just slip it into the rack in the Times Square subway station where the guy hands them out.</strong></p> \n<p>A couple of people had the gumption to actually redo that story as a Chick tract and I only wish I had a thousand of them, because that would be really fun to leave in the laundromat.</p> \n<p><strong>Are there any characters in these stories that you miss? <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/search/dan%20pussey\">Dan Pussey</a>, the guy who tragically makes it big in superhero comics, or the misanthropic <a href=\"http://danielclowes.com/LLLL.html\">Lloyd Llewelyn</a>?</strong></p> \n<p>I feel like Dan Pussey could have just gone on and on as the world changed. He would be running one of the movie studios right now. I think about Lloyd Llewelyn all the time. He was like the big actor that peaked too soon and became a has-been and is doing infomercials or something, and there’s something much more interesting about that than the successful character that takes off. I’ve thought about doing the Ghost World girls as adults. I think one day I may just revisit all the characters. I may do something where they get together in some way, just to see what would happen. </p> \n<p><strong>It’s funny how short the Art School Confidential story is. Four pages long, and it’s been made into a feature film.</strong></p> \n<p>The only reason I allowed it to be [marketed] as though it’s based on that story was because I would get money from being the author of the original material. But really we wanted to do an art school story. I always thought we should have changed the name, but nobody else agreed with me, so it stayed with it.</p> \n<p><strong>Do you want to keep on making movies?</strong></p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/28/woody-harrelson-laura-dern-wilson-daniel-clowes\">It looks like there’s going to be a Wilson movie coming up this summer</a>, I wrote the screenplay for that, but I have to say ... I don’t know. It was a fun thing to do for 10 years or so, to write the screenplays. But now, really, all I want to do is sit at the drawing board. I’m newly inspired to get back to comics full-time and not do anything else. I’m cranking out the comics.</p> \n<p><strong>How do you preserve an observation that inspired you after you’ve reworked it a hundred times?</strong></p> \n<p>I’ve devised various ways to keep it loose while still plotting it out so that I don’t get trapped. A lot of it has to do with not writing any of the captions or dialogue until I’m really feeling the pressure. I’ve actually found over the years that when I’m using the pen and doing the comic book lettering, at that moment my brain is really freed to know what’s going to sound right. I’ll wind up making drastic changes while I’m lettering that have a sort of clarity to them I can’t have at any other time. It’s a very interesting process.</p> \n<p><strong>I’ve never understood how jokes in particular survive any of this.</strong></p> \n<p>By the time you’re actually drawing the thing, no matter how spontaneous you keep it, the joke is already worked out. Once <a href=\"http://www.peterbagge.com/\">Peter Bagge</a>’s wife told me she could hear him through the heating grate in the floor where he had a studio in the basement, cackling at his own comics. And I thought: “I’ve never laughed at one of my own comics.” Going back and rereading the Eightballs, I laughed at a couple of my own jokes. It was cool.</p> \n<p><strong>What else makes you laugh?</strong></p> \n<p>There’s so much good comedy in the world you almost take it for granted. That Mike Judge show <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/aug/06/silicon-valley-mike-judge-sitcom\">Silicon Valley</a> always makes me laugh because we’re [living] right in that area [northern California], and he’s so great at cataloguing different types of assholes. Every week there’s a new type of asshole! And you’re like: “Yes. That is one of them.”</p> \n<p><strong>Given how respectable comics have gotten in the past 20 years, where is there still to go? What would you like to see more of?</strong></p> \n<p>I’d like to see more people who can draw really well also figuring out how to tell stories. Because I feel like there are a lot of really beautiful-looking comics that aren’t that interesting to read. And there are certainly a lot of people who could potentially write good comics, but writing for comics is a very, very difficult thing. I think it’s only really done perfectly when it’s the same person doing both, or at least having a great control over the visuals. I’d just like to have more things to actually read. I have a lot of things I can look at. Even the most average, bland Hollywood movie has to be worked out to such a degree that there’s a certain pleasure to watching it, knowing that it’s going to play out in a way that has some structure to it. Just to get to that point would be a big step.</p> \n<p><strong>The cover and logo of Eightball get redesigned practically every issue – were you just bored and mixing it up, or were you trying to find something that worked?</strong></p> \n<p>No, I think that’s a very clear sign I was trying to find something. You can see in the first two issues I use the same logo. In the third issue that logo didn’t quite work, and then I’m just restlessly moving from one thing to another, and by the end it was these big, full-colour paintings that I was spending weeks on. It’s something I never quite got, and at the time I felt once I have the perfect format, I’ll just stick with that. But I now look back and see that it’s a good thing I never felt comfortable with that. And I still never do! I’m still looking for ways to work that will be, you know, The Way. </p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/28/1432827623721/665e0204-2c89-42d0-b329-0d93adad4910-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Richard Saker/Richard Saker","altText":"Daniel Clowes at Gosh comic shop in London.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Richard Saker/Richard Saker"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-28T17:08:48Z","lastModified":"2015-05-29T22:43:45Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":13,"contributors":[{"name":"Sam Thielman","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sam-thielman"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Daniel Clowes","Books","Comics and graphic novels","Culture","Film"],"tags":[{"id":"books/daniel-clowes","webTitle":"Daniel Clowes"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"books/comics","webTitle":"Comics and graphic novels"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"}],"section":{"id":"books"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sam Thielman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sam-thielman"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"books"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/28/daniel-clowes-interview-comics-ghost-world-art-school-confidential","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49add","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/books/2015/may/28/daniel-clowes-interview-comics-ghost-world-art-school-confidential","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/28/daniel-clowes-interview-comics-ghost-world-art-school-confidential"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/28/1432827623721/665e0204-2c89-42d0-b329-0d93adad4910-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Daniel Clowes at Gosh comic shop in London.
