The characters have been assigned voices and accents and inflections that I’ll never hear. This is not a complaint, exactly; to have written a book that someone wants to publish in any and all formats is a writer’s dream. But to hold some disc or drive that contains a thing I made, transformed into a new thing I can no longer understand, is a predicament in which few writers find themselves.</p> \n<p>This disconnect will appear with increasing frequency as I embark on a series of literary events following the launch of my novel. As an audience member I have been to my share of readings in New York. I go because I am in love with books; I go to be with my friends. But even as a spectator they require a lot of concentration, and sometimes when I’ve worked myself into a cross-eyed headache I turn off my hearing aids and dip below the surface of the sound, let myself drift in the quiet. At my own events I won’t have the choice to opt out.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"604680df0325f384a44eb6537d0224e93218e818\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432231016215/faa5afcd-cb18-48da-962c-c3de15fb3c60-286x420.jpeg\" alt=\"sara novic\" width=\"286\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So far I have read in public only three times, each distressing in the regular ways (an audience!), with the added terror of exposing an increasingly unknowable part of myself – my voice. I can feel my words in my chest and mouth, but can’t be sure of what they sound like out in the world. As far as I’m concerned my voice has no echo; it does not stick to the tape recording. What does it mean to perform for an audience with such limited control of your output?</p> \n<p>Books have always provided me with a sense of solace and companionship when I found the hearing world overwhelming. Growing up I filled notebooks with the things I was afraid to say aloud. Libraries, too, seem designed for me – a place where one isn’t supposed to talk, equality under the rule of silence.</p> \n<p>Since my hearing loss was progressive, I was educated in spoken English alongside my hearing peers; later, when that became too difficult I learned American Sign Language (ASL) and used interpreters in class. When given the choice between the two, my preference is by far for ASL, in which at least I do not feel self-conscious. But having been brought up in the hearing world with an English education, and now in turn writing and teaching in English, I spend much more time immersed in English than I do in ASL. My ASL is fluent, and I can dream and think in sign, but it is not my primary thinking language.</p> \n<p>In reality, the language – or linguistic modality – in which I am most fluent is written English. When I’m writing, my mind and body need not be translated for a hearing audience. I don’t worry that I am unclear, that my lips and tongue will revert to their unpractised ways under pressure, or that I’m speaking at the wrong volume for the background noise I cannot gauge. When I’m reading a book, I do not have to guess in the way that I do when lipreading – paper never covers its mouth or turns its head.</p> \n<p>And yet there is a disconcerting entanglement between speech and the practice of being a writer. I frequently see advice from famous authors – <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/rereading-stephen-king\">Stephen King</a> among them – that you absolutely must read your own work aloud in order to edit it properly. Without listening to your words in your own voice, you can neither fully understand what you’ve written nor hear how to fix it. At best this kind of advice leaves me feeling a little left out, but at worst, I wonder: am I making mistakes a hearing writer wouldn’t?</p> \n<p>Another part of writing that seems inextricable from hearing is dialogue. Someone who writes dialogue well is said to “have an ear” for it. I don’t think I write dialogue well. Whether this is just your average writerly paranoia or is linked to the physiology of hearing loss, I can’t say. Relevant here is a cultural divide between the deaf and hearing worlds with regard to frankness. By nature of its visual modality, sign language is more direct than spoken language; there are no euphemisms in ASL. Further, the threshold for “rude” or “inappropriate” is much higher in the deaf world. Stemming perhaps from the days before SMS and email, when it was harder to keep tabs on a deaf person’s wellbeing, there is no shame in bluntly discussing one’s feelings, plans and bodily functions with friends, or even acquaintances.</p> \n<p>In the writing world, any trace of this directness translates as “bad dialogue”. “That’s not how people talk,” my workshop mates have said. And of course, they’re right.</p> \n<p>In English the phraseology of silence and deafness overwhelmingly signifies the negative. To hear is synonymous with understanding – “I heard about that” or “I hear you” suggests the speaker’s knowledge, comprehension, or capacity for empathy on a given topic, whereas, across the headlines, cries for justice or peace often “fall on deaf ears”. So as long as deafness is a synonym for stupidity or wilful ignorance, d/Deaf and signing people will continue to be “othered” into a position of inferiority. (T<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/opinion/d_or_d_whos_deaf_and_whos_deaf.shtml\">he capital “D”</a> is used to refer to those who associate themselves with the Deaf community; a minority are medically deaf but choose not to associate with that community.)</p> \n<p>In the face of all this, it’s perhaps unsurprising that the works of fiction written in English by d/Deaf writers can be counted on one hand. It is important to note that sign languages foster a rich tradition of storytelling and slam poetry, but books written in English – many d/Deaf people’s second language – are few. On the other hand, this means the experiences of Deaf characters present a rich and relatively unmined cache of material with which to work. Plus, being a Deaf writer means I can write anywhere without being distracted – I wrote most of my first book on the New Jersey Transit Northeast Corridor line.</p> \n<p>And while writing in a language that works against me can sometimes seem a less-than-ideal occupation, what is the job of a writer if not to reinvent language, or at least to create the space and tools for the silenced?</p> \n<p>I am reminded of Chinua Achebe quoting James Baldwin, who expresses frustration with the limits of the language: “My quarrel with the English language has been that the language reflected none of my experience. But now I began to see the matter in quite another way … Perhaps the language was not my own because I had never attempted to use it, had only learned to imitate it.” Achebe goes on to say: “I recognise of course that Baldwin’s problem is not exactly mine, but I feel the English language will be able to carry the weight of my African experience. But it will have to be a new English.” And while Baldwin’s and Achebe’s problems are much bigger than mine, I can look at the successes of these literary giants and extract a hope that English, with a little work, can carry the Deaf voice, too.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Sara Nović’s novel <em>Girl at War</em> is published by Little, Brown.<br /></li> \n</ul>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2015/5/21/1432224937847/Sara-Novic-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘I can write anywhere without being distracted’ … Sara Nović","credit":"Picasa/PR","altText":"Sara Novic","cleanCaption":"‘I can write anywhere without being distracted’ … Sara Nović"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432231015900/faa5afcd-cb18-48da-962c-c3de15fb3c60-695x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":695,"orientation":"portrait","caption":" ","credit":"pr","altText":"sara novic","cleanCaption":" "}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-23T08:00:01Z","lastModified":"2015-05-23T08:00:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["Books","Culture","Disability"],"tags":[{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"society/disability","webTitle":"Disability"}],"section":{"id":"books"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"books"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/23/what-its-like-to-be-a-deaf-novelist","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/495ta","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/books/2015/may/23/what-its-like-to-be-a-deaf-novelist","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/23/what-its-like-to-be-a-deaf-novelist"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2015/5/21/1432224937847/Sara-Novic-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Paper never covers its mouth or turns its head’ … Sara Nović","credit":"Picasa/PR","altText":"Sara Novic","cleanCaption":"‘Paper never covers its mouth or turns its head’ … Sara Nović"}},"importance":7,"byline":{"title":"Sara Nović"},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Antony Sher / Tell you a secret?

In San Francisco, 100,000 hippies gathered during the Summer of Love, while 165 race riots blazed through the nation’s cities, leaving 83 dead. It was also the year when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2000/oct/08/features.burhanwazir\">Sidney Poitier</a> released three films that would make him a megastar. Poitier, who was born in Miami to parents from the Bahamas, had made his screen debut in 1950 in <em>No Way Out</em>; in 1964 he had become the first black person to win an Academy Award for best actor – for his performance in <em>Lilies in the Field</em> – and by 1967 his screen persona was well established. He was smart-suited and clean-shaven, dignified and graceful, neither dangerously defiant nor offensively deferential; masculine but strangely sexless. This persona echoed the manner of his friend <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/us-news/martin-luther-king\">Martin Luther King</a> and, like Dr King, Poitier was elevated into an icon. He became, in the words of <em>Revisiting Poitier</em>, an excellent collection of essays on his life and legacy, “the bourgeois wish-fulfilling symbol of a race”. Poitier’s three 1967 films would come to define his entire career: <em>To Sir, With Love</em>, <em>In the Heat of the Night</em> and <em>Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner</em>.</p> \n<p><em>Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner</em>, directed by Stanley Kramer and written by William Rose, is an exploration of the limits of racial tolerance disguised as a romantic comedy. It is boy meets girl, boy meets girl’s racist parents, boy gets girl. Poitier plays John Prentice, a black doctor, who has recently fallen in love with Joanna, a young white woman played by Katharine Houghton. The couple have only known each other for 10 days when they arrive at her parents’ home to announce their engagement and to ask for approval for the marriage. The parents, played by <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/katharinehepburn\">Katharine Hepburn</a> (Houghton’s aunt in real life) and Spencer Tracy, are forced to examine their attitudes, supposedly liberal, when confronted with the prospect of a black son-in-law. The film proceeds through conversation-heavy set-pieces as Joanna’s father – her mother is quickly won over by the charming Prentice – challenges his daughter’s fiance to explain how they will react to the inevitable obstacles their marriage will face.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"baf57e17b897b5be14bdb9a9a28356bd53af6799\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432229969264/aa5ecbb5-9683-43b9-ae59-60a318bdf83d-460x357.jpeg\" alt=\"Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger in In the Heat of the Night.

Photograph: Moviestore collection LTD</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Watching the film today, it’s fascinating to see how much it strains to reassure its audience even as it articulates their anxieties. As Kim Warren notes in <em>Poitier Revisited</em>, “the couple first meets in Hawaii, a state geographically disconnected from the continental United States, and they are on their way to the symbolically and politically neutral country of Switzerland”. The implication is that they will soon be some other nation’s problem. It is also made clear that the anxiety is shared by both sets of parents – the fathers, actually – and the most severe criticism of Prentice comes from Tillie, the black maid. “You ain’t foolin’ me for a minute,” she tells him. “I see what you are. You’re one of those smooth-talkin’ smart-ass niggers just out for all you can get with your black power and all that other trouble-making nonsense.”</p> \n<p>“Have you thought what people would say about you?” Joanna’s father asks Prentice. “In 16 or 17 states you’d be breakin’ the law. You’d be criminals.” “And say they changed the law?” replies Prentice. That exchange demonstrates how the film reflects the changing realities of interracial relationships at the time. In the same year that <em>Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner</em> was released, the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/law/us-supreme-court\">US supreme court</a> had ruled that states could no longer enforce laws that banned marriage on racial grounds. That decision was made after Mildred and Richard Loving, a black woman and her white husband, had been arrested and given a suspended jail sentence for violating a state law that prohibited marriage between white and black people. The court ruled on 12 June 1967. In September that year, Time magazine featured on its cover a young married couple, Peggy Rusk and Guy Smith; Peggy was white and Guy was black. “Mr and Mrs Guy Smith: an interracial wedding,” read the words below the image. The expressions on the faces of the newly married couple were ambiguous. She is smiling but he looks apprehensive, mindful perhaps of the words of the judge who had sentenced the Lovings: “Almighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents … the fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend the races to mix.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21de9a4abff8cdb498882e9dcdb8ea7abe95f0be\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432229787710/a6ef3275-0fa8-4adc-8fa2-bb20998c0595-460x349.jpeg\" alt=\"Sidney Poitier, Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967).

Photograph: Allstar/Columbia</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Poitier perfected playing parts that, in the words of <em>Poitier Revisited</em>, depicted “the accomplished, well-spoken, aspiring, mild-mannered black man that America ought not to fear, that the black middle class ought to be proud of, that racist white America would have trouble hating”. The film-makers created for him a character who was almost superhumanly gifted. Prentice had studied at Yale, worked for the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/world-health-organisation\">World Health Organisation</a> and is on his way to Geneva. The film further reassures by ridding him of any troublesome sexuality. At the start of the film his first wife and child have tragically died. The only kiss Prentice and Joanna share is visible in the rear-view mirror, and he makes it clear that he has yet to sleep with her. Poitier was condemned to asexuality in many of his films; one African-American critic referred to him as a “clean cut eunuch in the white world”.</p> \n<p>Poitier’s defence was that his films were “interesting, marvellous fables” and he was able positively to harness the fame and success they generated. Along with <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/us-news/harry-belafonte\">Harry Belafonte</a> and Jackie Robinson, he funded the African American Students Association, which provided university scholarships to Kenyan students. Among the students who benefited from the programme was a Kenyan called <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a>, who would later marry an American woman, and have a son with the same name. It is impossible to ignore the parallels between Poitier and Obama. When, in <em>Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner</em>, Joanna’s father asks Prentice if he has thought about the consequences of having children, Prentice tells him that “she feels that every single one of our children will be President of the United States, and they’ll all have colourful administrations”. “What people saw in candidate and President Obama,” <em>Poitier Revisited</em> argues, “they had seen decades before in the Poitier persona: cool, eloquence, genuine warmth, exceptionality, and ambiguity of identity. It was clear … Poitier had primed the white American imagination … for the historic election of the first black President of the United States.”</p> \n<p>Obama, elected with such hope and euphoria, has been accused of insufficient concern for the plight of African Americans. Poitier, too, was accused of being a white person’s fantasy of blackness. In a 1967 New York Times article entitled “Why Does White America Love Sidney Poitier So?”, he was dismissed as “the antiseptic, one-dimensional hero, a good guy in a totally white world, with no wife, no sweetheart, no woman to love or kiss, helping the white man solve the white man’s problems.” The assassination of King and the rise of blaxploitation left Poitier out of time. Yet despite the cartoonish perfection of Prentice, <em>Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner</em> is still relevant. I first saw it just before I introduced my then girlfriend to my family.

If you think his pottery is badly made, you should see some of the <a href=\"http://folkartmuseum.org/\" title=\"\">folk art</a> that’s tucked away in museums; he obviously has seen it, and mimics it. But there’s no magical transformation of the material. The endless quotations from cultural history in Perry’s art are predictable and glib. His take on contemporary society is shrill, repetitive and ultimately meaningless.</p> \n<p>The stupidity of his ceramics really takes the <a href=\"http://www.tooveys.com/lots.asp?WEBLOTID=198063&amp;LOTID=1412\" title=\"\">Staffordshire biscuit box</a>. Perry’s pots start with a cliched image of traditional ceramics as genteel bourgeois decor, then go about “subverting” this straw man with collaged pictures of council estates, angry kids and swearwords.

Walking among all the strident phrases and thinly drawn faces, I felt as if I was trapped in one of those parties <a href=\"http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000dXCFmm3nCRs/s/900/720/Michael-Heath-Cartoons-Punch-1981-09-02-362.jpg\" title=\"\">drawn by Michael Heath</a> where lots of trendy folk are talking bollocks.</p> \n<p>But wait, there’s more. When Grayson Perry was creating his early pottery in the 1980s, the exhibition reverently informs us, he also made Super 8 films. Here they are, lovingly restored. And very silly. So here he was in the 1980s, part of an avant garde group around the film-maker Derek Jarman, shooting eccentric little films, and making craft objects such as his mock-Saxon <a href=\"https://www.turnercontemporary.org/media/images/645/GP337_Early%20English%20Motorcycle%20Helmet_2011%20d%20x1000.jpg\" title=\"\">Early English Motorcycle Helmet</a>.

But two wrongs don’t make a right, and Damien Hirst does not justify Grayson Perry. The handicraft skills Perry possesses are fussy and uninspired.</p> \n<p>Here are his prints inspired by German art, with some nice details of old houses and blasted trees that are drowned out by the obsessive “relevance”. For once I would like to see Perry please himself with a work of art that is not about anything and not relevant to anything – something private. For it is privacy and silence that I miss in his work. Real art has mystery and otherness. It cannot be put into words. Instead, Perry makes slogans. He can and does explain everything he is doing. It is all a “statement”.</p> \n<p>This is art for those who need to be told what they are looking at and why it matters. No, that’s not fair. People are so busy these days. Art is not that big a part of most people’s lives. An artist who can deliver something quickly understandable and explain it 10 times over is doing the distracted modern audience a favour.

Being in a high-profile marriage [to the Saturdays singer Una Healy], I get the opportunity to go to big events like film premieres. I feel my best in a nice fitted black-tie suit – I&nbsp;think any man does. Obviously, all men look very similar in black tie, but there are little things you can do to add interest: the colour of the bow tie, cummerbund or braces. I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;designer stubble man – I look baby-faced when I am clean-shaven.

I let her neaten me up whenever she wants to, but I am not too worried about that sort of thing. I have shaved my legs before, but only when my legs or ankles have been strapped and taped because of injury; it’s painful when the tape rips your hairs out. I&nbsp;do shave my chest, because I am not a fan of the big hairy rug.</p> \n<p>I don’t have to work stupidly hard to stay in shape, and I am most confident about my shoulders, which are well formed. My calves are a bit weird, as they don’t have much definition, especially for somebody who is always running around. But, luckily, they are usually covered up by trousers or long socks.</p> \n<p>I have worn makeup for modelling photoshoots, but I wouldn’t wear it to an event: it would be too embarrassing if a fellow male caught me out, especially in the rugby world.

Farmer turned author John Lewis-Stempel also said writers of a certain age were inspired by the relatively good times they remembered from their 1970s childhoods. </p> \n<p>Lewis-Stempel’s book, Meadowland: The Private Life of an English Field, has been celebrated by readers and critics and won him the Thwaites Wainwright prize for nature writing. It is an intimate account of a year in the life of an English meadow, a hymn to the cowslips that that emerge in the spring, the hay-making of summer and the animals that live in and on the soil. </p> \n<p>Speaking at the Hay festival, just over the Welsh border from his Herefordshire farm, Lewis-Stempel said nature writing was a “boom area”. “In the digital age, I think people are looking for something real, and nature is real,” he added. “The rise in nature writing today goes alongside things like foraging.”</p> \n<p>Lewis-Stempel said he believed the resurgence coincided with the global financial crisis. “People were looking for something else. In the absence of religion, they turned to nature. It’s a search for values.” </p> \n<p>He said the demographic of many nature writers (“We’re not spring chickens”) might also have something to do with the trend. “We can remember the 1970s, when environmental disaster was if crude washed up on a beach in Devon and Cornwall.

Now, more than 2,000 paintings surveying <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2008/nov/05/uselections20083\">Obama’s</a> time in office have been plastered across the walls of the <a href=\"http://www.mocadetroit.org/\">Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit</a>, rendered in red, white and blue.</p> \n<p>This is not Pruitt’s only daily project. <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/sch/rpsfleamarket/m.html?item=131004190506&amp;pt=Antiques_Decorative_Arts&amp;hash=item1e80754f2a&amp;rt=nc&amp;_trksid=p2047675.l2562\">He has an eBay store</a> where he posts one object from his apartment each day. The funds from that endeavour go to a charity at the end of each year. And at the studio, he says people draw on lunch tables and calendars.</p> \n<p>Pruitt said that he likes projects with daily maintenance because he finds routine and repetition relaxing. </p> \n<p>“I like eating the same thing for dinner every night. I love flossing. I like watching the same television shows,” Pruitt told the Guardian. “There’s so much pressure in daily life, but there’s serenity in routine.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9368509f88b7104e1571ad4bcf89ab6f2747a154\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432315556972/eb5de9e7-f644-4c83-869f-3b1c766484e5-417x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Rob Pruitt's images of Obama. \" width=\"417\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rob Pruitt now has more than 2,000 paintings surveying Obama’s time in office.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>To begin each work, Pruitt searches online to see what Obama did the day before.

That film is then projected onto a canvas so that he can paint the image in what is the project’s trademark style – white expressionist brush strokes on a canvas covered in a spectrum of red to blue.</p> \n<p>“This may be hard to believe, but I never really thought about it at the beginning – I simply started with one painting on the first day,” Pruitt said. “I never imagined that one day I’d end up with almost 3,000 paintings of the president, so I’ve sort of surprised myself with how this project has grown.”</p> \n<p>When the project is over, there will be 2,922 2ft x 2ft square paintings of things like Obama standing alongside attorney general Eric Holder or meeting with foreign dignitaries.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8e65c5a653fd700249eaddcc2714dffbb2b26ad\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432316015209/16d77146-f607-4021-961f-c815283b7468-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Rob Pruitt's the Lincoln Monument. \" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rob Pruitt’s the Lincoln Monument.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pruitt’s favourite depiction is Michelle and Barack together, and he insists there was not a worst day to paint.
