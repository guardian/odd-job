Meet the rising actor who won’t let his ethnicity define him</p>","byline":"Jack Seale","body":"<p>It’s your early 20s. You’ve just emerged from higher education. Congratulations! Now go and live in a strange city to do a job you don’t like or understand, while painfully screwing up your first grown-up relationships. The obvious solution to not knowing what you’re doing is to party your way through it… but preferably without spiralling down to the point where you’re wasted 24/7, taking showers with your suit on, and being sick in your mouth during crucial meetings. That’s the fate of Danny, the young office manager played by Sacha Dhawan in queasily convincing new Channel 4 dramedy Not Safe for Work.</p> \n<p>This monstrous, immersive comic turn is a level-up role for the 31-year-old Mancunian, who has become dangerously close to ubiquitous in TV drama recently. He was a scene-stealing wrong ’un in Line Of Duty and Last Tango in Halifax and a bio-terrorist in Utopia, alongside gentler roles provided by his friend Mark Gatiss in The Tractate Middoth and Doctor Who biopic An Adventure In Space And Time.</p> \n<p>Perhaps most memorably of all, 10 years ago, Dhawan was one of the unknowns – along with Russell Tovey, Dominic Cooper, James Corden and NSFW co-star Samuel Barnett – given a golden ticket by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2006/oct/15/comedy.drama\">The History Boys</a>, the National Theatre play that became a global theatrical hit and, in 2006, a film.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvXgpLSRVYQ\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wvXgpLSRVYQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>“Alan Bennett! I’d studied him for my GCSEs!” exclaims Dhawan when he meets the Guide for coffee and eggs at a cafe near his north London flat, recalling the moment when he was lifted out of obscurity. Since then, he’s become one of the most visible British-Asian actors on TV, never once typecast by his ethnicity. Look again at most of his roles: they could have easily been played by a white actor.</p> \n<p>“The generation who will watch Not Safe For Work, my generation, don’t care who plays a part,” he says. “Sometimes there’s all this baggage: we’ve got to have this about his family, we’ve got to mention this. Cliches. There’s no freedom to own it.”</p> \n<p>Initially, NSFW centres on Katherine (Zawe Ashton), a civil servant exiled from London to Northampton, where the immigration think tank she created has been relocated and staffed with idiots. Ashton is brilliant as a young woman reacting fiercely as her potential glugs down the toilet. But it’s Dhawan who gives the show its grotesque comic guts as Katherine’s terrifyingly mashed boss: you’ll feel hung over just watching.</p> \n<p>Dhawan’s approach was not so much method as methodical. “I’ve seen actors play addicts and it can be a little generic,” he says. “But Danny takes a lot of different substances – coke, ketamine, pills, marijuana, sweets, chocolate – so I wanted to make every reaction specific. I talked to loads of people and watched loads of footage. There’s stuff on YouTube where people film their mates on ketamine.”</p> \n<p>Could he have just spent a weekend trying all the drugs himself? “I did think: ‘Maybe I’ll do that.’ Then I thought: ‘I might die.’”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d8fe19816d678b046c3ba5bb0b14742a5df503c5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435161006066/237a8c73-bdb0-4141-93db-e8d70cb53a1f-327x420.jpeg\" alt=\"History in the making: Dhawan with Alan Bennett.\" width=\"327\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">History in the making: Dhawan with Alan Bennett on the History Boys set</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>TV has historically struggled to accurately capture the weightless dread of realising you’re ill-equipped for adulthood. Not Safe For Work is, unless Being Human counts, the first attempt in quite some time. Originally titled Cut and promoted with the emphasis on graduates being caught by austerity, it’s developed into a more rounded look at characters who have all stalled for subtly sad reasons. Writer DC Moore gives the ensemble cast a distinct speech pattern: halting, vulnerable, defensively sarcastic. “Everyone’s misplaced, searching for some kind of stability,” Dhawan says. “Danny’s basically never had any form of guidance. He’s been born and left to his own devices.”</p> \n<p>You can understand why Dhawan names Not Safe For Work as his favourite role. He professes not to care about how it could promote him from solid supporting actor to star. “I’m interested in the dark horse. It’s too scary being the face of something, unless it’s really right. A lot of young actors want to get a lead role, get into Hollywood. I do everything slow and steady.”</p> \n<p>Dhawan has, in fact, been to America already: in 2010 he was cast in Outsourced, an NBC culture-clash sitcom set in a Mumbai call centre.</p> \n<p>“After the success of Slumdog Millionaire,” he recalls, “America said: ‘We can do our Indian thing now. Indian actors are funny! They can dance!’ They saw a gap in the market.”</p> \n<p>He auditioned for the show in London and, before he knew it, he had signed a five-year deal and was living in LA, getting the fear. “I loved the work, but I remember being in the hotel, on the top floor. You couldn’t even open the window, and I thought: ‘This is my home?’ And I felt so sad.

Javid said the CBI had been showing a commitment to remaining part of the EU even without these reforms. </p> \n<p>“You know how negotiation works. You wouldn’t sit down at the start of a merger or acquisition and, like a poker player showing his hand to the table, announce exactly what terms you were prepared to accept,” said Javid. “It doesn’t work in the boardroom and it won’t work in Brussels.”</p> \n<p> His remarks were reported just hours after the CBI announced that Fairbairn, a former head of strategy at the BBC and ITV, would be its new director general.</p> \n<p>Fairbairn, 54, will replace John Cridland – who has led the CBI since January 2011 – in November. She will be the first woman to lead the organisation, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year.</p> \n<p>It was already clear that one of Fairbairn’s main tasks will be to shape the CBI’s stance for the coming EU referendum.<br /></p> \n<p>Cridland and Sir Michael Rake, the CBI president, have supported Britain remaining in the EU but have been criticised for representing the view of big companies over smaller businesses.</p> \n<p>Ahead of Javid’s speech, the CBI said Fairbairn supported its advocacy of Britain remaining in a reformed EU. The CBI’s members voted eight to two in favour of the position two years ago, but some big companies, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/17/jcb-boss-says-eu-exit-could-lift-burden-of-bureaucracy-on-uk-businesses\">including JCB</a>, have taken a more hostile line on membership.</p> \n<p>A CBI spokesman said: “Most CBI members are clear that the EU gives us access to 500 million consumers and helps set the global trade agenda. <br /></p> \n<p>“But reform must be an ongoing process and we support the government’s push for Brussels to focus on the big ticket issues, like signing more trade deals and doing less where it doesn’t add value.”</p> \n<p>Rake said: “Carolyn is a remarkable business leader with an impressive background as an economist, journalist, management consultant and policy strategist. Her wealth and breadth of experience will be critical in steering the CBI through choppy political and economic waters, including an EU referendum.”</p> \n<p>Fairbairn began her career as an economist at the World Bank and then worked as a journalist at the Economist and as a management consultant at McKinsey &amp; Co. </p> \n<p>She was also a Downing Street policy adviser from 1995-97 when John Major was prime minister and ITV’s director of strategy between 2007 and 2010.</p> \n<p>Fairbairn was on secondment from McKinsey when she worked at Downing Street. Since then she has not been a member of a political party, donated to a party or otherwise been involved with party politics, the CBI said.</p> \n<p>Having spent seven years at the BBC, where, as the director of strategy, she helped launch Freeview, Fairbairn <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2004/oct/06/broadcasting.bbc1\">quit in late 2004</a> to spend a year travelling with her partner, Peter Chittick, who is now her husband, and their children.<br /></p> \n<p>Her decision took the BBC by surprise when the broadcaster was in the middle of a tough charter review process. Chittick had just cashed in on the &pound;66m sale of the Hotel du Vin chain he helped launch 10 years earlier.</p> \n<p>Fairbairn was also a non-executive director at the Financial Services Authority for three years from 2008 and worked on the FSA’s separation into two regulators.</p> \n<p>The CBI, which is the UK’s main business lobby group, said she was chosen from an initial list of 46 candidates that was whittled down to a shortlist of six. </p> \n<p>Cridland was a CBI veteran when he became director general but the organisation has opted for an outsider in Fairbairn. Katja Hall, the CBI’s deputy director general, was thought to be a strong candidate for the job.</p> \n<p>Fairbairn will also have to steer the CBI’s response to a further round of spending cuts planned by the chancellor, George Osborne. Cridland has broadly supported austerity measures, though the CBI has called for more infrastructure investment to support growth.</p> \n<p>She said: “The debate around Britain’s relationship with the EU and the productivity challenge facing our economy will be two of the defining issues of the next few years, and I greatly look forward to representing the voice of British businesses of all sizes on these questions and many others.”<br /></p> \n<p>Fairbairn is a non-executive director at the outsourcing company Capita, Lloyds Banking Group, the manufacturer Vitec, the Competition and Markets Authority and the UK Statistics Authority.
