A day later, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/08/ariana-grande-donut-i-hate-america-video\">Grande issued a statement</a> in which she apologised for her words and added that when she said them, she had been upset by America’s obesity rate.</p> \n<p>The statement did not bring an end to the scandal. On Wednesday, police in Lake Elsinore, California, and public health officials from Riverside County said they were <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jul/09/california-police-investigate-ariana-grande-doughnut-licking-incident?CMP=share_btn_tw\">investigating</a>, while the manager of Wolfee Donuts said the store did not normally leave doughnuts out. </p> \n<p>The day after the video was released, MLB Communications tweeted that Grande withdrew as the headliner for the MLB all-star concert because of “health issues”. She will be replaced by Demi Lovato. In a statement Grande wrote that she had “emergency oral surgery” and was still <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/618216636575715329\">recovering from having her wisdom teeth removed</a>.</p> \n<p>Grande, who was born in Boca Raton, Florida, 22 years ago, is known for a string of pop hits, having collaborated with stars such as Nicki Minaj and Jessie J. She began her showbiz career, however, as a child actor, with a role in the Broadway play 13. She went on to play small parts in TV shows such as iCarly and Winx Club: Enchantix.</p> \n<p>She then landed the role of Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon’s Victorious, and stayed with the show for three years until it ended. She starred in a spinoff, Sam &amp; Cat, which ended after only 35 episodes, allegedly because of difficulties between Grande and her co-star, Jennette McCurdy.</p> \n<p>Grande’s music career began during her time on Victorious, when she signed with Republic Records and released Put Your Hearts Up, a single aimed at young fans of the show. Her real musical debut came in 2013, however, when she released The Way, a single that made it into the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 and went triple platinum. The release of a full album, Yours Truly, increased her popularity.</p> \n<p>Grande released a second album, My Everything, which reached No1 in the US. She has enjoyed continued success with songs like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS1g8G_njx8\">Problem</a>, Break Free, Bang Bang and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5qU7p7yOY8\">Love Me Harder</a>, and is now working on a third album, Moonlight. She will also return to acting this year with a role in Scream Queens, a comedy horror show about vengeance on the anniversary of a sorority pledge gone wrong.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oja97POVbM8\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oja97POVbM8?start=46&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed&amp;start=46\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Grande is no stranger to negative press.

But the doughnut-licking incident has stirred conversation not just among her fans, but other celebrities. </p> \n<p>The Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon, for example, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SusanSarandon/status/619155767866863617\">tweeted</a>: “Today, lick a doughnut in solidarity with @ArianaGrande. A sweet, talented, true American.”</p> \n<p>The actor Rob Lowe did not have such a favorable reaction to Grande’s statement. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobLowe/status/618882358293311488\">tweeted</a>: “As my grandpa would say: ‘Yeah, sure. Pull the other leg, it plays jingle bells!’ #Lame”.</p> \n<p>Female stars from Madonna to Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus have come back from far bigger controversies – so Grande’s career may not have been licked just yet.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3af58fa083ac471f0ebb09ee4d806526bfaed0aa/0_53_2760_1656/2760.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1656,"width":2760,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP","altText":"Ariana Grande","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T17:48:52Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T19:13:49Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":83,"contributors":[{"name":"Ellen Brait","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ellen-brait"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Music","US news","World news","Pop and rock","California"],"tags":[{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock"},{"id":"us-news/california","webTitle":"California"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ellen Brait","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ellen-brait"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jul/09/ariana-grande-doughnut-licking-scandal-unlikely-derail-career","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agja","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jul/09/ariana-grande-doughnut-licking-scandal-unlikely-derail-career","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/09/ariana-grande-doughnut-licking-scandal-unlikely-derail-career"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3af58fa083ac471f0ebb09ee4d806526bfaed0aa/0_53_2760_1656/2760.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1656,"width":2760,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Grande is no stranger to negative press.

Here are five key questions Miller and Lord need to answer before the cameras roll.</p> \n<h2>How old should Solo be, and who should play him?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29b1188515c2cb496545582f18bfe7c96fd26988\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436357509151/96063384-d1bb-4db0-8140-ce5b87c86fe1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"From Mad Max to Han Solo? …&nbsp;Nicholas Hoult.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From Mad Max to Han Solo? … Nicholas Hoult</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/14/nicholas-hoult-mad-max-fury-road-interview\">Mad Max’s Nicholas Hoult on hanging off lorries and channeling Andrex puppies</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Reports suggest that Lord and Miller’s take will be an origins story, and Star Wars lore reckons Solo was around 29 during the events of the first movie, so it’s perhaps unsurprising that Hollywood sites have been pushing young twentysomethings such as Taron Egerton (25), Ansel Elgort (21) and Nicholas Hoult (25) for the role of the iconic space smuggler. Yet Ford himself was 33 when he began filming Star Wars, his seniority over Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) giving Solo an essential wily world-weariness. And there’s something about the idea of a fresh-faced take on the Corellian scoundrel that jars. </p> \n<p>If Disney-owned Lucasfilm is looking to ape the success of Marvel with its plan for a Star Wars cinematic universe, it should bear in mind that its sister studio has generally plumped for seasoned actors over callow ingenues when casting iconic heroes. Picking an act in their early 30s, perhaps playing a few years younger, would allow Solo to retain just enough of his “been around the block” swagger to keep him recognisable to fans. If Aaron Paul (35 and bookies’ favourite), Taylor Kitsch (34) and Chris Pratt (36) are just too old for the role – well they’d still make better choices than those previously mentioned. Paul, at least, seems more than keen, and someone at Star Wars – even if it’s just the social media editor – is evidently interested.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/aaronpaul_8/statuses/618633123304243200\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My dreams are coming true. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarWars?src=hash\">#StarWars</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/RuyQ1iTfIg\">https://t.co/RuyQ1iTfIg</a></p>— Aaron Paul (@aaronpaul_8) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronpaul_8/status/618633123304243200\">July 8, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Then again, the American actor just doesn’t look like a Han Solo type to me, though perhaps I’m being swayed by hours of watching him as a whiny meth addict in Breaking Bad. Second-favourite Aaron Taylor-Johnson has the right mix of brawn and swagger, and is capable of playing older than his 25 years.</p> \n<h2>How did Han and Chewbacca meet?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76e1395993dbe75b156cdce8f2407c34e2d816d5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436356885117/77212129-069f-4e49-a51f-3e4437c3ff7a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Good old days …&nbsp;Han and Chewie in the new movie.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Good old days … Han and Chewbacca in the new movie The Force Awakens.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/gallery/2014/jan/16/behind-the-scenes-of-star-wars-in-pictures\">Behind the scenes of Star Wars – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Since the Wookiee co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon is more than 200 years old during the events of the original trilogy, it stands to reason that he and Solo were not always friends. Expanded-universe novels about the smuggler suggest he met his eventual sidekick while working as a pilot on an Imperial slave ship. After he refuses orders to flay the wookiee, Solo and his new pal escape with the help of rebels and the hairy eight-foot-tall humanoid swears a life debt to his saviour. Disney is highly unlikely to borrow too much from the non-canonical books, but Lord and Miller will surely take the chance to bring back one of the saga’s best-known heroes, and explain why he displays such selfless loyalty to Solo. See also: How did Han meet Lando Calrissian and successfully prise the Falcon from his old pal’s possession.</p> \n<h2>Why does Solo hate the Force?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"472fe9037ba61c27df98b06a391c60b2352e9772\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436356936799/96dee2c4-0cf8-4994-a523-6e6e4bb91adb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Gunning for the Force, but why? …&nbsp;Han Solo.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gunning for the Force, but why? … Han Solo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/LUCASFILM/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Han displays a determined scorn for Jedi-like behaviour in the events of the original trilogy. Again, the expanded universe has an answer here, suggesting that the young Solo was once the victim of a religious fraud which left him a distinct non-believer in regard to spiritual matters. The smart route for Lord and Miller would be to avoid delving too deep into such matters: it’s enough for us to know that the Jedi were almost extinct at the beginning of 1977’s Star Wars, so it would hardly be rare for more cynical citizens of the galaxy to view their supposed powers as the stuff of myth and legend. We do, however, need to know how Solo became so world-weary in the first place.</p> \n<h2>How did Han upset Jabba the Hutt?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bbde1c3a550c809f2de73d499e79ca4f2cc1067\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436356995270/62cfd932-5554-42e8-8418-97a4bdace2a8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Han and Jabba the Hut\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mountain out of a molehill? … Han and Jabba</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>George Lucas’s decision to include a CGI version of the corpulent alien in the 1997 special edition of Star Wars will always go down as one of the most misguided film-making decisions ever to rear its ugly head in Hollywood. And Miller and Lord will presumably think carefully before introducing their own youthful, perambulatory version of the iconic gangster. Nevertheless, we know from the original movies that Solo owes a large debt to Jabba that he is either unwilling or unable to pay before being captured by Darth Vader’s forces in Cloud City and transported to the repugnant alien’s Tatooinese lair. Surely the origins of this storyline will play some part in the new film.</p> \n<h2>Did Han really make the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs, and what does that even mean?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bosSsgzgenA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bosSsgzgenA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/apr/16/star-wars-jj-abrams-the-force-awakens\">Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer – a return to the series' strengths</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Solo’s boast at the beginning of 1977’s Star Wars can be read in a number of ways. Since a parsec is a unit of distance, rather than time, the smuggler may simply have been talking a load of nonsense in order to secure the patronage of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker for their trip to Alderaan. George Lucas has said the apparent paradox of a ship covering an 18 parsec route without travelling the full distance can be explained by the Falcon’s advanced navigational computer rather than its engines, which allow it to calculate a smarter route. The expanded universe picks up on the anomaly, suggesting the route itself skirted a cluster of black holes, with Solo managing to cut down his travel time by flying dangerously close to the cosmic bodies. Now wouldn’t that make a scene to rival Han’s romp through the Hoth asteroid field in The Empire Strikes Back?<br /></p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436357459132/d5bbe472-7898-4c0a-907d-4f016e547917-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Larry Busacca/Getty Images","altText":"Aaron Paul in 2014.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Larry Busacca/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436357510527/96063384-d1bb-4db0-8140-ce5b87c86fe1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"From Mad Max to Han Solo? … Nicholas Hoult","credit":"Allstar/WARNER BROS.
