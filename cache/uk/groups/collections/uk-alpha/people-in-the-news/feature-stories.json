Larkin receives Trickett’s letter on 8 October 1968, and after “the luxury of a few minutes day-dreaming on the subject”, writes to dissuade her from putting his name forward.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/26/wole-soyinka-not-too-grand-and-old-oxford-poetry-chair-melvyn-bragg\">Wole Soyinka dismisses claims he is too grand and old for Oxford poetry chair</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The poet tells Trickett he is entirely “unfitted” for the role. “I have never considered literature in the abstract since that blessed day in 1943 when I laid down my pen in the Sheldonian Theatre and sauntered out into the sunshine, a free man; anything I have written since then has either been hack journalism or cries wrung from me by what I believe Gide calls the frightful contact with hideous reality,” writes one of the 20th century’s most beloved poets.</p> \n<p>He adds that he has so far given just one lecture in his life – “I hated it, and a number of people walked out in the first few minutes” – before explaining that the increasing publicity which comes with the position makes him “quite unsuited” to the position.</p> \n<p>“My idea of hell on earth (physical pain excepted, and I am not sure that it is excepted even in this case) is a literary party, and I have an uneasy feeling that the post carries with it a lot of sherry-drill with important people,” he writes, describing himself nonetheless as “deeply honoured” to be approached.</p> \n<p>Larkin would go on to be nominated for the position, seen as the second most important in British poetry behind the laureateship, by former incumbent WH Auden, in 1972 – and to decline again. He also turned down the poet laureateship in 1984.</p> \n<p>“There’s a letter from him declining the subsequent offer [which has been published], but this one is much more interesting,” said <a href=\"http://www.english.ox.ac.uk/about-faculty/faculty-members/20th-21st-century/mcdonald-dr-peter-d\">Peter Mcdonald</a>, professor of English and related literature at St Hugh’s. “His description of life in Oxford is wonderful …. His description of his career as hack journalism, his dismissal of the rest of his writing – it’s extremely pithy and funny.”</p> \n<p>Larkin’s comments about “sherry-drill” link to his “wonderfully sardonic” poem <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/178056\">Vers de Societ&eacute;</a>, said McDonald. Larkin writes in that poem: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I could spend half my evenings, if I wanted,<br />Holding a glass of washing sherry, canted<br />Over to catch the drivel of some bitch<br />Who’s read nothing but <em>Which</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Mcdonald said: “It’s not a dashed-off letter. He’s writing to someone he knows quite well, and who he has a lot of common ground with. He’s not just rebuffing it – it’s interesting because it is heartfelt.”</p> \n<p>In the wake of the revelation earlier this week that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/26/times-literary-supplement-philip-larkin-poem-claim\">an apparently unpublished poem by Larkin released by the Times Literary Supplement was most likely to have been by the Hull poet Frank Redpath</a>, Mcdonald said there was “absolutely no doubt” the letter was by Larkin. “It’s on his letterhead, with his signature,” he said. “The authenticity is not in question.”</p> \n<p>The discovery comes as the five candidates for this year’s position – Simon Armitage, Soyinka, AE Stallings, Ian Gregson and Se&aacute;n Haldane – face a vote by Oxford graduates to replace current incumbent Geoffrey Hill. <a href=\"http://www.votebyinternet.com/oxfordpoetry15\">Graduates must register to vote by 8 June</a>, with voting to run until 17 June.</p> \n<p>McDonald is one of Soyinka’s nominators for the position – all candidates must be backed by at least 50 Oxford graduates – but said he thought that either Stallings or Armitage “would also bring something absolutely unique and important to the role … I think it’s a pretty open field and I would be happy if any of those three get it,” he said.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week, a kerfuffle broke out after Bragg told the Sunday Times he had decided to back Armitage rather than the 80-year-old Soyinka over concerns the Nobel laureate would not “bother to come to Oxford”. </p> \n<p>“Soyinka is a grand man … I also query his age,” Bragg said. Soyinka dismissed the concerns: “How curious that anyone would even speculate that I would allow busy and committed people – friends, colleagues and total strangers – to waste their time nominating and campaigning on my behalf for such a prestigious position if I were not serious about contesting,” he said.</p> \n<p>The professor of poetry role has been held in the past by names from Seamus Heaney to Matthew Arnold. The holder is required to give three lectures a year. </p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432907944969/988ab1f8-5e6c-4fde-b163-cb7b50e58854-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jane Bown for the Observer","altText":"Philip Larkin in 1979.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jane Bown for the Observer"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-01T07:00:13Z","lastModified":"2015-06-01T07:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":5,"contributors":[{"name":"Alison Flood","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/alisonflood"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Philip Larkin","Oxford professor of poetry","Poetry","Books","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"books/philiplarkin","webTitle":"Philip Larkin"},{"id":"books/oxford-professor-of-poetry","webTitle":"Oxford professor of poetry"},{"id":"books/poetry","webTitle":"Poetry"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"books"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Alison Flood","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/alisonflood"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"books"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jun/01/philip-larkins-refusal-of-oxford-poetry-professor-nomination-discovered","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49b7p","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/books/2015/jun/01/philip-larkins-refusal-of-oxford-poetry-professor-nomination-discovered","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/01/philip-larkins-refusal-of-oxford-poetry-professor-nomination-discovered"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432907944969/988ab1f8-5e6c-4fde-b163-cb7b50e58854-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Thanks but no thanks ...

For example, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-melina-mercouri-1427550.html\" title=\"\">Melina Mercouri</a> refused to wear high-waisted dresses on <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2009/may/24/joseph-losey-film-director\" title=\"\">Joseph Losey</a>’s The Gypsy and the Gentleman (1958), set in the Regency era, preferring a shape that she believed to be more flattering to her figure. “I had to make some adjustments, though some of her outfits ended up far too modern looking.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3e3fc2aff7ab3c82665ed050f4fb3e5b44a9153e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/31/1433086029020/59b13e39-c165-4060-80ea-66a40aadf760-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Julie Harris's sketch for the 1979 film version of Dracula.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julie Harris’s sketch for the 1979 film version of Dracula.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BFI</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw (1958), a producer asked Harris to raise Jayne Mansfield’s plunging neckline to a more modest level. But when the star saw that the bar-room girls in the film had more revealing costumes, she objected strongly. Harris had to adjust all their necklines to be higher than Mansfield’s.</p> \n<p>In 1955, when a group of Rank stars went to the Venice film festival to publicise British films, Harris designed the notorious <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/british-actress-diana-dors-wearing-a-mink-bikini-whilst-news-photo/51154273\" title=\"\">“mink” bikini</a> that was worn by Diana Dors in a gondola. Actually, unbeknown to the newspapers that splashed photos of Dors over its pages, the bikini was made from rabbit fur.</p> \n<p>Harris designed for a whole range of films throughout her career, although she complained that “people only notice the costumes in period films”, not realising how much detail goes into contemporary clothes, always with the personality of the character in mind.</p> \n<p>“You do sketches first when you do period films. People think that the sketches are quite pretty and they like that and that’s how it’s got to be. But with modern clothes it’s different because the director can look at them and might say: ‘Oh, my wife wouldn’t like that.’ They all think they know about modern clothes,” Harris commented. “I think I was the person who first got the Beatles out of their collarless jackets into proper shirts and ties in Hard Day’s Night.”</p> \n<p>As colour films became more prevalent, Harris was able to experiment with a range of fabrics of different shades. She had particular fun with the bizarre costumes in Casino Royale (1967), the spy spoof with a multitude of James Bonds. She was also costume designer on Roger Moore’s first Bond movie, Live and Let Die (1973), and worked on Alfred Hitchcock’s penultimate film, Frenzy (1972).</p> \n<p>Her personal favourite was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2013/may/09/bryan-forbes-obituary\" title=\"\">Bryan Forbes</a>’s The Slipper and the Rose (1976), a retelling of the Cinderella story, which contained an array of gorgeous ballgowns. She had won a Bafta for her Victorian costumes in Forbes’s The Wrong Box 10 years previously. The last feature film on which Harris got solo credit was Dracula (1979), in which she was responsible for the elegant, silk-pleated batwing cloak worn by Frank Langella in the title role. She was one of the team of designers on The Great Muppet Caper (1981).</p> \n<p>On her retirement in 1991, after working on television, which included two Sherlock Holmes TV movies, The Sign of Four and The Hound of the Baskervilles (both 1983), and the mini-series A Perfect Hero (1991), she became a successful oil painter.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Diana Julie Harris, costume designer, born 26 March 1921; died 30 May 2015</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/31/1433084175419/Julie-Harris-in-1967.-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Julie Harris in 1967.

Next up is The Clangers, the show about pink, knitted, mouse-like whistling aliens created in 1969 by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin. But fans of the gentle, slightly surreal series can rest assured <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2015/clangers-eclipse\" title=\"\">the Clangers have not been given a CGI makeover</a> or modernised for their new CBeebies series later this month.</p> \n<p>As its <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2014/sep/08/michael-palin-clangers-narrate-monty-python-tv\" title=\"\">narrator Michael Palin</a> explains: “I’m very glad that they didn’t make major changes to The Clangers because it’s a lovely formula that works. I think part of what makes it work is that in some ways it’s mundane – they use sort of tin lids and elastic bands and all sorts of things to make stuff and I like that.</p> \n<p>“I think that’s encouraging children to think for themselves, not press a button and have it all done for them sort of digitally. There’s definitely an element of the old technology to the Clangers’ planet and the Clangers themselves. That appeals to me greatly.”</p> \n<p>“I loved watching The Clangers with our children,” Palin recalls. “It calmed everything down and I think possibly these days when everything is such a rush and there are so many demands on our time, ‘Do this, do that, get that done, know about this, find out about that’. The Clangers will be a little oasis of calm and that’s what’s so appealing.”</p> \n<p>Palin adds: “I find the Clangers’ world not only calming but therapeutic. There’s a Zen dimension to it. For anyone who says things are getting on top of them I’d say, ‘Don’t spend thousands on a spa, just spend a weekend on the Blue Planet!’”</p> \n<p>The first two series were narrated by Postgate – who died in 2008 – and Palin, who has not voiced a regular children’s TV series before, said it was “an honour” to be asked to take on the role and even his children were impressed. “I decided to do it without a second thought because The Clangers is special, there’s nothing quite like that little world that was created by Postgate and Firmin all those years ago.</p> \n<p>“I remember watching with my children and finding it just wonderfully peaceful with a little bit of wicked mischief to it throughout which was a very nice combination. To me it’s one of the great classics, it’s like being asked to be Biggles or something like that. I was honoured to be asked really.”</p> \n<p>Jo Chalkley, one of the animators working on the series, came back into stop-frame animation from working on Lego computer games because of her fond memories of The Clangers. She was relieved to find out they are, “not wearing baseball hats and texting. It’s like the original – it’s just lovely.”</p> \n<p>Palin says, “the whole idea was to keep it as close to the original in the sense of the design and look of the planet”, with the series filmed in the same 12 movements per second. “They’ve made a new set of puppets that move cleverly [and] are quite complex creatures so you can get more movement out of them. But the sounds they make are the same, the people in their world are pretty much the same.</p> \n<p>“The scripts are all freshly written but in the spirit of the old stories. So it’s very much like picking it up where it left off and I quite like that as one of the great things for me about The Clangers is they seem to be completely timeless, they’ll always be there, leading their lives and trying to get by day by day with their little problems that occur. There’s a lovely feeling of permanence that’s rather reassuring really.”</p> \n<p>Postgate’s son Dan, who has written some of the scripts, said when co-producers Coolabi and the BBC first talked with his family’s company Smallfilms about reviving The Clangers, “I thought there might be a desire to speed things up and make things a bit more sugary, quick cutting and fast stories”; but he was relieved when they said, “no we don’t want to do that, we want to keep that sort of nice mellow, gentle approach to it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/mediamonkeyblog/2015/mar/19/clangers-make-a-whistlestop-bbc-return-to-explain-solar-eclipse\">Clangers make a whistlestop return to BBC to explain solar eclipse</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“To do the new series it was naturally going to be something unknown, so many more people were involved, but I think it’s come together fantastically well and have been delighted with the way it’s turned out. I think we’ve kept all the ethos and values of the original and added it to it. I couldn’t be more happy really. It’s worked very well.”</p> \n<p>Like Aidan Turner when he was chosen to play Poldark, Postgate says he felt a huge responsibility to fans of the original series of The Clangers. And to his father: “I don’t want to be the one where everybody goes, ‘Oh God what has his son done!’”</p> \n<p>All the Clangers now have an individual swanee whistle – ranging from a small wooden one for Tiny to a large 1930s Bakelite one for Granny – so children can differentiate between them more. With the help of Firmin, the show’s makers, stop-frame company Factory, and puppet makers Mackinnon and Saunders have also created some new elements, which Firmin had already dreamt up but not had the resources to make before, such as Mother’s garden and Major’s workshop.</p> \n<p>As they have been asked to make 52 11-minute episodes, the team have scaled up production with nine sets and around 35 puppets so the six animators can work on episodes in parallel. The attention to detail is extraordinary. Hundreds of tiny working props, ranging from shears to radios have been created. The team even bought up the entire dye batch of a colour of wool called Old Rose to ensure repairs to the puppets during filming and in future would be done in exactly the same colour.</p> \n<p>“You’ve got to make sure the puppets are robust and under HD you can see every flaw,” says Factory managing director Phil Chalk.</p> \n<p>Six knitters worked full time to make the pink skins that surround the sophisticated, mechanical inner workings of the Clangers, using three kilometres of wool. The skins were based – with a few tweaks – on the original pattern created by Firmin’s wife in the 1960s and which will be available on the CBeebies’ Pinterest page. Although a certain amount of new technology is used, as with the painting out of the little rigs used to hold the Clangers to make them jump, the stars in the background are made in the same way as in the originals – by drilling holes in the back of the set so light shines through.</p> \n<p>Familiar characters such as the Soup Dragon and Iron Chicken remain, plus the music trees. Music – done by long-time Monty Python collaborator John du Prez – plays an even bigger part than before, with the whole score pitched in line with the Clangers’ whistles. CBeebies executive producer Jackie Edwards says: “That’s the beautiful thing about it, the programme is so rich because every single element has been thought through. It’s a proper labour of love.”</p> \n<p>Dan Maddicott, the series producer for Coolabi who also plays the Clangers’ whistles, adds: “I’ve worked on a lot of programmes and this is really a happy series, everyone working on it almost feels privileged to work on it.” Chalk explains: “A lot of the animators were inspired to get involved in stop-frame animation by The Clangers. So to be part of the re-imagining is something else.” Were they tempted to use CGI? “We would never have got the rights,” says Maddicott. “It took a lot of discussion, not to persuade Peter and Dan but to be clear that we were going to do it properly. They would never have agreed to one mention of CGI.”</p> \n<p>Edwards adds, “And we wouldn’t have bought it”.Chalk says: “We have to be mindful of the target audience. This isn’t a vanity project, we’re trying to reintroduce a heritage brand to a CBeebies audience. It’s got to be authentic because that audience have no preconceptions of what The Clangers are or where they live – it’s completely brand new.”</p> \n<p>“But with the “heart and tone” of the original, explains Edwards.</p> \n<p>In the 1970s The Clangers was not well known outside the UK, mostly because it did not need additional funding. The TV market is very different now and the show has been pre-sold abroad, including funding from NBC company Sprout, to broadcasters including Australia’s ABC network. It can travel easily as the different territories can add their own narrator. William Shatner is doing the US version – an obvious choice given the Star Trek star’s space connection.</p> \n<p>Is The Clangers’ comeback part of a rekindled love affair with space, due to recent exploration programmes, or part of a wider trend for nostalgia on-screen?</p> \n<p>Palin says space is “always fascinating for children”, particularly now with pictures being sent from other planets, but also it could be just that the series “were well done and they’re much-loved. Around The Clangers’ time was a golden age of children’s television and that’s been revisited possibly by the children who grew up then and remember it fondly and are now in a position to produce them or bring them back.”</p> \n<p>They may well have the chance with another, Ivor the Engine, as Postgate reveals he “might be able to so something” with the 50s and 70s series about a Welsh steam locomotive, perhaps as live action, rather than animation. “There are new techniques and ways of doing things that make the possibility there. I think there’s a certain dramatic quality to Ivor the Engine. My dad was a big fan of Dylan Thomas and Under Milk Wood and I’ve got this sort of idea of looking at Wales in a quite mystical sort of way.”</p> \n<p>“I think there’s something quite nice that could be looked at and expanded upon with all the eccentric characters involved. But not necessarily for children … maybe something that could be for everybody really. That interests me quite a lot.”</p> \n<p>“I was listening to Cerys Matthews signing the other day and I thought she’d be really good as Idris wouldn’t she?”</p> \n<p>But what about the urban myth that the original series of The Clangers contained some swearing? Firmin clears that up: “I wish journalists would take time to look at the script which is reproduced in The Art of Smallfilms, page 146. The line that has led to that myth is: ‘Oh, dammit. The B thing’s stuck again!’ There was never another line like that and will never be. And it was whistled!”</p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432914452371/The-Clangers-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The new CBeebies series of The Clangers will be narrated by Michael Palin.","credit":"PR","altText":"The Clangers","cleanCaption":"The new CBeebies series of The Clangers will be narrated by Michael Palin."}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-31T18:00:08Z","lastModified":"2015-05-31T23:10:06Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":92,"contributors":[{"name":"Tara Conlan","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/taraconlan"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["CBeebies","Media","BBC","Television industry","Children's TV","Michael Palin","Culture","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"media/cbeebies","webTitle":"CBeebies"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC"},{"id":"media/television","webTitle":"Television industry"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/childrens-tv","webTitle":"Children's TV"},{"id":"culture/michael-palin","webTitle":"Michael Palin"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"media"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tara Conlan","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/taraconlan"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"media"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/may/31/michael-palin-clangers-oasis-of-calm","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49bda","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/media/2015/may/31/michael-palin-clangers-oasis-of-calm","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/may/31/michael-palin-clangers-oasis-of-calm"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432914452371/The-Clangers-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The new CBeebies series of The Clangers will be narrated by Michael Palin.","credit":"PR","altText":"The Clangers","cleanCaption":"The new CBeebies series of The Clangers will be narrated by Michael Palin."}},"importance":4,"kicker":{"title":"Michael Palin"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[]},{"title":"Mary Lambert / I realised that all the mums were crying","rawTitle":"I realised that all the mums were crying","item":{"type":"article","id":"music/2015/may/31/mary-lambert-interview-new-album-heart-on-my-sleeve","title":"One to watch: Mary Lambert","trailText":"The Same Love singer with a talent for making people cry explains why stardom has given her reason to be joyful","standFirst":"The Same Love singer with a talent for making people cry explains why stardom has given her reason to be joyful","byline":"Kathryn Bromwich","body":"<p>When singer-songwriter Mary Lambert performed in public for the first time, aged nine, she reduced a roomful of adults to tears. She sang a lullaby she had written at a girl scout talent show: “Hush little babe, don’t say a word,” it went, “Mama’s gonna buy you a brand new life.”</p> \n<p>“I looked out and I realised that all the mums were crying. I think I said sorry,” she says. Writing music was Lambert’s way of coping after being repeatedly sexually abused by her father as a child. “I didn’t know how to get through that amount of trauma and function. I really believe that if I didn’t have songwriting I wouldn’t be alive.”</p> \n<p>Her debut album <em>Heart on My Sleeve </em>is set to be released in the UK in July, but in America Lambert is already a star. With roots in country music, Tori Amos-style confessional songwriting and spoken-word poetry, her big break came when she co-wrote and performed on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlVBg7_08n0\">Macklemore and Ryan Lewis’s 2012 single Same Love</a> (139m YouTube views and counting), an anthem to same-sex relationships.</p> \n<p>Now 26, Lambert has spoken openly about living with bipolar disorder, surviving a gang rape aged 17, a suicide attempt two years later and issues with her body image. “I like to be open about these things because I think not talking about it is part of the problem,” she says. “As soon as we talk about them, the less guilt and shame we’ll carry.”</p> \n<p>The sense of catharsis in her music means that fans often cry along at live shows. “I’m not <em>trying</em> to make people cry,” she says, “but I believe in the power of vulnerability – that’s how we can relate to each other. I have to just trust that the audience is going to hold me. It’s a symbiotic relationship: I get as much out of it as they do, hopefully.”</p> \n<p>Before her singing career took off, the classical music composition graduate had been working 16-hour days and three jobs to save money to record an album. Same Love changed her life “very dramatically. There was a moment at one of my first performances with Macklemore where there were 8,000 people. At my previous show there had been 15 people, including my mom.” Last year, the song gained her two Grammy nominations and she performed it on stage with Madonna while Queen Latifah married 33 couples of varying sexual orientations on stage.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZi69cid9ak\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sZi69cid9ak?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Mary Lambert – Teenage Dirtbag.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lambert grew up in a strict Pentecostal community near Seattle. When she was six, her mother, who she is “very, very close” to, divorced her father and came out as a lesbian, which meant they were excommunicated and ostracised. Lambert herself came out aged 17 but remains a Christian; this set off a cycle of self-loathing and shame, but eventually reconciliation with her faith.</p> \n<p>“I was so racked with guilt, I felt I had to apologise to God and repent every day. Then something snapped in me, and I realised, ‘This is insane, the God I believe in doesn’t share those views’. In general I think the Christian community is well-intentioned, but misguided.”</p> \n<p>Compared with her earlier songwriting, her debut album tempers sadness with equal amounts of joy. Secrets, the opening track, is a catchy, breezy tune that takes all her troubles, puts them out in the open and shakes them off: “I don’t care if the world knows what my secrets are,” she trills. So Far Away is a soaring romantic ballad, Dear One is a breathless and lyrical love letter. Much of this newfound happiness is down to her musician girlfriend Michelle Chamuel, runner-up on NBC’s <em>The Voice</em>, with whom she lives in Massachusetts.</p> \n<p>“It’s as important for me to grieve as it is to express joy. I’m not saying that shitty things happening is joyful, but it means that the value of joy is exponentially increased after you’ve experienced a certain amount of trauma. To fully feel joy you have to be fully present in your grief, so hopefully the songs reflect that.”</p> \n<p>In person – flower tattoos, bare feet with painted toenails, full pin-up make-up – she’s all warm hugs and bubbling enthusiasm.</p> \n<p>Her newfound fame brings with it extreme reactions from the public, but Lambert remains sanguine. “I get people who say, ‘You saved my life, you’re the reason I came out, you’re the reason I got over my eating disorder.’ That means so much to me, but if you take that home at night you start to develop a saviour complex. So I realised that if I took that home, I’d have to do the same with people who say, ‘You didn’t tweet me back, I’m going to slit my wrists.’ That’s a lot to feel responsible for.</p> \n<p>“I’m trying to make a very full life for myself that’s not too chaotic and not have my relationships and mental health suffer for the sake of my career. So that’s the plan: finding the balance.”</p> \n<p><em>She Keeps Me Warm is released on Virgin EMI on 20 July. The album Heart on My Sleeve is out on 31 July</em></p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432640484611/Mary-Lambert-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mary Lambert: ‘I really believe that if I didn’t have songwriting I wouldn’t be alive.’","credit":"PR","altText":"Mary Lambert","cleanCaption":"Mary Lambert: ‘I really believe that if I didn’t have songwriting I wouldn’t be alive.’"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-31T12:00:02Z","lastModified":"2015-05-31T12:00:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":9,"contributors":[{"name":"Kathryn Bromwich","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/kathryn-bromwich"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Pop and rock","Music","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Kathryn Bromwich","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/kathryn-bromwich"}}],"series":{"title":"One to watch","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/series/one-to-watch"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/31/mary-lambert-interview-new-album-heart-on-my-sleeve","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/494fh","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/may/31/mary-lambert-interview-new-album-heart-on-my-sleeve","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/31/mary-lambert-interview-new-album-heart-on-my-sleeve"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432640484611/Mary-Lambert-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mary Lambert: ‘I really believe that if I didn’t have songwriting I wouldn’t be alive.’","credit":"PR","altText":"Mary Lambert","cleanCaption":"Mary Lambert: ‘I really believe that if I didn’t have songwriting I wouldn’t be alive.’"}},"importance":3,"kicker":{"title":"Mary Lambert"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[]},{"title":"My inspiration / Jon Mayhew on Jules Verne","rawTitle":"Jon Mayhew on Jules Verne","item":{"type":"article","id":"childrens-books-site/2015/jun/01/my-inspiration-jon-mayhew-on-jules-verne","title":"My inspiration: Jon Mayhew on Jules Verne","trailText":"The author of the Monster Odyssey series explains how the genius of Victorian sci-fi master Jules Verne – who wrote Around the World in 80 Days and Journey to the Centre of the Earth – took his writing to a whole other world…","standFirst":"<p>The author of the Monster Odyssey series explains how the genius of Victorian sci-fi master Jules Verne – who wrote Around the World in 80 Days and Journey to the Centre of the Earth – took his writing to a whole other world…</p>","byline":"Jon Mayhew","body":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"519cfb4b5ec8960ea3c2b05159952d289d3a82a4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432643780910/8695997e-744e-4ffe-9561-fc0657417384-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Journey to the Centre of the Earth by Jules Verne\" width=\"258\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/monster-odyssey-the-wrath-of-the-lizard-lord.html\">Monster Odyssey</a> series is the ongoing story of Prince Dakkar, son of an Indian rajah who has been sent to England for an education. It is 1814 and what few schools there are find Dakkar’s rebellious spirit too much to cope with. Finally, Dakkar is placed with the mysterious Count Oginski, a genius inventor with a dark past. Dakkar soon finds out that Oginski is waging a war against an evil organisation called Cryptos, who are set on ruling the world. But nothing is as straight forward as it seems and Dakkar is drawn into a world of monstrous adventure.</p> \n<p>The inspiration for my series came, in part, from the works of Jules Verne. Verne was a French writer who first published his work in the middle of the nineteenth century. His books are still in print and have inspired countless other books, films, TV programmes and comics to this day.</p> \n<p>It was through the films that I first became aware of his work.
