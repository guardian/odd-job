It’s a big honour.

Grimshaw now has 2.6 million listeners aged 15 to 29, down from 2.8 million in Moyles’ last three months on air, against 2.9 million listeners aged 30 or over, down from Moyles’ 3.9 million.</p> \n<p>Tipped for a judge’s role on the new series of Simon Cowell’s The X Factor, Grimshaw is a key weapon in the station’s efforts to retune to a younger audience <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2012/jun/19/bbc-one-radio-one-failing-targets\">following years of criticism that it had grown too old</a>.</p> \n<p>But despite the DJ’s best efforts, Grimshaw still had more than 1.1 million listeners aged 45 or over at the beginning of this year. The proportion of his audience in this age bracket actually increased, albeit marginally, since the same period in 2014, from 18.6% to 20.3%.</p> \n<p>This is presumably what Cooper meant when he has talked about the difficulty of shrugging off older listeners who are reluctant to retune to Radio 2 or 6 Music, the “trendy adults who just refuse to lose interest in new music”.</p> \n<p>The latest audience figures were a record low for Grimshaw, dipping as far as Sara Cox’s last audience in 2003.</p> \n<p>It is a pattern reflected by Radio 1 as a whole, which fell to 9.7 million listeners at the start of this year, also a 12-year low.

An Ofcom report last year revealed that 16- to 24-year-olds spent 15 hours a week listening to the radio compared with more than 21 hours a week a decade earlier.</p> \n<p>Cooper, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2012/feb/05/ben-cooper-controller-radio-1\">not long after taking the job</a>, predicted that “traditional radio for young people is dead in about a generation.

She came on to the chimes of Bob Marley’s Punky Reggae Party and the music delivered that, ricocheting between US No Wave, pop-soul and reggae. Guitarist Jack Petruzzelli filled her late husband Fred “Sonic” Smith’s enormous shoes admirably. The band – including original guitarist Lenny Kaye and drummer Jay Dee Daugherty – were decked out in black and white, like Smith wore on Robert Mapplethorpe’s iconic Horses sleeve, which she once said “captured a generation who sought within a new landscape to excite, to astonish and to resonate with all the possibilities of our youth”.</p> \n<p>Now an unfeasibly lithe, bovver-booted 67-year-old, Smith’s masterful singing combined her youthful fury with rich sensuality, authority and wisdom. Some songs sounded just like the album. Others were remodelled, by design or accident. “I’m a person, not a record,” she spat. Lengthy poetic sections incorporated new rails against governments and corruption. Johnny, the desperate character who is attacked in a hallway in Land/Horses, was cheekily relocated to Manchester, but remains “in that same fucking hallway” – a thrilling way of suggesting that, 40 years on, the same issues are more universal.</p> \n<p>There was much humour, though. The “poet laureate of punk” is now a grandmother, and revealed that her literary skills now extend to reading Uncle Wiggily stories to her baby grandson. The haunting Elegie – originally a requiem for Jimi Hendrix, which now honours a long line of those departed – felt unbearably sad until someone in the audience yelled the name of Timperley’s deceased finest, Frank Sidebottom.</p> \n<p>After a glorious post-Horses romp through the likes of Because the Night, Dancing Barefoot, People Have the Power (“to vote, to strike!”) and even obliging a yelled request for her rarely performed, infamous 1974 first recording, Piss Factory, she exited to an ovation, still mauling sacred cows. A rampage through the Who’s My Generation saw the “hope I die before I get old” line changed to “I don’t need any of that shit. I hope I live because of it.” On this imperial form, few would bet against another 40 years. </p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/684c4f3312803e3ca549c5fe59ccbd95c45e926b/0_0_2617_1571/2617.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1571,"width":2617,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Shirlaine Forrest/WireImage","altText":"MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - JUNE 08:  Patti Smith performs at O2 Apollo, Manchester on June 8, 2015 in Manchester, England.

On a slightly more scholarly note he campaigned to keep <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/titian-diana-and-actaeon\">Titian’s Diana and Actaeon</a> in Britain – a painting of a gathering of female nudes by the most extravagantly heterosexual artist of the Renaissance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec4163e56dd7c34e095e176e7725d5306000969e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433860685350/87ba7a11-286e-430c-8b9c-757dcbd080e4-373x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Naked Portrait 2002 by Lucian Freud\" width=\"373\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naked Portrait, 2002 - paintings like this of Kate Moss are seen as evidence of Freud’s extravagant heterosexuality</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ray Tang/REX</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> It was said of Titian in his lifetime that he used to get tired because he went to bed with all his models. The rumours about Freud’s constant propositioning and opportunism will soon be appearing in a biography near you, and will add to his reputation as what in the olden days they called a “womaniser”. </p> \n<p> But his paintings tell another story. Freud’s grandfather Sigmund, looking at his art, would surely have seen something a lot more complex than macho lust for luscious ladies. For a start, Freud scarcely flatters any of his models. His harsh, blue- and grey-flecked renditions of flesh are scarcely sensual in the way Titian is sensual. Instead of relentlessly seeking out stereotypical beauty (his Kate Moss portrait was an exception, and a weak work) he was drawn to difference and variety, most famously in his grand nude <a href=\"http://www.phaidon.com/resource/lucian-freuds-benefits-supervisor-sleeping.jpg\">Benefits Supervisor Sleeping</a>.</p> \n<p> There is another way of seeing Freud: as an artist who celebrates the ambiguity of desire and sexual identity. Far from “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherchez_la_femme\">cherchez la femme</a>” &agrave; la Titian or Picasso, he is fascinated by men, too. Moreover he is drawn to people whose identity is unsettled.</p> \n<p> Freud’s greatest paintings are his <a href=\"https://agnautacouture.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/lucienfreudleighgemeentemuseum-708421.jpg\">naked portraits of the performance artist Leigh Bowery</a>. They are monuments to a colossal personality and laments for an age of crisis in the gay community: Bowery died as a result of Aids in 1994. Freud’s passion for Bowery’s body is just as copious as his enthusiasm for the flesh of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2014/jun/21/lucian-freud-muse-big-sue-tilley-turns-illustrator\">Sue Tilley</a>. These great models inspired some kind of fascination in him that was neither gay nor straight but ... painterly. And in the freedom of the studio Freud saw people stripped of fixed sexual personalities – reduced to flesh and yet liberated in it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7b335b71dfc74d230efb6ce65ffed59565a2f42e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433860761455/98a1db20-751a-4ec6-bfaf-88aaee06c01e-460x317.jpeg\" alt=\"Sue Tilley, whom Lucian Freud painted in Sleeping by the Lion Carpet\" width=\"460\" height=\"317\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sue Tilley, whom Lucian Freud painted in Sleeping by the Lion Carpet and Benefits Supervisor Sleeping</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff / Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> He is neither a gay nor straight artist. Bowery identified as gay but married Nicola Bateman in the year he died. <a href=\"http://www.viennareview.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VR_13_11_p13-16_FREUD_GDK_701792-e1384527186331.jpg\">Freud painted them on a bed together</a>, naked in love, people clinging to one another - human beings finding solace in each other.</p> \n<p> The Freud/Spender letters are not just another bit of tittle-tattle. They are a caution that we should not crudely interpret art by biographical assumptions. Freud clearly liked sex, of that we can be sure. But as a painter, he achieves something stranger and more universal than lust. He sees people beyond the constraints not merely of clothes, but of gender. </p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433860221389/d79a35e1-737b-4a16-a09a-eed1482be78a-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sothebys/PA","altText":"Letter to Stephen Spender (1941) - Self-Portrait - one of the unpublished letters written by a teenage Lucian Freud","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sothebys/PA"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433860685063/87ba7a11-286e-430c-8b9c-757dcbd080e4-906x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":906,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Naked Portrait, 2002 - paintings like this of Kate Moss are seen as evidence of Freud’s extravagant heterosexuality Photograph: Ray Tang/REX","credit":"Ray Tang/REX","altText":"Naked Portrait 2002 by Lucian Freud","cleanCaption":"Naked Portrait, 2002 - paintings like this of Kate Moss are seen as evidence of Freud’s extravagant heterosexuality","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ray Tang/REX"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433860761877/98a1db20-751a-4ec6-bfaf-88aaee06c01e-2060x1421.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1421,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sue Tilley, whom Lucian Freud painted in Sleeping by the Lion Carpet and Benefits Supervisor Sleeping Photograph: Oli Scarff / Getty Images","credit":"Oli Scarff / Getty Images","altText":"Sue Tilley, whom Lucian Freud painted in Sleeping by the Lion Carpet","cleanCaption":"Sue Tilley, whom Lucian Freud painted in Sleeping by the Lion Carpet and Benefits Supervisor Sleeping","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Oli Scarff / Getty Images"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-09T16:04:09Z","lastModified":"2015-06-09T16:06:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":67,"contributors":[{"name":"Jonathan Jones","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741000/JonathanJones.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jonathanjones"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Lucian Freud","Stephen Spender","Sexuality","Painting","Art","Art and design","Culture","Society","Books","Gender"],"tags":[{"id":"artanddesign/freud","webTitle":"Lucian Freud"},{"id":"books/stephen-spender","webTitle":"Stephen Spender"},{"id":"society/sexuality","webTitle":"Sexuality"},{"id":"artanddesign/painting","webTitle":"Painting"},{"id":"artanddesign/art","webTitle":"Art"},{"id":"artanddesign/artanddesign","webTitle":"Art and design"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"world/gender","webTitle":"Gender"}],"section":{"id":"artanddesign"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jonathan Jones","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jonathanjones"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"artanddesign"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/jun/09/lucian-freud-love-letters-stephen-spender-artist-sexuality","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49jgk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/jun/09/lucian-freud-love-letters-stephen-spender-artist-sexuality","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/jun/09/lucian-freud-love-letters-stephen-spender-artist-sexuality"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433860221389/d79a35e1-737b-4a16-a09a-eed1482be78a-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Letter to Stephen Spender (1941) - Self-Portrait: one of the unpublished letters written by a teenage Lucian Freud.
