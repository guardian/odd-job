But I want these three Marinas buried in the three cities which I’ve lived [in] the longest, which is Belgrade, Amsterdam and New York.” Nobody would know where the real body was interred, she added.</p> \n<p>Abramović was motivated to plan her service after attending the funeral of her friend, the author Susan Sontag, at P&egrave;re Lachaise cemetery, Paris, in 2004.<br /></p> \n<p>“It was the saddest funeral I’ve been to in my life and she is one of the greatest human beings I have ever met. She was full of life, curious and just an incredible writer,” said Abramović. “I went back to New York and went straight to the lawyer and said my funeral is going to be like this. And then I made an entire script.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2015/jun/18/marina-abramovic-the-planet-is-dying-we-have-to-be-warriors\">Marina Abramović: 'The planet is dying.

I just go for it. I don’t care how much pain inside. Then we have second Marina – very different, very spiritual, very emotional ... And then there is third one who really like bullshit.”</p> \n<p>In Sydney she spoke of the genesis of her art, the time she spent with Indigenous communities in the Western Australian desert, and her plans for the as-yet-unbuilt Marina Abramović institute in Hudson, New York – her “legacy” – where she will teach mindfulness exercises to the public.</p> \n<p>The institute will include a “blood bank”, a collection of blood samples from 250 of the most inspirational artists, philosophers, scientists and people from indigenous cultures, which will once a year be re-energised by a Brazilian shaman. The project was as yet “unrealised”, Abramović said.</p> \n<p>“Now I have this long career of 45 years, I never look back,” she told the Sydney audience. “I only look in the future because when I look back, I think I should be dead by now.”</p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0947323ed05bc1ed84e6f79e704be88cec47e0c8/0_127_5162_3098/5162.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3098,"width":5162,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Remi Chauvin/MONA","altText":"The artist Marina Abramovic whose work is being exhibited at MONA in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, from June 2015.

Yup, after lying pretty low for nearly three months after quitting One Direction, Zayn Malik has made his comeback into public life. And he chose to do so not by hanging out in wellies backstage at Glastonbury, but by getting dressed up to the nines and hitting up the Paris menswear shows. The year’s biggest blow to pre-teen girlhood is turning out to be an unexpected windfall for the style world.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"394ae924460f2668e8bfd71cee173bc0e0f189e7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435680378415/93095595-05b2-499c-8066-e60ef6d234c1-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Kanye West, Zayn Malik and Joe Jonas at the Louis Vuitton menswear SS16 show.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kanye West, Zayn Malik and Joe Jonas at the Louis Vuitton menswear SS16 show.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Among Paris show attendees, the utter hotness of Zayn was the runaway number one topic of conversation. A typical comment went something like, “So handsome it’s <em>ridiculous. </em>Have you seen his <em>eyes?</em> Oh. My. God.” Pretty impressive, when you consider how jaded showgoers are. Of course, it helped a lot that he was seriously well dressed. He pulled off a Hawaiian-slash-baseball-style Vuitton jacket with a panache that led American Vogue to report that “if this is any indication of the look he’s crafting for his solo career, then expect to see him rise to the top of the charts”, and rocked a front row seat at the show, next to Kanye West. At Valentino, he wore a navy frock coat with burgundy and ivory trim with matching navy trousers, and a crisp white shirt. Not everyone can carry off such formal tailoring with a platinum buzz cut and a diamond nose ring. But guess what: Zayn can.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb11ac59a8f9677b8340a0c9905f4df9d629b554\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435680459155/26bc244a-6fa2-46bc-9b1d-f651a1c890f9-272x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Zayn Malik at the Valentino SS16, show.\" width=\"272\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zayn Malik at the Valentino SS16, show.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LaurentVu/Sipa/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Zayn’s stellar Paris appearances were a happy surprise, because after a toned-down monochrome suit at the Asian Awards in April, his most recent fashion “moment” had been the reveal of ill-advised apple green hair, on fiancee Perrie’s Instagram account. But now, he’s showing signs of fulfilling the promise he showed as the most-directional member of One Direction. Remember when Zayn was wearing a polo neck under blazers, back in 2013, and we were all a bit sniffy? And then the following year … oh, wait, we were all wearing <em>the exact same thing</em>. And band stylist Caroline Watson never came out and said it, but we always suspected that Zayn was stylist’s pet: he is, after all, the only band member who Watson made godfather to her daughter, Brook.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10c2071b4d7a9608fd56523c7f7724acb55fb996\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435683291370/dc042d7b-57df-4b87-a668-667d73e950a7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"That directional polo neck … Zayn Malik (second left) with One Direction in December 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">That directional polo neck … Zayn Malik (second left) with One Direction in December 2013.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Fisher/Rex</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Zayn: welcome.

interview before his last day in job, CEO says going public accelerated short-term-thinking, and regulation would pose threat to free speech</p>","byline":"Jemima Kiss","body":"<p>The outgoing chief executive of Twitter has said he underestimated the pressures that going public would place on the company and warned that his successor would nevertheless have to manage an increasingly complex set of geopolitical challenges as well as the demands of Wall Street.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian before his last day at the company on Wednesday, Dick Costolo said that while Twitter had grown revenue by 97% year on year to $1.7bn (&pound;1.1bn), the pressure placed on the company obscured its other achievements in bringing 302 million monthly active users on to the service.</p> \n<p>“When we took the company public, I had an expectation that the market would evaluate us based on our financial metrics first and foremost,” he said. “I probably would frame the way we were thinking about the future of the company differently, understanding how we were in retrospect evaluated.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Costolo said the pressures of meeting Wall Street expectations on a quarterly basis meant the company had to battle against a current of incrementalism and short-term thinking. “You always want to keep focused on the long-term vision, yet when you go public you’re on a 90-day cadence and there’s a very public voting machine of the stock price that accelerates that short-term thinking.”<br /></p> \n<p>But he argued that Twitter had stuck to a “cohesive long-term strategy” and said there were plans to make the service more accessible during live events, whether sporting finals or breaking news.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>He referenced Lightning, a new set of features intended to enable better curation and promotion of live content on Twitter. “People have been asking why I didn’t do that four years ago,” he said. “Four years ago, the site didn’t even stay up. We were the only big site on the internet whose 404 [error message] was its own brand – the fail whale.”</p> \n<p>In Costolo’s five years as chief executive, Twitter has transformed from a private company with 300 staff valued at $3.7bn to a public company with 3,900 employees valued at $23.5bn. </p> \n<p>When he announced he was stepping down, he was believed to have succumbed to pressure from investors concerned about slow growth and a perception of disappointing revenues.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Asked why he was leaving, Costolo said he had put together a strong team that was now being recognised outside the company. “It is the right time,” he said. “Great leaders and great CEOs are both resilient and self-aware.” </p> \n<p>He dismissed suggestions that he had set expectations too high by prioritising rapid growth in user numbers. “I have never paid attention to people externally who are saying I should do this or that.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Costolo gave the interview after a rare speech in Granada, Spain, in which he argued that Twitter had become a “product of the world” that had taken on “a more ambitious and symbolic meaning – the idea of democratic access for all.”</p> \n<p>Referring to article 19 of the United Nations’ human rights declaration, which asserts the right of the individual to “seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media”, Costolo said that throughout history withholding information had been a method of retaining power. “With billions now online, that right of access to information is a reality and Twitter allows that information from the source.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>What constitutes a news story was no longer determined just by the media, he said, and while Twitter would not end propaganda, he argued that governments now found it harder to cover up the true version of events. </p> \n<p>Costolo said the job of Twitter CEO had come to involve resolving complex geopolitical issues, citing for example Iran, where authorities use the site to communicate while blocking citizens’ access.</p> \n<p>“The challenge is we can’t be excessively parochial and have an American perspective on the way things should be. We have to abide by the rule of law in the countries in which we operate, while pushing to make sure that these voices can be heard despite whoever is in power at the time.”<br /></p> \n<p>It is an example of the non-financial measures by which Costolo argued Twitter should be judged. “As a company, we will continue to navigate this intersection of ethics and technology that has not been confronted before, and make difficult decisions every day to ensure the smallest voices in the world can be heard.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Twitter under Costolo’s leadership has been criticised for failing to crack down effectively on threatening and abusive messages, and faced pressure to block activity by terrorists trying to recruit.</p> \n<p>Costolo said efforts to discourage abusive language included tripling the size of its abuse reporting team, allowing third parties to report abuse of others and making it harder for blocked users to reopen accounts. “You have to make the cost equation less expensive for the person who feels they are being abused,” he said.</p> \n<p>He said regulation, particularly in Europe, was not an answer to the challenge, and it was not appropriate to act as if Twitter and its competitors were a type of communications utility that needed the sort of oversight imposed on broadcasters and telecoms carriers. </p> \n<p>“I will say directly that I think regulation is a threat to free speech,” he said. “I can’t think of an example where regulation didn’t have unintended consequences and I’m unable to conceive of a regulatory body that will be swift enough to deal with the constantly evolving issues of ethics, communication and technology. I just don’t think it’s possible.”</p> \n<p>Costolo’s successor has yet to be named – the company will be led on an interim basis by Jack Dorsey, the co-founder. Whoever takes on the job would have to contend with a far broader set of challenges, Costolo said. “When I took on the role of CEO I thought of myself as a technologist, but I’ve had to become more and more concerned with the geopolitical landscape, as have all my counterparts in tech.</p> \n<p>“Dealing with that landscape will be the big challenge , the different ways in which countries think about the value of open exchanges of information. I have only seen that get more complex.” </p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435686086158/dcf0acf1-0ea4-4bc7-908f-22306d4586fb-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christian Charisius/Corbis","altText":"Dick Costolo","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Christian Charisius/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T18:03:09Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T23:37:09Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Jemima Kiss","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/24/1400942620317/Jemima-Kiss-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jemimakiss"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Twitter","Dick Costolo","Social media","Digital media","Technology","Media","Internet"],"tags":[{"id":"technology/twitter","webTitle":"Twitter"},{"id":"technology/dick-costolo","webTitle":"Dick Costolo"},{"id":"media/social-media","webTitle":"Social media"},{"id":"media/digital-media","webTitle":"Digital media"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet"}],"section":{"id":"technology"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jemima Kiss","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jemimakiss"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"technology"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jun/30/twitter-boss-complex-challenges-dick-costolo","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9e7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/technology/2015/jun/30/twitter-boss-complex-challenges-dick-costolo","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/30/twitter-boss-complex-challenges-dick-costolo"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435686086158/dcf0acf1-0ea4-4bc7-908f-22306d4586fb-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dick Costolo, the outgoing Twitter chief executive.
