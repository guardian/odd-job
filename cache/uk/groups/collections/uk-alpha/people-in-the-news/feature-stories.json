A jury has ordered the rapper-actor to pay $5m (&pound;3.2m) to a woman who said he acquired a video she made with her boyfriend, added his own crude commentary and posted it online without her permission. </p> \n<p>Manhattan jurors are set to continue deliberating this week on possible further, punitive damages in Lastonia Leviston’s invasion of privacy lawsuit against the multiplatinum-selling artist. </p> \n<p>Attorney William A Brewer III says 50 Cent and his legal team are “disappointed in the verdict but very appreciative of the service of the jury and the court”. Leviston’s lawyer, Philip Freidin, declined to comment on the award, first reported by the New York Daily News. </p> \n<p>The lawsuit stems from a 13-minute video that appeared online in 2009 featuring a wig-wearing 50 Cent as a narrator dubbed Pimpin’ Curly. The character made explicit remarks about Leviston and taunted rap rival Rick Ross, who wasn’t in the video but has a daughter with Leviston. At the time the video surfaced, Ross and 50 Cent were trading barbs via video, lyrics and interviews. </p> \n<p>50 Cent got the 2008 tape from the man in it, who was Leviston’s boyfriend. The rapper and his lawyers said that 50 Cent didn’t actually post the video but that Leviston’s then-boyfriend said she wouldn’t mind if he did, and he thought that was sufficient permission. </p> \n<p>The Pimpin’ Curly character was just “joking” by referring to Leviston as a “porn star”, 50 Cent said during sworn pre-trial questioning that was played for the jury, according to news reports. He didn’t testify at the trial. </p> \n<p>But Leviston, of Pembroke Pines, Florida, said she was horrified and humiliated when the video appeared online. “This was something done to me. I didn’t have a choice. I would never, ever do this to myself,” she testified, according to news reports.</p> \n<p>Born Curtis Jackson, 50 Cent burst to the fore of rap in 2003 withthe album Get Rich or Die Tryin’, its lead single, In Da Club, and a tough life story that included being shot nine times. </p> \n<p>Now 40, he is also a businessman, with his ventures ranging from mining to water drinks, and an actor whose credits include the Starz network action series Power and the forthcoming boxing movie Southpaw. </p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436770323043/003cb45d-a148-476a-a776-d42e2c3e164c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Visar Kryeziu/AP","altText":"50 Cent … Ordered to pay.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Visar Kryeziu/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-13T06:54:23Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T07:57:44Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":6,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["50 Cent","Music","Pop and rock","Rap","Hip-hop","Urban music","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"music/50cent","webTitle":"50 Cent"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock"},{"id":"music/rap","webTitle":"Rap"},{"id":"music/hip-hop","webTitle":"Hip-hop"},{"id":"music/urban","webTitle":"Urban music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jul/13/50-cent-ordered-to-pay-woman-5m-in-sex-tape-case","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4atgv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jul/13/50-cent-ordered-to-pay-woman-5m-in-sex-tape-case","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/13/50-cent-ordered-to-pay-woman-5m-in-sex-tape-case"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436770323043/003cb45d-a148-476a-a776-d42e2c3e164c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"50 Cent … ordered to pay.

It was so windy I swung about a bit but oh yes, I enjoyed it, I feel it’s well worth it. My legs ache like anything – and my right arm where I hold the rope – and my hair is all sticking out.” Long added she was “living in hope” to be able to repeat the challenge next year, when she will be 102.</p> \n<p>Mother-of-two Jennie Watson, 42, from Fareham, Hampshire, who completed the abseil earlier in the day, said: “I think she’s amazing, a real inspiration. You have to be quite agile to get the ropes down, but it’s the bravery more than anything. How she does it I have no idea.”</p> \n<p>Karen Kay, events fundraiser at the Rowans hospice, said: “Doris is an amazing lady and a huge inspiration. She has been abseiling for the Rowans hospice for more than 10 years now and has raised over &pound;11,000. We can’t thank her enough for supporting local hospice care. Everyone at the Rowans hospice wishes Doris all the best for this epic challenge.”</p> \n<p>Long, from Hayling Island, who hopes to raise &pound;1,000, wrote on her fundraising webpage: “I first started abseiling at 85 years old, and this will be my 16th abseil for the hospice. The Rowans hospice is my local hospice and all the care is given completely free of charge. Please help me to continue their wonderful care, and support for patients with life-limiting illnesses and their families.”</p> \n<p>To sponsor Doris Long, visit <a href=\"http://www.justgiving.com/DorisLong101\">www.justgiving.com/DorisLong101</a>. </p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436713907535/ebfdcdd8-d051-4a55-b75e-39f8f9cced64-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Steve Parsons/PA","altText":"Doris Long","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436714028769/0cdc5b2e-2412-48d2-8e78-3aa49191e85e-861x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":861,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Doris Long after her successful descent of the Spinnaker tower.

As he prepares to tour the album, he explains how his career hit the skids, and why he’s ready to make amends","byline":"Luke Bainbridge","body":"<p>Like so many great debut albums, when Badly Drawn Boy’s <em>The Hour of Bewilderbeast</em> was released – 15 years ago last month – it seemed to somehow both capture the zeitgeist and convey a magical timeless quality. “More than any other, it’s the record people mention when they stop me in the street or come up to me in a bar. It still means a lot to a lot of people,” says Damon Gough. “They tell me how it got them through some difficult times, or soundtracked their best times.”</p> \n<p>From the wonderful opening bars of cello and French horn of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4o5tGajfYE\">The Shining</a>, through an eclectic 18 tracks including pastoral left-field folk ditties such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4E_1I4kiP0\">Camping Next to Water</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgrHvz3zZZM\">Stone on the Water</a>, the breezy euphoria of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAtcJ954TjQ\">Once Around the Block</a>, the stripped-down ethereal ballad of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4CddZuq8z8\">Magic in the Air</a>, it was a lo-fi masterpiece that had reviewers falling over superlatives and coining new musical genres such as “folk-hop” and “future folk”. It went platinum and won 2000’s Mercury prize, beating a strong shortlist including Coldplay, Leftfield, and Gough’s friends Doves. Receiving the winner’s &pound;20,000 cheque from Jools Holland, he threw it on the floor and quipped, “I always assumed I was never going to win because good things don’t happen to good people normally…”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2009/nov/28/showing-off-badly-drawn-boy\">Paul Morley's Showing Off... Badly Drawn Boy</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It’s fair to say that the past three years or so have been a less celebratory time for Gough; a fallow period prompted by a few on-stage meltdowns (more of which later) and separation from his long-term partner and mother of his children, Clare (who also inspired most of <em>Bewilderbeast</em>). Plus a couple of albums that had not sold as well as they might. At the end of last year, Gough realised that the 15th anniversary of his debut was looming and decided to reintroduce himself to the public by playing it live in its entirety for the first time at <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/apr/22/badly-drawn-boys-bewilderbeast-tour-is-cause-for-genuine-celebration\">a string of gigs</a> including the Barbican in London and Manchester’s Bridgewater Hall. It seemed fitting. Back from the wilderness with <em>Bewilderbeast</em>… but then onwards and upwards. The gigs take place this month.</p> \n<p>“I want to stress that the anniversary of <em>Bewilderbeast</em> is not something I want to dwell on. I want to get on with writing and releasing new music, but it felt like a good way to reintroduce myself,” Gough tells me, nursing a pint in a London pub after his photoshoot for the <em>Observer</em>, the first he’s done in a while. “I do get frustrated with people always banging on about <em>Bewilderbeast</em>, but I understand it too. For most artists their debut is important, and with me that was magnified because it did so well out of nowhere. Well, apart from people like you who knew where I had come from…”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp1A2KQx9I\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/anp1A2KQx9I?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Badly Drawn Boy wins the Mercury prize in 2000.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When Gough and I first met, he was 27 and I was working at Manchester’s <em>City Life</em> magazine. Badly Drawn Boy was still just a rough sketch. It was 1997, three years before <em>Bewilderbeast</em>, and he rang me up one afternoon out of the blue. “Is that Luke?” a faltering voice said. “My name’s Damon and I’ve started a record label with a friend of mine and we’re putting out my first EP and a mutual friend of ours said you might be able to help me…”</p> \n<p>We agreed to meet in Manchester’s Atlas bar, where he gave me a copy of his EP (a lo-fi 7in, recorded in his bedroom, entitled simply <em>EP1</em>) and nervously explained his vision. He had decided to call himself Badly Drawn Boy, inspired by a cartoon his little nephew had drawn, and he talked at length about the sort of music he wanted to make, and influences such as Beck and the Beatles <em>Anthology</em> series, which had not long been released. Shortly after that, he played his first solo gig, a ramshackle affair to about 30 people upstairs at the Britons Protection pub. It was obvious he was a singular talent, if still a little rough around the edges – but neither of us would have predicted he’d win the Mercury only three years later.</p> \n<p>One of Gough’s early breaks had been meeting Andrew Shallcross, aka Andy Votel, a young hip-hop producer who was part of the Stockport music and art collective Violation of the English Language (Votel). Gough played him some early demos, and Votel encouraged him. “I used to play Andy tapes in the car, but I’d fast-forward through my vocals because I was embarrassed by the sound of my voice,” says Gough. “One day I stopped at a petrol station and he listened to the vocals when I was in paying. He was convinced I could sing and we should put it out.”</p> \n<p>It was Votel who suggested they start a label, which they named Twisted Nerve, after a Hayley Mills horror film. Twisted Nerve quickly became the next big thing in the UK indie scene, feted by the music and style press, and signing other acts such as Dakota Oak, Alfie, Misty Dixon (featuring Jane Weaver) and Aidan Smith. Gough and Votel became, for a short while, Manchester’s bearded lo-fi answer to Damon Dash and Jay Z, although most of the label’s acts were in little danger of troubling the charts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPVAipmV7jY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RPVAipmV7jY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Badly Drawn Boy’s Once Around the Block\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After the success of his first three EPs, Gough signed to XL in 1999, but still wasn’t sure about making an album, so he set about recording songs in several studios around Manchester with various producers. Gradually, a collection of tracks took shape: a meandering assortment of folk songs, poetic shanties, experimental passages and piano ballads, some recorded in bedrooms, some in studios, with numerous personnel playing everything from guitars and keyboards to horns, clavinets, vibraphones and theremins. It shouldn’t have worked, but, underpinned by Gough’s intuitive ear for melody, it did. </p> \n<p>The album title came when Gough was on tour in Japan, supported by Twisted Nerve band Alfie. Hungover and jetlagged at a soundcheck one day, Gough said to the band, “I feel bewildered”. “I feel like a bewilderbeast,” replied Sam from Alfie. Gough loved the made-up word. They kicked about various titles until Votel one day said “Well, this is your hour isn’t it? It’s the hour of Bewilderbeast.”</p> \n<p>Gough’s hair had started to recede before <em>Bewilderbeast</em>, and feeling self-conscious about it, one day on tour in Japan, he grabbed his girlfriend’s tea-cosy hat to wear on the stage. The hat quickly became his signature look, and 15 years on he is still never seen in public without one.</p> \n<p>Even today he refuses to take it off to show me what’s underneath, “But I’m not Darth Vader or anything…”</p> \n<p>Do you even sleep in your hat?</p> \n<p>“Sometimes, but I’ve got a bed hat as well.”</p> \n<p>What, like an old Victorian nightcap?</p> \n<p>“Kind of, yeah…”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"335568d2fc6d8b26accc8541e4849c84911ee363\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436438866716/0f9f21bb-c480-45c5-a0e2-ed048586f517-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Damon Gough in 1999, in his pre-hat days.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damon Gough in 1999, in his pre-hat days.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After the success of <em>Bewilderbeast</em>, Gough was asked to write the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg_5VAb_sAY\">soundtrack</a> to the film of Nick Hornby’s book <em>About a Boy</em>, starring Hugh Grant, which became a huge hit. Then, in 2003, came third album, <em>Have You Fed the Fish?</em>, on which Gough sang, tongue in cheek, “I’m turning Madonna down. I’m calling it my best move.”</p> \n<p>Today, Gough, 45, still seems a little bewildered about how he got here. He’s always been a contradictory character, an outer bravado and occasional bolshiness battling with his inner insecurity. While that combination is certainly not unique to him, his battle seems to bubble closer to the surface than with many other artists. His gigs were always unpredictable. His determination to keep them spontaneous and fresh meant they sometimes came across as shambolic – songs would teeter on the edge of falling apart, until he managed to pull them back together at the end, often triumphantly. A bad temper on stage was at odds with his character off stage. “My bravado came from insecurity,” he nods, “and that has affected my career, particularly as a live performer. That insecurity unwittingly created a kind of Jekyll and Hyde character.”</p> \n<p>Around the time of his eighth and ninth albums, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2010/sep/30/badly-drawn-boy-its-what-im-thinking-cd-review\"><em>It’s What I’m Thinking Pt 1 – Photographing Snowflakes </em></a><em>and Being Flynn</em> (the soundtrack to a Robert De Niro film that hasn’t been released in the UK), there were several high-profile on-stage meltdowns. In Los Angeles, in December 2010, Gough told the crowd at the Troubadour that he was going to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2010/dec/20/badly-drawn-boy-onstage-meltdown\">“ruin his career tonight”.</a> “After tonight I’m never playing live again. Seriously, do you think I want to be here?” he continued. “This night has been a complete disaster for me.”</p> \n<p>Looking back now, Gough blames the bad sound for his outburst. “When the sound isn’t good on stage and I can’t hear myself, it’s like being asked to run a marathon with a broken leg. I couldn’t hear myself and I said something like, ‘If I can’t do this properly I might as well go home’. Someone heckled, ‘Why don’t you then?’ and I just lost it.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-356152805__\n</div> \n<p>Another infamous meltdown was at a festival in Northampton when Gough joked: “I don’t think I’ve been to Northampton before… I’m sure I’d remember because it’s a shithole.” A woman in the audience took exception to this and the row ended with Gough throwing a tambourine at her. He’s at pains now to explain he always instantly regretted these incidents. </p> \n<p>“I’d come off stage feeling terrible. I’d like to apologise now to anyone who reads this who was at that Northampton gig,” he says. “I’d love to go back there and do another gig and make amends, if they’d have me back. The bad gigs always get the press, rather than all the amazing gigs I’ve done, but that’s just the way the world is. I’ve seen other artists slightly disrespect the audience and it’s funny. Mark E Smith will turn all the amps up…”</p> \n<p>But, I say, that only really works if you’re Mark E Smith, doesn’t it? Badly Drawn Boy’s music had reached a more mainstream audience… “You’ve got to the crux of it there,” he says. “I’ve always battled against that. I gained an audience from <em>Bewilderbeast</em>, and then after <em>About a Boy</em>, lots of couples starting coming to the gigs.”</p> \n<p>On-stage meltdowns are a thing of the past, he insists now, suggesting they were tied to his depression. “It’s something to do with the way my brain works, which I’ve spent the past three years working on, admitting that I’ve got some issues, which ironically make me the creative person I am. I hate the word depression. They should call it something else like rhubarb or something. It wouldn’t sound so scary or have such a stigma attached to it. As soon as you say the word depression people get depressed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_asHpi7jjXQ\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_asHpi7jjXQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Damon Gough throws a tambourine at a heckler in Northampton.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“My music is heartfelt and emotional. I’m a rollercoaster type of person. I drove myself to do music because I didn’t want a normal life. I envy people who can just enjoy a ‘normal’ life. I love people and I love life, but I struggle with it, and music has saved me in a lot of ways. When I create a new song, it gives me such a sense of achievement.”</p> \n<p>Do you think the past few years might have been a bit easier if you hadn’t taken everything quite so personally? “Oh yeah, definitely,” he says. “It’s certainly not helped that the music I’ve written is so personal. I’ve got a kindness in my soul, generally, but there’s another part of me that gets pissed off if I think I’m being taken wrong, or if I think people aren’t being appreciative.” So how does he feel now about writing new music? “I feel freer than ever. I feel freer than I did in the beginning and I feel freer than I did anywhere in the middle. That’s down to growing up a bit, and taking stock. When I sit down at my piano to write I feel freer to write. I come up with ideas easier. I’ve got ideas coming out of my ears. Writing melodies has always been easy for me; it’s the words that sometimes take a little bit of trial and error. Just sitting here talking with you has made me take stock again, and realise how much I still have to give. It makes me feel like 15 years is nothing, when you think of someone like Bob Dylan and his output. I feel I could release another 10 albums in the next 15 years, and then I would have a real back catalogue. That’s the artist I want to be, talking about my back catalogue of 20 or 30 albums.”</p> \n<p>So is he looking forward to the <em>Bewilderbeast</em> tour? He smiles, before replying: “I can’t wait.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://play.spotify.com/user/guardianmusic/playlist/5P8PPRVRWzjKBzkQz0peUi?play=true&amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;utm_medium=open\"> \n <iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:5P8PPRVRWzjKBzkQz0peUi\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.songkick.com/artists/224609-badly-drawn-boy\">Badly Drawn Boy tours The Hour of Bewilderbeast, 24-31 July</a></em><em>, details at songkick.com.

And just what is ‘crazy dancing’? </p>","byline":"Judith Mackrell","body":"<p>“It was frightening,” says <a href=\"http://www.flamencofestival.org/eng/artistas/israel-Galv&aacute;n-39/biografia/\">Israel Galv&aacute;n</a>, remembering the night he received the worst reaction of his performing life – at the premiere of his work, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqNzYnWmvJM\">Lo Real/Le R&eacute;el/The Real</a>, in Madrid in 2013. A tribute to victims of the Holocaust, the production is tipped to be a highlight of the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/2015/loreal#.VZ_O72TF_5o\">Edinburgh international festival</a> this summer. Yet back in Madrid, something about its subject matter or discordant style so outraged the audience that they began chanting insults and calling for the performers to leave the stage.</p> \n<p>It was a hostile contrast to the adulation Galv&aacute;n enjoyed during the early years of his career. As a young man, he was a flamenco prodigy, winning almost every award going. Even when he began pushing his style and his choreographic ideas to more challenging extremes, many critics still judged him the finest dancer of his generation. Galv&aacute;n’s technique is still, at 41, almost unmatched for poise, precision and speed.</p> \n<p>Like many great flamenco artists, his virtuosity was bred in the bone. Both his parents were professional dancers and he thinks this gave him an unusually early start. “My mother carried on performing until she was seven months pregnant,” he laughs, “so I was probably dancing inside the womb. It was always expected of me that I would become a dancer – anything else wasn’t an option.” In fact, by the time little Israel was two he was already performing with his parents on stage.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f6b197456abf477fccdb151850b83e71308a2f19\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436547654039/13fdd4f4-58c8-4680-8b47-e9fbc2624dfc-336x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Israel Galv&aacute;n at Sadler's Wells, London.\" width=\"336\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Israel Galv&aacute;n at Sadler’s Wells, London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As a parent himself now, Galv&aacute;n does balk slightly at this, but he insists that in the 1970s, when he was growing up in Seville, it was perfectly normal: “There was a fashion for child performers then.” Just as he was far from being the only infant on stage at the Sala Flamenco in Seville, he wasn’t the only one who would be smuggled out when police raided the club at one or two in the morning – child dancers may have been popular, but parents were breaking the law by letting them perform at night.</p> \n<p>Looking back, Galv&aacute;n is fascinated by the bizarre environment his family exposed him to. “There were a lot of men dressed as women, drinking in the audience.” One of the other performers was a puppeteer whose act included a rather dubious life-size female mannequin. But Galv&aacute;n insists that he loved it all. “It was such a happy atmosphere. It was a fantasy for me, being a kid in this grownup world.”</p> \n<p>Galv&aacute;n also loved that world because dancing came so easily to him. “I don’t ever remember rehearsing, it was always like a game – and people seemed to enjoy watching me a lot.” Yet, perhaps because of his unusual ability, when he reached his mid-20s, he began to tire of his success. “I no longer wanted to be representative of the kind of flamenco audience and critics wanted. I no longer want to have to dance ‘well’ all the time. I knew that if I was going to survive in dance, I was going to have to find my own way.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I knew that if I was going to survive in dance, I was going to have to find my own way</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>He thinks all good flamenco dancers have to find their individual style to some extent. He himself had already played with elements from other forms – incorporating <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_3B85387z4\">a frisson of Michael Jackson</a>, and imitating the airy dextrous tapping of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2012/jul/04/artaires-fred-adele-kathleen-riley-review\">Fred Astaire</a>. But from his mid-20s, he began to experiment more boldly, inspired by the German tanztheater of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/stage/pinabausch\">Pina Bausch</a>, and by the <a href=\"http://www.kazuoohnodancestudio.com/english/\">Japanese Butoh legend Kazuo Ohno</a>. “I still saw myself as a flamenco dancer, but I didn’t want to be confined to the flamenco language. I wanted to have the freedom to dance all the gestures in the world.”</p> \n<p>The works Galv&aacute;n went on to create and perform were unlike anything seen in flamenco before. Typical was <a href=\"http://www.kazuoohnodancestudio.com/english/\">La Curva</a>, a solo in which he danced on a pile of flour, slapped out rhythms on every surface of his body, and flipped between cartoon-comic poses, ballerina grace and torero machismo. This bold, playful eclecticism didn’t meet with universal approval – Galv&aacute;n demonstrates his father shielding his eyes with an expression of pain. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9509a6ff5b28d641182fcb682cdf20c2746e263\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436548300912/79666150-7ff0-45d2-830c-d593050f13a4-460x286.jpeg\" alt=\"Israel Galv&aacute;n in Lo Real\" width=\"460\" height=\"286\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Lo Real has been a therapy, a medicine,’ says Israel Galv&aacute;n.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Louise Duzert</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But his experiments with movement were nowhere near as controversial as his experiments with narrative. In his 1998 version of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2011/nov/08/my-favourite-film-red-shoes\">The Red Shoes</a>, he drew on the life of the unfortunate Spanish dancer Felix Fern&aacute;ndez Garc&iacute;a, known as El Loco, who was hired by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2010/sep/12/sergei-diaghilev-and-the-ballets-russes\">Serge Diaghilev</a> to give flamenco lessons to his Russian dancers, and ended up in an asylum. And in Metamorphosis, he used <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/booksblog/2015/may/13/kafka-metamorphosis-translations\">Franz Kafka’s story</a> as an allegory of his own radical transformation as a dancer. To develop its dark expressionist language (or, in his words, its “crazy dancing”), Galv&aacute;n studied images of unusual flamenco artists from the past, including one hunchback. But he says many of those who saw the work condemned it as a betrayal of the art form, having nothing to do with flamenco at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"71c0b0d6ff3ef2a3eaa905a7c9b0ac07ae8e3387\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436548733997/c0e54d0b-32b8-4651-8217-7a09684b36a9-460x284.jpeg\" alt=\"A scene from Israel Galv&aacute;n's Lo Real\" width=\"460\" height=\"284\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>However, it was with Lo Real that Galv&aacute;n, unintentionally, alienated his public most. He describes the work as the logical outcome of his childhood anxieties about death, born from the fact that his parents were Jehovah’s Witnesses, and had made him believe that one day, soon, the world would come to an end. “I was terrified we were all going to die. I thought my head would suddenly be cut off.”</p> \n<p>As he grew older, Galv&aacute;n’s fear of death transferred itself into an obsession with the Holocaust. It was, he says, “the ultimate killing machine”, and it has always had a personal resonance for him: Jehovah’s Witnesses were among the minority communities targeted by Hitler, as were Gypsies. Galv&aacute;n’s mother was born into a Gypsy family, and its culture is key to flamenco.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjX8JGrB5Co\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjX8JGrB5Co?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch a preview of Lo Real – video\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The Germans always liked what was different from them – but then they wanted to annihilate it</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>He felt a strong compulsion to channel this into dance, yet for a long time struggled to find a way of doing it justice. One day, however, he was listening to the Antony and the Johnsons song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-SOlVbflEY\">Hitler in my Heart</a> and a line from its chorus – “from the corpses flowers grow” – sparked his imagination. The lyric is a reference to the profusion of flowers that blossomed from the hideously enriched soil of concentration camps, and its poetically charged irony inspired him to think of choreographing a comparable collage of imagistic fragments. One is a vignette that features <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2003/sep/09/world.news1\">Leni Riefenstahl</a>, Hitler’s favourite director, whose film Tiefland was, perversely, a celebration of Gypsy life. As Galv&aacute;n drily says: “The Germans always liked what was different from them – but then they wanted to annihilate it.”</p> \n<p>He’s still unsure why Lo Real caused such offence at its premiere, speculating that the audience may have reacted badly to flamenco being used to tell this painful story, and to a non-professional Gypsy dancer being included in its cast. But for him, the work proved hugely cathartic. “It’s been a therapy,” he says, “a medicine.” Talking to Galv&aacute;n now, he’s so animated and funny it’s hard to imagine him ever having obsessed over death. Yet he says that if he’s feeling depressed or anxious, he still relies on dance to lift him. “When I’m performing, I can’t be thinking about the past or worrying about the future. I’m always in the present moment on stage, free to be anything I want. A different world opens up.”</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/2015/loreal#.VZ_O72TF_5o\">Lo Real</a> is at the Edinburgh Festival theatre, 19-21 August.
