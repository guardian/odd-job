At 37, he seems a natural shuffler, feet moving in small increments, shoulders rounded. It’s a manner he adopted to devastating effect as the titular homeless man in the hugely moving TV film <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/sep/24/theweekendstvstuartalife\" title=\"\">Stuart: A&nbsp;Life Backwards</a>, the first time I paid him proper attention. That suggestion of tender vulnerability is Hardy’s special skill (blame the sleepy eyes and baby-face features); Brando had it, and comparisons have been made. There’s a moment in Mad Max, when he offers Splendid (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2492819/\" title=\"\">Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley</a>) a thumbs up&nbsp;and a weak smile, that really captures the Hardy brand, what I’m&nbsp;calling “tough puppy”.</p> \n<p>But Hardy can turn it on its head, too: in <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/bronson\" title=\"\">Bronson</a>, as notorious long-term prisoner Charles Bronson, he’s&nbsp;all beefed-up swagger, imbuing the character with&nbsp;more menace than wild eyes and maniacal laughter could convey. And his mumble! It would be irritating if it weren’t for all that talent.</p> \n<p>Off-screen, Hardy’s back story offers a perfect Hollywood arc: middle-class British childhood derailed by delinquency (“What an arse I must have been to my poor parents,” <a href=\"http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/film-tv/8074/tom-hardy-esquire-interview/\" title=\"\">he has said of his school days</a>), and substance abuse that almost ended his career before it took off.

I&nbsp;had wardrobe tantrums, where I&nbsp;would plan what I was going&nbsp;to wear in advance, then change my mind 1,000 times. They stopped about two years ago, and now I just throw on whatever I feel like in that moment and head out. I&nbsp;guess I’ve grown up and become more secure in myself.</p> \n<p>My nan always taught us to be well put-together. I remember her dressed in a real outfit, with her dress cleanly pressed, and her hat and gloves. When she moved to England from Guyana in the 1950s, she had people judging her for being&nbsp;black, so she made sure no one&nbsp;could fault her appearance. She was always immaculate, and instilled that in us. If I came home from school with a creased uniform, I’d get into a lot of trouble. That’s stuck with me, and I am proud of it.</p> \n<p>Blow drying my curly hair takes up&nbsp;most of my getting-ready time. I&nbsp;let it air dry for a while first, because if you blow dry curly hair&nbsp;from wet, it usually ends up frizzy; there’s so much moisture in&nbsp;it. I use an amazing all-natural blow dry balm called <a href=\"http://www.carolsdaughter.com\" title=\"\">Carol’s Daughter</a>. It’s got shea butter and coconut oil in it, and is really protective and nourishing stuff. I&nbsp;use only natural products, because my mum’s a vegan and a herbalist and often makes me products, mixing up essential oils.</p> \n<p>I used to hide behind my hair, wearing it big and long, to make me feel more confident, but in the past year or so I’ve been tying it back more and more. That makes me feel strong, because I know I’m no longer hiding.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Leona Lewis’s new single, Fire Under My Feet, is <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/fire-under-my-feet-single/id990016841\" title=\"\">out now on iTunes</a>.</p>","section":"Fashion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434384838254/df48a101-b29d-41f7-b753-b428ae3142b2-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":279,"width":465,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty","altText":"Leona Lewis","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-20T05:00:08Z","lastModified":"2015-06-20T05:00:08Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":3,"contributors":[{"name":"Rosanna Greenstreet","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rosannagreenstreet"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Beauty","Life and style","Fashion","Leona Lewis","Music"],"tags":[{"id":"fashion/beauty","webTitle":"Beauty"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"fashion/fashion","webTitle":"Fashion"},{"id":"music/leonalewis","webTitle":"Leona Lewis"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"}],"section":{"id":"fashion"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rosanna Greenstreet","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rosannagreenstreet"}}],"series":{"title":"How I get ready","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/fashion/series/how-i-get-ready"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"fashion"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/2015/jun/20/leona-lewis-how-i-get-ready","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49h6p","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/fashion/2015/jun/20/leona-lewis-how-i-get-ready","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jun/20/leona-lewis-how-i-get-ready"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434384838254/df48a101-b29d-41f7-b753-b428ae3142b2-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":279,"width":465,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Leona Lewis: ‘My nan was always immaculate, and instilled that in us.’ Photograph: Getty","credit":"Getty","altText":"Leona Lewis","cleanCaption":"Leona Lewis: ‘My nan was always immaculate, and instilled that in us.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty"}},"importance":5,"kicker":{"title":"How I get ready"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434384838254/df48a101-b29d-41f7-b753-b428ae3142b2-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":279,"width":465,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty","altText":"Leona Lewis","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty"}}]},{"title":"Prestigious post / Simon Armitage elected Oxford professor of poetry","rawTitle":"Simon Armitage elected Oxford professor of poetry","item":{"type":"article","id":"books/2015/jun/19/simon-armitage-wins-oxford-professor-of-poetry-election","title":"Simon Armitage wins Oxford professor of poetry election","trailText":"Popular British poet selected for prestigious post ahead of strong field including Wole Soyinka","standFirst":"<p>Popular British poet selected for prestigious post ahead of strong field including Wole Soyinka</p>","byline":"Alison Flood","body":"<p>The British poet Simon Armitage has seen off an international field to be chosen as Oxford’s latest professor of poetry.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian after the announcement, Armitage said he was “delighted and very excited and suitably daunted as well”.</p> \n<p>“It’s been such a long process,” he said. “In the time it’s taken we’ve had a general election, Sepp Blatter has come and gone and come again, and we’ve nearly got a new leader of the Labour party.”</p> \n<p>He said he would try to give students an insight into “what is occasionally quite a muddy world, and a muddy art form, remembering that the audience are primarily students, and not to see it as a platform for professorial grandstanding”.</p> \n<p>“For me, it’s a chance to say something a little bit more contemporary,” he said. “Often it’s been professors talking about previous generations. I feel as if I’d like to bring thing up to date. To look at poetry today, in dialogue with the poetry of the past.”</p> \n<p>The award-winning author of more than 12 collections of poetry, Armitage has been hailed by fellow poet Sean O’Brien as “the first poet of serious artistic intent since <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jun/17/philip-larkin-honoured-westminster-abbey-memorial\">Philip Larkin</a> to have achieved popularity”. Combining linguistic inventiveness, streetwise flair and contemporary subjects, he has reached an audience far beyond the literary ghetto with poems, novels, translations of medieval verse and scripts for radio and television.</p> \n<p>The poet laureate, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/carol-ann-duffy\">Carol Ann Duffy</a>, welcomed the announcement, calling Armitage “a fine, vocational poet and a brilliant communicator for the modern age who never forgets the roots and ancestry of poetry”.</p> \n<p>“Oxford is lucky to have gained his time and commitment to this post and should prepare itself to be shook, rattled and rolled,” she said.</p> \n<p>Five candidates were competing for the position, a post second only in prestige to the poet laureate which was first established in 1708. Candidates “of sufficient distinction to be able to fulfil the duties of the post” – which include a lecture a term – must assemble nominations from at least 50 Oxford graduates.</p> \n<p>Armitage was joined on the shortlist by the Nigerian playwright and poet Wole Soyinka, the American <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/ae-stallings\">AE Stallings</a> – the only woman in the running for a position which has been held by men for all but two weeks of the last 300 years – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/jul/21/squawks-and-speech-ian-gregson-poem-of-the-week\">Ian Gregson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.seanhaldane.com/new-poems\">Se&aacute;n Haldane</a>. Armitage received 1,221 of the 3,340 votes cast, with Wole Soyinka in second place on 920 just ahead of AE Stallings on 918.</p> \n<p>Armitage was backed by 58 names, including John Carey and Melvyn Bragg. Bragg had previously supported Soyinka, but later publicly switched his allegiance to Armitage, telling the Sunday Times of his concerns that the 80-year-old <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/26/wole-soyinka-not-too-grand-and-old-oxford-poetry-chair-melvyn-bragg\">might not “bother to come to Oxford”</a> if he were to win. Soyinka hit back, saying: “How curious that anyone would even speculate that I would allow busy and committed people – friends, colleagues and total strangers – to waste their time nominating and campaigning on my behalf for such a prestigious position if I were not serious about contesting.”<br /></p> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian after the announcement, Bragg said he was “delighted for him, and for Oxford, and for poetry”.</p> \n<p>“This is one of the few posts in this country which recognises the value of poetry on a national scale,” Bragg said, “even though it comes from just one university. It has become a post that’s nationally recognised, and we should applaud recognition of poetry on this scale.” Armitage is “a very fine poet”, Bragg continued, who “has a direct connection with a very large, young audience who like poetry, and feel he speaks to them. And I feel he’ll take it very seriously, and be available for undergraduates,” he said.</p> \n<p>Bragg added that he backed Soyinka initially because he wasn’t aware of Armitage’s candidacy. “As soon as I registered that, I changed my mind,” he explained. “And one of the things you learn at university is that when you think about things, you are allowed to change your mind.”</p> \n<p>The election is not the first race for the professorship to have been dogged by scandal: in 2009, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2009/may/25/ruth-padel-resigns-oxford-poetry-professor\">Ruth Padel was elected</a> by Oxford graduates to the post, but remained in position for less than two weeks, resigning in the wake of charges that she had leaked to journalists the allegations of sexual harassment which had been made against her rival, the St Lucian writer Derek Walcott.<br /></p> \n<p>The first ever professor of poetry at the university was Joseph Trapp, in 1708, with names including Matthew Arnold, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/aug/30/seamus-heaney\">Seamus Heaney</a>, WH Auden and Robert Graves also filling the role. English poet <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/booksblog/2010/jun/21/geoffrey-hill-poetry-oxford-professor\">Geoffrey Hill</a> is the current incumbent, and will step down at the end of this academic term.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk/about/oxford-people/professor-of-poetry/nominees\">a statement provided by Armitage</a> laying out his hopes for the professorship, the poet and translator of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2007/feb/03/poetry.simonarmitage\">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a> said he had decided to run because “after so many years in the field, I feel I have plenty to say on the subject and a desire to talk and write about” poetry.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/26/simon-armitage-making-poetry-pay\">Simon Armitage: making poetry pay | Aida Edemariam</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He would, he said, use the platform “to discuss the situation of poetry and poets in the 21st century, to address the obstacles and opportunities brought about by changes in education, changes in reading habits, the internet, poetry’s decreasing ‘market share’, poetry’s relationship with the civilian world and the (alleged) long, lingering death of the book”.<br /></p> \n<p>And he would, he ended, be “greatly excited and deeply honoured” if Oxford graduates “saw fit to appoint a self-schooled poet who views poetry from a hill above a Yorkshire village”. <br /></p> \n<p>“A former Oxford professor of poetry, Robert Graves, once described poetry as a continual, lifelong apprenticeship, and to that end it would be an adventure and an education,” said Armitage, who has held the role of professor of poetry at Sheffield University since 2011.<br /></p> \n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/245800\">his 2013 poem The Unthinkable</a>, Armitage imagines a “huge purple door” washing up in a bay, “its paintwork blistered and peeled from weeks at sea”.

Is it something you’ve always studied? </p> \n<p><strong>GZA:</strong> I was inspired by it, but it’s not that I have always been interested in science – science is everything. It’s in everything in the world. Most of it is actually based on physics, it’s actually energy and matter, and most of the album has been inspired by that.</p> \n<p><strong>SB:</strong> It is an all encompassing thing. [Science] can kind of turn people off, but it’s the most interesting thing ever.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>GZA:</strong> It’s also the way you deliver the message. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tETcDafA7WY\">It’s boring to some because of how it is taught and how it is delivered.</a> In most sciences, they don’t have ways of getting the message across, like how some artists have a way of getting it across. </p> \n<p><strong>SB:</strong> My dad was a scientist and made telescopes, and quite often he would try to explain things to me, and my head would just really hurt. I guess one of the last scientific conversations I had with him was about the parallel alternative universes, and it was just amazing, how excited he got about it. It’s kind of cool, like the things that were a bit too far-fetched in the comic books are now fact.</p> \n<p><strong>GZA:</strong> They have a saying, what was science fiction years ago is now science fact now.</p> \n<p><strong>SB:</strong> Getting back to the music, I have been listening to your music for a long time, and you’ve bridged loads of eras of hip-hop, from right from the very start to right now.

I used to read a lot of nursery rhymes, and I learned a lot of those rhymes word for word. I would go to an aunt’s house, and she would let me play music, and she had The Last Poets album. At that time, albums didn’t have explicit stickers on them, so some of the songs had profanity on them, and I was moved by that. I would listen to those songs, to the flow, and I’d balance it back and forth with the nursery stuff I had. A year later I moved to Staten Island [from Brooklyn]. I had a few DJs in my neighbourhood that would play music in the streets. There was no hip-hop yet, there were just DJs that were playing disco, funk and pop music, and we would gather round, go to the parks and dance and enjoy ourselves. I would often take trips from Staten Island to the south Bronx, which is originally the first place of hip-hop. I was only around <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/46135-watch-gza-tell-stories-of-his-youth-in-a-new-episode-of-pitchforktvs-animated-series-frames/\">11 years old, and sometimes RZA</a> would come with me. The DJs and MCs there were way more advanced than the neighbourhood I was coming from. It was just a culture that I was moved by, and I knew that was my calling. </p> \n<p><strong>SB: </strong>When you first started making this music, did it feel completely natural? Did you get the sense at the time that this was a really important new culture that was going to define your whole life and mainstream music?<br /></p> \n<p><strong>GZA:</strong> No I couldn’t see that. For us, it was just a passion and a hobby; it was something that is so much a part of my makeup. It was something I loved so much, we didn’t know it was going to change or revolutionise the world as a music genre. But if you think about it, [hip-hop is] something that children are attracted to immediately: even a lullaby – “Hush little baby don’t say a word / Papa’s gonna buy you a mockingbird” – that’s rhyming. When children hear that, they gravitate towards that faster than they would R&amp;B or rock and pop, because it’s spoken word. It’s all art when you look at it – it’s a way of expressing yourself. Kids started doing hip-hop and rhyming and break dancing, and stopped being in gangs, so it was a powerful tool to get kids off the street and stop them from hurting each other. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpQmFfdYFzY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpQmFfdYFzY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch Wu-Tang Clan’s Protect Ya Neck\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>SB:</strong> On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXGlHT5NSno\">Paper Plates, you really took 50 Cent</a> apart in a really methodical way, saying he wasn’t actually representing anything. You have said that a lot of modern mainstream hip-hop really regresses the themes, it tends to be very materialistic and moves away from lyricism. It’s an important view, because it isn’t said enough.</p> \n<p><strong>GZA: </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/03/hip-hop-lyrics-gza-wu-tang-clan\">I think at some point, there was a shift in music, and it changed the dynamics</a>. I think he loves hip-hop and hip-hop was in him, just like it is in me. It was probably different when he started rhyming, because he is like nine years younger than me. He caught it from the beginning when it was all about clever raps, it was about who can write the most intellectual, wittiest, clever, thought-provoking rap. </p> \n<p>I think a lot of kids that are rhyming now, they are rhyming about violence, and that was never us. When we were talking about killing someone, we were talking about murdering someone with a rhyme. Back in the day, a lot of MCs had a lot of intellectual names. This name was given to me by RZA, I was called the Genius, RZA was the Scientist and Dirty [Ol’ Dirty Bastard] was the Professor. These were the names that we had when we were teenagers that represented good things and positive things, it didn’t represent killing. Now it’s about rapping about your car or your house, or about all the shit you can get, and it was never that years ago. </p> \n<p>It’s not me getting on a track saying, the earth is the third planet and it’s 93m miles from the sun. I am not teaching in that sense. It’s about making sure everything is cohesive and fits together, and the story is amazing and compelling and keeps moving and motivating. I shouldn’t have to sit down and listen to a song, and after three lines know I will hear something about a car. You should be more interested in the mind that made the car, and not the car itself.</p> \n<p><strong>SB: </strong>The record of yours that most people would refer to is probably Liquid Swords. Tell me a little bit about making that record. What was writing it like?</p> \n<p><strong>GZA:</strong> It was a great experience. It was a comeback for me because I already had a deal and an album [Words From the Genius] prior to putting out Wu-Tang. I was striking back at Cold Chillin’ [Warner’s subsidiary label, who he claims did not treat his album as a priority at the time]. It was personal when I was writing that, and I didn’t want to use it, but I was like, I am done with them. </p> \n<p>Then, when I got to release a solo album again [Liquid Swords], I was on a major label again, and I was getting all the push from them. I was probably one of the first rappers to be signed to the label; I was getting so much support because of the popularity from Wu-Tang. Making an album was a great feeling, and there were many hours in RZA’s house, in his basement, and hours of beat playing. We were still in our early stage, so there was so much support from everyone. I was doing the album, and every now and then a Clan member would come through, Rae would be there one day or Ghost another. It was just fun. </p> \n<p><strong>SB:</strong> Did you use a live band on it, or was it all sampling?</p> \n<p><strong>GZA:</strong> For the first album it was a lot of sampling, I don’t think we were bringing in musicians at that time. From what I know, it was all just samples, hip-hop and rock music, which is what hip-hop is: it’s a combination of all of them.</p> \n<p><strong>SB: </strong>People talk about originality in art, but so much music is made from other music, everything is connected, and I love amazing pieces of music that originally come from different sources. One thing goes through someone’s mind and comes out the other side.</p> \n<p><strong>GZA:</strong> Everything is always coming from something else. Even if you create something, it has to be inspired by something else. If you think of Apple and Steve Jobs, he had to be inspired by something that launched the ideas in his head. Our music came from these old songs, rock, pop and funk, and that’s why people were able to take a sample from a song that’s only half a second or a second long, and chop it up. It’s an art in itself.

Can’t put a seatbelt on a semi-automatic,” wrote the bestselling novelist, who is followed by almost three-quarters of a million people on Twitter.<br />King withdrew his own novel Rage, about a high-school shooting, following the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_Middle_School_shooting\">1996 murder in a Washington school</a> of a teacher and two students by Barry Loukaitis. Loukaitis quoted a line from Rage: “This sure beats algebra, doesn’t it?” following the murders.

I asked my publishers to pull the novel,” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/feb/01/stephen-king-pulled-book-gun-controls\">wrote King in his 2013 essay</a>. “I didn’t pull Rage from publication because the law demanded it; I was protected under the First Amendment, and the law couldn’t demand it. I pulled it because in my judgment it might be hurting people, and that made it the responsible thing to do. </p> \n<p>“Assault weapons will remain readily available to crazy people until the powerful pro-gun forces in this country decide to do a similar turnaround.”</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434712341120/4fc29a8c-cfb0-4a2a-9545-639cb18c3842-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Varley/Sipa/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Stephen King","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Varley/Sipa/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T11:25:20Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T11:27:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":352,"contributors":[{"name":"Alison Flood","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/alisonflood"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Stephen King","South Carolina church shooting","US gun control","Gun crime","Books","Culture","US news","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"books/stephenking","webTitle":"Stephen King"},{"id":"world/south-carolina-church-shooting","webTitle":"South Carolina church shooting"},{"id":"us-news/gun-control","webTitle":"US gun control"},{"id":"world/gun-crime","webTitle":"Gun crime"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"books"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Alison Flood","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/alisonflood"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"books"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jun/19/stephen-king-gun-control-charleston-closed-minds","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avzg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/books/2015/jun/19/stephen-king-gun-control-charleston-closed-minds","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/19/stephen-king-gun-control-charleston-closed-minds"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434712341120/4fc29a8c-cfb0-4a2a-9545-639cb18c3842-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Stephen King: ‘The American shooting gallery remains open’.
