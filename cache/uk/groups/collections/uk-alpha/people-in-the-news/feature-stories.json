In doctor-speak, that means I have a “nervous absence of appetite.” I would go further and say that I have a nervous fear and disgust toward eating food.<br /></p> \n<p>We all have a critical voice that comments on what we do. When I sit down to eat a meal, the critical voice inside my head goes crazy. It shouts at me: <em>What are you doing? Do you want to get fat?</em> It tries to scare me: <em>You’re choking. Maybe that food is poisoned. </em>And it calls me names: <em>You bitch!

And my critical voice said, <em>Yeah, you stupid bitch!</em><br /></p> \n<p>Nobody can see the yelling that takes place on the inside. All they can see is how calm I am when they join the yelling. They see me smile, and they think I’m arrogant and rude. It isn’t that. I’m just comfortable being yelled at.<br /></p> \n<p>But over the years, the shame from all that yelling has added up. Shame: that’s a “painful feeling of humiliation.” Getting yelled at day and night inside my own head is painful and humiliating, even when nobody else joins in. That load of shame used to feel so heavy, I could hardly get up in the morning.<br /></p> \n<p>There’s one good thing about being an anorexic, though. It isn’t the reason I became an anorexic, but it’s one of the reasons I didn’t want help for so long. We anorexics can’t bear to eat, even if we want to. But in our society, people who don’t eat are winners.<br /></p> \n<p>Imagine what it’s like for someone like me, trudging through the day getting yelled at and insulted. And then, out of the blue, somebody says, “Girl, I wish I could fit those jeans! What’s your secret? How do you <em>do</em> it?”<br /></p> \n<p>That was always the nicest part of my day.<br /></p> \n<p>Did I want to be skinny? No. I didn’t stop eating to trim down, I stopped eating to shut up the voice. But once people started coming up and begging me to help them diet, did I want to <em>stay</em> skinny? Hell yes!<br /></p> \n<p>That’s the problem with getting help for anorexia. Lots of anorexics can’t understand what treatment is supposed to do to help us. The one thing we <em>know</em> treatment will do is make us gain weight—and that will take away the nicest part of our day.</p> \n<p>But here’s the thing: anorexia nervosa isn’t a lifestyle, even though it feels like one. It’s torture. It’s very slow, painful death. Your hair falls out, your teeth rot, your bones turn brittle, and your skin turns patchy. Then you die. Really! Anorexia kills.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e021079d2ca92136eff81a5233cb49bd21a7a814\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434356411842/3e3ec1b0-7d02-442d-9210-7f906f95d291-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Clare and Elena\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elena Dunkle and her mum Clare B Dunkle: they wrote Elena Vanishing together. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chronicle Books</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The way to live a happy life isn’t to trudge along with a burden of shame, hoping that every now and then someone will pay you a compliment.

He is 56, tall (6ft 4&frac12; inches “with a temper” as he once put it) and his white shirt is unbuttoned. He stoops to greet me beneath a cluster of cherry trees in the sloping gardens and I notice he has the combination of stature and softness that suggests a kindly fairytale character — a Silver Giant, rather than a Selfish one. His hair, a mishmash of grubby grey and bright white, is swept back in a mane that nearly reaches his collar.</p> \n<p>In his two signature roles, as an innocent man imprisoned in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/57129/shawshank.redemption\">The Shawshank Redemption</a>, and as a victim of child abuse victimised again in adulthood in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/96638/mystic.river\">Mystic River</a> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwpS0Qty-RQ\">for which he won an Oscar</a>), he was made to seem pitiful. His size seemed to give him further to fall, more to lose. He has used his body equally well to get laughs, not least as a gormless, oversexed pitcher in <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/bull-durham\">Bull Durham</a>, the brilliant 1988 baseball comedy which gave him a breakthrough hit as well as a partner (his co-star, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2009/dec/24/susan-sarandon-tim-robbins\">Susan Sarandon</a>, from whom he separated in 2009). He still turns up in the occasional part but films don’t seem to interest him much these days. While he is a celebrated film-maker, Oscar-nominated for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/59494/dead-man-walking\">Dead Man Walking</a>, he hasn’t directed one for 16 years. “They’re not doing those kinds of movies any more,” he tells me. “Or, if they are, they’re doing them for $10. And they want you to get a major star before they give you that $10.”<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6848fd6a3c692ed4bd0c529696b517a23a35cee7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434109695866/3e9add37-4832-40ff-9d60-95f6f0058242-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tim Robbins with Susan Sarandon in Bull Durham\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Robbins with former wife Susan Sarandon in the 1988 hit Bull Durham.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext Collection</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Theatre, his first love, is taking up most of his time, and in particular <a href=\"http://www.theactorsgang.com/\">the Actors’ Gang</a>, which he founded nearly 35 years ago. He mentioned the company in his Oscar acceptance speech and it is with them that he has come to Lyon. His spare, inventive production of <a href=\"http://www.theactorsgang.com/on-tour\">A Midsummer Night’s Dream</a> has toured the world for the past year. On the evening we meet, it is about to be performed under the stars at <a href=\"http://www.nuitsdefourviere.com/\">Les Nuits de Fourvi&egrave;re</a>, a two-month festival of theatre, music and dance. (He will also play a gig with his band, the <a href=\"http://timrobbins.net/music/\">Rogues’ Gallery</a>, which specialises in good-natured rock. A folk tinge has been passed down from his late father, Gil, a member of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2011/may/25/folk-usa\">the Highwaymen</a>.)</p> \n<p>Why, I wonder, is it an actors’ “gang”? “We were a bunch of punk rockers when we started out,” he explains, settling into a chair beneath the tree and pulling a cigarette from a pack of Natural American Spirit (“100% organic tobacco”). “We had that aesthetic: we’ve got each other’s backs.” Early shows could be shambolic. “Then we acquired a discipline for our anarchy.” Recently the group hit a crisis. “In changing management, we found that our old management had…” He takes a long draw on his cigarette and picks a ladybird off his wrist. “Things had been done which had left us in debt. I had to rally the troops. It was one of those moments where you say, ‘Is this it?’” After some fundraising, A Midsummer Night’s Dream was mounted. They were in the enchanted forest but they weren’t out of the woods. “We were still struggling economically so I put a mandate out that we had to do the show for $500. That forced us to really get creative. How do you make a forest without a set? Well, you do it with actors.”<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"220e7ac5c3c9b93444734222013d042e7a108ecb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434109881215/2f1f15bd-8c34-42a9-91c1-3e41480ddce1-460x247.jpeg\" alt=\"Tim Robbins presented A Midsummer Night's Dream with the Actor's Gang at Les Nuits de Fourvi&egrave;res in Lyon.\" width=\"460\" height=\"247\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Robbins presented A Midsummer Night’s Dream with the Actor’s Gang at Les Nuits de Fourvi&egrave;re in Lyon.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I'm less likely now to judge people. I can see someone is angry yet not have to engage</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Productions such as this represent only one branch of the work of the Actors’ Gang. Pride of place in Robbins’s affections belongs to the <a href=\"http://www.theactorsgang.com/prisonproject\">Prison Project</a>, the brainchild eight years ago of the company’s British member <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabra_Williams\">Sabra Williams</a>. The group, led by Robbins and Williams, goes into jails in the US for improvisation workshops; they have had an immediate and beneficial effect on the prison population. Robbins says he never had any qualms about the project, which is now a permanent fixture. “Not one. We do exactly the same thing with the prisoners as we do with our actors. Same training, using masks and make-up and improvisation. It transforms them. They’ve told us that it puts them in touch with emotions they haven’t felt in years. If ever. It helps them deal with their incarceration. It provides a new openness for them to communicate with their families. Guards have told us that it has an effect on how prisoners relate to one another — these people are reaching out across racial lines, rival gang members are bonding. ”<br /></p> \n<p>Acting has unlocked emotion for Robbins too. “It continues to expand my empathy,” he says. “I’m less likely now to judge people. I can see someone is angry yet not have to engage.” Having children — he has two sons, aged 26 and 23, by Sarandon —has helped. “You don’t want to be getting into a power struggle with a six-year-old.” His voice is languid and soothing. The temper he once acknowledged flares up less nowadays. He is first amused, then apologetic, when the photographer recalls the last time they met: “The paparazzi had been on your back. You were well fucked off.” A quick exchange of information establishes that this was in the early 00s. Robbins was likely being hounded over his<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2003/apr/20/usa.iraq\"> opposition to the Iraq war</a>. In the wake of their protest, he and Sarandon had been disinvited from a Bull Durham anniversary event held by the Baseball Hall of Fame. “Crazy times,” he sighs.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b7937b77bc0e1e6627eedef9b184b5e858e855e6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434110195821/82f6589c-ff06-4a47-badc-5b6e9c4f27ac-389x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tim Robbins in Lyon.\" width=\"389\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Robbins in Lyon.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Prisoners in his acting workshops aren’t the only ones who have cottoned on to the downside of tribalism. The same thought occurred to Robbins when he was directing a production of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2009/may/10/1984-george-orwell\">1984</a>. He realised that the “two-minute hate” that Orwell imagined, in which citizens scream at the TV screen, was part of his own life, only it involved watching news programmes that demonised the right, or getting riled at Fox News. “Maybe it’s no accident.” He stubs out his cigarette thoughtfully on the heel of his shoe. “Maybe the design is that we stay divided.”<br /></p> \n<p>For years, he was caricatured, along with Sarandon and their Dead Man Walking collaborator <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/seanpenn\">Sean Penn</a>, as a bleeding-heart Hollywood liberal. (He is among those lampooned in <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/team-america-world-police\">Team America: World Police</a>.) His political allegiance hasn’t switched. He’s very forgiving of Obama, for instance: “I happen to think he approached office with good intentions.” But his outlook has altered since his right to free speech was defended during the Iraq war by the sort of industry figures, including <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/clinteastwood\">Clint Eastwood</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/kevin-costner\">Kevin Costner</a>, who might not naturally be his political allies. “I know Republicans who love their children and are not evil. We might disagree on a lot of things but there is common ground. I know some Republicans who acknowledge climate change. I don’t think it gets us anywhere to be in a constant battle.”<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>That's such a strange thing [sending $500 cheques to 10 Republicans]. I think I was angry at some Democrats over the war</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Even so, it was downright <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jan/29/tim-robbins-explains-his-campaign-contributions-re/?page=all\">perverse of him to send cheques for $500-a-piece to 10 Republicans in 2006</a>. “Yeah, that is such a strange thing,” he laughs, as though we are discussing crop circles or spontaneous human combustion. “I called my accountant and said, ‘Was this real?’ I really don’t remember what happened. I think I was angry at some Democrats for supporting the war. There was an article. In a men’s magazine. It said, ‘Here are some candidates that are not so awful.’” He is talking in slow, faltering sentences, trying to make sense of this contradictory evidence. “I don’t think I can get my money back.” He’s giggling now. “I can’t deny I did it. I was following bad advice.”<br /></p> \n<p>Whatever the reason, he seems happy to have contributed some good-natured mischief to the world. It is into that category that his rambunctious version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream also falls. A few hours later, as Robbins joins the curtain call beneath a spotlight provided by the full moon, he is wearing a smile that looks ready to spill off the sides of his face. Cushions on which the audience have been sitting rain down on him and his cast. Making his exit, he slips backwards on one, only to transform the mishap into a full-blown slapstick moment: he turns each subsequent step into an identical stumble, his arms windmilling, so that it appears to have been his intention all along to play the goofball. He looks like he’s having the time of his life.<br /></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.nuitsdefourviere.com/\">Les Nuits de Fourvi&egrave;re runs until 31 July in Lyon, France</a><br /></li> \n</ul> \n<p><br /></p>","section":"Stage","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434109504472/01951440-d57f-47db-afea-a693b4d275f3-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graeme Robertson for the Guardian","altText":"Tim Robbins in Lyon, France, where his Actors' Gang performed at Les Nuits de Fourvières.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434109696371/3e9add37-4832-40ff-9d60-95f6f0058242-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tim Robbins with former wife Susan Sarandon in the 1988 hit Bull Durham.

We meet in Paris, a few days after the Jenner cover has become a global news story.</p> \n<p>“I knew everybody would be asking me about it,” she says, explaining the thoughtful and nuanced blog she posted in response to Jenner’s transition. “I am so moved by all the love and support Caitlyn is receiving,” she wrote. “It feels like a new day, indeed, when a trans person can present her authentic self to the world for the first time and be celebrated for it so universally.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/15/orange-is-the-new-black-season-four-confirmed\">Orange Is the New Black confirmed for season four</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But in the same blog, Cox questions the celebrations of Caitlyn’s attractiveness, and urges a continuing focus on diversity and multiple voices within the trans community. “I thought there was a conversation that was not being had,” she explains. “It was about me wanting to acknowledge all those trans folks out there who don’t have access to health care, who don’t embody cisnormative beauty standards, even that cisnormative beauty standards are deeply problematic.</p> \n<p>Cox is unafraid to speak her mind and has spent much of the last year appearing on platforms at US colleges. It’s hard to think of another TV star with such a dual life.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLk4OZTWqdc\">Orange is the New Black</a> began in 2013, and, along with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULwUzF1q5w4\">House of Cards</a>, was a pioneer of television that was not actually on television, and brought Netflix its biggest audience for an original show. Cox had appeared as a contestant on the reality show I Want to Work For Diddy (she did not end up working for the rap mogul, leaving in its sixth week) but OITNB was her breakout role. Her character Sophia is a transgender woman imprisoned for credit card fraud committed to fund her gender reassignment surgery. “I love her heart and soul,” Cox says. “She’s kinda sassy, too. I love the no-nonsense sass and the quiet wisdom she has.” She waves her hand. “I hate that word, sassy.” She pauses. “For years I would get direction from people asking, ‘Can you make her sassier?’ Which is code for, can you make it a little more ‘black’, a little more attitude? It rubs me the wrong way. There’s something that feels a little patriarchal about it too, right?” The <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SassyBlackWoman\">“sassy best friend” trope</a> has been a TV cliche for years; OITNB, an ensemble drama telling stories of women in prison, firmly rejects those stereotypes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9068726cea267852c7f34ef1f734b38744e5c496\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434127783635/2f87c12f-f0ba-4ad7-9660-993a6fd632d1-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A year before Caitlyn Jenner’s Vanity Fair viral sensation, Cox appeared on the cover of Time magazine\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A year before Caitlyn Jenner’s Vanity Fair viral sensation, Cox appeared on the cover of Time magazine. Photograph: Time</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cox agrees that it has one of the most diverse casts on television, “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/26/-sp-women-shonda-rhimes-shondaland\">outside of Shondaland</a>,” the studio run by the formidable Shonda Rhimes and which makes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prE0lIZOqbk\">Scandal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_2707650637&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=baRfki0-L2Q&amp;v=q1pcpgREQ5c\">Grey’s Anatomy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fGby9c7yyQ\">How to Get Away with Murder</a>. “Now we have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBzu_jKLJek\">Empire</a> and other shows coming down the pipe that have more black and brown faces on them. I don’t know if we’re a trailblazer or not, but I would hate to think that this is a trend. It’s not enough to have people of different sexual orientations, races, genders, ages, sizes on television. The story must be compelling.”</p> \n<p>She leans over carefully (she’s wearing a skintight orange dress, “nothing to do with the show”, that leaves little room for manoeuvre) and shows me her Instagram account on her phone, where a picture of her and other cast members on the cover of <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/3rGwh1ih4D/?taken-by=lavernecox\">Essence magazine currently has over 19,000 likes</a>. “I’m a black transgender chick from Mobile, Alabama, I grew up poor and working class, and I’m on the cover of magazines,” she notes, with some amazement.</p> \n<p>Cox was raised with her twin brother – who plays her OITNB character in her pre-transition scenes – by a single mother. She endured relentless homophobic bullying as a child, and has described other children at school calling her names such as “sissy” and “faggot”, as well as being chased home from school. A teacher once informed her mother: “Your son is going to end up in New Orleans in a dress if we don‘t get him in therapy right away.” At 11, she attempted suicide, and credits a move to study dance at the Alabama School of Fine Arts with saving her life. In her late teens, she moved to New York to pursue acting. She describes herself as “gender-nonconforming” when she first arrived in the city, where she began her transition.</p> \n<p>I ask her where she went out when she first arrived, but she’s coy about naming the clubs, because “if I tell you the venues, it will date me too much”. She says she loved to just “go out and <em>dance</em>. It was before boys – well there’s never been a time before boys! – but, like, I wasn’t going out looking for boys. I was going out to dress up and have fun. And it felt so pure.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"78271e4c34042c023b96ad2787df961d4d53289a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434128040413/331ce1f7-2cc2-49f8-a644-eaaa4999af42-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"'I love her heart and soul' ...

Laverne Cox as Sophia in Orange is the New Black. Photograph: Jessica Miglio for Netflix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The New York nightlife also provided Cox with a living. “A lot of black transgender women aren’t so lucky, but I was able to perform and put together a look that was able to fly.” In fact, during the first season of OITNB, Cox was still working at a restaurant called Lucky Cheng’s on the Lower East Side, where she had applied to work as a waitress, but ended up performing as a drag queen. She recognises how lucky she was to have the opportunity, and praises the queens and trans women she worked with who became her family, but says the job itself was “degrading, and it never stopped feeling degrading. We mostly catered to bachelorette parties, groups of girls who would come in from the outer boroughs to celebrate with ‘the freaks’. I don’t like to be negative, but that was the gig.”</p> \n<p>Cox left Lucky Cheng’s after the first season of OITNB wrapped, and has been in work almost constantly since, appearing on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePs3v9ls4sg\">The Mindy Project</a>, shooting a film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4270516/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_4\">Grandma</a>, with Lily Tomlin, fronting a pilot called Doubt for CBS and making a documentary on trans life for MTV, among plentiful other acting gigs. I ask her if she’s noticed a difference in the kinds of roles she is offered now; if, say, she is no longer being typecast as a prostitute. She gently corrects a poor choice of words. “I’ve played sex workers seven different times on television and in films. People who do sex work are human beings and deserve to have their stories told in humanising ways. But I’ve done it so much that I want to do something different.” I ask if I’ve made a faux pas with “prostitute”. “Maybe because I’ve talked to a lot of folks who do advocacy for sex workers, but for me it’s about acknowledging that it is work, so it’s less stigmatising, absolutely.”</p> \n<p>Cox has spent many months on a speaking tour of college campuses in the US and Canada with a lecture called Ain’t I A Woman. “Before I knew I was a trans woman I wanted to be on stage and act and dance, but my acting has given me the platform to speak out,” she says. “Before Orange, I was writing pieces about gender for the Huffington Post, and speaking in Albany for <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laverne-cox/transgender-freedom-riders-the-fight-for-transgender-equality-in-new-york-state_b_3129833.html\">the passage of the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act</a>, but I just got a bigger platform.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1feeab8730d13b5095ef011203a3c24fc773260d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434128282804/0c6d3947-70df-4f32-986b-0b1e66a82919-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Laverne Cox (right)  in The Mindy Project\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laverne Cox (right) in The Mindy Project.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox vis Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Presumably it’s easier to simply not be the person everyone asks for an opinion on every issue connected to life as a trans person. “It’s intense, it’s hard,” she admits, but says she has always felt as if she should be of service, and has a sense of this being “God’s will for me, to be very grandiose about it.” Plus, she says, “I was frustrated with the way trans stories were being talked about in the media and press.”</p> \n<p>When Cox appeared on that cover of Time magazine, it was a vital, historical moment. She says now that with people like her and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/01/caitlyn-jenner-vanity-fair-cover-life-affirming\">Caitlyn Jenner</a> in the public eye, trans people are experiencing “unprecedented affirming visibility”. But visibility only goes so far. “We need more people of colour in positions of power at LGBT organisations, more trans people, different perspectives. And we need more queer and LGBT perspectives in black organisations, so we are not getting myopic,” she insists. She lists stark, horrifying statistics. “In the first eight weeks of 2015, seven trans women were murdered, and they were all trans women of colour. They’re not being murdered just because they’re trans, but because they’re at the intersection of identities, of race, class, homelessness. These issues have to be addressed if we want to end violence against trans folk.”</p> \n<p>We discuss <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">the Guardian’s project The Counted</a>, tracking the number Americans killed by police this year, which has revealed that black Americans killed by police are twice as likely to be unarmed as white Americans. “I don’t know if this is incendiary or not, but the United States was created on the backs of slave labour,” she says. “And so you have to reckon with the fact that the system is inherently a white supremacist system. That’s controversial to a lot of folks. There’s so much confirmation bias in how we’re raised and it can be deeply painful to realise that everything we thought about the world around us is a lie.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fee21e3fe6774dd5e544c8276e812b8a3c0105c5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434128474747/1fffd9ea-2828-4bf3-a581-adca3d6b4b54-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'I have to look in the mirror and say, this is my black nose, and it’s gorgeous.' Photograph: Andrew H Walker/Getty Images\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I have to look in the mirror and say, this is my black nose, and it’s gorgeous.’ Photograph: Andrew H Walker/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She wonders if this is why people struggle to understand transgender issues, and brings up a survey that suggests 92% of Americans believe they have never met a trans person. “People get so frustrated with this trans thing because they’re like, there’s just men and women, vaginas and penises, you’re either one or the other.” But, she says, it’s a western construct. “If you look at spirit traditions in the United States, or <a href=\"http://www.everyculture.com/South-Asia/Hijra-Religion-and-Expressive-Culture.html\">hijra traditions in India</a>, religious cultures all over the world have fourth and fifth genders. And then Europeans and westerners came along and said, ‘What is this?’ Colonialism was not just about colonising whiteness, but about colonising the gender binary model.”</p> \n<p>There’s a moment of silence, and then we both start to to laugh: this is not exactly a typical celebrity interview. This willingness to not just be visible as a trans woman, but be radical about it too – to not just say publicly that Caitlyn Jenner looks good, but to assess what that reaction means for the trans community and women as a whole – is invigorating. When the Vanity Fair cover was released, Cox started a Twitter hashtag, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/transisbeautiful\">#transisbeautiful</a>, in order to “multiply trans narratives” – that is, to acknowledge that both her and Caitlyn’s situations are privileged, and theirs are not the only stories to tell. But she says there is an element of selfishness at play, too. “I started the hashtag to celebrate all the things that are beautiful about my transness,” she says. It’s hard to imagine Cox, so strident with her views, lacking in confidence, but she says becoming a public figure has amplified physical scrutiny of her.</p> \n<p>“I have been picking myself apart my whole life,” she says. “I have never talked about the medical details of my transition, and a lot of people assume I’ve had all this surgery. Years ago, I wanted really highly invasive surgical procedures to feminise my face. All these years later, I have the money to do it, but I don’t want it. I don’t want it! I’m happy that this is the face that God gave me, and it’s imperfect.” She says, with horror, that she was recently told by a commenter on Instagram that she should get her nose done. She didn’t reply. “No, girl! My fans were like, that’s the nose African Americans have, and what’s wrong with that? My fans had my back. In those moments I have to look in the mirror and say, this is my black nose, and it’s gorgeous.”</p> \n<p>She sits back in her chair and exhales dramatically. We covered a lot, didn’t we? “We covered <em>a lot</em>,” she laughs. “I think you got all of Laverne today. Let’s see how you handle it.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2015/06/orange-is-the-new-black-netflix-early-release-1201441766/\"><em>Orange is the New Black season three</em></a><em> is on Netflix now</em></p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434125117840/My-acting-has-given-me-th-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'My acting has given me the platform to speak out' … Laverne Cox.

Together they released her debut album, Frank, in 2003. He now works as senior A&amp;R manager at Island Records.</em></strong></p> \n<p><strong>How did you become Amy’s manager?</strong><br />An artist I was looking after, Tyler James, said he knew a girl called Amy Winehouse who’d dropped out of school, and things weren’t happening for her. Looking back on it, I was 19, working in the music industry but I didn’t really know anything. I called her and pretended I was this big manager who could make things happen, giving it all the showbiz talk, and obviously she thought I was a wanker, she made it very clear. She flicked my ego away like it was a pea on my shoulder, and I realised humour was the backup plan, and that’s how we connected. The whole time she was saying she had absolutely no interest in making music. I got this package through the post with a demo tape with two songs on, and the jiffy bag was covered in stickers of hearts and kisses, and it had “Amy” scribbled over it about 100 times. It didn’t fit with the girl who didn’t want to be noticed. I put it on in my car and it blew my mind. As soon as producers heard her they were in. From the off, she was very funny, very blunt. She was different, she used to make a lot of her own clothes. She was a personality.</p> \n<p><strong>What was your relationship with her like as a manager?</strong><br />We connected on music, we used to go to a lot of gigs. I’d feel completely inadequate because I thought I knew my music – I assumed, I’m the guy in music, I’m gonna know more than you – and I learned very quickly that she knew so much more. It was my job to get her from A to B. If I booked in a session and didn’t literally get her out of bed, in the car, drop her off, pick her up, sit in on the session, it just didn’t happen. There were two motivations: one, you had to make it fun. Two, there had to be a strong musical pull. If there was a good studio with loads of instruments, or some musician who could really play, she’d be out the door like a flash. We were young, we were kids, we were figuring it out in our own ways.</p> \n<p><strong>What was her songwriting process like?<br /></strong>There were two sides to how Amy would write: either playful, tongue-in-cheek, almost concept-based, like I Heard Love is Blind and Fuck Me Pumps, or extremely personal and deep. I remember the first two songs she came up with for <em>Back to Black</em> were two completely opposite styles of her: Addicted, which went “you got me addicted, more than any dick did”, although this was way before any signs of any problems. The first really serious one I heard was Unholy War, where she used this very current phrase that was all over the news, and she’d made it about her own mess and unsolvable problems.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6106730ee7a5ba4604dab792401375ecbaecb2c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434121652885/c9808ecb-1cf7-4670-b480-433dcf575060-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nick Shymansky with Amy Winehouse.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Connected’: Amy Winehouse with Nick Shymansky.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong> What was Amy like to hang out with?</strong><br />At times it would be very difficult, but most of the time she’d be so sweet and funny. There are lots of things though which I now look back on and think, shit, that was a sign [of things to come].Once we were out in this really nice hotel in Miami, having the best time, and she came downstairs in a bad, bad mood, and she just kicked a metal chair across the restaurant. She must have felt instantly bad, and said, “I’m in a really bad mood and I don’t know why, I’m just really angry, and it’s not your fault, I’m really sorry.” Looking back years later, I realise that there was depression. That’s something I learned from the film: I didn’t know she took Seroxat as a teenager. I didn’t know about the bulimia either, until towards the end of working with her, when she dropped a massive amount of weight real quick. It’s very easy to look back, it’s very hard to see things all around you at the time.</p> \n<p><strong>How did Amy change in later years?<br /></strong>I’ve never experienced such a drastic change in a human being. I’d been on holiday in 2005, and when I got back she told me she’d met this guy and fallen in love, and that he was “a right wrong’un, but a good boy”. I walked in and he was there, and that’s when I first met Blake [Fielder-Civil]. And I thought, something’s really wrong. I don’t have any evidence of this, but I feel instinctively that she was doing something heavy, like crack or heroin. It was horrible to see her going from someone so tender and brilliant and warm to being kind of derelict and lost. But at the same time there was something vulnerable about Blake. I get angry when I see him in the film, and I’ve been very angry with him in the past, but at the end of the day he wasn’t a grownup, he was a lost kid who had his own issues.</p> \n<p><strong>What happened after that?<br /></strong>The next year was just hell, things got very dark – phone calls in the middle of the night, her talking gibberish, “come and get me, I’m in the toilet at the pub”, “what pub”, and the phone would hang up. I’d be driving round Camden at 2am, trying to see where there were lights on in pubs. She knew that I knew something wasn’t right, and around me she was kind of ashamed. I felt really protective. There were glimpses of [the old] her here and there, but she never got back to that place ever again.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/16/amy-review-asif-kapadias-amy-winehouse-film-is-a-tragic-masterpiece\">Amy review: Asif Kapadia’s Amy Winehouse film is a tragic masterpiece</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>You famously tried to make her go to rehab... </strong><br />Yes, we got through a few arguments, the denial, and I got her to a place where she said, “OK, fine, let’s do this, I can’t lie to you, there are issues.” So I got her to go and see the guy about rehab. At the time I didn’t really know her father, but she made it clear to me she’d do it if he backed her. So I got on the phone and lined it all up, he assured me she needed help and that he’d back me. I drove her all the way to Bluewater where he lived, and he completely backtracked. It was like she manipulated him. She sat on his lap, gave him this look like, “I don’t really need to go, do I?” and he was like, “Of course you don’t need to go.” [This issue is covered in <em>Amy</em>: her father has since disputed the film’s version of events] </p> \n<p><strong>How did you feel when she made it all into a song?</strong><br /> I knew at some point she’d write a really big hit, and it was ironic that the hit she wrote was, verbatim, that day, and it was mocking me. Not only was I not her manager any more, but she’d written this huge hit that’s undeniably brilliant, that was a complete mockery of our friendship and of what she needed. And the whole world’s dancing along to it, and really she was writing about a decision that five years later would result in her being dead. It was really fucked up.</p> \n<p><strong>What do you think about the song when you hear it now?<br /></strong>I can’t really listen to Amy any more, unfortunately. If I walk into a shop and she’s playing, I always get a little sense of pride and warmth, but I can’t put it on. The greatest songs, like Motown, are happy, uptempo songs that are heartbreaking when you actually listen to them – there is that tonal contradiction. It’s like The Detroit Spinners’s It’s a Shame: people dance to that song and all the hooks are brilliant, but if you listen to it it’s a guy desperately begging someone to not break his heart.</p> \n<p><strong>Did you lose touch after that?<br /></strong>We carried on as friends for a bit, but I kept on seeing bad things happen. So I decided I was going to disappear, and make it clear she could call me if she wanted to sort it out. I was so sure – being young and green – that I could make this huge statement for Amy, and within two months max she’d be in rehab, sorting things out. The huge mistake I made was I thought nothing could continue without me: Amy had missed half a dozen planes in the past two years. Any time I wasn’t around, things didn’t happen. Then I heard whispers that Raye [Cosbert], her promoter, was to be her manager. Her career exploded six weeks after that. I had friends call me – over the past seven years everyone had known I’d been completely behind this girl, Amy Winehouse, put all my time into it – so when she had that massive hit people would call me and congratulate me, and I didn’t have it in me to say: I’m not her manager any more. It took me a while to realise I was out of the picture.</p> \n<p><strong>In the film Yasiin Bey [Mos Def] says she “wanted to disappear”. Does that fit in with the image of Amy you knew?<br /></strong>Yeah, no doubt about it. But just because someone’s self-destructive doesn’t mean that you should just leave them to it – you should still try and make them realise they don’t have to chase that demon. The other thing is, from when I met her at 16 until 2005 she was stimulated and busy, and at the end of the last tour was the first time she’d been able to go “kind of been there, done it, and now I’ve got to figure out what’s next”. She was very bright – when we used to travel she used to do sudokus at the speed of light, crosswords. She used to read books that even now I can’t read – she needed stimulation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57cc23625f9c1408103a86d2c55af45acba7f9c0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434131926149/20024cc5-73e8-49f9-b5ca-9acd27f41c70-396x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Amy Winehouse photographed in Camden by Karen Robinson.\" width=\"396\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Winehouse photographed in Camden by Karen Robinson.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>The family have distanced themselves from the film. Do you think they were portrayed wrongly?</strong><br />As a film-maker you have to get a lot of different people’s realities, look at facts, timelines, ask questions and piece it together. I don’t want to pass judgment on her family – they’ve lost their daughter. They all loved each other as well, it’s just that different people handle things in different ways. But I feel like the film was consistent with how I saw it. I think a lot of the stuff that is angering Mitch [Amy’s father] are things that he is shown saying in the film. I think he loved Amy, and Amy loved him, and it’s a very, very delicate part of telling the story, which I think they’ve handled about the best they possibly could.</p> \n<p><strong>How did you react when you heard of Amy’s death?</strong><br />I was getting married the next day. It was beautiful weather, and Amy was coming, she told me she was really excited. The wedding was a chance for her to see a lot of people from the past and show that she’d got it together. It was about four o’clock, we were in the garden: it was an amazing atmosphere, we were so happy. And then my cousin came running into the garden, shouting, “I’ve just turned on the news, Amy’s dead,” and it felt like someone had punched me full pelt in the stomach. I justcouldn’t comprehend it, and I went into shock. I kept thinking, “But she can’t be, there’s a place on that table for her, she’s coming.” The happiest weekend in my life turned really dark. I did get married the next day, and it was beautiful, but it was also a bit like a wake.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/apr/27/amy-winehouse-documentary-family-cannes-film-festival\">Amy Winehouse documentary is ‘misleading’, says family</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Why do you think Amy’s legacy has been so powerful?</strong><br />In a landscape where artists can be quite safe and average at times, she was special. Many modern artists are very strategic and business-minded about their career, whereas Amy was totally music. She just really didn’t give a shit, and I think that really projected through her interviews, her music, her persona, and that’s what connected with people. I think this film had to happen, but I think after this she should probably be left alone for a while. Then we’ll see where her legacy naturally sits in 10, 15 years.</p> \n<h2>Jude Rogers, music writer: ‘I argued for Back to Black to win the Mercury but it didn’t – the tabloid version of her had taken over’</h2> \n<p>Her size got me first. She was tiny, a doll under a huge beehive, which threatened to topple her over. Tottering across the stage in a baby-pink, acid-blue and neon-yellow dress, she sang Love Is a Losing Game like none of us imagined she’d be able to sing it. Her voice that night was mature, world-weary, stripped of the ornamentation with which she’d lately been cloaking it. Looking at her then, as I look at her now, I remember thinking, bloody hell. How is she only 23?</p> \n<p>Watching <em>Amy</em>, and remembering her performance at the 2007 Mercury music prize ceremony, I was amazed how quickly after that I forgot that she was a human being. It was my first year as a Mercury prize panellist, my first glimpse into that big, shiny world. <em>Back to Black</em> had been released the previous November, and at the <em>Word</em> offices, where I worked as reviews editor, I remember its first run through my headphones, then playing it again, again, again.</p> \n<p>Was it just me that felt like this? It usually was. But by the next September, its fresh, bloody mix of raw lyric-writing, jazz, pop and hip-hop – a description that denies it its full power, its instantly identifiable style – had become a global soundtrack. Its success felt like a victory already. I argued for it to win the Mercury prize, but it didn’t; somehow the tabloid version of her had taken over. This album had become much bigger than her.</p> \n<p><em>Amy</em> broke my heart in several ways. It showed, very vividly, how this tiny woman wrote these songs: here are touchingly neat handwritten lyrics and scribbled hearts, here’s her instinctive guitar-playing. Here is her youthful and gleeful intolerance of media bullshit, before she became immune to it, blank-eyed and hollow, as that fame grew.</p> \n<p>And before her name became comedy shorthand, and her struggles ours to plunder, there was Winehouse’s wit and her cleverness and her daftness. I remember interviewing her on the phone one Christmas; she was in a cab going back to the house of one of her oldest friends for a bath. She was funny and wry and happy as Larry. Later on, we never thought of Winehouse as a young woman, more a billboard poster, or a cartoon. Maybe that’s why the voices and images of her oldest friends in this film, circling around this tiny girl we felt we all knew but never did, got me most of all.</p> \n<h2><strong>Molly King, e</strong><strong>xecutive director, Other Voices festival: </strong>‘I was at the front, as close to Amy as you could get. And I was totally enthralled’</h2> \n<p>In December 2006, a couple of months after Rehab was released, Amy came to Dingle to play on the <em>Other Voices</em> TV show. My dad, Philip King, created the show and the festival that grew out of it, and I’ve been working on it since I was nine. I was 14 when Amy came. It was my job to make sure the cameraman’s cables didn’t get tangled up, so I was right at the very front of the church on a little cushion, probably as close to Amy Winehouse as you could have gotten, and I was totally enthralled.<strong><br /></strong></p> \n<p>Before the gig, I carried all her bags up to her hotel room. She was like, “Jesus, how did you carry all of them, they’re so heavy?” I remember thinking she was so small, a tiny person. She’d been travelling for hours to get to Dingle, and there was no complaining, no drama. All she wanted was a tube of Pringles and then she was ready to go. Her performance was stunning. I was really struck by how happy she was on stage. </p> \n<p>The film was devastating. I loved it but I found it very harrowing to watch. I would have liked to have seen more about her relationship with music – she had an innate sense of rhythm, and her knowledge of jazz, R&amp;B and gospel was encyclopaedic. I think it focused a little too much on the negatives, on her downward spiral, and not enough on the music, which was the real love of her life. <strong>Interview by Killian Fox</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Tom Oxley, p</strong><strong>hotographer: </strong>‘She ripped the phone from my hand and started singing “Congratulations” to my pregnant sister’</h2> \n<p>The film was extremely powerful. It seems a long time ago. You forget what exactly went on, and seeing all this footage brings it back. They’ve pieced it together like a jigsaw and the effect is breathtaking. It reminds you how much of a talent she was – a complete one-off.<br /></p> \n<p>I was fortunate to photograph her quite a bit over the years. It always seemed to be in dressing rooms before gigs or award shows, and when it was just her and me in the room we used to have a laugh. Once, before an <em>NME</em> awards show at the Astoria, my older sister rang me and asked if I could talk. I was like, “Not really”, and she said, “OK, I’m going to be very brief: I’m pregnant”. I said it out loud and Amy turned around. I told her it was my sister and she ripped the phone out of my hand and started singing “Congratulations”. When I got the phone back my sister was like, “Who’s that?” She couldn’t believe it when I said it was Amy Winehouse.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b870eac24d6ff55eed02edc25e07198079e04082\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/13/1434194948156/e65312c0-7788-4c11-af51-774ebe20c620-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Amy Winehouse, photographed backstage at Koko.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Winehouse, photographed backstage at Koko.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Oxley/IPC</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’ve met a lot of famous people but only a few make you think, wow, this is a huge personality, a genuine star. She used to do vocal warm-ups before the show, and hearing someone singing properly, from the diaphragm, is a special thing. But she had a lot of baggage, and what was sad in the film was seeing the pressure she was under from the British paparazzi. The flashbulbs going off every time she leaves the house. What I didn’t realise at the time was how constant the attention was – 24 hours a day from all corners of the globe.</p> \n<p>When I saw her in a professional capacity she always seemed on good form. I tried not to impose too much, and I always seemed to get invited back. I pop up in the film, backstage at the <em>Q</em> awards. She’s wearing a black and red dress. I never have problems with my kit but as soon as I took my camera out the flash packed up. It was one of those nightmare moments. I tapped the flash against the wall and put it back on. She did one of those pleasant smiles that said: hurry up , I’m waiting. Thank goodness the flash worked and I got a few really good shots.</p> \n<p>I can’t imagine how the film-makers were able to collate all that footage and make it work but they’ve done it brilliantly. You really get to see Amy for who she was. The whole thing was really well done. <strong>KF</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Sylvia Young, f</strong><strong>ounder and principal of Sylvia Young theatre school, London: </strong>‘I had to keep telling her off in school, but we did think the world of her’</h2> \n<p>I thought the film was beautiful, moving and a worthy tribute. Amy was more than a singer, and the film shows how extraordinary she was. It also shows her vulnerability, and the shots of the paparazzi hounding her were distressing. I was a little concerned about the references to her father, and I can understand him being unhappy. I knew he desperately adored her and she adored him, and I’m sure whatever he said or did would have been in her interests.<strong><br /></strong></p> \n<p>She came to our school for just under three years, from the age of 12. She was not the best behaved student, except in classes that she was really interested in. She had a boredom threshold, and it was very apparent. But she was brilliantly clever. We put her up a year, and our English teacher thought she was going to be a novelist because her writing skills were amazing. I had to keep telling her off, because that’s what you do, but we did think the world of her.</p> \n<p>Later on she always said she would come in and see us but she never made it. We talked on the phone – and she paid for her goddaughter Dionne Bromfield to come to the school, so obviously she still thought well of us. Amy was quirky, very different. She was feisty but quite shy, which people find surprising. Anybody who didn’t know her will come away from the film thinking, my goodness, what a talent. <strong>KF</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A97-pQJD6Hw\"><em>Amy</em></a><em> will be in UK cinemas from 3 July, following a nationwide preview on 30 June</em><br /></li> \n <li><em><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-film-show-live-with-asif-kapadia-on-amy-winehouse-and-much-more-17184130196\">Guardian Film Show LIVE, with Asif Kapadia on Amy Winehouse</a>, and much more.

However, he escaped poverty and discrimination to win scholarships to study economics at LSE and Columbia University, New York and to qualify as a barrister in London. A fierce critic of the caste system, he became India’s first law minister when the country won its independence in 1947. Ambedkar is still revered today by Dalits there and across the world.</p> \n<p>The house will be turned into a museum and library, with rooms available for Dalits from India who are studying, like Ambedkar, at the LSE on two new scholarships. It will need up to &pound;1m of refurbishment and conversion work if the sale goes through.</p> \n<p>Arun Kumar, general secretary of the UK-based Federation of Ambedkarite and Buddhist Organisations, said: “It is a historical place. [Ambedkar] came to London and was exposed to an atmosphere of freedom and equality and went back to India building on everything he had seen and saying, ‘If in western countries there is equality, why not in India?’”</p> \n<p>Ambedkar was born a Hindu but converted to Buddhism before he died in 1956, convinced that caste discrimination was intrinsic to his original faith. Remembered as one of the founders of modern India, his portrait hangs in many homes of India’s 200 million Dalits. “He is a hero to us, a saint, like our god,” said 38-year-old Radhika Kumar, a Dalit and a cleaner in Delhi.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/oct/19/lynching-boy-underlines-curse-caste-still-blights-india\">Lynching of boy underlines how the curse of caste still blights India</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Though some of the harsher aspects of the caste system have been moderated in recent decades, Dalits still suffer systematic discrimination. In some regions, particularly the poor northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, caste tensions can lead to violence.

Gandhi condemned caste discrimination, but believed its causes were not religious and that parts of the caste system should be maintained.</p> \n<p>The museum is being funded by the government of Maharashtra, the Indian state where Ambedkar’s family was from. Dalits are an important constituency in India and wooed by politicians. Next year is the 125th anniversary of his birth.</p> \n<p>“This is a historical moment for us because it is not just a house but has the emotions of all Indians attached to it,” Rajkumar Badole, Maharashtra’s minister of social justice, said in London this year. Badole pledged too to fund an Ambedkar chair at the LSE and scholarships.</p> \n<p>Supporters of the museum say it will have relevance in the UK, too. Research by the British government has found evidence of caste discrimination among Britons of Asian origin in the workplace and in schools. Legislation is due to be introduced this year to make caste discrimination an offence in Britain. “It is important to send a message here, too,” said Kumar.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434325669562/603e55f4-faaf-416f-a9c7-74f5ee1fc963-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Margaret Bourke-White/LIFE Picture Collection/Getty","altText":"Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar in 1946","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Margaret Bourke-White/LIFE Picture Collection/Getty"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-14T23:48:07Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T00:21:30Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":10,"contributors":[{"name":"Jason Burke","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jasonburke"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["India","Museums","Heritage","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/india","webTitle":"India"},{"id":"culture/museums","webTitle":"Museums"},{"id":"culture/heritage","webTitle":"Heritage"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jason Burke","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jasonburke"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/15/london-house-to-become-museum-to-indian-activist","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49nck","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/15/london-house-to-become-museum-to-indian-activist","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/15/london-house-to-become-museum-to-indian-activist"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434325669562/603e55f4-faaf-416f-a9c7-74f5ee1fc963-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar in 1946.
