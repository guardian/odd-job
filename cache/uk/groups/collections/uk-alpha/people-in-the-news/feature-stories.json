It was the band’s <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/artist/303248/guns-n-roses/chart?sort=position&amp;f=379\">first and only song</a> to reach No 1 on the Billboard US charts. The song’s crown jewel – a grandiose guitar solo by lead guitarist Slash – regularly lands a prominent position on all time best guitar solo lists.</p> \n<p>Unpublished Critics was also taken from a best-selling album, at least in Australia: Australian Crawl’s second LP Sirocco. It reached No 1 on the Australian charts and was one of two album chart toppers for the band.</p> \n<p>Several lineup changes and the disappointing 1985 release, Between a Rock and a Hard Place, led to Australian Crawl disbanding the following year.

Their private life is displayed constantly on social networks; and some even post private pictures of themselves. I find it a pity. Being a star entails glamour and secrecy; it’s hard to keep any degree of mystery nowadays.”</p> \n<p>The actor also had harsh words for the response to a remark she made about the coastal town of Dunkerque, where Standing Tall was filmed.

You can only do the job if you have a real vocation. These children don’t talk much, they are locked in themselves, they know full well they are in the margins. There are a lot of people involved who do their best to help… but one can’t save everyone.”</p> \n<p>Bercot, only the second female director to have been given the opening film slot, denied that women film-makers have a problem in French cinema. She said: “I don’t feel I am a minority in France; we don’t suffer discrimination. Women are well represented here. I know it’s different in other countries.”</p> \n<p>When it was pointed out that there were only two women, out of 19 film-makers, in competition at Cannes this year, Bercot responded: “It’s true we are fewer in number, but we are recent in the cinema in France.

A tribute to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/apr/14/fast-and-furious-death-paul-walker\">Paul Walker</a> from the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/fast-furious-7\">Furious 7</a><em> </em>soundtrack, it’s a massive hit, topping charts around the world. It’s easily the biggest thing Khalifa has been a part of, probably the most-spun hip-hop track since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w\">The Monster by Eminem and Rihanna</a>, which was also No 1 for four weeks, in late 2013 and early 2014.<br /></p> \n<p>But that doesn’t mean See You Again is any good. Featuring a falsetto hook sung by a diminutive, chubby-cheeked youngster named <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/CharliesVlogs\">Charlie Puth</a>, it has a distinctly Lite FM flavor, the kind of thing you might hear while picking up your allergy medicine at CVS. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgKAFK5djSk\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RgKAFK5djSk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In any case, the track has pushed Wiz Khalifa into the top echelon of rap superstars, and at only 27. He’s run up a long string of gold and platinum singles, and though he doesn’t pass the “rapper your mother has heard of” test, that’s probably not far off. But his ascent has been unlikely: he’s a stick-thin military brat from Pittsburgh, who slowly built his career over the course of a decade. He won over his city with early mixtapes like 2006’s <a href=\"http://www.datpiff.com/Wiz-Khalifa-Show-And-Prove-mixtape.301190.html\">Show and Prove</a>, which is highlighted by Pittsburgh Sound, on which he raps fast and nimbly. His underground following swelled largely on the basis of songs about smoking weed, like Flight School. (He gets as high as an airplane, you know?) </p> \n<p>For a while he didn’t really need the mainstream. His fan base wasn’t huge, but it was passionate enough to keep him in Converse and marijuana – <a href=\"http://www.thefader.com/2010/11/16/wiz-khalifa-spends-10000-a-month-on-weed-may-be-a-bad-guy\">he claimed to spend $10,000 a month on weed </a>at one point. His breakout came in 2010 with the explosion of his song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UePtoxDhJSw\">Black and Yellow</a>, which sold 3m copies. It was an inspiring hometown anthem (<em>waaay </em>better than Empire State of Mind) that shouted out the Pirates, Penguins, and Steelers’ team colours, as the latter surged to the Super Bowl. It also had a quick tempo, though many of his later hits wouldn’t. </p> \n<p>By this point he had signed with Atlantic records, home of big-name rappers like Lupe Fiasco and BoB, and also Bruno Mars. Atlantic relied on a <a href=\"http://variety.com/2011/music/news/venerable-label-becomes-hip-hop-leader-1118039086/\">formula</a>: radio-friendly raps buffered by giant sung hooks. Not everyone liked this approach <a href=\"http://uk.complex.com/music/2011/02/interview-lupe-fiasco-hates-lasers\">(Lupe Fiasco famously denounced some of his own songs)</a>, but it was undeniably successful, and Khalifa had hits with slower-paced tracks like No Sleep, When I’m Gone, Remember You and Young, Wild &amp; Free, with Mars and Snoop Dogg. </p> \n<p>Snoop has grumbled that Khalifa borrowed heavily from his sonic template. “I guess the old school version would have been for me to ‘smash’ him [because of the similarities],” Snoop told me in 2013. “[But] my heart was to love him, because I loved what he did, and he was an extension of what I had put out.” </p> \n<p>Khalifa’s latest album <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/aug/14/wiz-khalifa-blacc-hollywood-review\">Blacc Hollywood</a> is a lumbering, big-budget collection of hip-hop cliches about women, the club, and getting high, with a motivational tone. By the time of its release last August, Khalifa’s tatted-up face had become a tabloid mainstay, considering he’d moved to Los Angeles, and married and <a href=\"http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/wiz-khalifa-goes-off-on-twitter-rant-over-ex-amber-rose-201542\">had a son with Kanye’s ex Amber Rose</a>. This notoriety, combined with the fact that he was rapping slower and more deliberately – he sounds completely different than early in his career – has helped him secure his perch atop the rap pile. </p> \n<p>Thus, we got See You Again, which is disappointing not because it doesn’t talk about smoking one down in Walker’s memory, but because it’s full of vague platitudes (“That bond will never be broken/ The love will never get lost,” etc) Also, the saccharine chorus makes me want to commit genocide. But apparently that’s what people want, as the song broke Spotify’s record for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/apr/16/wiz-khalifa-see-you-again-breaks-record-most-spotify-streams\">most streams in a day</a>, some 4.2m. It’s a cliche to pine for an artist’s younger, hungrier days before they had every comfort in life. But as far as I’m concerned, Khalifa’s Pittsburgh incarnation was much more appealing than his Hollywood one. </p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431526980763/1f162cc5-a607-41e2-9636-13327ae07a53-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andrew Toth/FilmMagic","altText":"Wiz Khalifa: toast of the tabloids.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andrew Toth/FilmMagic"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T15:19:57Z","lastModified":"2015-05-13T15:42:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":13,"contributors":[{"name":"Ben Westhoff","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ben-westhoff"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Wiz Khalifa","Fast & Furious 7","Film","Culture","Music","Hip-hop","Urban music"],"tags":[{"id":"music/wiz-khalifa","webTitle":"Wiz Khalifa"},{"id":"film/fast-furious-7","webTitle":"Fast & Furious 7"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"music/hip-hop","webTitle":"Hip-hop"},{"id":"music/urban","webTitle":"Urban music"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ben Westhoff","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ben-westhoff"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/13/wiz-khalifa-see-you-again-superstar","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48phy","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/may/13/wiz-khalifa-see-you-again-superstar","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/13/wiz-khalifa-see-you-again-superstar"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431526980763/1f162cc5-a607-41e2-9636-13327ae07a53-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Wiz Khalifa: toast of the tabloids.

This is actually less than the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/mayor-assembly/gla/spending-money-wisely/salaries-and-expenses/gla-elected-members-remuneration\">&pound;144,000 he’s entitled to</a> as he’s declined to accept annual pay rises during his second term. For the final year of that term, which ends in May 2016, Johnson will therefore get just over &pound;47,000. His salary as an MP is &pound;67,000, making a total of around &pound;114,000 a year. In other words, holding down his two jobs as a politician means Johnson is to be about 28 grand worse off. </p> \n<p>Also, he won’t be getting paid for <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-parachuted-into-camerons-political-cabinet-10240673.html\">being a member of David Cameron’s “political cabinet”</a>, a role that City Hall says will take up about two hours of his time every second Tuesday (and is not to be confused with being a cabinet minister, as some on social media are doing). Meetings of this group will either follow or precede government cabinet meetings and be attended by Cameron and various Tory party top brass. Johnson will get over all that, though. The mayor will still be cranking out his &pound;250,000 a year Telegraph column, so don’t expect to see him queuing for lentils at the <a href=\"http://islington.foodbank.org.uk/\">Islington food bank,</a> even though an unspecified portion of that separate, media income is donated to charities. <br /></p> \n<p>It was never likely that Johnson would be given a ministerial role while he was still mayor - that really would have been pushing his luck - and Cameron said in advance of the election that in the event of his remaining prime minister he would expect his “star player” to see out his second four-year mayoral stint in full. Reports that this suits Johnson anyway because it means he won’t be constrained by cabinet responsibility from continuing to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32703425\">campaign against a third runway at Heathrow</a> - now thought <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/stars-are-aligning-for-heathrow-in-postelection-push-for-third-runway-10241961.html\">more likely to happen</a> than it was - are, I’m assured, pretty much accurate. There could be another reason it suits him, though. <br /></p> \n<p>Cameron’s unpredicted victory means Johnson no longer needs to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/mar/27/why-boris-johnson-could-be-baling-out-as-london-mayor-by-bonfire-night\">step down as mayor early</a> in order to fulfill his ambition of replacing his old Bullingdon Club chum as Tory leader. Not that this means mayoral matters will be receiving quite the attention they deserve from “<a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/01/trouble-boris-johnson-how-bad-would-it-really-be-if-man-became-prime-minister\">Boris</a>” any more than they were <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/nov/02/boris-johnson-quit-london-mayor-ambitions-leader-tory-party\">before May 7.</a> Spending more time at the Palace of Westminster will give him more opportunity to work on that Conservative leadership bid, impressing fellow MPs with his gravitas, grip and general marvellousness. Cameron has said he will be gone from Number 10 in advance of the next general election, due in 2020. Expect the by then ex-mayor Johnson to be fully revved up to take his place. It was rather a good general election for him.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431515075035/dfcb2c0b-575d-429c-b82a-188877a2fa01-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andrew Matthews/PA","altText":"The mayor arrives for the election count in Uxbridge and South Ruislip.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T13:34:03Z","lastModified":"2015-05-14T08:19:24Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":198,"contributors":[{"name":"Dave Hill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/davehill"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["General election 2015","Politics","UK news","Boris Johnson","David Cameron","Conservatives","London politics","London","Mayoral elections","Society","Local politics","Local government","Ken Livingstone"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/general-election-2015","webTitle":"General election 2015"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/boris","webTitle":"Boris Johnson"},{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"politics/london","webTitle":"London politics"},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London"},{"id":"politics/mayoral-elections","webTitle":"Mayoral elections"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics"},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government"},{"id":"politics/livingstone","webTitle":"Ken Livingstone"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Dave Hill","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/davehill"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/13/boris-johnson-takes-pay-cut-but-hes-a-big-election-winner","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48pck","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/may/13/boris-johnson-takes-pay-cut-but-hes-a-big-election-winner","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/13/boris-johnson-takes-pay-cut-but-hes-a-big-election-winner"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-456659673","source":"guardian.co.uk","durationInSeconds":323,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/05/08/150508boris_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/05/08/150508boris.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/5/8/1431074888146/KP_219552_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Cult of Boris","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Cult of Boris","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Cult of Boris"}}},"importance":3,"showQuotedHeadline":true}],"lastModified":"2015-05-14T08:36:24Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/uk-alpha/people-in-the-news/feature-stories","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/uk-alpha/people-in-the-news/feature-stories"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"uk-alpha/people-in-the-news/feature-stories/front"}
