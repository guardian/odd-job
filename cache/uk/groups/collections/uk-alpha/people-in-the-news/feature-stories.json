I have passion. I have curiosity. I’ve always had a lot of energy.” She waggles a hand heavy with statement jewellery. “I have a fake hip, knee, thumb; more metal in me than a bionic woman, but I can still do Pilates.”</p> \n<p>Fonda leans forward, channelling gran as styled by Cartier. “Looking at age from the outside is so scary. But when you’re inside age – and I’m very much inside age – it isn’t scary at all. You need maturity to learn this, but it’s important to figure out what you need to do for yourself every day to decompress. I meditate. And I <em>always</em> get eight hours’ sleep.”</p> \n<p>That means last night she was sure to leave the yacht party on the dot of 10pm; her other daily must-have, a vodka martini, denied her by a waiter who brought a bottle of vermouth, not a cocktail. Her face nearly creases with laughter. “The French are about <em>wine</em>. I can’t wait to get home though.”</p> \n<p>Fonda perches, graceful as a mantis, on a Cannes hotel roof terrace overlooking the ocean. The wind whips so hard the awnings creak like the galley of a slave ship and I can barely see her for my hair. Fonda’s immaculate caramel waves barely move.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f38ccd9bd14655f0081121a81dd572fb158277a2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432225125922/bd1a0909-f1f0-4437-90a2-353aded4b5d0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lily Tomlin, June Diane Raphael and Jane Fonda in the Netflix series Grace and Frankie.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lily Tomlin, June Diane Raphael and Jane Fonda in the Netflix series Grace and Frankie.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melissa Moseley</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I’m two years older than my dad was when he died,” she says calmly. Five months before, she’d picked up Henry’s best actor Oscar for On Golden Pond (he was too ill to attend). “Katharine Hepburn was three years younger than I am now when she made that movie. People looked older back then. I wish I were brave enough to not do plastic surgery but I think I bought myself a decade.”</p> \n<p>Her eyes gleam from dewy skin (she’s brand ambassador for L’Or&eacute;al). There are some bags beneath; others were disposed of a while back, along with neck and chin wrinkles. “The danger with surgery is you say: ‘Oh this is good, let me do more. It can be an addiction. Thirty percent of women were sexually abused when they were young. And a woman who has been sexually abused will have a tendency to go too far. When you’re young it can be this” – she mimes self-harm – “and when you’re older it can be plastic surgery. When I see a woman who’s made her face a mask I say: ‘I bet, I bet.’”</p> \n<p>A quick pause for breath. “People don’t realise sexual abuse is an epidemic. And it has a lot to do with why women are distorting their faces with plastic surgery. It’s shocking to me that more than 30 people in the US have said Bill Cosby drugged them and raped them and there are still people who don’t believe it.” Cosby has denied the allegations. “It’s hard for people to understand why you could have been raped years ago and not said anything. People don’t understand the sense of guilt and shame. A lot has to do with how the media report it and how the police handle it. We have to change that and introduce real punishment for the perpetrators.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I believe it’s possible for a woman who really likes sex to have agency over her sex life</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Despite Oscars, an honorary Palme d’Or, Fonda has long been more activist than actor. In the 1970s she dismissed any role that wasn’t “issue-driven”. She believes in living her politics through life, topped up with active campaigning, whatever retractions this may later entail.</p> \n<p>She speaks like she writes – in her memoirs, on her excitedly typo-filled <a href=\"http://www.janefonda.com/still-goingcannes-2015-part-1/\">blog</a> – keen on the empowering nugget, often stressing what’s important by saying: “This is important.” She seems sound and rational and only occasionally prone to babble.</p> \n<p>This is the third or fourth age of Fonda. She quit acting in the early 1990s after 30 years, then returned with Jennifer Lopez comedy Monster-in-Law in 2005 (“big hit in the US, but the French were too intellectual”). Ten years on and she has hit her stride again. May saw the launch of well-reviewed Netflix series <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/may/08/grace-and-frankie-jane-fonda-lily-tomlin\">Grace and Frankie</a> (she and Lily Tomlin play two women whose husbands have left them for each other). “Old women are the fastest growing demographic in the world and yet you don’t see them in central parts. TV is more forgiving for us – and it’s edgier. Movies are so expensive that they play it safe. If you wanna really say something you go to TV.”</p> \n<p>Or you work with Paolo Sorrentino. Fonda is in Cannes for Youth, in which she plays an exquisitely vicious diva who Harvey Keitel’s director is courting for a part. Before the festival, Tomlin gave an interview suggesting Fonda was unhappy with the way she’d been shot (“She says: ‘I really look terrible … the lighting, everything, is just awful’”). And it’s true that the film makes her look like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylebuchanan/status/600982020630695936\">Barbara Cartland on a raddled day</a>. Today, she says acting is “a very challenging career, where there’s so much emphasis, especially for a woman, on how you look. You’re not in control.”</p> \n<p>Still, it’s her meatiest part in years – just a couple of scenes, but a total show-stealer. She tells Keitel’s character his last three films were “really shit”, he’s “old and tired” and “death is round the corner”. That back in the day, the likes of Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe “shit in their pants to see me coming”. That rather than sleeping her way to the top, she was “just fine being in all those producers’ underpants. I wanted to be there.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Jane Fonda in the film Youth\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n &lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Jane Fonda easily walks away with the new film YOUTH, but oh man, the wig-and-makeup team did her dirty &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/PqmeiYHXcj&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/PqmeiYHXcj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kyle Buchanan (@kylebuchanan) \n &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kylebuchanan/status/600982020630695936&quot;&gt;May 20, 2015&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Does Fonda think that present-day tutting at that casting-couch culture is overdone? She pauses for four seconds – an uncharacteristic age. “I believe it’s possible for a woman who really likes sex to have agency over her sex life. If she’s in charge and decides, ‘I’m going to go under the table for him’, she doesn’t lose anything. I know actresses who were very sexy and who chose who they wanted to have sex with.”</p> \n<p>Does she also agree with her character that nobody speaks frankly in the film world? “I think that’s quite true. Look at what happened with Sony and the hacked emails. Look what happens when you speak frankly. These days, everything is public. If you’re a powerful producer and I want you to hire me I’m not going to tell you what I really think of you. I’ll kiss your ass. That’s what happens.”</p> \n<p>Isn’t it disconcerting to live in such a world? Oh no, she smiles. “Growing up is knowing who you can trust, when you can tell the truth and when you can’t. Most of the time, you don’t. And that’s life.”</p> \n<p>Fonda was raised in a family “where there was not a lot of laughter. A long line of depressed people”. Henry was undemonstrative, plagued with self-doubt; her mother, Frances, slit her throat with a razor in a mental institution when Jane was 12.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5e3bef9338cedd4852e70344a2bf0d70ef295038\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432223604682/f89641a9-8954-4cff-a637-3cd591ea61f3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jane Fonda sings an anti-war song near Hanoi during the Vietnam War in July 1972.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fonda sings an anti-war song near Hanoi during the Vietnam War in July 1972.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nihon Denpa News/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“If a child grows up in a family where the parents look at them in the eye and reflect the child back to itself with love then love will be easy for that child. If that was not there when you’re little, then love will be very hard.” Hers did not, she confirms. “It doesn’t mean your parents are bad, it’s just they never got it themselves. As you get older you try to break the cycle.”</p> \n<p>She married three times, the first to Barbarella director Roger Vadim, who steered her into threesomes with Parisian prostitutes, then to counterculture author Tom Hayden, then MGM head Ted Turner, and she speaks freely of other affairs and crushes. Her first casting call was opposite Warren Beatty, who she assumed was gay because “he tried too hard, all his friends were gay, and he played beautiful piano”. “And I was always in love with Robert Redford – I made three films with him and nothing happened because I was married and he was married.</p> \n<p>“There are certain things I wish I had or hadn’t done but they made me who I am. I could have done many things smarter, better, safer. One thing that’s really important: what makes you what you are is your mistakes. It’s not your successes.”</p> \n<p>Fonda’s hope that she serves an example to other women means she’s highly aware of her own narrative; of why it matters and what it might represent. Her return to acting, for instance, she says has “never been done before”. “A woman coming back at 65 and recreating a career; it’s totally unique.”</p> \n<p>But for all her tub-thumping, it would be an error to see Fonda as a blanket feminist. Even the possibility of Hillary Clinton returning to the White House is tempered with scepticism. Taken alone, it’s not necessarily a blessing, she says.</p> \n<p>“I hope that changes something. But there’s a lot of women who’ve been presidents round the world and they might as well have been men. Margaret Thatcher was hawkish, militaristic, her policies not good for the environment or peace.” She drums the table with elegant nails and her metal-filled thumb. “It’s always more a question of conscience than gender.

How are you?</strong><br />I’m doing OK! I’m having a late start, because I had a meeting last night with Chuck Lorre, the creator of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2011/feb/25/two-and-a-half-men-sheen-charlie\">Two and a Half Men</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/the-big-bang-theory\">The Big Bang Theory</a>. We’re trying to make a musical out of Painted From Memory, the album I did with Elvis Costello. Elvis and I wrote eight new songs. We’ll probably keep five, along with five songs from the album.</p> \n<p><strong>I’ve just read your </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/jul/21/burt-bacharach-anyone-heart-review\"><strong>autobiography</strong></a><strong> and been struck by the dozens of songs you wrote, before you were famous, that weren’t hits.</strong><br />Oh, that period went on for a very long time. I thought songs were so simple that I could do five of them a day, but songs that sound simple are deceptive. It’s a very complicated process. So I left my job as pianist for the Ames Brothers [singing quartet] to go and start writing at the <a href=\"http://www.thebrillbuilding.com/wp-content/gallery/the-building/img_5693.jpg\">Brill Building</a> (1), but had no success. I couldn’t get a song published.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/jul/21/burt-bacharach-anyone-heart-review\">Anyone Who Had a Heart by Burt Bacharach with Robert Greenfield – review</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Before you were well-known, you also </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BRod3W9jkw\"><strong>toured with Marlene Dietrich</strong></a><strong>. What was that like?<br /></strong>I started in Vegas with her, trying to make a living. You could say the music wasn’t my kind of music. It actually sucked! But I liked her. She’d call and ask: “Could you come to Warsaw for one concert one night?” I’d walk down the stairs from the plane – this is before jetports – and she’d be standing there wearing a Dior scarf, with a bottle of vodka, pouring me a drink. Right there in the snow!</p> \n<p>I have to say, she was very supportive of me and would champion me to everybody. When my musical <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmJRQp5dtGY\">Promises, Promises</a> opened, she got 50 copies of the New York Times review and sent it to people all over Europe, basically saying, “I told you so.” I remember coming out of one concert and there was a huge throng waiting for her, and they’re all, “Marlene can I have your autograph?” And she said – loudly – “You don’t vont my autograph. You vont him!” Huh. Who’s he?</p> \n<p><strong>That must have been such a boost when you were struggling to get hits.<br /></strong>Yeah. I finally broke through with two songs that were pre-where I was going musically. I was still writing what I thought would be commercial, rather than what I was feeling, but Story of My Life and Magic Moments were hits [for Michael Holliday and Perry Como].</p> \n<p><strong>They were the first two consecutive No 1s by the same songwriter in the UK.</strong><br />Really? I was just so happy to have a hit anywhere.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2012/sep/02/hal-david\">Hal David obituary</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>It seems to be meeting the lyricist </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2012/sep/02/hal-david\"><strong>Hal David</strong></a><strong> (2), and then </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2012/nov/29/dionne-warwick-bacharach-david\"><strong>Dionne Warwick</strong></a><strong> around the same time, that started the waterfall of classic songs. Was it something in the chemistry between you and Hal?</strong><br />No, what started the change was that an A&amp;R man in Chicago – Calvin Carter at Vee-Jay Records – called me and said: “Listen, Jerry Butler wants to record this song of yours, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TYf8mgE_TA\">Make It Easy on Yourself</a> (3). We want you to come to New York, book the musicians, set the tempo, and you basically are in charge.” That was the first time anybody let me do that. I think we’d written some pretty good songs that became not-good songs by the time a producer or arranger got hold of them. Being allowed to be in control opened up whole new avenues: working with Dionne, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2006/apr/05/usa.uk\">Gene Pitney</a>. I just went from there.</p> \n<p><strong>What does it say about the quality of your songs that they’ve been sung by artists as diverse as Aretha Franklin and </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrwiFwv94As\"><strong>the Stranglers</strong></a><strong>?<br /></strong>I’m very hard on myself. We’re dealing with a short form, not a 52-minute classical piece. It’s not good enough for me to say, “Well, we’ve got a great chorus, but the verse isn’t so great.” When I was writing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyTpu6BmE88\">That’s What Friends Are For</a>, I was married to Carole Bayer Sager and played her this chorus. She said: “You can do a better chorus.”</p> \n<p><strong>It takes some guts to say that to Burt Bacharach.</strong><br />Well, she can do it! She was married to me. And also, she speaks her feelings. Awfully good writer, you know.</p> \n<p><strong>Your perfectionism is legendary: you made Cilla Black do 32 takes for </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDF_taQnoXk\"><strong> Alfie</strong></a><strong>.</strong><br /><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2011/apr/20/george-martin-beatles-1963\">George [Martin</a>, the producer] actually said: “I think you have it on take four.” I remember that date, at Abbey Road. I’m coming in from New York, and I don’t know Cilla. I don’t think I’d met George before. You’re nice about it: you don’t beat up people, but you might have 33 musicians in that room. It’s like one of your football teams, Manchester U or something. You’re trying to get everybody to peak at the same time.</p> \n<p><strong>But in terms of songwriting, you were winning the League, the FA Cup and the Champions League … every year.<br /></strong>Yeah. Absolutely true. I know I’m never going to get 100%, but I’m going to get as close to it … I don’t want to have to say afterwards, “The tempo was too fast.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBdSqk78nHw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBdSqk78nHw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>You’re rightly honoured as one of the greatest songwriters ever, but you don’t always get credit for the pioneering, avant-garde things you did – like having five pianos playing the same thing, slightly out of synch, on Tom Jones’s </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBdSqk78nHw\">What’s New Pussycat?</a><br /></strong>And with an out-of-tune sound on the piano. Fortunately, I learned how to orchestrate. So when I write, I’m usually hearing what the song is and the orchestration. So something like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0wCuwUneSM\">Walk on By</a>: as I’m writing that, I’m hearing the flugelhorn, which became identifiable.</p> \n<p><strong>Where do seeds for great songs come from? Do you wake with ideas in your head?</strong>The way Hal and I worked was in fragments. We never finished the song in one day. We took our work home. If I’ve been collaborating, I need the time alone to just lie on the couch and try to hear the whole vertical picture of what this song is. There’s only one song I remember that Hal and I wrote quickly: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3evJF4YViE\">I’ll Never Fall in Love Again</a>. We were doing a show in Boston and I got pneumonia. We had good reviews, but there was work to be done and I felt like shit. I was put in Massachusetts General and was there nearly a week. The producer was a son of a bitch. Really tough guy. He just said: “How long is he going to be in hospital? Can we put a band in his hospital room? If he’s not functioning in a week, I’ll bring in another writer.”</p> \n<p><strong>That’s pressure.<br /></strong>That’s pressure and at that point, all you wanna do is feel better. I got out and I went back to the hotel with Hal and wrote the song in maybe three hours. That’s how Hal got that line: “What do you get when you kiss a guy / You get enough germs to catch pneumonia / And after you do, he’ll never phone ya.”</p> \n<p><strong>Your autobiography is full of encounters with girls. You turned down Dietrich, but if there were Grammy awards for romancing, you’d probably get one of those as well.<br /></strong>Really funny. It probably sounds like that, but hey, I wouldn’t have got anything written!</p> \n<p><strong>I had wondered. When you first started, were songs a way of making yourself more appealing to girls?<br /></strong>I was a loner in high school. We had a little band and you’d get to meet girls that way. But I wasn’t doing too well. So the music helped. A little bit, but not much. The reality is that my basic love, all the way through, was the music.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"99df945c3c5383f9e677d02fc0a96a3c1dd15839\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432233087924/e4dc996b-de4d-44f5-af27-33478861a569-316x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Burt Bacharach backstage at the 2014 Wilderness festival in Oxford. \" width=\"316\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burt Bacharach backstage at the 2014 Wilderness festival in Oxford.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caitlin Mogridge/Redferns via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>You’ve been through three divorces (4). Do wives or girlfriends find it hard to accept that music is your primary passion?<br /></strong>Well, it’s a very insular, self-centred thing. You are basically in that zone, making your own hours. I’ve raised two young children with Jane [Hansen], my wife, but it’s not like a normal job where you go nine to five and you come home and have dinner. I’m in the music room now, and I would stay in wherever I was, just trying to make it better. I mean, it took me three weeks to write the music for Alfie.</p> \n<p><strong>One of your best songs.<br /></strong>And I probably wound up using what I started with, or close to it. But I have to turn a song upside down and make sure it’s really as good as I can make it. The other thing about this kind of obsessiveness … I was once in Paris, working with Dietrich. I had a No 1 record and a No 4 record in the States. I should have been out at one of the great Parisian bars, celebrating. Instead, the most important thing was: “I gotta make these arrangements really good.”</p> \n<p><strong>Is there a particular song you wish you’d written?<br /></strong>Oh sure. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rkItmVS3c0\">Ain’t No Mountain High Enough</a>, the Diana Ross record. Nobody’s matched that.</p> \n<p><strong>Any great singers you wish you’d have worked with? Could you have worked with Elvis Presley, for example?<br /></strong>I doubt it, although he did record <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFyh9bpzlPY\">Any Day Now</a>, and that’s one of those things where you think, “Great!”, and you hear it and it’s not so great. It was the same thing with Sinatra and the Count Basie band, with Quincy Jones producing. They did <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnvv53s_TUI\">Wives and Lovers</a>, which is in 3/4 time, but they did it in 4/4. I said, “Quincy, what happened?” He said: “The Basie band can’t play in 3/4.”</p> \n<p><strong>Didn’t Sinatra want to make an album with you, but wanted you there right then, and you couldn’t make it?<br /></strong>He hung up the phone. There’s no regret there. We’ve been talking about how I drive singers crazy. I’ve seen him record. He comes in. The band are ready. One take, two takes, done. I don’t know how to do that. And my songs are not the easy songs that Frank was doing. I would have lasted maybe one hour with Sinatra before he said, “Let’s forget this whole thing.” But hey. It was great to be even asked. Flattering.</p> \n<p><strong>And your work still fascinates modern artists. Is it true that when </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l8OslJ0Dsg\"><strong>Noel Gallagher sang with you</strong></a><strong> in 1996, he got so smashed celebrating afterwards that he was unable to sing the following night?<br /></strong>Because he did great! We had the whole symphony orchestra ready; he didn’t come back. I had fun with him. Listen, I love those guys [Oasis], because they put my portrait on the cover of <a href=\"http://www.gigwise.com/photos/75889/4/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-definitely-maybe\">Definitely Maybe</a>.
