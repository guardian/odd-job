Neither was found to have deployed a parachute.<br /></p> \n<p>Potter, 43, who grew up in New Hampshire and lived more recently in Yosemite, was one of the most recognizable figures in extreme sports, and was the creator of “freebase”, a hybrid extreme sport that combined rock climbing without ropes and skydiving.</p> \n<p>Graham Hunt, 29, was also a climber and a Yosemite resident.</p> \n<p>They crashed late on Saturday after leaping from a promontory called Taft Point, 3,000ft above the valley floor. An investigation into what caused the men to crash is ongoing. Base jumping in Yosemite is illegal.</p> \n<p>British climber Andy Kirkpatrick, who knew Potter off and on for more than a decade, said that he was full of contradictions and thought of himself as an artist. “He was using his body and his life as some kind of twisted piece of art, really,” Kirkpatrick said. </p> \n<p>“He was definitely walking quite a hard path in his life, hustling and trying to make a living while at the same time trying to live a sort of zen life, and doing some of the most extreme versions of any sport, Base jumping and proximity flying and free soloing.”</p> \n<p>Potter was sponsored by high-profile brands and had an active presence on social media and in climbing films, but his extrovert qualities were countered by another life “like a monk living in the woods, as quite a shy person”, Kirkpatrick said. He and others described Potter as intense: alternately joyous, stoic, brooding and generous.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"dean potter high-wire walk enshi canyon china\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://embed.theguardian.com/embed/video/sport/video/2012/apr/23/high-wire-slackline-china-canyon-video\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Potter’s death shocked the climbing community, “but not really shocked it”, Kirkpatrick said, because the inherent dangers in taking part in such extreme climbing for so many years made some kind of accident inevitable. </p> \n<p>“But it’s sad. He leaves a lot of people behind,” Kirkpatrick said, “and this robs even more people of the chance for him to inspire them in person.”<br /></p> \n<p>Potter climbed without any harnesses or protective gear (free soloing), walked along slack rope across points of high elevation (highlining), parachuted off cliffs (Base jumping), often with a webbed wingsuit to better control his flight, and flew in a wingsuit near the surface of cliffs, mountains and ridges (proximity flying). Base stands for building, antenna, span, earth. </p> \n<p>Chris McNamara, a climber who no longer Base jumps, told <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_28137692/extreme-athlete-dean-potter-dies-base-jumping-accident?source=rss\">the Associated Press</a>: “He always recognized how dangerous the sport was and at the same time how magical it was – the tension between those two things.”</p> \n<p>Alex Honnold, a Yosemite resident and another of the world’s most renowned rock climbers, tweeted that Potter’s death had left him “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlexHonnold/status/600173168939040769\">in a dark cloud</a>”, and told <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/18/sports/dean-potter-extreme-climber-dies-in-jumping-accident-at-yosemite.html?_r=0\">the New York Times</a> that Potter “shaped the direction of climbing for this generation. He was a very creative influence on climbing”.</p> \n<p>Conrad Anker posted <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/2z02nCsFs-/?taken-by=conrad_anker\">on social media </a>an old photo of Potter showing the moment before the pair jumped from a plane to parachute into a canyon, writing: “We loved it – mostly because it was a thrill and 99.9% of us knew we would never do anything quite this wild.</p> \n<p>“Dean was a visionary in many disciplines,” Anker wrote. “We will cherish these memories and hold the ray of life you often radiated close to our hearts.”</p> \n<p>Potter courted controversy throughout his career, both in his increasingly dangerous maneuvers and his ways of drawing attention. In 2006 he lost a sponsorship from clothing company Patagonia after climbing Utah’s Delicate Arch; in 2014 he and Honnold lost Clif Bar sponsorships after they appeared in a documentary about Yosemite climbing that the company felt included overly dangerous climbs and falls.</p> \n<p>He also drew criticism for strapping Whisper, his miniature Australian cattle dog, into a backpack to soar with him <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AGWiZLy0YuI\">on wingsuited Base jumps</a>. The film When Dogs Fly depicts Whisper’s many flights.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGWiZLy0YuI\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AGWiZLy0YuI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Yosemite chief of staff Mike Gauthier, who occasionally climbed with Potter, downplayed concerns over his methods in a conversation <a href=\"http://adventureblog.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/17/pioneering-climber-dean-potter-died-in-base-jumping-accident/\">with National Geographic</a>. “He was a larger-than-life character,” Gauthier said. “He’s just in the pantheon of great athletes that people idolize and look up to.”</p> \n<p>Asked about the fact that Base jumping is illegal in national parks, Gauthier said: “We’re not too concerned about discussing the ins and outs of Base jumping.” He and park ranger Scott Gediman instead emphasized the losses of those who survive Potter and Hunt, with the latter saying: “This is a huge loss for all of us.”</p> \n<p>Potter lived with his girlfriend, Jen Rapp, and her three children in Yosemite. Rapp told the Times that Yosemite “is exactly where he’d want his rule-breaking, fringe-pushing, counterculture spirit to live forever”.</p> \n<p> In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqEkFBNiP3c\">2014 documentary</a> for Outside Television he described a recurring dream of flying and falling. “When I was a little boy my first memory was a flying dream,” Potter said. “And in my dream I flew and also fell. I always wondered as I got older if it was some premonition of me falling to my death.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>“So I started free soloing harder and harder routes, kind of proving to myself that I could take control of this – pretty much the biggest fear that I had, of falling to my death.”</p> \n<p>He said that adding parachutes gave him an extra security that balanced the dangers of free solo climbing. “It ups my chances of living to be an old man,” Potter said. “And then you have the super bonus of if you fall, you don’t die, you fly.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d04a3bece8fce73d32b93cb9892229f5f48d6ec8/0_22_3651_2194/3651.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2194,"width":3651,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"ADIDAS AG / HANDOUT/EPA","altText":"Dean Potter and his dog Whisper","cleanCredit":"Photograph: ADIDAS AG / HANDOUT/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-18T17:47:01Z","lastModified":"2015-05-18T23:21:29Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":110,"contributors":[{"name":"Alan Yuhas","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/19/1411137976218/Alan-Yuhas-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/alan-yuhas"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Extreme sports","US news","California","Sport","Climbing holidays","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/extreme-sports","webTitle":"Extreme sports"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"us-news/california","webTitle":"California"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"travel/climbing-holidays","webTitle":"Climbing holidays"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Alan Yuhas","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/alan-yuhas"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/18/extreme-athlete-dean-potter-visionary-tributes","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49x45","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/may/18/extreme-athlete-dean-potter-visionary-tributes","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/18/extreme-athlete-dean-potter-visionary-tributes"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d04a3bece8fce73d32b93cb9892229f5f48d6ec8/0_22_3651_2194/3651.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2194,"width":3651,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dean Potter often strapped his dog Whisper into a backpack to soar with him on wingsuited Base jumps.

It sold 1,940 copies in the UK in the week to 9 May, according to book sales monitor Nielsen BookScan, putting it in seventh place in the hardback non-fiction charts and outselling new novels by major writers including James Patterson, Mark Billingham, David Baldacci and Jo Nesbo.</p> \n<p>In the US, its sales to date run to just under 14,000 copies, reported trade magazine <a href=\"http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/66640-clinton-cash-selfish-hit-the-list.html\">Publishers Weekly</a>, putting it in 13th place in the adult non-fiction list. Its American fans include the writer Lena Dunham, who published her own “<a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/2q4x4Ji1Hq/\">selfie with selfish</a>”, adding: “<a href=\"https://instagram.com/explore/tags/yeahiboughtit/\">#yeahiboughtit</a> (I support experiments in female identity exploration/am a student of pop culture/will not be shamed)”.</p> \n<p>Rizzoli describes Kardashian as “a trailblazer of the ‘selfie movement’”, saying that the “true American icon” has “mastered the art of taking flattering and highly personal photos of oneself”. The “collection of hand-picked images from her personal archive is a tribute to her fans who have supported her through her very highly publicised journey”, said the publisher. The images, many “never-before-seen”, range from her early life to the celebrity which has followed her reality television show and her marriage to the rapper Kanye West. </p> \n<p>At Waterstones, non-fiction buyer Bea Carvalho said that “early sales have been really impressive, with our initial order nearly selling through within a couple of weeks”. The Bookseller’s features editor Tom Tivnan called the book “landmark publishing, a cultural touchstone, the Catcher in the Rye of the Instagram generation”.</p> \n<p>“Seriously, one of the reasons it’s doing so well is Kim Kardashian is our dirty little secret. Even those who rail against her in the ‘why is she famous, she has no talent’ vein often pop over to the ‘sidebar of shame’ to find out what she and Kanye are up to. There is unquestionably something captivating or interesting about her,” Tivnan added. “And Rizzoli has tapped into that with a perfectly pitched book and a canny bit of publishing – what better way to tap into our selfie-obsessed culture than by making a title which is essentially an Instagram feed? It’s a brand extension similar to YouTubers <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2014/sep/28/alfie-deyes-youtube-pointlessblog-videos-book\">Alfie Deyes</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/dec/05/love-zoella-sugg-vapid-online-teenagers-private-cultural-spaces\">Zoella</a>’s books. </p> \n<p>“It’s easy to dismiss Kardashian, but there is something smart and calculating under there. I have a vague feeling that it is not merely another money-spinner from the Kardashian empire, but clever postmodern art mocking the entire culture and its fixations which has made her rich and famous. Though that may be reading slightly too much into it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/may/05/kim-kardashian-selfish-book-photography-selfies\">Kim Kardashian’s Selfish: a nail in the coffin for artistic photography?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Reviewers appeared unsure what to make of the glossy hardback tome, which comes with a revealing shot of Kardashian on the cover. “Kim Kardashian’s Selfish Is Anything But,” <a href=\"http://time.com/3849456/kim-kardashians-selfish/\">found Time magazine</a>, adding that the book is almost “an ode to the people around her” who do her hair and make-up.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/05/kim-kardashian-selfish/393113/\">The Atlantic</a> also noted the “industrial production, applied to one’s appearance” which the book reveals, with its reviewer finding that “Kim is, at this point, the unlikely embodiment of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_%28Duchamp%29\">Duchamp’s urinal</a>: in declaring herself, against all common sense, as art, she mocks and dares and provokes. She rejects what came before. And with her candour about who she is and what it takes to make her that way, she might also, against all odds, move us forward.”</p> \n<p>“This book<em>,</em> needless to say, does not have grand literary ambitions. It has no literary ambitions at all. It barely has words. The words it does contain are so aggressively repetitive that they feel like a true feat of editorial indifference,” <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2015/05/selfish_kim_kardashian_west_s_book_of_selfies_reviewed.html\">wrote Laura Bennett at Slate</a>, adding that “Selfish is an insane project, a document of mind-blowing vanity and deranged perseverance. It’s also riveting. I can’t recommend it enough.”</p> \n<p>Reviewers on Amazon have been equally split, with the work collecting almost 70 five-star reviews on Amazon.com, and 160 one-star notices. “This is neither interesting nor candid; it is an anthology of what is wrong with American culture. This was sent to me as a gag gift from a very disturbed individual I once called a friend. He is a friend no more,” wrote one reviewer. “As David Letterman would say, this is why the rest of the world hates us,” wrote another, but a third found it “a great look into Kim’s world”, giving “props to Kim for turning her selfies into a moneymaker”.</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431952466256/96a985af-9f1d-4d01-8b80-655001ce93b7-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Daniel Vorley/Getty Images","altText":"Kim Kardashian West.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Daniel Vorley/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-18T13:19:41Z","lastModified":"2015-05-18T13:48:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":53,"contributors":[{"name":"Alison Flood","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/alisonflood"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Publishing","Books","Culture","Kim Kardashian","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"books/publishing","webTitle":"Publishing"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian","webTitle":"Kim Kardashian"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"books"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Alison Flood","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/alisonflood"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"books"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/18/kim-kardashian-selfish-book-selfies","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4926m","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/books/2015/may/18/kim-kardashian-selfish-book-selfies","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/18/kim-kardashian-selfish-book-selfies"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431952466256/96a985af-9f1d-4d01-8b80-655001ce93b7-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kim Kardashian.

Added Temple: “It’s not easy to find British leading men who can deliver the kind of musically compelling performances we need and we have those in Johnny and George.”</p> \n<p>Film-makers have also secured the rights to both brothers’ autobiographies. Temple himself directed the 2010 television documentary <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2479536/\">Ray Davies: Imaginary Man</a> as part of BBC 4’s Imagine series, as well as a followup piece on Dave for the same Channel, 2011’s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012ht1t\">Dave Davies: Kinkdom Come</a>.</p> \n<p>The film has been a long-term passion of veteran British producer Jeremy Thomas, known for Bernardo Bertolucci’s Oscar-winning The Last Emperor, The Great Rock ‘n’ Roll Swindle, and more recent critically-acclaimed films such as David Cronenberg’s A Dangerous Method and Jim Jarmusch’s Only Lovers Left Alive.
