He <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/11/kanye-west-receives-honorary-doctorate-chicago\">received an honorary doctorate degree</a> from the Art Institute of Chicago, surprised basketball fans with a performance of single All Day at an NBA playoff game and had his publicist quash rumours about an acting role in Spike Lee’s forthcoming film, Chiraq.</p> \n<p>Now, he’s the recipient of kind words from animator, cartoonist and past collaborator Bill Plympton. The 90s animation cult favourite – now a two-time Oscar nominee – spoke for the first time about working with Kanye West, on the rapper’s 2005 video for Late Registration single Heard ’Em Say.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwtoSVRVjyU\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HwtoSVRVjyU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Bill Plympton’s video for Kanye West’s Heard ’Em Say\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As a child West had been a fan of Plympton’s animated program Spike &amp; Mike, according to an <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/14/bill-plympton-on-kanye-west-and-his-controversial-adolf-hitler-animated-film.html\">interview Plympton gave to the Daily Beast</a>. One night, Plympton received an unexpected phone call. </p> \n<p>“He said, ‘Is this Bill Plympton? This is Kanye West. Are you the animator guy? I want to hire you to do my next music video.’”</p> \n<p>Though Michel Gondry had already shot and directed a version of the video for Heard ’Em Say, West called in Plympton for one more to his liking. West needed to deliver the new video version to MTV for a premiere in a week’s time, Plympton remembered.</p> \n<p>“He flew over to my studio for a couple of days to look over my shoulder as I was drawing and criticized them,” Plympton said. “He said, ‘I look more handsome than that – make me more handsome!’ I said, ‘Sure, Kanye.’”</p> \n<p>Vanity aside, West made a good impression, according to Plympton. The rapper paid Plympton out of pocket, and impressed him with his creative involvement.</p> \n<p>“You know, he really is a smart guy, and very visual; he could be a theatre director. I trusted his opinion.”</p> \n<p>This week has also seen West’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBAtAM7vtgc\">Bound 2</a> music video – featuring Kim Kardashian topless astride a motorcycle – turned into<a href=\"http://www.zaktebbal.com/Bound-2Gether\"> an illustrated online children’s book</a>.

He talks martyrdom, indoctrination and other daytime TV</p>","byline":"Catherine Shoard","body":"<p>Nearly nine years ago, Nicholas Hoult gave a series of interviews. They all followed a similar template: remember the kooky, pudding-bowl kid from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/91439/about.a.boy\">About a Boy</a>? He’s grown up, got hot and is about to star in some new series called <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/skins\">Skins</a>. He’s also, most pointed out, very amiable and polite, at 17 still a little gauche beneath the cheekbones – a nice Wokingham lad.</p> \n<p>I wrote <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3662561/Teen-player.html\">one of these</a>. I remember Hoult was ever so excited to have just bought a moped, which he used to get to and from sixth form college. His mum – who had packed him cheese and ham sandwiches to take along for the day – was more sceptical.</p> \n<p>So it’s hard to imagine the unhappiness of Mrs Hoult after her son was cast in <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/mad-max-fury-road\">Mad Max: Fury Road</a> – eight months in the Namibian desert hanging off exploding lorries, told not to move lest his head come off. The watchword of George Miller’s movie is verisimilitude; <a href=\"http://jalopnik.com/how-the-man-behind-the-machines-of-mad-max-put-a-hellsc-1704037927\">CGI sneered at</a> for all but tweaks. As critics have observed, the fear on <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/05/nicholas-hoult-mad-max/\">Hoult’s</a> face is pretty convincing.</p> \n<p>In fact, the experience helped exorcise his petrolphilia. Just as <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/mad-max-fury-road-how-cars-were-made-2015-5?r=US\"> gearheads round the world get revved up over the rigs</a>, he says his motoring mania is behind him. “I’ve grown out of it. OK: a great car does have a little bit of a soul to it. There can be something special about the noise of it. But I’m no longer obsessed.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456727794__\n</div> \n<p>Instead, Hoult speaks knowledgeably about daytime TV – in particular <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/mar/26/homes-under-the-hammer-brilliant-daytime-tv-with-added-dion-dublin\">Homes Under the Hammer</a>, Wanted Down Under and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/come-dine-with-me\">Come Dine With Me</a> – and with studenty enthusiasm about food: “When I fall asleep I’m thinking about breakfast and then after breakfast it’s lunch and then it’s dinnertime with snacks in between.” At 25, then, he remains appealingly suburban despite the glam location (beach cabana at the <a href=\"http://www.hotel-du-cap-eden-roc.com/fr/accueil/\">Hotel du Cap</a>, Cannes’s most exclusive) and rising star status (<a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/x-men\">X-Men</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/134747/clash-of-the-titans\">Clash of the Titans</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/151433/jack-the-giant-slayer\">Jack the Giant Slayer</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/oct/07/jennifer-lawrence-nude-photo-hack-sex-crime\"> Jennifer Lawrence</a>’s ex). The guns are more pumped, the giggle less nervous, but Hoult is still a genuine sweetie.</p> \n<p>Likewise his Mad Max character, Nux, despite being a psychotic, terminally ill slave whose bald chalky skin is covered in tumours and a massive chest tattoo of a carbolic engine (he spent two hours in makeup each morning). <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/tom-hardy\">Tom Hardy</a> has said he channelled a wolf to play barking Max; for Nux, Hoult opted for a puppy: “He’s very enthusiastic and committed and affectionate but also kind of clumsy.” Species? He thinks a labrador, but retracts when he twigs it’s probably just because of the ads (“This film was inspired by loo roll”). “Maybe a German Shepherd. He does have some bite.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/14/charlize-theron-mad-max-imperator-furiosa-feminist-icon\">Charlize Theron on Mad Max: ‘We live in a very toxic world’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Indeed. Nux is, in fact, a suicide bomber of sorts, whose worship of the great wheezy leader, Immortan Joe (the movie is set in a ravaged post-apocalyptic future 45 years hence), means he dreams only of a “historic death” in which he will reach Valhalla through an act of homicidal martyrdom. Luckily Max, who Nux initially co-opts as a portable bloodbank, intervenes, alongside Charlize Theron’s one-armed freedom fighter.</p> \n<p>When Miller wrote the script in 1999, he conceived of Hoult’s character as a quasi kamikaze pilot. Then the film got stuck in development hell after the dollar crashed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Today, he’s careful not to be drawn too far on the contemporary echoes. The concept of a glorious battle death resulting in entry to warrior paradise is age-old, he says. “Now we have another rendering of that, but it’s been a constant” while Joe’s kingdom is, “like all cults, invented to get people to die on your behalf”. Theron, too, steers clear of generalisation. “Everybody’s looking for a sliver of hope and for most of these boys that’s the only thing they have. That’s where their worth is. Very much a reflection of what’s going on in the world.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"545e0bc3ba835ebc5fefba7bb0f4ba81154147d7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431621313953/ec6eb2f2-bf0d-4907-8fac-779aa79ef780-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Riley Keough and Nicholas Hoult in Mad Max: Fury Road.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riley Keough and Nicholas Hoult in Mad Max: Fury Road.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hoult, however, concedes the radicalism more freely. “It’s certainly I think the first time that a film of this scale has humanised those sorts of characters. You do actually, hopefully, relate to him. He hasn’t experienced a lot of things – and the second someone opens his eyes up to a different world and shows him a bit of kindness he changes. Before that he’s got nothing else to believe in.”</p> \n<p>The conditions of the shoot encouraged indoctrination. Every morning the actor playing Joe would preach to 150 of the cast and stunt team at the gym, running through nursery rhymes and have everyone pray to him. “There was a kind of a culty thing going on behind the scenes, and you saw that transmorph onto set. So I’m sitting in my car and the engines are rumbling around you and the war drums are getting beaten on the truck next door, and there’s 100 guys in makeup and costumes really fired up. And that does make the hairs on your arms stand up a bit.”</p> \n<p>He sips his Coke, apologises for any belching. “I don’t know if this is a bad thing or a good thing, but I don’t have anything in my life in which I believe so strongly that I would [die for it]. I’m not particularly religious in any sense. George would say: “This, for you, is scoring a goal in the World Cup final.” And I was like: “Right, OK, thanks for breaking it down simple.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/11/mad-max-fury-road-review-tom-hardy\">Mad Max: Fury Road review – Tom Hardy is a macho Mr Bean in brilliantly pimped reboot</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Hoult beams away, bouncy beneath some mockney self-deprecation. Yes, he says, he too wants an exceptional life. “Not in an extreme way. I don’t think there’s anything exceptional about me but I’m lucky to live in a sphere of people who are quite exceptional.” He’s never thought of himself as a role model, he says, feels no pressure about such a possibility, only mild bafflement. “People shouldn’t look up to me. Everyone’s got to make their own mistakes and do their own thing.”</p> \n<p>In 45 years, he’ll be Miller’s age and hopes to still be working, as well as “pottering on the golf course and chilling at home with the grandkids”. What about the possibility the world won’t support such a lifestyle? Might Mad Max’s cautionary moral contain something? “Well, you can’t help but worry. There’s so many great documentaries like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/155585/blackfish\">Blackfish</a> and <a href=\"http://virungamovie.com/\">Virunga</a> and you sit there and you go: Blimey.

But for at least two generations of young music critics, Hopper has been the model to aspire to.</p> \n<p>As well-versed in Chief Keef and Big Star as she is Miley Cyrus, the Chicago critic is one of a handful of music journalists whose every new piece feels like an event. When Bj&ouml;rk’s latest album Vulnicura leaked in January, <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9582-the-invisible-woman-a-conversation-with-bjork/\">it was Hopper’s interview that provided the record’s heartbreaking context</a>. “Sometimes you get a different story when you send a woman to talk to another woman,” she says, on lunch from her job as a senior editor at Pitchfork, where she runs the influential music site’s blog and <a href=\"http://www.thepitchforkreview.com/\">quarterly print Review</a>, paying special attention to helping diverse young writers develop bold ideas.</p> \n<p>The powerful voice of <a href=\"http://www.mnartists.org/article/just-what-it-makes-minnesota-music-critics-so-different-so-appealing\">Terri Sutton, music critic of Minneapolis’ City Pages</a>, encouraged Hopper, a young feminist punk, to find her own “staunch and caustic and uncompromising” tone. Since she started last October, Pitchfork has been Hopper’s first full-time editorial gig in 19 years as a professional writer. From 1991 to 2005, she published the zine <a href=\"http://pioneerspress.com/catalog/zines/3985/\">Hit It Or Quit It</a>; she’s been a columnist for the Chicago Tribune, Punk Planet and the Chicago Reader, and the first music editor of radical teen-girl webzine <a href=\"http://www.rookiemag.com/\">Rookie</a>, while writing for Spin and the Village Voice among others. A side stint as a self-employed publicist for acts like Beth Ditto’s Gossip gave her empathy for underdogs whose complex messages get lost in mainstream media.</p> \n<p>The First Collection anthologises 42 pieces from this era across eight themed chapters, rescuing the earliest from pre-internet oblivion and serving as a corrective to the lack of female music writers given the anthology treatment. Prospective editors told her that only dead or canonical writers sell essay collections. “I was like, I don’t think <em>any</em> of that is true so I’m not gonna listen to this,” says Hopper, who never has. As an original teenage <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/musicblog/2015/jan/28/riot-grrrl-10-of-the-best\">riot grrrl</a>, she was outlawed by the movement after she broke its media blackout.</p> \n<p>The collection entered a third print run before it was even officially released this week. It’s amazing vindication, says Hopper. “Part of the reason people don’t think it’s viable is because there wasn’t a gendered precedent for it. And lots of times when we’re talking about women’s work, those [precedents] have to exist. Part of the excitement is becoming an emblematic success.”</p> \n<p>Hence the title, though the anthology opens with a caveat declaring Hopper’s awareness of some similar precedents: Australian critic <a href=\"http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/roxon-lillian-11577\">Lillian Roxon</a>’s tireless 1969 Rock Encyclopedia; British artist and writer <a href=\"http://www.carolinecoon.com/\">Caroline Coon </a>with 1982’s The New Wave Punk Rock Explosion; 1995’s <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/rock-she-wrote-evelyn-mcdonnell/1101801417?ean=9780859652339\">Rock She Wrote: Women Write About Rock, Pop and Rap</a>. Hopper’s title isn’t a land-grab but a gauntlet-opener for other young rock-critical feminists. “It speaks to the perpetual myth within women’s creative work,” she says. “The myth of the first and the only, so it’s cheekily battling that myth and tokenisation.”</p> \n<p>It recalls <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/feb/12/girl-in-a-band-kim-gordon-review-autobiography-sonic-youth\">Kim Gordon’s recent memoir Girl in a Band</a>, which took its name from British rock writers’ obsession with asking her how it felt to be one. So much modern music journalism still treats non-male participants like novelties, but the flipside can be an overly cautious “don’t mention the war” approach. Reflected by her title, and the book’s final chapter, Females, Hopper has never shied from unpicking the potential implications of gender. Her 2012 piece,<a href=\"http://www.spin.com/2012/01/deconstructing-lana-del-rey/\"> Deconstructing Lana Del Rey</a>, is a staggering example that cuts through cynicism to find the truth behind the singer’s consummately constructed artifice.</p> \n<p>“What’s always really interested me, whether we’re talking about Miley or [St Vincent’s] Annie Clark, is the way that a female artist uses image,” says Hopper. “But also how we misunderstand a lot of the gestures and symbols of image in women’s art. Part of the reason that I drill down on that is because I’ve grown up female in America, and I know the weight of some of the things they lug on stage in that way.”</p> \n<p>Although nobody would ever doubt it based on her spare, piercing prose, Hopper also made sure her author photo conveyed her right to occupy her position as an important voice in music criticism. The book’s careful sequencing showcases the development of her critical perspective. The Chicago chapter opens with her landmark 2003 essay, <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20031002042645/http://www.punkplanet.com/archives/00000004.html\">Emo: Where the Girls Aren’t</a>, which traces the genre’s dismally boy-centric worldview back through 60 years of female oppression at the hands of rock. “Can you ignore the marginalisation of women’s lives on the records that line your record shelves in hopes that feigned ignorance will bridge the gulf … ?” she demanded. “It’s almost too big of a question to ask.”</p> \n<p>A decade on, <a href=\"http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2013/12/read_the_stomac.php\">her unflinching conversation with Chicago Sun-Times pop critic Jim DeRogatis about allegations of sexual assault on underage black girls by R Kelly</a> falls at the end of that chapter, and serves as an answer to the question she posed over a decade before. “I’ve never been able to mute my moral self when I’m listening to a record, no matter how good it is,” she says. “There are people and consequences behind the music we listen to, and because music has always meant so much to me, I can’t divorce that. I don’t need every record to be made by someone who passes some moral test, but at the same time it’s like, ‘all right, Brown Sugar, I’m turning this off, I can’t deal with this end of the Stones’. I just have problems with stuff, which I think is what makes me the critic that I am.”</p> \n<p>For music criticism to be effectual, it has to be progressive. Hopper’s been in the game for two decades, but continues to fight for change: particularly for critics and older musicians alike actively to seek out the new. “If you care about the work of women or other groups that have been marginalised with their music, you know you have to dig down to find the best shit,” she says. “We have to constantly look for the new people that are displacing us and offer them a leg up. That’s my whole thing.” The same goes for music journalism. “I think we’re already starting to see a really positive shift where there isn’t just one default experience of music being presented, one default frame of criticism,” she says. “And that’s really exciting to me.”</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431618758013/407df6d0-4d9d-41f4-b233-0600238670f6-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Sampson/Supplied","altText":"Jessica Hopper","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Sampson/Supplied"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-14T17:27:19Z","lastModified":"2015-05-14T17:45:58Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":4,"contributors":[{"name":"Laura Snapes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/laura-snapes"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Music","Media","Culture","Books","Essays"],"tags":[{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"books/essays","webTitle":"Essays"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Laura Snapes","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/laura-snapes"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/14/jessica-hopper-new-book-macho-world-of-rock-writing","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48qqv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/may/14/jessica-hopper-new-book-macho-world-of-rock-writing","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/14/jessica-hopper-new-book-macho-world-of-rock-writing"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431618758013/407df6d0-4d9d-41f4-b233-0600238670f6-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jessica Hopper: taking the wheel of the rusty of banger that is rock criticism.

But these proliferating commemorations often don’t follow the traditional pattern – centenaries or other major anniversaries of the births or deaths of writers who are then forgotten about (except by their posthumous fan clubs) for another 50 years. The recent tendency is to also pick out unbirthdays and random birthdays, and to celebrate these days more often or more publicly.</p> \n<p>One such initiative is the inaugural <a href=\"http://www.literaturewales.org/dylan-day/\">International Dylan Thomas Day</a>, whose timing may surprise anyone who raised a glass to the poet’s 100th birthday in October (in fact, peculiarly but revealingly, 14 May has been chosen as “the date <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/under-milk-wood-4.html\"><em>Under Milk Wood</em></a> was first read on stage” in New York in 1953). Discernible is a reluctance to let Thomas go gently into the usual relative oblivion after last year’s centenary, but also an eagerness to give Wales an annual festival celebrating a supreme national author comparable to England’s Shakespeare’s birthday, Ireland’s Bloomsday and Scotland’s Burns night: “I’ve enjoyed celebrating Burns night over the years and often wanted to celebrate Dylan Thomas in the same way,” said <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/cerys-matthews\">Cerys Matthews</a>, applauding it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/booksblog/2015/may/14/why-dylan-thomas-deserves-his-international-day\">Why Dylan Thomas deserves his international Day</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Literary anniversary events that reflect corporate or personal agendas in this way are far from new. The mother of all such festivities, the Shakespeare Jubilee of September 1769 (impressively an unbirthday and an unanniversary, as it supposedly commemorated the Bard’s birth in April 1764) also provided a career boost to its organiser, the actor David Garrick, while Bloomsday and Burns night, which originated as gatherings of disciples, have latterly been embraced by the tourism industry. Today’s ventures, though, are more likely to do so openly and from the outset - as with this week’s urgings (by notebook and travel gear maker Moleskine) to mark the late Bruce Chatwin hitting 75, and the preposterous candle-blowing (by Stieg Larsson’s publisher, Quercus) for the birthday of Lisbeth Salander, a fictional character, a fortnight ago. The title and date of International Dylan Thomas Day – set up and run by Literature Wales, and “funded by Welsh government” – testify to organisers’ eyes firmly fixed on America. Here celebration is also commodification, with Thomas (pictured) at once an ambassador, export and poster boy for <a href=\"http://www.visitswanseabay.com/events/dylan-day/\">Visit Swansea Bay</a>.</p> \n<p>A hidden agenda can also be seen behind literary (and other) <a href=\"https://www.google.com/doodles/\">Google Doodles</a>, a form of anniversary-marking that fits the recent pattern (most eccentrically mark random birthdays: Ngaio Marsh’s 122nd, say, or Gabriela Mistral’s 126th) and trumps the conventional kind in impact - there will be 3.5bn searches, the company estimates, during <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_Doodles_in_2015\">each doodle’s one-day reign</a>. The selection of authors may well reflect the enthusiasms of individual toilers in the Googleplex, and such recognition undoubtedly provides a splendid publicity bonanza. But the choices – notably international, often obscure – make other statements besides “Like” when seen together: they say that Google is sophisticated, scholarly and loves the humanities (not merely a bunch of tech geeks), and a global enterprise (equally likely, for example, to feature Asia or Latin America’s literary stars as America’s) rather than one with horizons limited to Silicon Valley or the US. Just as Garrick was also selling himself when he organised the Shakespeare Jubilee, so Google is simultaneously promoting itself whenever it celebrates late greats such as Marsh, the most recent author to be feted with a doodle.</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431615384508/Dylan-Thomas-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dylan Thomas in 1953.

Would he serve out his promised 10-year term? Was he, perhaps, another Hollywood star using the London theatre to buff up his CV? I remember a particularly horrible press conference a year later, when Spacey sought to announce his programme: the Old Vic stalls were packed with hacks asking prurient questions about his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2004/apr/20/film.filmnews\">private life</a>. It didn’t help that the opening work of Spacey’s tenure was a Dutch play all too aptly called <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2004/sep/29/theatre\">Cloaca</a> which, as Latin scholars are aware, means “shit”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2015/mar/06/how-kevin-spacey-brought-hollywood-to-the-west-end\">How Kevin Spacey brought Hollywood to the West End</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In fact, Spacey, who bows out after <a href=\"http://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2015/high-society/\">High Society, which opens this week</a>, has done everything possible to restore the fortunes of the Old Vic. He has given the theatre stability and, through his presence as an actor, glamour. He has tirelessly raised funds to ensure its future. He has also done a lot of unheralded work to encourage young people through a scheme with the umbrella title of <a href=\"http://www.oldvictheatre.com/oldvicnewvoices/\">Old Vic New Voices</a>.</p> \n<p>One day I was asked to give a talk to an American theatre party at the Old Vic. Unbeknownst to me, Spacey was in another part of the building working with young actors. As my session finished, a tracksuited Spacey, due to perform that night in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2008/feb/13/theatre2\">Speed-the-Plow</a>, suddenly appeared at my side and shook my hand with an unexpectedly iron grip that said a lot about his tenacity.</p> \n<p>What matters, in the end, is the work on stage and, after a patchy first season, Spacey has delivered the goods. My initial complaint was that Spacey was stumbling around in the foothills of world drama. Since then we’ve had bags of Shakespeare, including Spacey himself in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2005/oct/05/theatre.art\">Richard II</a> and Richard III, and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2009/jun/10/the-cherry-orchard-winters-tale-review\">Simon Russell Beale in The Winter’s Tale</a>. We’ve also had American classics from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2015/apr/14/eugene-o-neill-ah-wilderness-young-vic-natalie-abrahami\">Eugene O’Neill</a>, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams and David Mamet as well as Philip Barry’s The Philadelphia Story which is the source of High Society. There’s also been an exploration of the modern British canon, with plays by Coward, Rattigan, Osborne, Stoppard, Ayckbourn and Frayn. I’d love to have seen Spacey in Pinter, but you can’t have everything.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd20c2cfc927ec76a0e6956e558e4af19b5297a7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431605006407/0d742e3c-d308-4ed5-9705-1b0db862cccf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Simon Russell Beale (Leontes) in The Winter's Tale at the Old Vic in 2009.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Russell Beale (Leontes) in The Winter’s Tale at the Old Vic in 2009.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Along the way there have been some resounding flops. The most notorious was the British premiere of Arthur Miller’s final play, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2006/mar/03/theatre3\">Resurrection Blues</a>, which died a painful, public death. I’d seen the play in Minneapolis and knew that, without being Miller’s finest, it had something interesting to say. But at the Old Vic it was not helped by the choice of a fragile Robert Altman as director or by the casting of Maximilian Schell, who seemed a stranger to many of his lines, in the lead. Mark Rylance’s more recent production of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2013/sep/20/much-ado-about-nothing-review-rylance\">Much Ado About Nothing</a>, with James Earl Jones and Vanessa Redgrave in the leads, also proved to be one of the most senseless Shakespeares I’ve ever seen.</p> \n<p>But these were blips in an impressive record; and the great bonus has been the presence of Spacey as an actor. He is, by instinct, a natural comedian, which is why he was superb as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2005/may/11/theatre\">CK Dexter Haven in The Philadelphia Story</a>, whom he endowed with the laidback insouciance of the great Jack Benny. But he was equally good as a Richard III, full of bustling energy and self-loathing: I remember his astonishment at realising that Lady Anne found him “a marvellous proper man”. And Spacey was memorable in both his incarnations as the great American lawyer, Clarence Darrow. He played him first in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2009/oct/02/inherit-the-wind-theatre-review\">Inherit the Wind</a> in 2009 and then in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2014/jun/05/clarence-darrow-kevin-spacey-review-old-vic-london\">David W Rintel’s far superior solo show</a>. With his slight stoop and sagging walk, Spacey suggested a man whose knees were buckling under the weight of his moral indignation. Apart from being a fine performance, it also raised a ton of money for the theatre itself.</p> \n<p>I admire Spacey not just for his acting, but because he has stuck it out, rescued a theatre that looked as if might be heading for oblivion and given the Old Vic a civic purpose even without a penny of public subsidy. I sometimes wished he could have given us more than four productions a year but that is something his designated successor, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2015/apr/21/new-take-old-vic-matthew-warchus-groundhog-day-lorax\">Matthew Warchus, looks set to rectify</a>. Spacey will, however, hand over to Warchus a building that is functioning, lively and a vital part of the London theatre scene; and for that he deserves enormous credit.</p> \n<h2><strong><br /></strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Top 5 shows of the Spacey years</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>1.</strong> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2011/jun/29/richard-iii-review-kevin-spacey\">Richard III</a>. Under Sam Mendes’s direction, Spacey gave us a lethally ironic double-Gloucester and capped the Old Vic run by playing the role in 198 performances around the world.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-437960990__\n</div> \n<p><strong>2.</strong> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2008/feb/13/theatre2\">Speed-the-Plow</a>. Jeff Goldblum and Spacey generated enough energy to power the national grid in Matthew Warchus’s rollercoaster revival of David Mamet’s satire on Hollywood insecurity.</p> \n<p><strong>3.</strong> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2014/jul/13/the-crucible-old-vic-review-yael-farber-fiery-engrossing\">The Crucible</a>. Ya&euml;l Farber’s revival, starring Richard Armitage and Anna Madeley, reimagined Miller’s play as a study of male exploitation, rather than female hysteria.</p> \n<p><strong>4.</strong> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2014/oct/01/electra-theatre-review-old-vic-kristin-scott-thomas\">Electra</a>. Greek tragedy came to the Old Vic in Ian Rickson’s superb revival with Kristin Scott Thomas playing Sophocles’s distraught heroine like a woman possessed.</p> \n<p><strong>5.</strong> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2008/oct/07/theatre1\">The Norman Conquests</a>. Ayckbourn’s 1970s trilogy was brilliantly reclaimed in Warchus’s in-the-round staging, which turned us all into eavesdroppers on a comically horrendous family weekend.</p>","section":"Stage","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431597603531/eba65c08-cfdd-4bc3-ad2d-ae5f826447a8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tristram Kenton","altText":"Kevin Spacey as Richard lll at the Old Vic in 2011.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tristram Kenton"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431605007748/0d742e3c-d308-4ed5-9705-1b0db862cccf-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Simon Russell Beale (Leontes) in The Winter’s Tale at the Old Vic in 2009.
