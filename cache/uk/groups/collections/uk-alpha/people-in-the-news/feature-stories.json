White is putting his label’s artists on Jay Z’s service, whose USP is higher-quality sound than rival streaming sites and, it says, a fairer deal for musicians than they would get from the likes of Spotify and YouTube.</p> \n<p>Responding to a fan who said “I have zero interest in making Jay Z more money,” White said that the site was “not about the rich getting richer”. </p> \n<p>Referring to the launch, White said: “It takes artists that can get people’s attention to be able to make a scenario possible for those artists that don’t have a voice to get in a position where they aren’t struggling, and believe me Third Man Records is full of artists the mainstream’s never heard of and have no voice or power in the system. </p> \n<p>“Have you heard of Rachelle Garnier? what about the <a href=\"http://www.smokefairies.com/\">Smoke Fairies</a>? <a href=\"http://drakkarsauna.com/\">Drakkar Sauna</a>? <a href=\"https://myspace.com/danielluccapujol\">Pujol</a>? <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/artists/7766-the-gories/\">The Gories</a>? Those are just some of the up and coming artists on Third Man that try to make a living in music. And if you stream their songs … they get paid for it. And they get to LIVE and not take second jobs … and make MORE music! I support keeping musicians you love in business.”</p> \n<p>Replying to a fan who said that Tidal is elitist, White responded: “What is elitist about it? Who’s speaking for the little guy?”</p> \n<p>He added: “Tidal is going to help a lot of artists out. I’m talking about the punk band that has 50k hits on Youtube and doesn’t see a dime.”</p> \n<p>White said that while many listeners now expect to get records for free, making them is expensive. “There’s a lot of misinformation about music in the last decade, people know that it costs a lot of money to make a superhero movie, but they don’t know that it costs millions to make a country album too.”</p> \n<p>White responded to a fan who said he refused to pay for music by asking: “How much did you pay for that last movie you saw at the theater? And how much did that movie cost to make? Don’t devalue musicians man, support them. Making records is expensive, believe us. I don’t see people saying we should go to the movies for free, or Netflix should be free. That state of music is in flux, be on the side of supporting creativity, not taking from it. [Tidal] gives you that chance.”</p> \n<p>White also said that even successful musicians deserved payment for their work. “Do we tell Steven Spielberg we don’t need to pay him anymore to watch his movies? He’s made enough off of us right? He should show his new films for free right? Haha.”</p> \n<p>White said that he got on with the rest of the musicians who launched Tidal, which also included Alicia Keys, Deadmau5 and Madonna. “We spent all last night talking and discussing ways to make it very cool.” </p> \n<p>Referring to the services enhanced sound, White wrote: “Here’s the shocker: musicians want you to hear their music in the best ways possible. We mix on very nice speakers and systems only to have 90% of it be heard on tiny components that cut out half the information.”</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/6/1423222040211/31c50ce8-a169-4971-9349-c9b5fa8f4dab-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Douglas Gorenstein/NBC/Getty Images","altText":"Jack White performing in February 2015","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Douglas Gorenstein/NBC/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-20T21:27:39Z","lastModified":"2015-05-20T23:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":23,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Tidal","Jack White","Jay Z","Music","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"music/tidal","webTitle":"Tidal"},{"id":"music/jack-white","webTitle":"Jack White"},{"id":"music/jayz","webTitle":"Jay Z"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/20/jack-white-defends-tidal-what-is-elitist","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/494y8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/may/20/jack-white-defends-tidal-what-is-elitist","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/20/jack-white-defends-tidal-what-is-elitist"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/6/1423222040211/31c50ce8-a169-4971-9349-c9b5fa8f4dab-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Awarded for his rollicking solo album of blues-rock … Jack White.

After that golden era of butch men, we were left without a genuine action hero for too long. A whole generation grew up without a dominant figure kicking in people’s heads and breaking legs and crushing skulls.</p> \n<p>Statham has filled that void, and then some. It has helped that he is so prolific. Since 2002 he has appeared in 32 films, most as the leading man. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2003/jan/17/artsfeatures9\">The Transporter</a>. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2010/jun/15/the-expendables-violent-films-sylvester-stallone\">The Expendables</a>. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2011/jan/27/the-mechanic-film-review\">The Mechanic</a>. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2011/may/19/blitz-review\">Blitz</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2008/sep/26/actionandadventure\">Death Race</a>, <a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/movie/chaos\">Chaos</a>. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499556/reference\">War</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/parker_2012/\">Parker</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1656190/reference\">Safe</a>. He has snarled, he has punched, he has been involved in very many explosions.</p> \n<p>But Statham has also been aided by the fact that that the competition are either ageing or incompetent. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/arnold-schwarzenegger\">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> has the puffed-out chest, high-waisted chinos and general demeanour of a semi-successful cigar salesman. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/sylvester-stallone\">Sylvester Stallone</a>, with his reddish-orange, knotted-muscle torso, has acquired the appearance of a bodybuilding grandma. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/culture/steven-seagal\">Steven Seagal</a> looks more and more like a sea lion.</p> \n<p>Then there’s the current crop of rivals. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/dwayne-johnson\">Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</a> is probably Statham’s main competitor for the hardman role. But Johnson is too big, too muscular, too much like a bodybuilder. He can waggle his pecs. And he is a very big man. But could he beat up two people <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ymr74jPK_Y\">while tied to a chair</a>? Would he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMZjxr_7ZNA\">chop off a gunman’s hand</a>, then use that hand – still holding the gun – to shoot another man in the face?</p> \n<p>There’s <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/mark-wahlberg\">Mark Wahlberg</a>, hopping around like a snappy little Yorkshire terrier. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/vin-diesel\">Vin Diesel</a>: your friendly neighbourhood car mechanic. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2014/may/02/kiefer-sutherland-five-best-moments\">Kiefer Sutherland</a>, the kind of guy who’d come up to you in a bar and tell you he saw aliens last night. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/danielcraig\">Daniel Craig</a> is too clean-shaven. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/harrisonford\">Harrison Ford</a> is 90. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/chuck-norris\">Chuck Norris</a> has lost the plot.</p> \n<p>That’s not to say Statham is only a success because of his lack of competition. While he essentially plays the same character, he has shown an ability to really get under the skin of that character. Take Hummingbird, for example. He’s homeless and has long hair in that. In real life he is neither homeless nor does he have hair. </p> \n<p>In Crank, famously, he is injected with a poison that will kill him if his adrenalin level drops, leading him to snort cocaine, get in a lot of fights and have sex with his girlfriend in front of a crowd of cheering tourists. To my knowledge, he has never been injected with such a poison.</p> \n<p>Statham cannot do accents. He can’t really do facial expressions. His real life – <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrINMm1aCI\">professional diver</a> turned model turned <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWu3JqLMImY\">music video dancer</a> turned black market salesman turned actor – has been far more varied than his film career. </p> \n<p>But he can do fighting, and stunts, and more fighting. When a director needs an actor to punch someone in the throat, to snap an arm, to deliver a headbutt, Jason Statham is the man they turn to. He is our modern-day action hero. Cometh the hour, cometh the tough, uncompromising man.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/27/1403881304561/Jason-Statham-in-Crank-2--010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Allstar/LIONSGATE/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","altText":"Jason Statham in Crank 2: High Voltage","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Allstar/LIONSGATE/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-20T20:14:59Z","lastModified":"2015-05-20T21:50:29Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":142,"contributors":[{"name":"Adam Gabbatt","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/13/1413209732355/Adam-Gabbatt-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/adam-gabbatt"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Jason Statham","Film","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"film/jason-statham","webTitle":"Jason Statham"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Adam Gabbatt","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/adam-gabbatt"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/20/jason-statham-action-hero-spy","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/494tm","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/20/jason-statham-action-hero-spy","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/20/jason-statham-action-hero-spy"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/6/27/1403881304561/Jason-Statham-in-Crank-2--010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Now that’s tough ...

In 1971, several New York newspapers ran ads for a “one-woman show” that Ono was presenting at the museum. But anyone who came down to West 53rd Street would have seen no show at all, only a man with a sandwich board outside the museum entrance. Ono, the man explained, had released a number of flies in the sculpture garden; they could be in the museum now, or anywhere in Manhattan. In the catalogue she published, she appears in the garden with a large glass bottle full of the creatures, but on inspection it’s clear that even the release of the flies never happened. It was just a photomontage.</p> \n<p>Who knows whether Ono ever thought she would really get the retrospective she faked in 1971. But now, at the age of 82, her first (or is it second?) one-woman show really has opened at MoMA, and it goes a long way to revalorising one of the most misunderstood artists of the last 60 years. Her massive fame, and maybe her heal-the-world rhetoric too, has obscured the groundbreaking contributions she made to the art of the 1960s and beyond. At last, the art world has come round. This show – finely curated by <a href=\"http://artdaily.com/news/41786/Christophe-Cherix-Appointed-Chief-Curator-of-Prints-and-Illustrated-Books-at-MoMA\">Christophe Cherix</a>, the museum’s head of drawings and prints; and <a href=\"http://nymag.com/arts/art/profiles/62918/index3.html\">Klaus Biesenbach</a>, its chief curator at large – is no guerrilla occupation. It is a belated and jubilant rectification of the historical record, and a victory lap for an artist laughed at for too long.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26c7302b0e05ca61da274caddfca3f5a43eebf9b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432135344524/5b253615-7b54-43fc-ad2d-8de90a7620f0-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Museum visitors with Ono's Cut Piece in the background.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Museum visitors with Ono’s Cut Piece in the background.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Much of the early work on display here is drawn from a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/arts/design/13voge.html?_r=2&amp;\">major gift MoMA received in 2009</a> of artworks, correspondence and documentation related to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2008/dec/10/art\">Fluxus</a>, an impish and fluid movement with which Ono was partially associated. The Fluxus artists, notably <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/15/arts/music/15brecht.html?_r=0\">George Brecht </a>and <a href=\"http://georgemaciunas.com/about/\">George Maciunas</a>, favored performances and publications with a prankish tone. Ono’s art was pithier, and dreamier. Her essential 1964 book Grapefruit – the typescript for which is displayed here page by page – consisted of nothing but terse, open-ended instructions for readers to follow. Some could actually be executed: “Cut a painting up and let it be lost in the wind.” Others went far beyond any rational applicability:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>SMELL PIECE<br />Send the smell of the moon.<br />1953 autumn</p> \n <p>COLLECTING PIECE II<br />Break a contemporary museum into pieces with the means you have chosen. Collect the pieces and put them together again with glue.<br />1963 autumn</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Many years before the “<a href=\"http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520210134\">dematerialization of the art object</a>” – the critic Lucy Lippard’s phrase for the turn away from objects and towards ideas in American art of the late 1960s – Ono was creating artworks that could exist as mere instructions, to be executed once, multiple times, or never. A solo show in 1961 consisted of sumi-ink paintings on unstretched canvas, executed according to simple directions: one is burned, another placed on the ground, another drips with water. (Ono has recreated the paintings for this show.) </p> \n<p>Cut Piece, her most famous artwork, began as a score as well: sit alone on a stage with a pair of scissors before you, and let audience members snip off bits of your clothes one by one. She performed it twice in Japan in 1964, and a recording here of a later iteration at Carnegie Hall shows Ono seated on the floor, back ramrod straight, face expressionless. A man with a dumb smile comes on stage and slices her blouse, exposing her bra. She looks forward, impassive. Another cut. She crosses her arms to keep her bra from falling, but the face never changes. She is utterly victimized, but unyielding.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYJ3dPwa2tI\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lYJ3dPwa2tI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Cut Piece remains one of the most vexing works of performance art of the 1960s, and it now stands as a precursor to whole swaths of feminist and body-centered art. Not less importantly, it also expresses the deep influence of Zen Buddhism, or at least western promulgations of it, on the art of the 1960s. (Last year <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2014/mar/13/yoko-ono-guggenheim-bilbao-conceptual-influence\">she told the Guardian’s Jonathan Jones</a> that when she created Cut Piece, “I was originally thinking of the Buddha and how he gave everything up.”) MoMA’s curators touch on this only lightly: in the same gallery as Cut Piece, they have included ephemera from an all-night event she staged in 1964 at Nanzen-ji, a Zen Buddhist temple in Kyoto. Yet Zen was a near obsession of artists, writers and composers of the mid-century American avant garde, from Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns to Allen Ginsburg and especially John Cage – a frequent collaborator whom Ono befriended as early as the 1950s. </p> \n<p>Ono, both in her Japanese education and her American artistic formation, drew parallels between spiritual and religious practices (mostly Buddhist, but at times Christian) and artistic creation, and saw her own art as less a means of representation than a portal to a new, freer mindfulness. “At this point,” <a href=\"http://imaginepeace.com/archives/2526\">Ono wrote in 1966</a>, “what art can offer … is an absence of complexity, a vacuum through which you are led to a state of complete relaxation of mind.”</p> \n<p>Ono’s Zen-like instructions and performances of the early and mid-1960s are far more compelling than her sculptural work, which tend to cuteness and one-liner-ism. Half a Room (1967) is just that: a chair, a suitcase, a space heater, each slashed in half and painted white. Three Spoons, from the same year, consists of a Plexiglas pedestal that contains not three but four spoons. These mid-60s works are pretty twee, though one in particular has historical significance: a stepladder, painted all white, above which Ono hung a framed piece of paper on which she typed the single word YES. You can’t climb the ladder now, but you could in 1966, at the Indica Gallery in London. John Lennon did – and soon Ono became, in Lennon’s phrase, “the world’s most famous unknown artist”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fe29a66225f5f1b617290be00127f838a391dd6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432135433325/77bacdfb-1345-4680-acea-948bac2ddf7a-460x305.jpeg\" alt=\"Yoko Ono\" width=\"460\" height=\"305\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yoko Ono: Zen-like instructions. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Everything changes after that. Cherix and Biesenbach have done their best work in this second half of the show, correcting the most enduring falsehood surrounding Ono’s career: that she was some avant garde harpy who glommed on to Lennon’s fame, turned him into some far-out conceptualist, and (have you heard?) broke up the Beatles. </p> \n<p>In fact, Lennon influenced Ono as much as Ono influenced Lennon, in ways that improved both of their careers. If her best art before Lennon encouraged a Zen-like dissolution of thought, after Lennon she attached that refusal of distinction and dualism to a greater campaign for world peace, waged not in galleries but in the mass media. They married in 1969; for their honeymoon, the couple invited the press to their Amsterdam hotel room, where they stayed in bed for a week. The same year they launched a massive ad campaign: <a href=\"http://imaginepeace.com/warisover/war-is-over\">war is over</a>, the billboards proclaimed, from New York to Tokyo.</p> \n<p>Many of these happenings were accompanied by music – both hits like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkZC7sqImaM\">Give Peace a Chance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN4Uu0OlmTg\">Happy Xmas (War Is Over)</a>, and tougher fare like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6CiCYjZqbA\">Amsterdam</a>, a 25-minute track in which Ono warbles, over and over, “Let’s pray for peace.” Mocked for too long by overprotective Lennon fans, Ono’s music is finally getting the appreciation it deserves – and at the end of this fine retrospective, in a soundproof room, you can jam to the Plastic Ono Band’s decades of ambitious, surprising music, the work of a still undervalued artist who, more than most, trusted her audience to do as they pleased. You can make a painting, in a gallery or in your head. You can cut out the sky.

It is the fact that the school drama studio in which his character works, while hating his job, is the very one Davies used to teach in for real – while hating his job. Out the back, you can find a blackened hole in the bricks where he used to stub out cigarettes while commiserating with the equally miserable music teacher.</p> \n<p>Doesn’t it feel odd to be back there? It is, he says with a laugh, “almost therapy. Every time I wrote a school scene I thought of that drama studio, because that’s where I was a bit lost at sea. I often run teaching down in my standup, but I had some great years and it’s a great job. It represented a place where I knew what I wanted to do but didn’t have the courage. So it’s nice to be back in that room remembering myself. It’s not somewhere I’ve had profound revelations, it’s just a fairly warm feeling. I sat in that room dreaming of doing something like this.”</p> \n<p><em>This</em> is two acclaimed solo standup tours, his own sitcom, appearances on panel shows and, perhaps most famously, his role as another teacher, Mr Gilbert, the head of sixth form in <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/the-inbetweeners\">The Inbetweeners</a>. There are times when he regrets not being brave enough to try for a career in comedy earlier, but what would be the point in worrying about that now?</p> \n<p>We meet in a cafe in south London, near where Davies, 47, lives. There does not seem to be much of a distance between his stage persona and who he appears to be in real life – he is a generous talker, a talented storyteller.</p> \n<p>Man Down, in which Davies plays Dan, an inept fortysomething manchild, is about to start its second series. One of the best things about it was the casting of Rik Mayall as Dan’s dad – Davies looks like an overgrown version of Mayall – and the cruel, anarchic pranks he played on his son. Mayall’s sudden death last year feels like a huge loss to the show.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c618fb192b233d8779aea5a6fdb62064bd8a6a9b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432141618157/9f0c75bc-592e-4947-bfec-1b8723c86e96-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Greg Davies with Gwyneth Powell and Rik Mayall in Man Down.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greg Davies with Gwyneth Powell and Rik Mayall in Man Down.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shamil Tanna/Man Down</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Working with Mayall, whose comedy The Young Ones had been a massive influence on Davies as a boy, was a dream, he says. “He was a force of nature. His appetite was not blunted, and his enthusiasm and his ambition were huge.” And so professional, he adds. “He often asked me: ‘What’s my motivation for this scene?’ ‘Why am I sitting on your toilet having a shit?’ was a question he genuinely asked me, and I had to say: ‘It’s … fun? There’s nothing deeper than that, I’m sorry’.”</p> \n<p>Davies grew up in Wem, a small town in Shropshire. Comedy was a big feature in his house – his dad was the funniest man he has ever met – but until his late teens, he had no idea that comedy could be a career. His father, a lecturer, was teaching in the US, and Davies, his A-levels finished, went out to visit. Because his dad was at work, Davies spent all day listening to the two tapes he had brought for his Walkman: the Smiths’ The Queen is Dead, and Eddie Murphy’s live show Delirious. “It’s a hugely offensive piece of work now,” he laughs, “but there are elements that are such great storytelling. It was the first time I thought: ‘You get paid for this? For telling silly stories?’”</p> \n<p>Davies had been involved in amateur dramatics, and went on to do English and drama at university. He took his final third-year piece, a silly, one-man play, to the Edinburgh fringe, performing at lunchtime for three days, “to about four people”. One reviewer came and though “he definitely fell asleep during it”, he saw enough to write: “The young man ruined a perfectly good autobiography by pulling silly faces.”</p> \n<p>“It was the first time I’d been into the big wide world and it horrified me,” says Davies. Properly? It put him off? “Yeah. I was a very young 21-year-old. I was very scared. I spent three years at university in west London and I went into central London three times. I came from Shropshire, and just having travelled that far was enough ambition.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79a2de5d1702df3fb87d307181c7bbc3164808e2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432142331497/a11f9dd3-e99b-436b-881f-229436ef1477-460x326.jpeg\" alt=\"Davies with Roisin Conaty in Man Down.\" width=\"460\" height=\"326\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Davies with Roisin Conaty in Man Down.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Hardcastle/Man Down</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>His father suggested he get a proper job so Davies spent the next 13 years teaching. “My dad was wonderful but that was his one piece of terrible advice, although my mum and sister think I needed to toughen my hide before I entered this world and they were probably right because I would have crumbled back then. I wouldn’t have had the guts for it. I’ve barely got the guts now.”</p> \n<p>At 33, sure that he would turn into a teacher like one of those he had seen sitting miserably around a table, moaning about a child, he had “an early midlife crisis. I had a very pragmatic girlfriend at the time, a remarkable woman who said: ‘I don’t understand. You don’t want to do teaching, stop doing it; you want to do comedy, start doing it.’”</p> \n<p>Davies took a comedy course, which gave him the courage to start gigging. Soon he was doing three gigs a week, while still teaching, though when a friend got him a job writing for the children’s TV channel CBBC, he gave his school, where he had just been made head of drama, six months’ notice.</p> \n<p>What did it feel like when he left? “Amazing. And petrifying.” For the first couple of years he thought about walking away from it every day, he says. “It was so frightening. Once you’ve dared put your head above the parapet the idea that you’re not going to be good enough to progress, to me, was terrifying.” Did he have a career plan? “No. It was only ever: ‘Could I earn a living out of comedy?’”</p> \n<p>He was in the sketch group We Are Klang (they had a shortlived series on BBC3), but it was the Inbetweeners that really raised his profile; he followed that with two successful standup shows. There have been parts in other things, the comedy Cuckoo for instance, and when Channel 4 commissioned Man Down he must have felt his career change was justified. Even so, he says his mother still worries about how his career is going, and his father regularly asked if he needed any money, so accustomed was he to bailing out Davies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7fc74b2d1500c074f048627672b59f087c53a44\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432144150602/66e7b0f3-b80a-4b61-be0b-81845b3a7f35-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Davies with Simon Bird in The Inbetweeners.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Davies with Simon Bird in The Inbetweeners.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>His father, Bob, died last year. How has that affected him? I don’t mean in the obvious sense – he was incredibly close to his father, and will have been devastated. But not many of us are so tightly bound to our parents in our work. Bob Davies is almost certainly the reason his son became a comedian – “I always had my dad’s full attention when I was being funny, so it’s no surprise that I’ve gone on to see just how much attention I can get by being funny” – and he featured often in his material. So much of Mayall’s character was inspired by Bob, for instance.</p> \n<p>“By any stretch of the imagination, it’s a peculiar set of circumstances to lose a fictional father and real father in the same year,” says Davies. “It’s very difficult and I miss him terribly. We were a good father and son, we had a lot of fun together. I laugh with my mum and sister regularly, we are still reduced to fits of laughter remembering him. And I’m really glad he got to see what I did. Even when he was poorly and in a wheelchair, he was wheeled into gigs, and was of the opinion that he would have done a much better job – and rightly so.”</p> \n<p>Will he be able to get out on stage and talk about his dad again without dissolving? “I suppose you try and compartmentalise the way you’re feeling. If I’m remembering great times we had together … It’s very simplistic but I don’t feel sad when I’m laughing. It’s easy to separate the two feelings. The joy of comedy is that you’re absolutely in control of what you reveal of yourself. People say I have talked about my dad for years, and I have, but I haven’t touched on our relationship really, I’ve just taken tiny aspects of his personality and profited from them.” He laughs. “Much to his irritation.”</p> \n<p>He reminds me of this idea of being in control of what he reveals of himself when I ask him about his former relationship with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/15/liz-kendall-labour-leadership-interview\">Liz Kendall, the MP</a> who was first to put herself forward for leader of the Labour party (they were together for eight years, and remain good friends). Was he wary of her career and how the things he said on stage or on panel shows might affect her? There is a long pause, then: “I’m really not comfortable talking about my personal life.” But it’s more a question about your work, I say. “I think,” he says, after another long pause, “if you’re creative and trying to do something that comes from a place of honesty, you can’t clip those wings for any reason. But that’s not to say it wasn’t something I was concerned about. Of course. But I do what I do. What is the point of pretending to be something other than I am? It would be ridiculous to start behaving differently. So, yes, something of concern but I’ve never modified what I do, and nor have I ever been expected to.” He is quiet, but smiling, his mouth clamped shut.</p> \n<p>If Man Down gets a third series, he will spend most of his time on that, but he wants to do another standup show and tour next year “because I miss it. I haven’t done a gig for two years.” It will be interesting to see what he comes up with, partly because the more successful he becomes, the harder it is to pull off the conceit that he’s a tragic, middle-aged loser. “Yes, but I’m still a mess,” he says with a laugh. “Look at how fat I am.”</p> \n<p>What does he love when he is standing there, in front of people? “I love to make people laugh and that will come from trying to make my dad laugh,” he says. “I love it in a visceral sense – it fills me full of hope. It’s instant gratification. It’s a group of people going, ‘Yes, you have done well, it’s funny’ straight away. It’s just joyful to see people laugh.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>The new series of Man Down is on Channel 4 on Monday 1 June at 10pm.</em></p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432141428235/bd151c48-db4f-4f47-9b55-fe36b7cb3f4d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Levene/Guardian","altText":"Greg Davies: 'I had an early midlife crisis.'","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Levene/Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432141618678/9f0c75bc-592e-4947-bfec-1b8723c86e96-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Greg Davies with Gwyneth Powell and Rik Mayall in Man Down.

The lyrics to Picasso Baby suggest someone desperate for the art world’s approval as he namechecks artists including <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/marina-abramovic-on-lady-gaga-marriage-and-art-20-odd-questions-1402006045\">Jeff Koons</a> and the painter <a href=\"http://genius.com/1939411\">George Condo</a>, rapping out a cultural cringe, a plea for intellectual recognition. Abramović, meanwhile, can now afford to diss him and drop him. For she has ascended to pseudo-messianic glory.</p> \n<p>It is a measure of how completely Abramović hogs the idea of performance art in the popular imagination that when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/may/11/chris-burden-one-of-the-most-pertinent-and-poetic-artists-of-the-age\">Chris Burden</a>, an American artist who similarly pioneered martyr-like, life-threatening performance – he got himself shot in the arm and crucified on a Volkswagen – died recently there was little fuss, at least on this side of the Atlantic. I guess he should have worked with Lady Gaga.</p> \n<p>Abramović has crossed a line that even Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst are wary of. Someone was bound to do it eventually. She has not just taken art out of the gallery but into a realm of rock concert hysteria and teen adulation. To put it kindly, you can say her fans resemble the star-struck kids in old films of the Beatles. But what is the cultural price of mass intoxication? Is it a good thing? Poor Jay Z. He thought he could exploit an artist to look cool. He had no idea who he was messing with.</p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432131544543/2627706a-5140-48bb-ac1f-65dc0cba4a2a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Yana Paskova/New York Times/Redux/Eyevine","altText":"Jay Z dances with the Marina Abramovic at the Pace Gallery.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Yana Paskova/New York Times/Redux/Eyevine"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-20T15:57:44Z","lastModified":"2015-05-20T23:00:45Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":26,"contributors":[{"name":"Jonathan Jones","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741000/JonathanJones.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jonathanjones"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Marina Abramovic","Art","Art and design","Jay Z"],"tags":[{"id":"artanddesign/marina-abramovic","webTitle":"Marina Abramovic"},{"id":"artanddesign/art","webTitle":"Art"},{"id":"books/art","webTitle":"Art and design"},{"id":"music/jayz","webTitle":"Jay Z"}],"section":{"id":"artanddesign"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jonathan Jones","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jonathanjones"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"artanddesign"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/shortcuts/2015/may/20/marina-baramovic-says-shell-never-work-with-jay-z-again","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/494ac","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/artanddesign/shortcuts/2015/may/20/marina-baramovic-says-shell-never-work-with-jay-z-again","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2015/may/20/marina-baramovic-says-shell-never-work-with-jay-z-again"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432131544543/2627706a-5140-48bb-ac1f-65dc0cba4a2a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jay Z dances with the Marina Abramovic at the Pace Gallery.

That, I think, is the charm of Palmyra – its slender creamy beauty rising up fantastically in the middle of hot sand,” she writes. “It is lovely and fantastic and unbelievable, with all the theatrical implausibility of a dream. Courts and temples and ruined columns … I have never been able to decide what I really think of Palmyra. It has always for me the dreamlike quality of that first vision. My aching head and eyes made it more than ever seem a feverish delusion!

The air is fresh and clear and pure,” records the novelist. “And then, suddenly, you come to the white spires of the shrine. All is calm and gentle and peaceful there. There are trees, a courtyard, running water. Gentle-faced custodians bring you refreshments and you sit in perfect peace, sipping tea.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14ff4067efa51ae2dd12cb68a040fbc01053d5ff\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432131697760/d206a8db-f554-491d-b1cb-fabcedd73479-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Agatha Christie in Syria\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The archaeological dig at Chagar Bazaar.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: &copy; Agatha Christie Mallowan 1946/PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“This is Agatha Christie’s most ignored book,” said David Brawn, who is bringing out the new edition this summer. “She published it just after the second world war, in 1946 – she had got married in the 1930s to Max Mallowan, and she used to travel with him. She was a real emancipated character – she’d live in the tents, get involved in the digs, catalogue and clean the artefacts, and photograph them … There’s a bit of real-life adventure in there, such as her car getting stuck in a wadi, but it’s really just a charming and personal account of what her life was like.”</p> \n<p>Christie writes as the memoir opens: “This book is an answer. It is the answer to a question that is asked me very often. ‘So you dig in Syria, do you? Do tell me all about it. How do you live? In a tent?’ etc, etc,” adding a little later: “This is not a profound book … It is, in fact, small beer – a very little book, full of everyday doings and happenings.”</p> \n<p>Its opening pages see her describing her travails attempting to find a suitable outfit for her travels: “‘Of course, Modom, we are not being asked for that kind of thing just now! We have some very charming little suits here - OS [outsize] in the darker colours.’ Oh, loathsome OS! How humiliating to be OS! How even more humiliating to be recognised at once as OS!” writes Christie, cheerily.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f6890056917624c4cecc06126526f7da33b4fe4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432131880655/d11d2a01-617f-43a9-af21-a0562af81c24-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Agatha Christie in Syria\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The House at Tel Brak, photographed during Christie’s visit.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: &copy; Agatha Christie Mallowan 1946/PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Brawn said the book has been in print since it was first released in 1946, but that a new edition has not been released in 20 years.
