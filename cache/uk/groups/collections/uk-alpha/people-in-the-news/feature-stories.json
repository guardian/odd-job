People like familiarity, as they should with a radio station, but obviously... I do like the word “obviously” a lot, don’t I? Let me get out my thesaurus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/15/clara-amfo-radio-1-official-chart-show\">Clara Amfo on taking over the Radio 1 chart show: ‘I’m smiling a lot’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Does someone tell you if you repeat particular words a lot on air?</strong><br />Yeah, everyone’s got their crutch phrases; listeners have been pretty cool, but I’m my own worst critic. If I listen back to a recording of myself I’ll slap myself on the forehead and feel a bit like an idiot. Anyway, back to your question, there’s not going to be a major overhaul but obviously… No, don’t say “obviously”! But I’m somebody who likes all different types of music. It’s evident from my background – being at Kiss FM and Radio 1Xtra – that I love hip-hop and R&amp;B, that’s music I’m passionate about. But there’s everything from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/mar/22/kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-butterfly-review-fearless-in-scope\" title=\"\">Kendrick Lamar</a> to Kate Bush on my&nbsp;iPod.</p> \n<p><strong>Which radio DJs present or past have inspired you?</strong><br />Oh gosh, so many people. I keep mentioning Sara Cox in interviews and I swear she’s going to think I’m obsessed with her. But I remember listening to her and thinking, “I really like this lady. She’s just chilled, she can tell a good story, and I feel like if I bumped into her in the pub she’d be like [adopts Mancunian accent] ‘Yerallright?’” But I adore Vanessa Feltz, she’s so well read, she’s unapologetically herself. And Trevor Nelson is an incredible broadcaster.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I’m just a girl out here enjoying what she does and I hope you enjoy what I do as much as I enjoy doing it</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Should good radio DJs be like a friend then, someone you’d want to go to the pub with?</strong><br />There has to be a sense of friendship there. But it’s such a funny one because there’s an element of me – and it’s something I almost don’t want to let go – that I’ll always feel like I’m watching what I’m doing happening to somebody else. It feels surreal. I’m just a girl out here enjoying what she does and I hope you enjoy what I do as much as I enjoy doing it. I want people when they listen to me to be like, “Clara, she’s all right. I trust her, I get it.”</p> \n<p><strong>What if success changes you?</strong><br />Don’t get me wrong, I’m an ambitious person, but I’m somebody who’s very much into holding on to my sanity in this industry.

Even saying that to you now – I get to go down in the chart-history books among all the other greats who have done it. It’s another crazy thing that I wasn’t expecting to happen.</p> \n<p><strong>Radio 1’s remit is to appeal to 15- to 29-year-olds, but the station has struggled to do that. [The average age of listeners is currently 32.] Is that something you are made aware of? </strong><br />Yeah, it’s on my mind, but at the same&nbsp;time I’m not thinking, “That’s not something that a 15- to 29-year-old would or wouldn’t like.” Because&nbsp;not every 15- to 29-year-old is&nbsp;the same type of person. Something&nbsp;I’m very aware of is engaging people’s attention for however long they are listening. People’s listening habits are all over the shop – some people you’ll catch them for 12 minutes on the train, others will listen literally all day – so I’ve got to make sure everything I say is of some use and every tune is relevant to the audience.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2013/aug/04/clara-amfo-radio-dj-kissfm\">Clara Amfo: 'I'm inspired by Oprah.

The cause of her death wasn’t immediately known.</p> \n<p>Trained as a physical therapist, Bing taught breathing and relaxation techniques to generations of expectant mothers, wrote several books about birth and pregnancy and encouraged women, and men, to be more prepared, active and inquisitive participants in the arrival of their babies.</p> \n<p>“I was certainly considered a radical,” she wrote in Lamaze’s magazine in 1990. By then, she noted, childbirth education had become common: “This so-called fad has been proven not to be a fad.”</p> \n<p>Born 8 July, 1914, in Berlin, Bing fled Nazi Germany with her family for England, where she got her physical therapy training. Working with new mothers got her thinking about delivery practices, an interest she brought with her to the United States in 1949.</p> \n<p>She learned about ideas advanced by some doctors, including French obstetrician Fernand Lamaze, for using breathing and mental preparation to manage labor pain without medication. She and the late Marjorie Karmel established what is now Lamaze International in 1960 to spread the strategies.</p> \n<p>Bing gave birth herself at 40, going into a fast labor during which she was given spinal anesthesia and nitric oxide. She told the New York Times in 2004 that she’d gleaned that childbirth training wasn’t about refusing drugs, but rather about teaching a woman “to help herself as far as she can go”.</p> \n<p>Lamaze became a household word, woven into pop culture. Its signature classes involved both women and men, with the idea that fathers could provide emotional and mental support in the delivery room.</p> \n<p>Over the years, the idea of refusing all painkillers during labor fell out of favor with many women, and some couples sought shorter birth preparation classes than Bing’s six-week program.</p> \n<p>Still, “I feel we have changed the whole attitude toward obstetrics and pregnant women, not necessarily technical changes, but the psychological and practical approaches to pregnancy,” she told the New York Sun in 2004.</p> \n<p>Lamaze International, which has about 2,000 childbirth educators around the world, now more broadly promotes healthy and natural birth practices and preparation. Bing’s influence lingers there, as in delivery rooms around the country, President Robin Elise Weiss said Saturday.</p> \n<p>“Even if people haven’t heard her name,” Weiss said, “she’s impacted how they give birth.”</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3ce6a88ee3afad2cadae4882d0376269ae9b280d/0_9_200_120/200.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":120,"width":200,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lamaze International","altText":"Elisabeth Bing, co-founder of Lamaze International","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Lamaze International"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-17T03:13:18Z","lastModified":"2015-05-17T03:13:19Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":6,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["US news","Childbirth","New York","Pregnancy","Germany","Parents and parenting","Health & wellbeing"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/childbirth","webTitle":"Childbirth"},{"id":"us-news/new-york","webTitle":"New York"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/pregnancy","webTitle":"Pregnancy"},{"id":"world/germany","webTitle":"Germany"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"}],"section":{"id":"us-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"us-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/may/17/natural-childbirth-pioneer-elisabeth-bing-dies-at-100","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49xe8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/us-news/2015/may/17/natural-childbirth-pioneer-elisabeth-bing-dies-at-100","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/17/natural-childbirth-pioneer-elisabeth-bing-dies-at-100"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3ce6a88ee3afad2cadae4882d0376269ae9b280d/0_9_200_120/200.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":120,"width":200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Elisabeth Bing, co-founder of Lamaze International, became interested in childbirth techniques in the 1950s.

Last week, Divided Britain no longer referred to the angst-ridden outcome of the latest election, but to whether you thought Kevin Pietersen should be in the England cricket team.</p> \n<p>Even those who would struggle to tell you who England are playing this summer – is it the Ashes again, already? – were surprised to find they suddenly had an opinion about cricket. More impressive still, Pietersen’s return to public consciousness came at a time when he had not picked up a bat for his country in 14 months; when he was plying his trade in sport’s most modest of arenas, the county championship, in front of crowds that can only kindly be described as minimalist.</p> \n<p>English cricket has once again found it impossible to contain, to accommodate or even to comprehend the phenomenon that is Kevin Pietersen. A year ago, he was sacked by the England and Wales Cricket Board, charged with fomenting dressing room disquiet and, obliquely, with England’s poor performance against Australia. Six months ago, at the expiry of a confidentiality clause that had built tension rather than defused it, Pietersen published an autobiography that kicked sand in the faces of friend and foe alike. Everyone agreed, at this stage, that he would never play for England again.</p> \n<p>But English cricket has a history of unfathomable decisions and bungling administrators. Two months ago, the new ECB chairman, Colin Graves, said publicly that there was a way back for the sport’s perennially prodigal son. “If he [plays county cricket] and then comes out and scores a lot of runs [the selectors] can’t ignore him,” Graves told the BBC.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Pietersen was fulfilling those conditions, blasting his way to a triple-century for Surrey; by Tuesday, it was all in vain. The new director of cricket who blocked his way back to the team citing “massive trust issues” was his former captain Andrew Strauss, a man whose opinion of Pietersen has been well known ever since he accidentally called him a bad word while commentating on TV. (Strauss had thought he was off-air.)</p> \n<p>Since cricket fell out of favour as a “national sport” in the 1990s – thanks to a dearth of victories and football’s pincer movement on the summer –only a handful of players have managed to transcend the game and make their mark on the wider British consciousness. At the start of the 2000s, it was Andrew Flintoff, a man with a simple enjoyment of his sport that harked back to an earlier, less clinically professional era. He was cheerful and fans could relate to him – he was the kind of guy you knew you’d enjoy a pint with. When he inspired England to their first Ashes victory in 18 years, sports lovers hugged him to their grateful chests.</p> \n<p>Pietersen made his Test debut in the same series. His hair was long, with a mohican streak of blond, he wore a diamond earring and he batted with a freedom that hadn’t been seen in England in a generation. In an unbearably tense, closely fought series, nothing seemed to faze him. If Flintoff was a throwback, Pietersen was the very model of a 21st-century sportsman, bred for a world of buzz, hype, attention.</p> \n<p>He was born in Pietermaritzburg, one of four brothers fiercely competitive in every area of life; Pietersen once told me that “during grace before dinner you had to keep one eye open or else someone’s going to nick your sausage”.</p> \n<p>“Playing rugby in the back garden, playing cricket, we were so competitive it was unbelievable,” he said. “I think it’s a great asset to have. To be confident about your ability is vital… I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.”</p> \n<p>His Afrikaner father, Tony, instilled the discipline he needed to succeed, although arguably his mother, Penny, had the most influence over his future. It was her English birthright that allowed him, at 19, to exchange nationalities, when he felt his progress to the South African team was being impeded by the post-apartheid quota system.</p> \n<p>Clive Rice, a former South African Test cricketer, invited him to play at Nottinghamshire. “It was a new environment for him,” says Mick Newell, the current England selector who was then a Notts coach. “There were very few people he knew. So he was certainly quiet in that environment.”</p> \n<p>Rice first met him in 2001. He remembers a “quiet young man, fantastically athletic and talented. He’s always been a very keen, hardworking cricketer – he loves batting and he loves his fitness. But he was very different then: quiet, shy and unsure of himself. He only bloomed as an individual when he put the performances in front of his team.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a32e36a2d78fcd1a3e0296a03cc32be377602c99\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431768810209/6c8cb4e2-88bb-4384-a547-f6367b494d68-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Strauss and Kevin Pietersen celebrate after winning the fifth Ashes test.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Strauss and Kevin Pietersen in happier times celebrate after winning the fifth Ashes test.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Copley/PA Wire</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He bloomed fast and bright. Ed Smith, a former England batsman and current Test match commentator, recalls of him that, on an England A tour, “embryonic greatness poured out of him like incense. He wasn’t stressed; he was certain.” He was called up to the England team as soon as he had finished the mandatory four-year qualifying period. When he first appeared for England in his homeland, spectators cried “Traitor!”</p> \n<p>After scoring a century, he kissed his England badge, a gesture that seemed not so much deliberately provocative as hopelessly gauche. That inability to appreciate how he was seen by others is a trait he seems never to have grown out of. From early beginnings, Pietersen made no secret of how much he enjoyed the trappings of his career – the cars, the sponsorships, the introduction to his celebrity wife, Jessica Taylor of Liberty X. Even last week, as he left the country crying injustice, he tweeted a picture of the private jet that would be flying him to Dubai.</p> \n<p>That lack of self awareness has been at the heart of the fallings-out and forced exiles that have punctuated his career. There was the Nottinghamshire captain who threw Pietersen’s gear from the dressing room balcony; the short-lived England captaincy, which ended when he claimed he could not work with the coach; and of course Strauss, about whom he texted uncomplimentary messages to the opposition. Still, no one ever accused Pietersen of being malicious: just self-absorbed. Even Strauss admitted: “Nine-tenths of my time as England captain I found him a good guy to have in my team.”</p> \n<p>After each incident, Pietersen would appear suitably contrite, a shade more humble. He had learned, he would say; he would do whatever was needed; he would earn back his place. He did more than that. For the best part of a decade, his individual performances were enough to outweigh the collective concern over his attitude. His batting was explosive, unpredictable, thrilling.</p> \n<p>Since Flintoff’s retirement, his emergence from the pavilion has been the most eagerly awaited moment of any England match and inspired hyperbolic prose rarely heard of any player but WG Grace (Tom Holland, the novelist and historian, described one of his innings as “a berserker assault, the batting equivalent of dismembering a shield-wall singlehanded”).</p> \n<p>But even that has never been enough for Pietersen, who yearns not just to be a hero, but to be loved as one. In interviews, he can contradict himself while believing, passionately, each truth he espouses. His early experiments in how to shape his own narrative – the awkwardly fascinating video, for instance, that he released in the middle of the texting scandal – have been honed on Twitter, a place where he can direct the traffic with the help of his personal policeman, Piers Morgan. His autobiography was thumping proof of both his need to justify himself in the eyes of his fanbase and a misplaced faith in honesty above policy.</p> \n<p>Does all this make him impossible to handle? His high-profile friends – from former opponents such as Shane Warne and Graeme Smith to starry team-mates in the Indian Premier League – don’t think so. “He is slightly different in the way he thinks and the way he plays,” Kumar Sangakkara said recently. “In Sri Lanka, we’ve had players like that who are very different and there is a place for individuality and difference in a dressing room.” Or, as former England batsman Mark Butcher put it more bluntly to me last week: “You never get 11 guys in a cricket team who all like each other.”</p> \n<p>It is, it seems, the English sensibility that has found Pietersen uniquely hard to stomach. But he wishes to play for England and he, and many others, still believe he should. Another Pietersen book is due in the autumn; whatever its contents, it’s sure to cause more ulcers.</p> \n<h2>THE PIETERSEN FILE</h2> \n<p><strong>Born</strong> Kevin Peter Pietersen on 27 June 1980 in Natal province to an Afrikaner father and English mother.

The club was something of a town hall, a locale where folks would gather to eat burgers and fish plates, where the fun would extend until early in the morning. James’ brother would drive around in a van, picking up residents and driving them to the club, she said.<br /></p> \n<p>“It would get packed.

He later donated the roughly 70-year-old building to the BB King Museum and Delta Interpretive Center.</p> \n<p>According to the Mississippi Blues Trail historical marker outside the green wooden building, Club Ebony was built just after the end of the second world war by entrepreneur Johnny Jones, opening for business in 1948.</p> \n<p>In a memoir, Jones wrote: “There were no other clubs for Negroes in Indianola at the time.” It was part of the “chitlin’ circuit”, a collection of juke joints and clubs where blacks could forget their hardscrabble existence and enjoy themselves in the racially divided South.</p> \n<p>Under Jones and other owners, including a white bootlegger named James B “Jimmy” Lee, the club’s early performers included Ray Charles, Count Basie, Albert King and Willie Clayton. Ruby Edwards took over the club in the 1950s. When King came from Memphis to play Club Ebony in 1955, he met Edwards’ daughter, Sue Carol Hall. King and Hall were married in 1958.</p> \n<p>Mary Shepard and her husband Willie bought the club in 1975. It would go on to play host to James Brown, Ike Turner and Bobby Rush.</p> \n<p>The club had live music from Thursday through Sunday for a time after King donated it to the museum in 2012, said Dion Brown, the museum’s executive director. However, it no longer has regular shows; it only opens for tour groups and special occasions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1659cf5f15a9023b84d2e2e4dd9d23d44c01a604\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431802402087/31d56714-70cb-4f1d-8b3d-8b477a9ffb7e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"club ebony bb king\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Concert posters line a wall at the historic Club Ebony on Friday, May 15, 2015 in Indianola, Mississippi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sainz/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The wooden exterior of the club is painted green, and the entrance has a small portico.

With a reputation in America as a fixer, called in to sort out production and creative problems, Latham-Jones has worked with 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight, and helped to shape critical successes such as <em>Sideways, Little Miss Sunshine, Walk the Line </em>and <em>The Devil Wears Prada.</em></p> \n<p>“As a child I loved <em>Passport to Pimlico </em>and what we think of as ‘the lovable Ealing comedies’, but that was not all they made. Some of their films were outrageous and not cosy at all. I am not bringing back the Ealing comedy brand – there are generations that love those films and, of course, they are still known all over the world – but I am motivated by the fact that a younger generation of British film fans may well have heard of the American studios Sony and 20th Century Fox, but not of Ealing. I want to change that.”</p> \n<p>Ealing Studios, founded in 1902 in west London, produced a succession of hits in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was then run as a BBC production site and was revamped in 2000 as an independent film-making brand, producing the new St Trinian’s franchise.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd6aafb1b5cdd4fab3c4b3e0e1c6a995f7e9b9cf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431787398331/0bd6e0e6-a388-4947-86fe-a63e63816c56-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Noomi Rapace  and Maria Callas.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noomi Rapace and Maria Callas.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP/Rex</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On Friday in Cannes, Latham-Jones revealed details of his planned Ealing biopic of the opera singer Maria Callas. The film, which will star Noomi Rapace, is based on the book <em>Too Proud, Too Fragile,</em> by Alfonso Signorini, and will tell of the diva’s turbulent career and two-decade affair with Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis. Rapace, the Swedish star who made her name playing Lisbeth Salander in the films of Stieg Larsson’s Millennium trilogy, is to be a key face for the reborn Ealing Studios. She is also scheduled to star in <em>Vacation</em>, a Swedish drama to be written and directed by a fellow Swede, Jesper Ganslandt.</p> \n<p>Latham-Jones has already produced four films with Ealing – while he was setting up new funding for a bigger operation. These include a newly completed film about the singer Nina Simone, which stars Zoe Saldana and David Oyelowo, and<em> The D Train</em>, starring Jack Black, which was made for Sony and is out in Britain this summer. Also finished is <em>Kids in Love</em>, another acting job for supermodel Cara Delevingne, who stars alongside Bafta rising star award-winner Will Poulter.</p> \n<p>Later this year, the Ealing brand will also target television, with a project in which Rowan Atkinson takes a serious screen role as Georges Simenon’s Parisian detective Jules Maigret in two feature-length films for ITV.</p> \n<p>“The boundaries between television and film production are more than blurred now: they don’t exist. I see them as equal worlds,” said Latham-Jones.</p> \n<p>The line-up of future productions, aside from the Callas biopic, includes <em>Encounter</em>, with a screenplay to be improvised by the actors and acclaimed director Dominic Savage, and <em>Fishermen’s Friends</em>. The latter is perhaps the most traditional Ealing project on his slate, being the true story of the surprise commercial success of an amateur singing group from Port Isaac in Cornwall.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"661031390613142e3577aa8d04ee900c96dae26c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431787454417/abec68d6-0a87-44a2-994e-4648c64655a5-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Ben Latham-Jones of Ealing Studios.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Latham-Jones of Ealing Studios.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Latham-Jones says he has raised finance for his reinvigorated studio by enthusing a group of private equity investors, not all of them British. A good friend to stars such as Cate Blanchett, the producer lives in a flat in Covent Garden, London, and has a great love of acting. But Latham-Jones is also a money man, who says he welcomes the appointment of John Whittingdale as the new secretary of state for culture, media and sport.</p> \n<p>“It was a bold move, putting him in the job, but he is the right man. We get on well and he understands the significance of the creative industries in Britain now,” he said.</p> \n<p>Latham-Jones added that because Ealing Studios can now make films independently, without joint finance deals, Britain’s other big players, Film4 and BBC Films, were welcoming the beefed-up operation. Crucial to any success, he believes, will be his hands-on approach, coupled with an unsentimental assessment of the right budget for the right film.</p> \n<p>“I was on set most of the time for the four films we have just made. It is important to me to be involved day-to-day. I also think it is important to know what kind of film you are making and to get the finance right. In the past perhaps there has been an attempt to make every British film for every single kind of audience. Instead, we are going to judge who each film is aimed at. We have seen the success of a film for an older audience like Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, well, I think there is a similar gap for younger viewers, so that they don’t only have Marvel superhero movies to watch.”</p> \n<p>Latham-Jones is taking over the production side of Ealing from producer/director Barnaby Thompson, but the two will continue to work together. Thompson said he was proud of Ealing Studios and happy to leave it “in Ben’s capable hands”. He added: “I have decided to focus my attention on being a film-maker full time. I want to concentrate on my upcoming directing projects.”</p> \n<p>Alongside partners Harry Handelsman and Uri Fruchtmann, Thompson is to retain his shares in Ealing Studios Operations, the buildings and film facilities side of the business, which is thriving to the extent that Ealing Studios’ productions struggle to find space on the sound stages there. “Luckily, most of the productions ahead of us are being filmed on location.”</p> \n<p>The first sign of the new identity of Ealing Studios will soon be visible. A new logo sequence has been filmed with music composed by Michael Nyman. Symbolically, swirling bright colours will gradually reveal the familiar Ealing name in its trademark typeface at the centre of the screen.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431729655406/--1964-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Audrey Hepburn appeared in the Ealing Studios favourite The Lavender Hill Mob.

She talks about the challenges they faced in their 30-year marriage and about how close The Theory of Everything was to reality</p>","byline":"Joanna Moorhead","body":"<p>Here is Stephen Hawking’s verdict on the movie about his marriage: it needed more science. And here is Jane Hawking’s verdict: it needed more emotion. Those opposing views on The Theory of Everything, which brought Eddie Redmayne an Oscar and a Bafta for his portrayal of Stephen and Felicity Jones Oscar and Bafta nominations for her portrayal of Jane, reveal a great deal about not only the personalities of the world’s most famous scientist and his former wife, but also one of the major strands of difference in their relationship.</p> \n<p>But the truth is that science is probably more absent from the film than emotion, because what the film represents is a triumph of Jane’s experience and persona after decades in which the family was viewed solely through the prism of Stephen’s genius, who as well as being the world’s best-known scientist is also the world’s best-known sufferer of motor neurone disease (MND).</p> \n<p>Today there is an aura of unassuming achievement around Jane, who is sitting in the conservatory overlooking her garden in a quiet corner of Cambridge. Meeting her feels <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/dec/25/felicity-jones-stephen-hawking-the-theory-of-everything-interview\">like fast-forwarding through time to meet an older Felicity Jones</a>, so accurately did the actor represent her subject. But then, talking to Jane, it all turns on itself again: the reality was, she says, that she and Stephen met Jones and Redmayne when they were researching their roles, and was later astounded to realise how closely her mannerisms, gestures and speech patterns had been noted. “When I saw the film, I thought: she’s stolen my personality!”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"331bbe3046d289c9d7bf01a2c81d5f9586aedf57\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431443290013/21d29ffc-44e6-4fbc-b097-7755e4f83fc2-292x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Jane Hawking\" width=\"292\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Hawking: ‘The &shy;difficulties of dealing with Stephen’s disease were much greater than they appear in the film.’</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Her relationship with Stephen started when both refused to be daunted by the fact that Stephen had just been diagnosed with terminal motor neurone disease. They ploughed into marriage in the face of his parents’ pessimism about its chances of success, and had three children. In the face of pressures that were almost too much to bear, and alongside her friendship with another man, they somehow kept their marriage together for a quarter of a century before ending it with a remarkable degree of equanimity.</p> \n<p>Does the film present an accurate portrait of their marriage, which began at Trinity Hall in Cambridge in 1965?</p> \n<p>“The important thing is that the feelings, where they are there, are very much true to our experiences. So from an emotional point of view, it’s spot on. The only thing is that they’ve had to minimise the strains and struggles, because in our real life the difficulties of dealing with Stephen’s disease were much greater than they appear in the film.”</p> \n<p>And, yes, the impression given in the film that she and Stephen managed to split up without too much acrimony – and that Jane’s new partner and now husband, musician Jonathan Hellyer Jones, became part of their immediate family – is indeed an accurate one (although for a long time after they met, their relationship was platonic).</p> \n<p>Jane met Jonathan when, to give her a break from the constant demands of caring for Stephen, a friend suggested she should take up singing in the local church choir, run by Jonathan. It was 1977. The Hawkings, then parents of two young children, were living in Cambridge, where he was garnering a reputation as one of the most glittering scientists of his generation. Jane, though, was isolated and overwrought. How much were the demands on their marriage the product of Stephen’s disease – without it, might they still be married today? Jane isn’t sure: although his health was a huge strain, there were others. From the outset, Stephen’s “eccentric” family made no secret of the fact that they didn’t think the marriage would survive.</p> \n<p>“Stephen’s mother once said to me, ‘We don’t like you because you don’t fit into our family.’” On another occasion she learned by chance that the Hawkings were planning to move to Cambridge so they could be there when the marriage foundered, as they were sure it eventually would.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"90a4a53af615f7e2d178a5e95a5453caa7a04bbe\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431522152931/59aa72f8-7f88-4f6d-af00-d54545fbc208-324x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Jane and Stephen Hawking\" width=\"324\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane and Stephen Hawking in 1974.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But it wasn’t just about a lack of support from the wider family. “The truth was, there were four partners in our marriage,” says Jane. “Stephen and me, motor neurone disease and physics. If you took out motor neurone disease, you are still left with physics. Mrs Einstein, you know, cited physics as a difference for her divorce ...”<br /></p> \n<p>During their marriage, she says, Stephen would retreat into himself. And, though he tried to explain physics to her, she always felt shut out of the world that was so crucial to him. But the stresses of MND were not solely or even mostly down to the physical difficulties of the condition; what brought even greater disruption to their lives was the advent of the carers who shared their home, who disapproved of aspects of their lives, and whose presence meant they could never have the privacy that every family needs to thrive.</p> \n<p>“They whispered about us and they undermined me,” says Jane. It’s clear the pain is still there. One of those nurses, Elaine Mason, went on to become his second wife, though the two later divorced. This is an episode of their lives Jane is reluctant to rake over, although it was this relationship that tipped the Hawkings into splitting up, rather than her relationship with Jonathan. Why did they carry on for so long, even after she had met Jonathan and become close to him? She says it never felt like a choice: she loved Jonathan and depended on him for support, but she absolutely loved Stephen as well.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-454192060__\n</div> \n<p>“There was no alternative to just carrying on. I felt very committed to Stephen, and I didn’t think he could manage without me. I wanted him to carry on doing his amazing work, and I wanted the children to have a stable family behind them – so we just carried on.”</p> \n<p>In real life, as in the film, Jonathan became part of the family, sharing the workload of caring for Stephen with Jane, and helping bring up the children. He had been widowed a couple of years before they met. “What brought us together,” says Jane, “was loneliness. We were both very lonely people, and then we found one another.”</p> \n<p>So the formal split in the Hawkings’ marriage didn’t come until the early 1990s, by which time the oldest children were in their late teens and 20s and the youngest late addition, Timothy, was 10. In real life, as in the film, Jane says there is no doubt that Timothy is Stephen’s child, not Jonathan’s. She is proud of the way she and Stephen and Jonathan kept their lives on an even track for so long. “But once the breakup happened, things absolutely exploded. The lines of communication became much more difficult for a while.”</p> \n<p>Even when a marriage has petered out gradually, it still takes time to recover, she says. “They reckon you have to allow at least one year for every five years of marriage to recover before you can pick up the reins and find yourself again.”</p> \n<p>Jane and Jonathan eventually married in 1997. How has that union compared with her first one? “I don’t think of my life as having two marriages, I think of it as a continuum,” she says. “We all lived in such harmony, and for so long, until the divorce and the disruption.”</p> \n<p>But her two relationships have been very different. “I’ve been able to lean on Jonathan – we can lean on one another,” she says.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-443996280__\n</div> \n<p>“Whereas in the past with Stephen, he was dependent on me all the time. He worked very hard and he was very successful, but I never felt I could lean on him emotionally or confide in him.”</p> \n<p>Another difference is that, where physics divided her and Stephen because she was not of that world, music unites her and Jonathan: he is head of music at Magdalene College, and Jane sings regularly in choirs and as a soloist.</p> \n<p>Today, Stephen lives just round the corner from Jane and Jonathan. When we meet, she has just returned from visiting him, and they’re all planning to meet for Sunday lunch with Lucy, the couple’s daughter, at the weekend.</p> \n<p>Stephen has taken part in many of the publicity events for The Theory of Everything, which was based on Jane’s memoir of their time together. Now 71, she and Jonathan divide their life between Cambridge and their house in northern France, and she makes regular visits to Seattle where her and Stephen’s eldest child, Robert, works for Microsoft and has a son and a daughter.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/apr/30/katie-hopkins-life-harder-disabled-people\">Dear Katie Hopkins.

When I was seven my headteacher told me how delighted she was that my mother was going to speak at speech day. I was utterly horrified – partly because I knew I’d be beaten up in the playground.</p> \n<p><strong>My parents gave me strong values.</strong> My mother was an iconic figure for me because I could see what she stood for. She was a pacifist who was more of an example than an instructor. She didn’t go on about moral values, but she had them all right. I did not emulate her, although I’ve tried to have moral courage – difficult sometimes when it means standing up against your close friends and colleagues.</p> \n<p><strong>My father taught me the Catholic just war theory</strong> where war has to be morally justifiable with a series of guidelines. He was a soldier in the second world war, and an academic who had an ability to get on with people of all backgrounds. He hated prejudice and he had great social tolerance.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-454699024__\n</div> \n<p><strong>My brother John was a widower</strong> when he died in 1987 aged 60. He and his wife left two children, so they joined my family. They had four children who are my grand-nieces and nephews. The youngest recently got married, so I’m the last of that generation for them. We’re very close.</p> \n<p><strong>Bernard, my first husband, was an atheist</strong> and tolerant of my Catholic faith, which is important to me. Our marriage breakdown was caused firstly by us working in towns 50 miles apart, which meant we only saw each other at weekends. Secondly, some people in the 1970s could be cruel to the husbands of well-known women, and they would refer to him as Mr Shirley Williams, or as my consort. He was a generous, brilliant man and a great philosopher, but being treated like that grated with him.</p> \n<p><strong>I didn’t want to get married again.</strong> I thought here I am as a cabinet minister and we’re going to have trouble again, but Dick [Harvard professor Richard Neustadt who died in 2003] persuaded me. I was friends with Dick’s first wife long before I knew him. They were a happy couple and then she contracted multiple sclerosis. He retired so he could look after her. Towards the end, she said to Dick that he should remarry, and he ought to think about marrying me. He was also a marvellous man.</p> \n<p><strong>My daughter Rebecca is a lawyer.</strong> Her style is one of close, detailed analysis that comes partly from her father. She’s more forensic, precise and detailed than me.</p> \n<p><strong>I’m very close to my two grandsons.</strong> Sam, 13, is a chip off the old block and just like me. He’s passionate about politics and he started the debating society at his school. Nat, nine, is a more artistic, graceful boy who dances across the room like Billy Elliot and he’s less like me.</p> \n<p><strong>The family matters a lot to me as a unit.</strong> Rebecca’s husband died in his early 50s three years ago. He had a rare form of septicaemia caused by a cat scratch that lasted for nine years. Watching someone whom you love die is hard. It was tough for Rebecca and the boys because their father was always with them. I don’t kid myself that family life is all smooth, happy, sunlight and joy – especially in a family like mine where there are strong personalities. Nevertheless, when you go through it together, you develop a very strong bond.
