Unlike them, she was principally published and known as a voice firmly rooted in the science-fiction, fantasy and horror world. One reason for this was that she was remarkably prolific – only genre publishing could have coped with putting the majority of her 90 novels and 200 short stories into print.</p> \n<p>In the course of her long career – she made her first sale, a young adult novel, The Dragon Hoard (1971), at 21 and wrote up to her death – she produced adult and young adult novels, science fiction, fantasy, horror, crime, spy fiction, erotica, a historical novel (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Gods-Are-Thirsty-Revolution/dp/B008SMEW7Y\" title=\"\">The Gods Are Thirsty</a>, in 1996, about the French Revolution, one of her many obsessions), radio plays and two episodes of the television space opera Blake’s 7. Yet all her work shares a tone – Lee captured like few other modern writers a gothic, not to say goth, sensibility in which the relentless pursuit of personal autonomy and sensual fulfilment leads her characters to the brink of delirium, as well as to a fierce integrity that can co-habit with self-sacrificing empathy.</p> \n<p>Like Carter in particular, Lee writes in a mode heavily influenced by decadents such as Aubrey Beardsley and William Beckford and yet concerned with ethical behaviour as well as personal fulfilment.</p> \n<p>It is typical that in the first of her Flat Earth sequence, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nights-Master-Tanith-Lee/dp/160762043X\" title=\"\">Night’s Master</a> (1978), the demon lord Azhrarn should accept responsibility when his random acts of sadistic vengefulness cause the potential destruction of humanity, and sacrifice himself; also typical of Lee’s mordant irony that he does so because, without humanity to torment, his life would have no point. Another of the Flat Earth novels, Death’s Master, won the <a href=\"http://www.britishfantasysociety.co.uk/british-fantasy-awards/\" title=\"\">British Fantasy award</a> in 1980 – Lee was the first woman to be so honoured.</p> \n<p>Lee was fascinated by genre tropes and the possibilities involved in re-imagining them – <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Birthgrave-Tanith-Lee/dp/1607620790\" title=\"\">The Birthgrave</a> (1975), in a way groundbreaking in its time, combines planetary romance and epic fantasy tropes in a tale of a goddess-like woman re-establishing autonomy and identity. Under the influence of Carter’s The Bloody Chamber (1979), she turned energetically to fairy-story re-imaginings.</p> \n<p>In the short story Red as Blood, for example, she turned the Snow White tale on its head so that a virtuous witch queen is trying to save the kingdom from her vampire step-daughter – after all, “skin white as snow, lips red as blood” are something of a giveaway. What is particularly inventive about the story is that its internal logic dictates resolution via a redemptive prince who is a Christ-figure in the manner of Oscar Wilde’s tales.</p> \n<p>Born in London, the child of professional dancers, Bernard and Hylda, Lee spent her childhood travelling around the British Isles. Because of dyslexia, she learned to read a little late but thereafter devoured the printed world. Among many other schools, she attended Catford grammar school, south-east London, and then spent a year at Croydon art college; her strong visual sense gave form and discipline to her fiction. Her parents encouraged her to write – most of her early fiction was typed from Tanith’s almost impenetrable handwriting by her mother.</p> \n<p>Becoming a writer was a natural extension of her love of story; she was fortunate enough to have written The Birthgrave at a time when, in the US, paperback sf and fantasy was having one of its periodic booms, so that she not only sold that book to DAW Books, but went on selling to them for many years. Further, her editor was impressed enough with her work that he published whatever she wrote – from the epic fantasy of The Birthgrave and its successors to more low-key books about rogues and adventurers to sf set in futures of endless physical self-reinvention (Don’t Bite the Sun, 1976) or erotic fulfilment with automata (The Silver Metal Lover, 1981).</p> \n<p>Gradually her work was taken more and more seriously; she won few awards but was nominated for many. Three major collections of her shorter work, Dreams of Dark and Light (1986), Women as Demons (1989) and The Forests of the Night (1989, appeared in the late 1980s.</p> \n<p>Thereafter her career went through the doldrums, exacerbated by changes in publishing in the 90s and thereafter. Precisely those qualities that had built her career – her endless fertility and constant self-reinvention – were liabilities in a publishing world obsessed with strict category and with authors who produce the same reliable product. At one point, she complained that she was writing books because she could do no other, but was stacking them unpublished in a cupboard.</p> \n<p>Luckily, the rise of the small press movement, coupled with sales through the internet, made it possible for her career to revive and the last years of her life saw her experimenting with work that completely transcended strict genre boundaries. She explored her current themes in a series – the Colour sequence of 2011 onwards – that could follow what was broadly speaking a horror novel with another that was a spy novel. An extended squabble with some of her other publishers over rights was resolved and DAW started a significant reissue of 22 of her books.</p> \n<p>Illness hindered her writing in her last months. At the time of her death, her editors were working on a short story collection that will appear posthumously – a last Flat Earth novel remains unfinished.</p> \n<p>Her husband, the painter and writer John Kaiine, whom she married in 1992, survives her.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Tanith Lee, writer, born 19 September 1947; died 24 May 2015</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433175497870/Tanith-Lee-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tanith Lee Photograph: Hodder","credit":"Hodder","altText":"Tanith Lee","cleanCaption":"Tanith Lee Photograph: Hodder"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-01T17:14:58Z","lastModified":"2015-06-01T18:15:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":17,"contributors":[{"name":"Roz Kaveney","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/roz-kaveney"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Books","Fantasy","Science fiction","Culture","Television & radio","Fiction"],"tags":[{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"books/fantasy","webTitle":"Fantasy"},{"id":"books/science-fiction","webTitle":"Science fiction"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction"}],"section":{"id":"books"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Roz Kaveney","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/roz-kaveney"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"books"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jun/01/tanith-lee","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ckp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/books/2015/jun/01/tanith-lee","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/01/tanith-lee"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433175497870/Tanith-Lee-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tanith Lee was one of the most influential voices in contemporary fantasy writing.

Even his gait, with left knee permanently crooked, suggests a man whose trunk cannot sustain the weight of an outsize head. Cooper, a fine actor, also makes you believe in the romantic sensibility that existed inside Merrick’s distorted frame … Much as I admire Cooper’s performance, I still find Pomerance’s play – as I did on its Hampstead theatre premiere in London in 1977 – thin and tendentious.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Dominic Maxwell, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/stage/theatre/article4456620.ece\">the Times</a>:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>There is really only one reason for seeing this imported Broadway smash hit, but it’s a good one: Bradley Cooper. If you’ve only seen him as the smoothly confident star of films such as The Hangover and Silver Linings Playbook, get ready to see a stage actor of boldness and imagination. He is physically extreme yet adroitly witty too as Joseph Merrick, the famously disfigured real-life Victorian at the centre of Bernard Pomerance’s 1977 play.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Paul Taylor, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/the-elephant-man-theatre-royal-review-bradley-cooper-is-terrific-as-john-merrick-10287684.html\">the Independent</a>:<br /></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The best scenes are those with Patricia Clarkson’s warm, witty Mrs Kendal, a celebrated actress who is amused and knowing about her way with illusion. Having been roped in to meet him because she’ll be able to mask her revulsion at Merrick, she practises different gracious intonations of “I am very pleased to make your acquaintance”, only to be thrown into unguarded sincerity by the intelligence and impishness of his conversation.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Ben Lawrence, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/11639001/The-Elephant-Man-West-End-review.html\">the Telegraph</a>:<br /></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Cynics will question the gym-toned, handsome Cooper’s motives for doing this. (“Look at me playing ugly. I have no vanity!”) But this is not a superficial performance: its strengths lie in its subtleties. As he is saved from a lifetime on the Victorian freakshow circuit by Dr Frederick Treves, Cooper slowly, carefully, unpeels Merrick’s personality – the man behind the deformity.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Michael Coveney, <a href=\"http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/reviews/elephant-man-haymarket-review_37926.html?cid=homepage_news\">What’s on Stage</a>:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Cooper avoids every trap of “disability” acting by suffusing this outer appearance with soul and passion. It’s a wonderful, and very moving, display.

Not only did the idea of being asked to do it again give me pause, but here he is, Steven Spielberg of all people, [asking] if I would entertain doing it again.”</p> \n<p>While Ava DuVernay might have beat Spielberg to the screen with her critically acclaimed Selma, Spielberg still owns the life rights to Martin Luther King Jr, meaning he would be able to use his actual speeches in the film.</p> \n<p>According to Oyelowo, it’s not the only offer he’s had to play the civil rights leader again.</p> \n<p>“I really don’t know. I’ve already been asked by a project that will remain nameless,” he said. “To be honest, right now, today I couldn’t think of anything worse. Just the weight gain alone is a reason for me to stay away from it! But I feel like we did so much with that film. It’s time to let that film do its thing for a while before I go entertaining anything like that.”</p> \n<p>Oyelowo received a Golden Globe nomination for his role in Selma, but missed out on recognition from the Academy. He will next be seen in true crime thriller Captive.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433165266133/55d4eb73-8478-4294-ba54-f73a5e4ff26c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Atsushi Nishijima","altText":"Could Steven Spielberg bring David Oyelowo the Oscar he deserves for playing Martin Luther King Jr?","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Atsushi Nishijima"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-01T14:46:21Z","lastModified":"2015-06-01T14:48:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":8,"contributors":[{"name":"Benjamin Lee","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/benjamin-lee-film"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["David Oyelowo","Steven Spielberg","Film","Culture","Selma","Martin Luther King","US news"],"tags":[{"id":"film/david-oyelowo","webTitle":"David Oyelowo"},{"id":"film/stevenspielberg","webTitle":"Steven Spielberg"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"film/selma","webTitle":"Selma"},{"id":"us-news/martin-luther-king","webTitle":"Martin Luther King"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Benjamin Lee","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/benjamin-lee-film"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/01/david-oyelowo-steven-spielberg-asked-him-play-martin-luther-king-again","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49cnb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/jun/01/david-oyelowo-steven-spielberg-asked-him-play-martin-luther-king-again","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/01/david-oyelowo-steven-spielberg-asked-him-play-martin-luther-king-again"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433165266133/55d4eb73-8478-4294-ba54-f73a5e4ff26c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Let’s go round again … could Steven Spielberg bring David Oyelowo the Oscar he deserves for playing Martin Luther King Jr?
