Looking back, I knew I was being laughed at, but people often make comments about my size and the way I look. Usually I brush it off, although it can knock me for six at first. But I had no idea that someone had <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc0qLqWsEqA\">put photos of me dancing online</a>, and that it was attracting some vicious comments.</p> \n<p>I got a call from a friend, telling me I was all over the internet. I was horrified, but by the time I went on Twitter, there were scores of supportive messages from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEHxebYPsfw\">a group of women in Los Angeles </a>who had set up a campaign to find me. They had called me the Dancing Man, and they wanted to invite me to the US to party.</p> \n<p>I went to work (I am head of finance for a boutique hotel chain in London), sure it would die down after an hour. But the tweets carried on, and people were trying to find me, so I asked a friend to <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=dancing+man+found&amp;biw=2009&amp;bih=1274&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U2SJVcjnGOKv7Abb9oHwBQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCAQsAQ#imgrc=ploI4Q7Zyptr-M%253A%3Blw-YzrfsSUPwbM%3Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fpbs.twimg.com%252Fprofile_images%252F573983561457528832%252FNRdOaAbz.jpeg%3Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftwitter.com%252Fdancingmanfoun1%3B400%3B400\">post a picture of me on Twitter</a>. People were thrilled to have found me, but there were other people claiming to be me, too, so they needed proof. It’s a fantastic irony that people actually wanted to be me: a 47-year-old single, fat Liverpudlian who’d been ridiculed online by an anonymous troll. So I sent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALOn0SJBEHM\">Cassandra</a>, one of the Californian women, a photo to prove who I was.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/25/dancing-man-fat-shamed-cyberbullies-hollywood-party\">'Dancing Man' fat-shamed by cyberbullies gets own back at Hollywood party</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I assumed I was going to meet up with her and a few friends, to go clubbing. It turned out that 1,700 women were going to pay for me to fly to LA, and in that first weekend, they raised $40,000. They also started the <a href=\"http://dance-free.squarespace.com/\">Dance Free Movement</a> to publicise it, and to find people who’d been bullied because of their gender, disability or weight.</p> \n<p>I never thought it would turn into such a momentous occasion. A big club got in touch to offer us a venue for the party. Moby offered to DJ. Once celebrities were interested, the whole thing escalated.</p> \n<p>I was gobsmacked. It felt crazy that something so harmful and personal could turn so quickly into something positive. I realised we could take a stance against this kind of bullying. My boss arranged for me to have some media training with a pal who worked in TV, and gave me time off. There was soon enough money for the party, with plenty left to donate to various anti-bullying charities, including <a href=\"https://www.kidscape.org.uk/\">Kidscape</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cybersmile.org/\">Cybersmile</a> in the UK, who were delighted when I approached them.</p> \n<p>I flew to the US with my brother and mate, to New York first, to go on the Today show with Meghan Trainor. I thought there would be a few of us interviewed, but it was just <a href=\"http://www.today.com/popculture/dancing-man-today-show-defies-bullies-dances-meghan-trainor-t22501\">me, dancing with her as she sang</a>. I had dinner with Monica Lewinsky, who does a lot of campaigning against cyber-bullying. She was lovely.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456904410__\n</div> \n<p>Then it was off to LA for the party. We got to the club to find TV crews from all over the world setting up. Later on, we found a small bar, where we could talk about the journey so far and how much we were looking forward to the party. Back at the club, there were people queueing up outside, cheering me as we got nearer. When we got in, my mind went blank. I’d had no idea the experience would be that intense.</p> \n<p>Cassandra and I had a dance, and then I made a speech. I’d been panicking about it, but decided to just speak off the cuff. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/25/dancing-man-fat-shamed-cyberbullies-hollywood-party\">Then the party started</a>, and I danced all night. The next day, <a href=\"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/05/24/dancing-man-takes-anti-bullying-pitch-literally-to-dodgers-stadium/\">I pitched the first ball</a> at the LA Dodgers game.</p> \n<p>I have never thought about the people who posted the original images of me. They must have their own insecurities, to put the spotlight on someone else so maliciously. It was done anonymously, and I like to think that indicates the shame they must have felt. I’m large. I’m distinctive. But I’ve got broad shoulders and a bit of confidence. I can cope with negative attention. And I guess I was lucky – I was blissfully unaware of all the trolling at first. If I’d seen the hurtful words, it could have been soul-destroying.</p> \n<p>In fact, the whole journey has been completely positive. I’m an average bloke, but if I can help people be kinder to each other, that’s got to be a good thing, hasn’t it?</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> As told to Camilla Palmer.

It wasn’t a kissy-cuddly environment. It was Mother and Father as opposed to Mummy and Daddy. I would shake my father’s hand and kiss my mother on the cheek rather than hug them, but it was a close family unit. My parents were always busy, but in the holidays we went with them on business trips.</p> \n<p><strong>My parents didn’t push us at school</strong>. But they did believe in social skills: mucking in and helping out. My mother cooked dinner and my father did the dishes along with the nominated son for the day. On a Saturday morning, one of us had to take round the wee hard brush or vacuum cleaner. It was educating us to look after ourselves.</p> \n<p><strong>My mother was scared every time I drove</strong>. But <a href=\"http://evolution.skf.com/david-coulthard/\" title=\"\">my father was a Scottish karting champion</a> and bought me my first kart at 11. We were given motorbikes first. My mother would be at the sink and we’d be flying past with no crash helmets on. My brother Duncan was the daredevil who had the speed and bravery, my sister Lynsay had the speed and I had the work ethic.</p> \n<p><strong>Because I’ve been so lucky </strong>and so driven, I’m not good with the self-pity thing. A low point for the family was burying my sister two years ago. She went through periods of depression and was on medication [Lynsay died of an overdose of a prescription drug]. I went with her to counselling, but I couldn’t feel what she felt. As a sportsman in the public eye, I told her she was welcome anywhere I went but on condition that she moved at my pace.</p> \n<p><strong>As a teenager</strong>, I thought about being married and having children then I started having success in cars so I switched off my mind to anything else. I had girlfriends but didn’t want anything that would emotionally distract me from the job. When I met my wife, Karen [Minier], a TV journalist, she already had a seven-year-old daughter. Some men look for the virginal type but for me it confirmed her mothering skills and ability to be independent.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63fbe15771e93cdc313f64e6001011975d88c7db\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435679425174/848d23af-451a-4201-8e88-cec91a4d98c8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"David Coulthard Karen Minier\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Coulthard and his wife, Karen Minier - they have been together for 10 years.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Peters/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Karen and I got married</strong> because we had a child together and I had no intention of marrying anyone else. We’ve been together 10 years and were married in a register office in Monaco [in 2013]. I don’t want to de-romanticise it, but I don’t subscribe to it being the best day of my life. On the other hand, when I got a call from the school nurse recently saying my son had hurt himself, the fear of a negative conversation immersed my body.</p> \n<p><strong>My son, Dayton, is six</strong>. No matter where I am in the world, I prioritise coming home to take him to school. I flew back from Australia to do that for two mornings, then went back to Malaysia. When we’re home of an evening, Karen does the cooking and I do the dishes. If I was doing dinner, I’d suggest a takeaway. I don’t want to give two hours to the kitchen when I don’t have a lot of time at home.</p> \n<p><strong>I think I’ve only smacked</strong> my son’s hand once. I try to reason, and lead by example – and give slightly distracting mini-lectures. I consistently say to him: “If you’re polite and respectful to people, you’ll get <em>almost</em> everything that you hope for.”</p> \n<p><strong>I cuddle up with my son</strong> and I kiss him on the lips. I hope that continues. I’m not being weird, and there’ll be a point when he doesn’t want that, but I hope he’ll still kiss me on the cheek. I’ve lived 20 years in Monaco and greet friends that way. My father certainly wouldn’t do that, though.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> David Coulthard is a Formula One pundit on BBC television.

This week he returns to play his most iconic role in Terminator Genisys and, since it’s not going down as one of his greatest films, here’s what we’d pick instead. </p> \n<h2>Pumping Iron</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdVCfDioTcY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BdVCfDioTcY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Perhaps the only actor to have ever broken out in a documentary, Arnie’s appearance in this bodybuilding doc has brought him both rewards and embarrassment. The 30-year-old goes into great, great detail about his routine, showing off his physique at any given moment. In this haunting clip, we hear him compare weight training to ejaculating.</p> \n<h2>Total Recall</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rziE39JWfs\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-rziE39JWfs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Long before Colin Farrell and director Len Wiseman brought roughly nothing to the table in the 2012 remake, Paul Verhoeven and Arnie added surprising smarts to this 1990 sci-fi thriller. A thin layer of satire added to a pacey action plot made it one of Arnie’s most purely enjoyable films. </p> \n<h2>Terminator 2: Judgment Day </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmEjjjkTTc4\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qmEjjjkTTc4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The first Terminator is a brilliantly spare thriller, as ruthlessly efficient as Arnie’s deadly android, but James Cameron’s 1991 sequel transformed a B-movie into a blockbuster. Utilising CGI in a way that no one had before, the effects still hold up to this day and the undervalued storytelling makes it a model on how to keep a broad audience on the edge of their seats.</p> \n<h2>Last Action Hero</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M80ZKIjSp3g\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M80ZKIjSp3g?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Unfairly overlooked, this 1993 meta-action film provided Arnie with a chance to poke fun at his persona, quite literally, as the actor played himself. Released a week after Jurassic Park, it was always somewhat doomed, with a complicated premise that was a little too knowing and also a little too nuts to work on the masses. </p> \n<h2>True Lies</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xgf1m8_hey-because-it-s-you-true-lies-1994_shortfilms\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/embed/video/xgf1m8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Arnie’s attempts at comedy were mixed and, given the failure of Last Action Hero, it’d be understandable if he stayed away from the genre completely. But reuniting with James Cameron for this 1994 attempt was a stroke of genius. Making sure the action quota was kept in check while also ensuring a steady stream of laughs, the balance was perfectly managed and proved, yet again, that Arnie works best when paired with Cameron. </p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435836532081/13bd3af3-1025-485a-8805-3175f4967058-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Moviestore/REX Shutterstock","altText":"I’ll be [looking] back ...

This kind of wave slowly breaks on one side so the surfer can ride the open face as it runs down the point. The ride is longer and better for a longer-length learner’s board. Even as an advanced surfer, point breaks are my favourite waves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56bc68577d71c128eac5caaf97d96c8dca57f69c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435857622551/63e98407-645d-4109-b7c6-a33289fe0aad-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Steph Gilmore\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephanie Gilmore</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Women’s presence in surfing is growing rapidly.</strong> I see more and more girls, of all ages, in what were formerly male-dominated line-ups. In the past, we weren’t welcomed but I’ve seen guys’ attitudes change and now I find them to be far more encouraging. I actually think they enjoy seeing how fast we’re progressing.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://beachsafe.org.au/beach/nsw014\"><strong>Wategos</strong></a><strong> beach is my favourite.</strong> When the swell is bigger, the crowds aren’t too big and the sun is out, it’s one of the most magical places in the world. Set up a blanket on the beach, take a range of boards and you won’t want to leave until sunset. And, if you need somewhere to stay, try <a href=\"http://raesonwategos.com/\">Rae’s</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Whites beach has to be one of the most beautiful and deserted in the area</strong>. Sunrise at Belongil beach is the perfect time and place for yoga.</p> \n<p><strong>My favourite spot in Bryon isn’t actually a beach – it’s a restaurant called </strong><a href=\"http://www.balcony.com.au/\"><strong>The Balcony</strong></a>. It’s great for sitting outdoors, people-watching.</p> \n<p><strong>The town has a really good foodie scene.</strong> <a href=\"http://byronbaycafebar.com.au/\">The Roadhouse</a> is my go-to lunch spot at the moment. Have the fish tacos with a nice gin spritzer. My favourite place for dinner is <a href=\"http://www.italianatthepacific.com.au/\">The Italian</a> at the Byron Beach Hotel. It makes a mean negroni and great lamb-shank lasagne.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2889d51dcef919ac9ed7d8021f41a23c2cef8c3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435857734019/e500fb1d-233a-4edb-b20c-13d255b00b94-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Evening mood with surfers at Watego Beach near Cape Byron, New South Wales\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Surfers at Watego Beach near Cape Byron, New South Wales.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Coffee is a big deal in Byron.</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TopShopByronBay?rf=128929027176333\">Top Shop</a> cafe is on a corner block just off the main street; it’s a great spot to hang out on the grass in the sun.</p> \n<p><strong>I love the fashion side of surfing</strong>, the balance of sport and lifestyle. <a href=\"http://www.pompidou.com.au/shop/contact_us.php\">Pompidou</a> has great contemporary Australian brands, <a href=\"http://shop.spelldesigns.com/\">Spell </a>is a local designer with a style that is very “Byron bohemian”, and <a href=\"http://www.ahoytrader.com/\">Ahoy Trader</a> is perfect for house-styling pieces.</p> \n<p><strong>Every visitor should take a walk up to the lighthouse at Tallow beach</strong> to enjoy the view and watch the dolphins play in the ocean below.</p> \n<p><strong>Byron has a great music scene and hosts two of Australia’s best music festivals</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.bluesfest.com.au/\">Bluesfest </a>and <a href=\"https://www.splendourinthegrass.com/\">Splendour in the Grass</a>. We also have the <a href=\"http://www.fallsfestival.com.au/\">Falls Festival</a> – I play guitar and joined the band <a href=\"http://www.spiderbait.com.au/\">Spiderbait</a> on stage at the latter. A lot of big musicians hang out here – some have bought homes.

When there is no swell, paddle out around the headland or up the coast to Main Beach.</p> \n<p><strong>Of course, there’ll always be a few people who are way too aggressive</strong> but they obviously can’t see how lucky they are to be riding waves in the ocean for fun, so I try to steer clear of them. Having more girls in the line-up definitely brings a nice balance to the atmosphere.</p> \n<p><strong>The ArtPark Gallery is an awesome local Byron crew</strong> who put on great exhibitions.
