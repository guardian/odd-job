Coogan had two supporting cast members to cover costume changes and act with him in sketches. One was Simon Pegs or something but <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/mar/27/star-trek-3-to-veer-closer-to-spirit-of-original-tv-show-says-simon-pegg\">I haven’t heard of him since</a>. The other was Julia Davis, who went on to make some of my favourite comedies of all time. </p> \n<p> Davis is one of the rare few in British comedy who has never put a foot wrong. Take Human Remains, the series she created with Rob Brydon. They play a different couple in each episode, all inevitably burdened with some dark backstory or bizarre predilection; like the swingers with a comatose sister for a lodger or the Scottish-dancing religious couple convinced their neighbour’s garden has been influenced by Satan. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVAqWMGyqH0\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZVAqWMGyqH0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>What I found particularly inspiring was the way they wrote the series – spending hours facing a camera and improvising. They found things in improvisation that you would simply never achieve by sitting down and cranking out a script. It certainly influenced us when we were creating the characters for our series <a href=\"http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/almost_royal/videos/\">Almost Royal</a>. </p> \n<p>The characters Davis portrays are often utterly reprehensible and narcissistic – and in the case of Jill Tyrrell in Nighty Night an actual murderer. But in Nighty Night it’s not the darkness, but the gleeful silliness of her performance and writing that stands out. By throwing off the shackles of any need for Jill to be likable, Davis is free to take things so gloriously over the top and to such a grotesque level that you almost have no chance to make a moral judgment on what the character is doing.<br /></p> \n<p>Comeuppance is not something she is concerned with as a writer – a nasty person does vile things to nice people and regularly gets away with it. We have been trained as viewers to expect the bad guys to be punished or go through a process of redemption. But this is not what you get with Nighty Night. What is important is the offbeat, twisted and explosively funny way in which Davis handles the deeds themselves. Jill is a classic sitcom character – a chancer out to get what she can, albeit without the buffer of charm or empathy.<br /></p> \n<p> I would love to say that Davis has impacted my comedy in these ways. The truth is, though, the main way she has influenced me is by making shows so good that I would much rather watch them than write my own.<br /></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.edgamble.co.uk/\">Ed Gamble is at Canons’ Gait (PBH Free Fringe), Edinburgh, 8-30 August</a></li> \n</ul>","section":"Stage","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434469385699/bd625e42-56f6-445b-8700-ac97fbc6e17a-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"BBC/BBC","altText":"Julia Davis (Jill) in Nighty Night","cleanCredit":"Photograph: BBC/BBC"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-17T07:00:01Z","lastModified":"2015-06-17T07:00:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Comedy","Stage","Culture","Television","Julia Davis"],"tags":[{"id":"stage/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy"},{"id":"stage/stage","webTitle":"Stage"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/julia-davis","webTitle":"Julia Davis"}],"section":{"id":"stage"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"Comedy heroes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/stage/series/comedy-heroes"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"stage"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2015/jun/17/julia-davis-nighty-night-comedy-heroes","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49p2c","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/stage/2015/jun/17/julia-davis-nighty-night-comedy-heroes","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/17/julia-davis-nighty-night-comedy-heroes"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434469385699/bd625e42-56f6-445b-8700-ac97fbc6e17a-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Gloriously grotesque … Julia Davis in Nighty Night.

Constable was born there in 1776, and his earliest sketches include scenes of the house, garden and surrounding farmland – including the oldest drawing Roodhouse has traced, which shows an overgrown patch of weeds and brambles. “This place was the origin of my fame” Constable once wrote.</p> \n<p>In February 1815, Ann fell while weeding. Constable’s brother Abram wrote to him: “My mother was attack’d yesterday morning whilst in the garden with giddiness, brought on by the cold which was very severe and stooping to weed.” By the end of March she was dead, aged just 67. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fc41397e9124c40a25ca39fb3969bd1b32347bb0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434470939752/c41e82c5-f26f-4c13-b8b2-668631186062-373x420.jpeg\" alt=\"By 1816 he was dead ...

Instead he came for a long summer stay, but when he painted the gardens in July his father was ill. Golding died the following year. Soon afterwards, the family home was sold, and then demolished along with its gardens in 1839. The link was broken between Constable and <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/flatford/\">the landscape which had inspired many of his most famous paintings</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/upload/img/constable-hay-wain-NG1207-fm.jpg\">The Hay Wain</a>.</p> \n<p>Christchurch Mansion has owned the two garden paintings since 1955, and has the best Constable collection outside London. In 2013, along with the Tate and others, it launched a successful appeal to acquire one of his most spectacular paintings, Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows, which is also on display. Roodhouse has borrowed work from the Tate, the V&amp;A and the Fitzwilliam in Cambridge – including another shadowed garden belonging to Constable’s friend John Fisher in Salisbury.<br /></p> \n<p>Alongside these works, which offer us a glimpse into Constable’s childhood, is a rare example of the work of the artist as a juvenile delinquent – a carving of a windmill, which Constable gouged with a penknife into a piece of timber from his father’s mill.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://www.cimuseums.org.uk/Christchurch-Mansion\">Constable’s Gardens, Christchurch Mansion, Ipswich, until 6 September 2015</a></p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464581028/e5743a98-5cc9-4397-a1f4-16a8466839d4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Colchester and Ipswich Museum Service collection","altText":"Gathering pace … Golding Constable’s Flower Garden, August 1815.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Colchester and Ipswich Museum Service collection"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434470756109/df38d23d-23dd-428f-8ac3-d19181c4351c-2060x1334.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1334,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Overshadowed … Golding Constable’s Kitchen Garden, July 1815.

Just as I was spreading the jam on my toast, he made a confession with so much sadness it made me want to both slap him in the face and swaddle him up in my arms: he said he believed premarital sex is a sin. He was torn apart with self-hatred for not being able to reconcile his desire to live life for God and his inability to stop chasing the “pleasures of the flesh”. This was a surprise to me, as the bulk of our time together was focused on the flesh. Tears came to his eyes as he spoke of his guilt. Tears.</p> \n<p>I told myself not to take it personally – he’s just dealing with his own shit – but the question persisted: am I a person who doesn’t know how to experience sex the way the other person in the room does? A night that was hot to me was instantly regrettable to the other person – it was behaviour he was ashamed of. And that’s when it hit me: Tinder has turned me into a teenage boy.</p> \n<p>I am new to London, new to being single and, after my past two relationships with women, new to dating men. In the months since I turned 30 and left New York, my life has morphed into an off-brand episode of Sex and the City – one where there’s no budget for wardrobe and everyone is slightly fatter. I’ll go on a few dates with someone who seems great until they inevitably do or say something to relegate themselves to an anecdote. From now on, this man will be filed away in my memories as “the Closet Christian”. There. I did it: I quickly turned him into a cartoon to mask the fact that my feelings got hurt. Whew.</p> \n<p>Don’t get me wrong, I love <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/technology/tinder\">Tinder</a> – it’s the great equaliser of modern dating. There’s a straightforward, cards-on-the-table honesty and the tiniest bit of vulnerability to the fact that we’re all hanging out in this virtual meat market. I find it a purer medium than more traditional dating sites such as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/28/seven-secrets-of-dating-from-the-experts-at-okcupid\">OkCupid</a> or Match.com. A friend equated the latter to having your parents set you up on a date because, “You two have so much in common!” With Tinder, you can’t over-intellectualise it. It’s like being at a bar on your phone, whatever time of day you feel like it, with absolutely no risk of rejection.</p> \n<p>This method of seduction feels ideal to me, as I experience extreme anxiety when trying to maintain eye contact with strangers (which is apparently what you do to meet people in the real world). If I find someone attractive, I start scowling the moment our eyes meet. Being from New York, my subconscious still operates under the assumption that everyone has a “wouldn’t want to be part of a club that would have me as a member” mentality, and that showing interest upon first glance is a sign of weakness. On the flip side, when I find someone insufferable, I tend to smile broadly. I am in therapy.</p> \n<p>You’d think that these dates would be a complete crapshoot, but it’s surprisingly straightforward. Photo choice and presentation communicates a lot about a person – it has made me examine what I find attractive, and not just physically. Sometimes a guy catches my eye, but then I see he hasn’t written anything in his profile, so I dismiss him – because that is one of my boner-killers. For reference, here’s a list of my top 10 boner-killers – with the disclaimer that there are probably plenty of women who drop their knickers for this kind of stuff. I just don’t know any of them personally.</p> \n<p><strong>10.</strong> People who describe themselves as “normal” or a “good guy”.</p> \n<p><strong>9.</strong> Use of LOL.</p> \n<p><strong>8.</strong> Use of headshots/modelling photos.</p> \n<p><strong>7.</strong> Use of motivational quotes.</p> \n<p><strong>6.</strong> Photos at historic landmarks. (I get it. You’ve been on holiday.)</p> \n<p><strong>5.</strong> Only one photo/all selfies/all group shots.</p> \n<p><strong>4.</strong> Photo of your naked torso with the head cropped out.</p> \n<p><strong>3.</strong> Dude in bed, lying on his back, phone straight in the air above him – nobody looks hot from this angle. It is just too damn earnest.</p> \n<p><strong>2.</strong> Photo of you and a celebrity.</p> \n<p><strong>1.</strong> Being ugly. Just kidding.*</p> \n<p>In this virtual game, you get to pretend that every single person pictured is potentially up for it – but now what do <em>you</em> want? That’s a question I never used to ask myself. Before, whenever a person showed interest, the wheels in my head would start turning: “What are they looking for and how do I keep fooling them into thinking I’m attractive?”</p> \n<p>Here’s the problem: earlier, I said what was great about Tinder was the lack of risk. Not having to face my crippling social phobia and fear of rejection is the appealing factor here, but what if risk is the one thing that makes meeting someone special? Perhaps, by removing the risk, you bleed the experience of its most vital element and that’s why these encounters inevitably end up feeling disposable no matter how you approach them.</p> \n<p>When an uncomfortable encounter occurs in a romantic setting, it can be crushing and reminds you how easy it is to become vulnerable without a partner acting as your shield against the world. This vulnerability works in direct opposition to my newly developed teen-boy instincts. I’m going to move forward and try to keep an open mind, an open heart and slightly less-open legs (because you never know who’s saving it for marriage).</p> \n<p>*No, I’m not.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434378085350/Desiree-Akhavan-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Desiree Akhavan: 'And that’s when it hit me: Tinder has turned me into a teenage boy.'

It is “edifying and inspirational”, s/he wrote. And s/he is absolutely right.</p> \n<p>The book is as unusual as you might expect and hope for from Patricia Highsmith. An elegant creative writing guide, it’s also a goldmine for anyone hoping for insight into The Talented Mr Ripley – and its author.</p> \n<p>Highsmith points out in the book that The Talented Mr Ripley begins with an “almost but not quite incredible” coincidence. It’s quite some chance that the father of Dickie Greenleaf selects Tom Ripley, “a potential murderer”, to bring his son home.</p> \n<p>As soon as I read that I could see that it was all too true. What astonishing ill fortune that Greenleaf Snr should select a <em>sociopath</em> – who barely knows his son – as the person to help him. And that he should pay for that sociopath to go all the way to Italy from New York and live with his son. I want to write that it stretches credulity; and yet I have to admit that it didn’t stretch mine at all. Motoring through the pages, I accepted the coincidence as fine and natural; the story’s details are presented in such a reasonable, matter-of-fact way, and the reader zips along, happily snapped into a mantrap of narration.</p> \n<p>The book is full of direct and clear explanations of the mechanics of plotting and how best to use chance as a device. Such passages also demonstrate Highsmith’s magic – her power to compel you to read on and forget about how unlikely it all is. Although, if you’re hoping for tips about casting such spells yourself, Plotting and Writing A Suspense Thriller may sometimes make for depressing reading. Often, as much as providing a step-by-step guide, it demonstrates how impossible it is to walk in Highsmith’s shoes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It’s no more or less useful than Mike Tyson telling you that you need to move faster, dodge smarter and hit harder</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Sam Jordison</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>You might be able to follow her writing method of “mentally as well as physically sitting on the edge of my chair” while composing your thriller (done because Ripley is a young man on the edge of <em>his</em> chair - “if he is sitting down at all”). Good luck, however, if you want to create this kind of alchemy: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“By thinking myself inside the skin of [Ripley], my own prose became more self-assured than it logically should have been … No book was easier for me to write and I often had the feeling Ripley was writing it and I was merely typing.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Plenty of the rest of her advice is similarly hard to follow – unless, like Highsmith, you happen to be a major talent. “The setting and the people must be seen as clearly as a photograph,” she advises. Well, yes. She also notes that a writer “should sense when something is wrong, as quickly as a mechanic hears a wrong noise in an engine, and he should correct it before it becomes worse”. That’s true, and irrefutably good advice. But it’s no more or less useful than Mike Tyson telling you that you need to move faster, dodge smarter and hit harder. It might work for him…</p> \n<p>In spite of her modest tone, much of this book reads like a showcase of a master magician’s tricks. But it’s worth reading for other reasons, not least its delightful idiosyncrasy. “I cannot think of anything worse or more dangerous than to discuss my work with another writer,” says Highsmith. Doing so seems to be one of the peculiar enjoyments of the French, she explains. </p> \n<p>Elsewhere, she writes: “I create things out of boredom with reality and with the sameness of routine and objects around me.” That’s some insight into the languid minds of so many of her characters - and the way she flings them to far flung places and strange situations. Also, into how detached she could be. How many people here suffer from reality boredom?</p> \n<p>Another moment of telling self-revelation comes when (and no surprises here if you’ve been following this month’s Reading group) she says that she doesn’t enjoy letting justice catch up with her criminals. She “rather” likes them and finds them “extremely interesting, unless they are monotonously and stupidly brutal”.</p> \n<p>But please don’t get the impression that Highsmith is as amoral as her subjects. One page later she points out how strange it is that the public likes to see the law triumph – but has no issue with brutality. “Sleuth-heroes” can beat women, be brutal and sexually unscrupulous, but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u72uhY6sS0g\">the public will still cheer them on</a> because they are chasing “something worse than themselves, presumably”.</p> \n<p>The impression you get of Highsmith is of a complicated, roving intelligence: clear-sighted, determined and not at all concerned with trying to live a conventional life. The book is correspondingly eccentric. Yet while it doesn’t have the usual sets of rules, suggestions and markers you might expect from a creative writing handbook, by the end you realise that this is a singularly useful volume. There’s hard practical advice here from someone who has a fine understanding of plotting, motivation, <a href=\"http://www.sfwriter.com/ow04.htm\">what to “show</a>” and not tell, how to keep things moving forward and how and where to place a climax.</p> \n<p>There is further gold on what she terms “thickening” the plot – adding complications to ensure that things remain interesting. (Examples from The Talented Mr Ripley would be the unexpected arrival of Freddie Miles in Tom/Dickie’s flat in Rome, and Dickie’s father’s decision to hire a detective late on in the novel.) She also cuts through the complications surrounding point of view. Don’t dwell on the question, says Highsmith: just think about <a href=\"http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/proc/files/74p071.pdf\">whose eyes the story is looking through</a>, and whether the story would be better told from someone else’s point of view. She notes that keeping the focus on Ripley, for instance, increases intensity. Possibly that’s another pep-talk from the Mike Tyson boxing school – but it points to her broader ideal of avoiding complications and just trying to do the practical thing.</p> \n<p>And in case you are still worried that this is a book that will work only for the unusually talented, Highsmith is also tremendously reassuring about her own struggles and unfinished projects. Not to mention financial concerns, even deep into a successful career: “The eternal maneuverings one has to perform in order to exist on an irregular and often inadequate income … the insecurity that is the very air writers breathe.”</p> \n<p>She’s possibly at her best when discussing failure. She talks about several projects of her own that she hasn’t finished - books where she became too involved with small irrelevant details, plots that didn’t work out, books that didn’t sell. In fact, she explains neatly why there’s no such thing as failure in writing, just the accumulation of experience. “A writer should not think he is bad or finished [if a book fails to get to market] … Every failure teaches something. You should have the feeling, as every experienced writer has, that there are more ideas where that one came from, more strength where the first strength came from, and that you are inexhaustible as long as you are alive.”</p> \n<p>Keep going, in other words. </p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434467573806/b75d1a17-0ab4-4815-9882-f4e9fdb77c62-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ulf Andersen/Getty Images","altText":"Patricia Highsmith poses at home in Locarno,Switzerland in 1987.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ulf Andersen/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T16:19:02Z","lastModified":"2015-06-16T16:21:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":11,"contributors":[{"name":"Sam Jordison","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/samjordison"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Patricia Highsmith","Books","Crime fiction","Culture","Fiction","Creative writing"],"tags":[{"id":"books/highsmith-patricia","webTitle":"Patricia Highsmith"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"books/crime","webTitle":"Crime fiction"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction"},{"id":"books/creative-writing","webTitle":"Creative writing"}],"section":{"id":"books"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sam Jordison","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/samjordison"}}],"series":{"title":"Reading group","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/series/reading-group"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"books"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/booksblog/2015/jun/16/creative-writing-lessons-from-patricia-highsmith","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49zm4","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/books/booksblog/2015/jun/16/creative-writing-lessons-from-patricia-highsmith","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jun/16/creative-writing-lessons-from-patricia-highsmith"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434467573806/b75d1a17-0ab4-4815-9882-f4e9fdb77c62-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Criminal mastermind ...
