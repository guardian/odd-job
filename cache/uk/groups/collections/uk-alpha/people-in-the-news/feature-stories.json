There are some great songs, sure: the instrumental title track, and Martha, which could be a Neil Diamond tune performed by Willie Nelson, as well as Ol ’55 – covered by Asylum labelmates the Eagles – about whom Waits was publicly sniffy, biting the hand that fed him. The strength of the San Diego troubadour’s songs was never in question, but as an artist lacking identity, he was considered two-a-penny among a myriad of folksy singer/songwriters competing for the public’s affections. By the time he released The Heart of Saturday Night in 1974, he’d forged a clearer direction, as demonstrated by the cloth cap and loose tie worn with dilapidated swagger on the cover – a style contrary to the longhaired, bell-bottomed country rockers fashionable at the time. (Looking For) The Heart of Saturday Night is set from the woozy perspective of the wide-eyed fledgling drinker, a loving ode to Saturday nights on the lash. Over the course of 16 studio albums, Waits would chart the doomed romanticism of the maudlin drunk, as well as documenting his ever-changing relationship with the bottle himself, in varying states of inebriation (The Piano Has Been Drinking is a wonderful example). This track perfectly traces the build-up to the hour of power, identifies the transient moment one has worked all week for and finished off with the “magic of the melancholy tear in your eye”. It’s sentimental and immediately nostalgic for the only day of the week that apparently matters, which implicitly adds to the sense of pathos.</p> \n<h2>2 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkOMiA_uGso\">Tom Traubert’s Blues (Four Sheets to the Wind in Copenhagen)</a></h2> \n<p>Broadly speaking, Waits’s career is categorised as falling into two stark phases: before Swordfishtrombones and after Swordfishtrombones. Yet, the truth, as ever, is more complex, and the trajectory of his artistic development is a far more nuanced journey than the Road to Damascus epiphany of conventional wisdom. For instance, what a game changer the opener on Small Change must have been when people first heard it in 1976, with the now familiar gadabout narrator emerging fully frazzled and fabulously furry around the edges. Tom Traubert’s Blues is a dauntless display of bravura, a songwriter in complete control, showing off his plumage. Many have commented on the seismic shift undertaken when Waits left Asylum for Island Records later down the line, but the barfly in our midst in 1976 was a world away from the folk-inflected pupa two albums earlier. The thirsty man motif continues unabated here, with a string section to melt even the coldest heart. It has an international flavour, too; bastardising the de facto Australian national anthem in the chorus, it was written in London and recounts an intoxicated crawl around the Danish capital with a girl called Matilda. Tom Traubert’s Blues has attained cult-classic status and may well be his best-loved song. Tom Waits had found his voice, and that voice would be seriously growly from now on.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZmqbcBsTAw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ZmqbcBsTAw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Tom Waits – Tom Traubert’s Blues\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>3 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByomIJf5n9w\">Step Right Up</a></h2> \n<p>Like a scenario from the pages of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/497199.Factotum\">Bukowski’s Factotum</a>, at the end of the 1960s Tom Waits was living out of his car and working on the door of an LA nightclub called The Heritage. There, he was able to bide his time, reading endless Kerouac and scribbling down the jive-ass phraseology of characters frequenting the nightspot, charged up on endless coffee and cigarettes. “I was sitting there incognito in the inner sanctum of this club – hobnobbing, doing some low-level social climbing,” he said later. Waits had taken the job because he intended to eventually play there himself, which he did, giving himself valuable stage time to hone his craft. His love of the Beats and his meticulous note-taking came together to devastating effect on 1976’s Step Right Up, where he spits a series of skittering slogans and one-liners over a roving jazz bassline, selling an unspecified product with pitches from the sublime (“It mows your lawn and it picks up the kids from school / It gets rid of unwanted facial hair”) to the ridiculous (“Change your life / Change into a nine-year-old Hindu boy, get rid of your wife”). Step Right Up is a hilariously badass proto-rap classic that alludes to the singer’s cynicism towards advertising. This antipathy was obviously lost on the agency working for crisp manufacturer <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.fritolay.com/snacks\">Frito Lay</a>, whose advert used an approximation of the song that was so convincing even Waits thought the person singing it was himself. After a protracted legal battle, the courts ruled his voice was his own property. </p> \n<h2>4 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STXF9PZkjSQ\">Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis</a></h2> \n<p>The plinky playfulness and positive chord progression at the outset of Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis instantly calls to mind the heartwarming energy of Ray Charles’s Georgia on My Mind, though once both songs get underway, the only thing they really share in common are titular US place names 1,000 miles apart. The content of the song is fairly self-explanatory; Waits sings verbatim the imaginary epistle a prostitute writes to the fictional character Charlie about her attempts to make a go of it with a trombonist “who works out at the track” in a new metropolis. She’s clean, sober and pregnant, according to the letter. This hooker with a heart of gold narrative is certainly less patronising than most, a darkly funny scenario that also stirs in us a sense of pity. There’s a twist in the tale, naturally, from one of music’s great raconteurs. The song might have Christmas in the title, but it’s no Christmas song, though full of humour and humanity, it’s the gift that keeps on giving. </p> \n<h2>5 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C49H3aWdiK8\">Heartattack and Vine</a></h2> \n<p>His wife Kathleen Brennan once said Waits’s songs fall into two categories, “grim reapers” and “grand weepers”, while the man himself whittled it down to three categories when he released his album Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers &amp; Bastards in 2006. If we’ve had mostly bawlers so far, then Heartattack and Vine (from the 1980 album of the same name) is probably a brawler, and a bit of a bastard, too. Waits’s bluesy Way Down in the Hole introduced him to a wider audience when it was used as the theme to The Wire in 2002, as Heartattack and Vine had when Levis used Screamin’ Jay Hawkins’ version for a campaign nine years earlier. The singer had no objections to the cop show; he did, however, take umbrage with Levis, forcing the brand to make a grovelling apology in Billboard magazine after he took them through the European courts. Car manufacturers Audi in Spain and Opel in Scandinavia have also found themselves embroiled in costly litigation over the use of his music. “Songs carry emotional information and some transport us back to a poignant time, place or event in our lives,” he said after the aforementioned Frito Lay judgement. “It’s no wonder a corporation would want to hitch a ride on the spell these songs cast and encourage you to buy soft drinks, underwear or automobiles while you’re in the trance.” After the Opel judgement, he likened adverts carrying his songs to having an udder sewn to his face. It’s “painful and humiliating”, he said. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tom Waits\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:5uWrTOdXwm4ryzgilEASxg\" width=\"460\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Tom Waits – 10 of the best\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>6 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovv0xmgrM_o\">Johnsburg, Illinois</a></h2> \n<p>If Swordfishtrombones is meant to be some kind of artistic year zero, then the love song Johnsburg, Illinois – named after Brennan’s hometown – is a throwback to the tipsy ivory tinkler of yore. Elsewhere, brutal blues bangers such as 16 Shells From a Thirty-Ought-Six stomp harder than ever before, while noirish tales about Bloody Marys and chihuahuas (Frank’s Wild Years) and the cuban funk of the title track, demonstrate Dadaist/Beefheart experimentation and unfettered eclecticism. Johnsburg, Illinois has no intention of reinventing the wheel, however, and what a treat it is, one so tantalisingly short that you want to put it on again and again. “She’s my only true love / She’s all that I think of,” sings Tom sweetly, “look here in my wallet, that’s her.” While the lyric of the song suggests he wanted to show off his new wife to all and sundry, the pair, in reality, have maintained an intensely private relationship away from the media, only adding to their mystique. </p> \n<h2>7 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTlkVTwMLFs\">Rain Dogs</a></h2> \n<p>The critical reception accorded to Swordfishtrombones included much profound astonishment, and Waits’s songwriting peers sitting up and taking notice, too. Elvis Costello told Patrick Humphries in his book The Many Lives of Tom Waits, “I think I was envious [of] his ability to rewrite himself out of the corner he’d appeared to have backed himself into.” If Swordfishtrombones had been audacious, then Rain Dogs was more creatively ingenious still, and probably carries more classics per pound than any other Waits record: Cemetery Polka, Hang Down Your Head, Time, Downtown Train, Singapore … every one’s a classic. Best of all, perhaps, is the title track, inspired by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtwv9h5CSKE\">Martin Bell’s Streetwise</a>, a documentary about nine homeless youngsters in Seattle to which Waits had contributed music. Commencing with a Gallic accordion flourish, it tangos along with the pinched staccato guitar notes of longtime collaborator Marc Ribot, perhaps best exemplifying that Waitsian sound. If you’re curious to know what Waitsian actually means, then the Collins dictionary defines it as: “hoarse, gravelly vocals, discordant sounds, and the use of unusual instruments”. Rain Dogs is also catchy as hell, in a stealthy kind of a way. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc990c23ffd8ae741a6e7b6585d3fbc42b9d1af3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433948754674/70d19962-8855-472e-9902-d469751f636f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tom Waits\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hail hail … Tom Waits on stage in 2004.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MARKUS SCHREIBER/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>8 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-iENCZKFzk\">What’s He Building?</a></h2> \n<p>Once in a while, Waits throws up a peculiar, avant garde spoken-word track laced with ambient noises, field-recorded sounds and creepy backing, such as The Ocean Doesn’t Want Me on Bone Machine. Perhaps the most effective of those is What’s He Building? from Mule Variations. “What’s he building in there?” Waits keeps asking, his curtain twitching, his conjecture becoming ever more preposterous as the backing frequencies oscillate, the static becoming yet more deranged. “He never waves as he goes by,” he sneers, “he’s hiding something from the rest of us …” The instruments clatter and the tools continue to clink. “I tell you one thing … he’s not building a playhouse for the children.” The track beautifully captures the suburban paranoia of middle America, and while it was intended to be largely comical on its release in 1999, it has come to seem more sinister as surveillance has become more pervasive post-9/11. “We seem to be compelled to perceive our neighbours through the keyhole,” Waits told the writer Barney Hoskyns. “He has chickens in the backyard and doesn’t get home til 3am, and he says he’s from Florida but the license plate says Indiana … so, you know, I don’t trust him”. </p> \n<h2>9 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw3mFXOwRgw\">Hoist That Rag</a></h2> \n<p>Where Bone Machine and Mule Variations explored the American blues, Real Gone was the album where Tom Waits truly embraced hip-hop and beatboxing, with his hacking rhythms apparently recorded in the great man’s own bathroom. Best on that album is Hoist That Rag, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2004/oct/01/popandrock.shopping9\">described by Alexis Petridis in the Guardian</a> as a “sort of Afrobeat Sea Shanty”, which also featured one of Marc Ribot’s most quietly effective sliding hooks in years. There’s a beautiful simplicity to the song, with the heart only skipping a little faster when Waits delivers the title of the song with a throat-clearing roar. Each repetition of that phrase is a purging act of release. In Hoist That Rag, he seems to attack flat-earthers, and war is never far from his lips, either, while it wouldn’t take too much of a stretch to imagine the rag in question might be the American flag. Suddenly, in 2004, he was becoming more bellicose, more lyrically direct and more overtly political, too. </p> \n<h2>10 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fju9o8BVJ8\">Hell Broke Luce </a></h2> \n<p>You suspect that after he quit drinking in the mid-80s, the Tom Waits caricature became ever more grotesque, a kind of inverse and publicly decaying Dorian Gray, while the contented family man got to bring up his children and continue romancing his wife. The repartee, the tall tales and the sophistry are all surely to deflect attention from the person behind this carnival of madness. Cracks began to appear in the fa&ccedil;ade when Waits was unable to contain his temper over the Iraq war. Where lyrically he had often been deliberately obtuse, the ongoing conflict saw him pen an unofficial triumvirate of protest songs – Day After Tomorrow on Real Gone, Road to Peace on Orphans … and, finally, Hell Broke Luce on Bad As Me. All three were unusually to the point and angry. Hell Broke Luce is the noisiest of the bunch, evoking the feeling of being at war, where you can smell the morning napalm and you want to take cover from the falling bombs and the deafening yell of the NCOs. Aside from the lung-busting menace of Hell Broke Luce, Waits had settled into a familiar groove by 2011’s Bad As Me, though the furrow he’d ploughed to get to that place had been anything but conventional. Working in an industry that until recently was obsessed with youth, Waits is one of those rare artists who is improved the more wizened he becomes, and the more he resembles an old baseball glove. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fju9o8BVJ8\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Fju9o8BVJ8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Tom Waits – Hell Broke Luce\n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433948970144/c1ae31c7-fc29-4064-baf4-0789e68f6be4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Robert Yager for the Guardian","altText":"Tom Waits","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Robert Yager for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433948755189/70d19962-8855-472e-9902-d469751f636f-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Hail hail … Tom Waits on stage in 2004.

She came to stand as an icon for Britain’s entire culinary adventure since the second world war.</p> \n<p>Early in her career she worked as a wartime home economist for the Ministry of Food, cooking an infinite variety of dishes to tease out new ways with brown flour, imaginative uses of dried egg, or tasty treats with scrag-end. From 1944 she appeared on the BBC’s early-morning radio programme Kitchen Front and regularly on Woman’s Hour. This apprenticeship was a prelude to live demonstrations on television when she took over the cookery for a magazine programme, Designed for Women, broadcast from 1947. These postwar years also saw the beginnings of a prolific career in journalism.</p> \n<p>Marguerite, along with <a href=\"http://www.cooksinfo.com/philip-harben\">Philip Harben</a> and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-fanny-cradock-1388721.html\">Fanny</a> and Johnnie Cradock, became one of the celebrity chefs of her day (though Marguerite was careful always to call herself a cook). As well as television appearances, there were large-scale demonstrations across Britain, which took on a surreal character as the 50s wore on. A flour manufacturer, Frenlite, saw possibilities in combining variety acts and cookery and Marguerite was soon baking sponges and whisking meringue to the musical accompaniment of Geraldo and his Show Band, the wisecracks of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/2005/jan/03/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\">Cyril Fletcher</a>, and the warbled tunes of the husband-and-wife act Pearl Carr and Teddy Johnson. Her apogee was to appear at the London Palladium – the Cradocks, meanwhile, were packing the Royal Albert Hall.</p> \n<p>But Marguerite was a writer more than a performer (although her memorable 1999 Radio 4 series on the cookery of the 20th century fixed her queen-motherly tones in many a brain), and her writing career was transformed by her association with the publisher <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/2001/sep/03/guardianobituaries.politics\">Paul Hamlyn</a>. He conceived an inexpensive book filled with large colour photographs to illustrate the recipes. The resulting Cookery in Colour (1960) changed everything, with sales of 2 million.</p> \n<p>Marguerite’s success was cemented by a series of mass-market books of 500 recipes – of sweet dishes, hors d’oeuvres, meat courses and so forth. These must have entered the kitchens of every modern home during this expansive and socially mobile decade. Marguerite explained and simplified for the insecure and the novice: another great success was Classic Dishes Made Simple (1969). She also introduced them to new foods, from pimentos to lemongrass (though rarely pursuing exhausting authenticity).</p> \n<p>In later years, her contribution was also valued for the memory and the sheer length of her career. Books building on her experience of wartime cookery, including We’ll Eat Again (1985), the winning Spam: The Cookbook (2000), her larger Marguerite Patten’s Century of British Cooking (1999), Coronation Cookbook (2002) and Feeding the Nation (2005), brought her many new admirers.</p> \n<p>The sweetness of her nature, the energy she displayed throughout her life, and the efficiency of her planning and performance of cookery demonstrations, left younger colleagues and competitors standing. Though some curled their modern lips at the style, she was a force for good.</p> \n<p>She was born in Bath, the eldest of three children of Wallace Brown, a printer, and his wife, Elsie, a schoolteacher, but Marguerite was not very old when the family moved to the north London suburb of Barnet, where her father had bought a printing business. His sudden death in 1927 left the three children dependent on their mother’s earnings and with few illusions about an early entry into the world of work – although winning a scholarship permitted Marguerite to stay on at Queen Elizabeth’s grammar school, Barnet, into the sixth form.</p> \n<p>Although her brother became a merchant mariner, and her sister a teacher, Marguerite was resolute that her own talent for instruction should not be confined to the schoolroom. She dreamed of a stage career, but the boards she trod at first proved to be those of the North Metropolitan Electric Power Supply Company, where she was asked to demonstrate the virtues of an electric kitchen to women hitherto chained to coal-burning ranges or monstrous gas stoves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naoW1io23Vs\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/naoW1io23Vs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Marguerite Patten’s 10-minute Christmas pudding\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This was in 1933 and her first job offered a double dividend: sound training in domestic science and confirmation of her love of performance. Marguerite’s mother was broad-minded enough to allow her to build on outings as an amateur actor at the Little theatre in Bath and the Hampstead Everyman, and undertake a season of repertory in Oldham in 1937. Her producer was Arthur Leslie, eventually better known for playing Jack Walker, landlord of the Rover’s Return in Coronation Street.</p> \n<p>Noises of war offstage would always have brought this happy experiment to an end, but it was the lure of Frigidaire (an American company seeking to establish itself in Britain) during her first season of “resting” that, in fact, pulled her back into steady employment, demonstrating domestic science and education in the broadest sense. She became a missionary of “cold cookery”, with salads (viewed with horror by most British people), mousses, moulds and frozen creams her gospel. So unfamiliar were the British with the idea of refrigeration that many in her audiences had to be persuaded not to turn off their machines during the winter months.</p> \n<p>By now she was a seasoned demonstrator with much practical experience, of great utility once war became inevitable. In 1939 she moved to Yorkshire, and then to Lincoln, as home economist for the local electricity company, working in the evenings in the ARP (Air Raid Precautions) canteen, developing and teaching dishes to cope with wartime shortages. In Lincoln, she met Bob Patten, a gunnery officer with Bomber Command, whom she married in 1942.</p> \n<p>Not long afterwards she transferred to the Ministry of Food and took on demonstrating and educational work in East Anglia, which might involve, for example, polishing off a few rissoles and inspirational cakes and biscuits from a makeshift stall in small-town markets. It was pregnancy and motherhood that brought her back to London, where she based herself at the family home in Barnet, while her husband was away on foreign postings.</p> \n<p>She was the ideal candidate to run the advice bureau maintained by the ministry in Harrods department store. Her audience no longer consisted of farmers’ wives, but included perhaps embassy staff or dowagers from Eaton Square – for the first time bereft of all maids and cooks-general – who had never before so much as touched a frying pan. Marguerite found the work absorbing and she stayed with it long after the war, while food rationing persisted. Her earliest books, indeed, were written for Harrods between 1947 and 1950.</p> \n<p>When her husband was demobbed from the RAF, he moved to Brighton to work once more as a greengrocer. Marguerite did not follow him to the coast until after her mother had died at the end of the 1940s, when they set up home in Hove, first running a guesthouse (losing money and sleep in the process), then building a large house to their own designs. Although Marguerite’s daily demonstrations at Harrods ended with the move, her public appearances and writing did not.</p> \n<p>She received many lifetime achievement awards, including Woman of the Year in 2007, and was the subject of This Is Your Life in 2000 and Desert Island Discs in 2001. She was appointed OBE in 1991 and CBE in 2010.</p> \n<p>Bob died in 1997, and Marguerite was predeceased by her two grandchildren. She is survived by her daughter, Judith, a great-grandson, Luke, and her sister, Elizabeth.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Hilda Elsie Marguerite Patten, cookery writer and broadcaster, born 4 November 1915; died 4 June 2015</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/01c596ac17181031c43a18e32844af295e9b2c32/0_31_1325_795/1325.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":795,"width":1325,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"ANL/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Marguerite Patten worked as a wartime home economist for the Ministry of Food early in her career.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: ANL/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-10T16:19:05Z","lastModified":"2015-06-10T23:00:41Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":12,"contributors":[{"name":"Tom Jaine","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/tom-jaine"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Food and drink","Books","Food & drink","Life and style","Food TV","Television"],"tags":[{"id":"books/food","webTitle":"Food and drink"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/food-tv","webTitle":"Food TV"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"}],"section":{"id":"books"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tom Jaine","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/tom-jaine"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"books"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jun/10/marguerite-patten","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49kye","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/books/2015/jun/10/marguerite-patten","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/10/marguerite-patten"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/01c596ac17181031c43a18e32844af295e9b2c32/0_31_1325_795/1325.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":795,"width":1325,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Marguerite Patten worked as a wartime home economist for the Ministry of Food early in her career.

He inspired both devotion and loathing among pop music fans, thanks to his unique ability to transform music of almost any form into his own style of easy listening.</p> \n<p>A James Last concert would include anything from light classical and jazz favourites through to ballads, polkas, waltzes, a James Bond theme or pop numbers by anyone from the Beatles or <a href=\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=\" 46&amp;v=\"gF2ODWluPlY&quot;&quot;\" title=\"\">Hawkwind</a> to Marvin Gaye, all blended together into a seamless, jaunty fusion. It was a formula that led him to be derided as the Emperor of Elevator Music, but won him sales of over 100m albums around the world. He was awarded so many gold and platinum albums that his record company admits that it lost count.</p> \n<p>Devotees of Last’s music point to his skill in incorporating contemporary trends into his music (his repertoire even included a piece entitled Hip Hop Polka 2), and the way in which he made use of audience participation and response during his shows. With a band that included a 16-piece string section, nine-piece brass section and six-member choir, the so-called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S7HyLcpnCc\" title=\"\">Gentleman of Music</a> tried to transform his concerts into a good-natured party, for which he, as conductor, provided the slick, cheerful and upbeat soundtrack.</p> \n<p>Those who were less impressed with Last’s easygoing, jovial approach complained bitterly that he made music of all types sound exactly the same. One self-styled James Last Hater even posted a page on the internet explaining how his loathing of Last had inspired him to become a punk back in the 1970s and how he then feared that Last might record the “Non Stop Punk Party Album”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWAbnF_7eO8\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWAbnF_7eO8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The James Last Orchestra at the BBC, 1976\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He was born Hans in Bremen, Germany, the youngest of three sons of Louis Last, a post-office worker, and his wife, Martha.

He had started out playing classical music, but became an avid listener to dance styles and the jazz that he heard while playing bass on the circuit of clubs for American servicemen that sprang up in Germany after the second world war.</p> \n<p>In 1948 he formed the six-piece Last-Becker Ensemble, which included his two brothers, Robert and Werner, who had been highly influential in persuading him to become a professional musician. Within two years he was voted the best jazz bassist in Germany, an award that he won again in 1951 and 52.</p> \n<p>After the group split up in 1956, Last moved on to join the North German Radio Dance Orchestra in Hamburg, and began writing his first arrangements for the orchestra, and for musicians including Caterina Valente and Helmut Zacharius. He explained his approach by saying “you have to recognise your limits and live within them. I recognised early enough that I was no Beethoven, so I do what I can, and that as good as possible.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODQ5kQ4qzgg\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ODQ5kQ4qzgg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Abba medley from James Last’s String of Hits, 2011\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In 1964, he put together his own orchestra, and the following year demonstrated his highly commercial musical formula with his album <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqYlHgbM7Lw\" title=\"\">Non Stop Dancing</a>. This was original both in the way that it was “non-stop”, in the sense that there was a segueing of the tunes, with no breaks, and in the way he used a live party atmosphere (the idea apparently borrowed from listening to concerts on Radio Copenhagen that included the background sound of tinkling glasses and talking).</p> \n<p>Apart from his bravery in sticking with a large, expensive orchestra at a time when pop music was fast becoming dominated by far smaller rock bands, Last also proved astute in the range of the music he covered. He made sure that he always reflected the sounds of new performers somewhere in the set (even if those performers may not have liked what he did to their work). “When I started, the Beatles were being condemned by many of my fellow artists, but I realised very early on that you must rely on the new moods in society. New things matter. Living this way I stayed young forever”.</p> \n<p>A massively prolific artist, “Mr Happy Sound” recorded 52 hit albums between 1967 and 1986, and was credited with achieving sales surpassed only by Elvis Presley. He achieved his first British success in 1967 with the album This Is James Last, which remained in the bestsellers for an astonishing 48 weeks.</p> \n<p>Though Last was a hard-working musician, he tried to make his life as easygoing as his music. He and his wife Waltraud (nee Wiese), whom he married in 1955, moved to Florida, where he could play golf and invite his musicians to join him at the James Last Sunshine Club. In the US he could also escape from the German press, who, in the early days at least, were never too enthusiastic about his success. “As a German”, he complained, “you are nobody within your own border.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S7HyLcpnCc\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3S7HyLcpnCc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  James Last, Gentleman of Music, 2001\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Even that changed in the 90s, when Last was delighted to find that the pop fashion for easy listening had made him something of a cult hero – with some of his audience 40 years or more younger than himself. “Those who just listen to stuff like techno maybe get fed up with it and want to hear something else, which starts and ends with a melody.” At the time he was recording an album of pieces by Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov, and commented: “I’m proud of my age. I’ll never have to fill in a crossword. I can always read the old sheet music”.</p> \n<p>In his later years, he continued to release albums, including Eighty Not Out, Music Is My World and My Personal Favourites, a double set released last year. And he continued touring, retaining a large fan base in Europe with his “happy music”. In the UK, he made regular appearances at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g79uoipZyso\" title=\"\">Royal Albert Hall</a>, London, where he gave a remarkable 90 concerts during his career, more than any other performer.</p> \n<p>The final two came on 31 March and 1 April this year, as part of a “farewell tour”, much of it in Germany, that he had announced after falling ill last year. Last said at the time “the concerts will mark the end of this chapter in my life. The main thing is that my fans have the best concerts of their lives and we will make this our ‘happiest’ concert yet.”</p> \n<p>Two years after Waltraud’s death in 1997, Last married Christine Grundner. She survives him, as do his daughter, Caterina, and son, Ronald, from his first marriage.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> James (Hans) Last, bandleader, born 17 April 1929; died 9 June 2015</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433947697895/1c9fec4f-baec-402f-a88b-85d7c80bd3e2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dorothee Falke/Allstar","altText":"James Last in concert in Munich in 2013.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dorothee Falke/Allstar"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-10T16:00:39Z","lastModified":"2015-06-10T23:00:41Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":8,"contributors":[{"name":"Robin Denselow","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/robindenselow"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Music","Pop and rock","Germany","Florida","US news"],"tags":[{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock"},{"id":"world/germany","webTitle":"Germany"},{"id":"us-news/florida","webTitle":"Florida"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Robin Denselow","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/robindenselow"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/10/james-last","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49kj5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jun/10/james-last","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/10/james-last"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433947697895/1c9fec4f-baec-402f-a88b-85d7c80bd3e2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"James Last in concert in Munich in 2013.

The song from the Goon Show was allegedly sung by journalists when they hacked his voicemail.</p> \n<p>A lawyer for Yentob, who is not believed to have been the subject of any stories written as a result of the phone hacking, said his client would benefit psychologically from the information he sought.</p> \n<p>Yentob was present at the Royal Courts of Justice in London for the hearing.</p> \n<p>Last month Mr Justice Mann awarded damages totalling &pound;1.2m to eight people whose phones were hacked by Mirror Group journalists writing celebrity stories.</p> \n<p>The scale of the award reflected invasions of privacy being “so serious and so prolonged”, he said.</p> \n<p>The actor Sadie Frost was awarded &pound;260,250 while the former footballer Paul Gascoigne was awarded &pound;188,250. MGM is set to launch an appeal against the payouts on Wednesday afternoon.</p> \n<p>Before the application, Jeremy Reed, who is representing all the claimants, asked for further disclosure in relation to Yentob. He argued that such disclosure was “reasonable and proportionate”.</p> \n<p>The barrister told the court that Yentob had searched but had not found any stories about himself. He would, however, be surprised if some had not been written as a result of hacking.</p> \n<p> Reed said the additional information would be “psychologically useful” to his client. “There is a difference between simply knowing that your phone has been hacked … and then the next stage, seeing particular journalists doing it, and then the next stage is even more – to know what those journalists were doing with it.”</p> \n<p> He said his client wanted to know if there were “more nasties lurking in MGN’s system”.</p> \n<p> Lord Pannick QC, for MGN, said the request was disproportionate, “speculative in the extreme” and would cost &pound;25,000. It was unlikely to yield information useful to Yentob, he said.</p> \n<p>The judge said he had considered whether the request for relief was proportionate and practical, and concluded that it was not. </p> \n<p> He said: “The question is what legitimate objective would such disclosure achieve? It simply does not come within any reasonable distance at all of achieving what would be a reasonable objective to a post-trial disclosure exercise. Finding another dozen documents would not put Mr Yentob in any better practical or psychological position than he is now.”</p> \n<p>He noted that previous disclosure of documents by MGM in relation to key journalists and their emails yielded only two emails.</p> \n<p> MGN previously admitted misuse of private information in respect of all eight but contested the size of the awards.</p> \n<p>MGN will formally ask for permission to appeal later, as well as a stay on damages payments until any such appeal is resolved.</p> \n<p>The hearing continues.</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/24fda650a9e0cc7651710601669d7355522e212e/0_0_2249_1349/2249.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1349,"width":2249,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Anthony Devlin/PA","altText":"Alan Yentob","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-10T14:53:14Z","lastModified":"2015-06-10T15:15:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Karen McVeigh","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/karenmcveigh"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Karen McVeigh","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/karenmcveigh"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/10/judge-rejects-alan-yentob-bid-for-trawl-of-mirror-group-emails","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49kg4","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jun/10/judge-rejects-alan-yentob-bid-for-trawl-of-mirror-group-emails","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/10/judge-rejects-alan-yentob-bid-for-trawl-of-mirror-group-emails"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/24fda650a9e0cc7651710601669d7355522e212e/0_0_2249_1349/2249.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1349,"width":2249,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alan Yentob has said he felt violated on a ‘truly massive scale’ by the hacking.
