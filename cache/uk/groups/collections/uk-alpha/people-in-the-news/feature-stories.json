Having become the House of Commons representative of the lucky residents of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Johnson is required by law to lose two thirds of his mayoral salary. Neither is there any issue with his being London mayor and an MP at the same time. It is perfectly legal and Johnson has precedent on his side: Ken Livingstone was an MP when he become the first holder of the City Hall post in May 2000 and he <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_East_(UK_Parliament_constituency)\">remained one</a> until the general election of the following June. Also, if prime ministers can <a href=\"http://www.witneyconservatives.com/\">simultaneously be MPs</a>, why can’t London mayors?<br /></p> \n<p>Johnson has been receiving around &pound;142,000 a year as the capital’s political leader. This is actually less than the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/mayor-assembly/gla/spending-money-wisely/salaries-and-expenses/gla-elected-members-remuneration\">&pound;144,000 he’s entitled to</a> as he’s declined to accept annual pay rises during his second term. For the final year of that term, which ends in May 2016, Johnson will therefore get just over &pound;47,000. His salary as an MP is &pound;67,000, making a total of around &pound;114,000 a year. In other words, holding down his two jobs as a politician means Johnson is to be about 28 grand a year worse off. </p> \n<p>Also, he won’t be getting paid for <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-parachuted-into-camerons-political-cabinet-10240673.html\">being a member of David Cameron’s “political cabinet”</a>, a role that City Hall says will take up about two hours of his time every second Tuesday (and is not to be confused with being a cabinet minister, as some on social media are doing). Meetings of this group will either follow or precede government cabinet meetings and be attended by Cameron and various Tory party top brass. Johnson will get over all that, though. The mayor will still be cranking out his &pound;250,000 a year Telegraph column, so don’t expect to see him queuing for lentils at the <a href=\"http://islington.foodbank.org.uk/\">Islington food bank,</a> even though an unspecified portion of that separate, media income is donated to charities. <br /></p> \n<p>It was never likely that Johnson would be given a ministerial role while he was still mayor - that really would have been pushing his luck - and Cameron said in advance of the election that in the event of his remaining prime minister he would expect his “star player” to see out his second four-year mayoral stint in full. Reports that this suits Johnson anyway because it means he won’t be constrained by cabinet responsibility from continuing to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32703425\">campaign against a third runway at Heathrow</a> - now thought more likely to happen than it was - are, I’m assured, pretty much accurate. There could be another reason it suits him, though. <br /></p> \n<p>Cameron’s unpredicted victory means Johnson no longer needs to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/davehillblog/2015/mar/27/why-boris-johnson-could-be-baling-out-as-london-mayor-by-bonfire-night\">step down as mayor early</a> in order to fulfill his ambition of replacing his old Bullingdon Club chum as Tory leader. Not that this means mayoral matters will be receiving quite the attention they deserve from “<a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/01/trouble-boris-johnson-how-bad-would-it-really-be-if-man-became-prime-minister\">Boris</a>” any more than they were <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/nov/02/boris-johnson-quit-london-mayor-ambitions-leader-tory-party\">before May 7.</a> Spending more time at the Palace of Westminster will give him more opportunity to work on that Conservative leadership bid, impressing fellow MPs with his gravitas, grip and general marvellousness. Cameron has said he will be gone from Number 10 in advance of the next general election, due in 2020. Expect the by then ex-mayor Johnson to be fully revved up to take his place. It was rather a good general election for him.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431515075035/dfcb2c0b-575d-429c-b82a-188877a2fa01-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andrew Matthews/PA","altText":"The mayor arrives for the election count in Uxbridge and South Ruislip.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T13:34:03Z","lastModified":"2015-05-13T14:27:57Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":16,"contributors":[{"name":"Dave Hill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/davehill"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["General election 2015","Politics","UK news","Boris Johnson","David Cameron","Conservatives","London politics","London","Mayoral elections","Society","Local politics","Local government","Ken Livingstone"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/general-election-2015","webTitle":"General election 2015"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/boris","webTitle":"Boris Johnson"},{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"politics/london","webTitle":"London politics"},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London"},{"id":"politics/mayoral-elections","webTitle":"Mayoral elections"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics"},{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government"},{"id":"politics/livingstone","webTitle":"Ken Livingstone"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Dave Hill","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/davehill"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/13/boris-johnson-takes-pay-cut-but-hes-a-big-election-winner","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48pck","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/may/13/boris-johnson-takes-pay-cut-but-hes-a-big-election-winner","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/13/boris-johnson-takes-pay-cut-but-hes-a-big-election-winner"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-456659673","source":"guardian.co.uk","durationInSeconds":323,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/05/08/150508boris_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/05/08/150508boris.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/5/8/1431074888146/KP_219552_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Cult of Boris","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Cult of Boris","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Cult of Boris"}}},"importance":7,"showQuotedHeadline":true},{"title":"Tina Fey / No one is safe from her lovable rudeness","rawTitle":"No one is safe from her lovable rudeness","item":{"type":"article","id":"stage/2015/may/13/my-comedy-hero-lou-sanders-on-tina-fey","title":"Lou Sanders on Tina Fey – no one is safe from her lovable rudeness","trailText":"From Saturday Night Live to 30 Rock and the Golden Globes, the mischievous comedy star ridicules women, men, kids, dogs – but in a caring, sharing way","standFirst":"<p>From Saturday Night Live to 30 Rock and the Golden Globes, the mischievous comedy star ridicules women, men, kids, dogs – but in a caring, sharing way</p>","byline":"Lou Sanders","body":"<p>Saying you like Tina Fey is like saying you like the sky – everyone likes the sky. Most people discovered Fey after her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HsyEvr5Pnw\">Sarah Palin impersonations</a> on Saturday Night Live, though I prefer her impression of her two-year-old daughter on The Tonight Show.</p> \n<p>The first time I came across Fey was through her character Liz Lemon in <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/30-rock\">30 Rock</a>, the TV series based on her time as a head writer at <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/feb/13/saturday-night-live-at-40-five-best-sketches\">Saturday Night Live</a>.</p> \n<p>30 Rock is superbly funny – it’s unashamedly odd, loud and cartoony. There are physical jokes, clever jokes, dumb jokes, character jokes and jokes within jokes. And, if you don’t like jokes, there are lots of characters. Every character in 30 Rock is so well drawn, big, bold and hilarious. Most of the characters shouldn’t be likable but somehow they put some heart into their heartlessness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVh7KJW0cFU\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iVh7KJW0cFU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In 30 Rock, Fey doesn’t deny gender stereotypes, but covers them in such a way that it’s not gender speaking, but the individual. There’s a scene where Jenna, her narcissistic long-term friend and star of the show-within-a-show that 30 Rock centres on, asks: “You never pretended to be a bride when you were a little girl?” Lemon replies: “I did, but I just never romanticised it.” And we see a flashback to Lemon as a little girl, in a bridal veil, holding two teddy bears: “This is my husband, Sol Rosenbear, and this is his son Richard … from a previous marriage.”</p> \n<p>Fey was also hilarious <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Hia8yDMEo0\">presenting the Golden Globes</a> alongside Amy Poehler. Like the characters in 30 Rock, they were rude to everyone and you loved them for it, simply because there was no real malice. I wish everyone were a bit more like Fey and Poehler. In TV and comedy it often feels as if everyone is living in a fearful climate, where they are nervous about new ideas, concepts or talent.</p> \n<p>Fey’s book <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/24/bossypants-tina-fey-review-30-rock\">Bossypants</a> is the perfect comedy autobiography. Take her response to people telling her that women aren’t funny: “It is an impressively arrogant move to conclude that just because you don’t like something, it is empirically not good. I don’t like Chinese food, but I don’t write articles trying to prove it doesn’t exist.” <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2LIOwotXFI\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2LIOwotXFI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>As well as being an author, actor and scriptwriter, Fey is an amazing improviser. I’ve always thought the rules of improv are just like the rules of life: don’t try too hard, don’t be up in your head, and say yes to things. Fey does all of these and teaches others to do them, too.<br /></p> \n<p>Before and beyond 30 Rock, she consistently seems to support and bolster those around her. She doesn’t just talk about supporting women, she actively hires, nurtures, celebrates and collaborates with them. But that doesn’t stop women from being ridiculed and called out for stuff – alongside men, dogs, kids and anyone else in her firing line.

In the simplest of tunes, ie Pulp Fiction, there was a simple sax motif, but it's where that's placed in the simple mechanics of the tune which makes it work. Something like Adam F - Mother, which is a B-side to Metropolis, it's just a beautiful ambient journey which I almost see as an inversion on a ballad. We can write ballads within electronic music if we try a little harder, but you wouldn't arrive it through the way you've got it it. Adrift, and a Letter of fFte - they arrive in a very sculptured way. Those records wouldn't have been able to arrive at that state, as ballads, without getting through those beats.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-5553417ce4b075defdfb25e3","publishedDateTime":"2015-05-13T12:20:25Z","body":"<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14897593\">allcrews</a> asks:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>How did you manage to extract Timeless as a musical arrangement living inside your head into an actual album via Rob Playford’s programming and production.

But what he does have is a fantastic width and berth to throw loads of creative ideas at him. Within his own label he was never really a producer, he had lots of artists creating for the labe. It has its own advantages - having a ridiculously creative engineer and producer is a great team. My thought was: can I create it like that? Can this computer do this? A great example would be what if I make Timeless - if I take Inner City Life, Pressure and Jah, and make this into a masterpiece which we could gel together, which became about 16 minutes. At that point that's when my creative process kicks in another gear - right Rob, can we link these things together, extend them?

Drum and bass like any other genre has fallen on it sword in many ways , but it's like a phoenix rising from the ashes. Every genre succumbs to gentrification at some point- as equipment becomes cheaper, as crowds become younger, there seems to be a sheepish attitude towards producers - how they can follow a mundane, linear sound, and make money. Craft is about leading, and this is obviously lacking in this day and age in the way people see the genre. </p> \n    <p>However, like any craft, a lot of craft goes underground and you'll find people making unbelievable music: great editing, great craftsmen. You just need to look a bit deeper, The one thing I can say after 20 years deep, is we have the ability to go back and forth in time. And when I got into really underground music when I was a kid, it reminded me... I'm talking 30 years ago, whether it was PiL, Steel Pulse, The Stranglers, these records were not pop records charting. Pigbag is another good example. These were records I discovered. I went back to find them. Same with Motown. THat's where Metalheadz and drum'n'bass is about - you have to go back to go forward.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-55534498e4b01c8d6c261772","publishedDateTime":"2015-05-13T12:33:49Z","body":"<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14892662\">LordSpacebar</a> asks:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>What do you think about the splintering of musical culture and the changes in the way tribalism used to connect music to contemporary culture?

The aesthetic of orchestral music from a primal, cerebral level has always been in my music. Pre Timeless, Sun Ray 2 on J Majik's label, a daring attempt in how to flip a record from nice to nasty and back again, but to introduce an orchestral colour to my music. It's a very simple Mendoza break, but with an absolutely beautiful take on a pianist's note played by a five year old child - reaching out to create, wanting something better, a sunset, which is laden with this lullaby of a string sound. Which for me fast forward, something like Beachdrifter which was always designed for orchestral aesthetic. I just built a blueprint of music and hope the technology would be able to take me there. Whether that's Ableton, or Heritage Orchestra. Back then, the LSO could not have played Timeless or even thought to, in the way it can be spread through the orchestra. In a way that youth culture can now understand this blueprint. </p> \n    <p>It's not about whether or not the technology was here then but lets face it - if you begin the new Timeless project at bar zero, and say no-one play an instrument, begin? The room will be silent for two hours. There is no syncopation. This isn't about Ableton Live, this is about young human beings engaging in synthesisers, percussion, real instruments, with a different attitude. Just like Moore's law and the computer chip at the end of five decades, we are finally realising the beginning of something very special where the music from the 90s is a phenomenal blueprint that can be catered for in the modern age.

There's only one record on the label that I'm not happy with, and I'm never going to tell you. There's one on the label, and one of my own making as well. Angels Fell has to be it though. Driving to his house from Brixton, and Carl will always quote Ghosts as being a big influence for him. Angels Fell has a special place in my heart and always will do - he was changing into a profound artist, but his sound had been the same for so long. He is the king of bass, no contest. But the moniker Metalheadz means you can shape an artist and get the best out of them - and that EP is one of the greatest ever made. Angels Fell allowed me to sculpt an EP into finite detail: Blade Runner, only I've seen what I've seen with me eyes. It was about a vision, trailblazing, and that gave this EP such a B-boy aspect, of taking things out. This was a thing for me: the b-boy attitude.</p> \n    <p>For the record, one of the things to understand as far as this culture is concerned... between Dillinja and Calibre, everyone else is in the middle. You've got two polarities of music, in terms of what drum'n'bass can be and how widespread. I always felt Timeless was the orbit - everything floats in the orbit of Timeless, and everything else, myself included, floats in the middle of that.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-555349d6e4b0226afc852a09","publishedDateTime":"2015-05-13T12:56:04Z","body":"<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14898363\">Albert Shelton</a> asks:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>How does visual art influence your sound? – Albert of Realist Radio</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/52096878\"> \n <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> \n  <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> \n   <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/14900692\" title=\"View GoldieWebchat’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2015/05/13/14900692/e45e12c4-2699-4321-9cde-5c4f95417584/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for GoldieWebchat\" /> </a> \n   <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> \n  </div> \n  <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> \n   <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> \n    <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/14900692\" title=\"View GoldieWebchat’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">GoldieWebchat</span> </a> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> \n    <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/52096878\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">13 May 2015 1:53pm</a> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"> \n    <p>I'm Dorian motherfucking Grey of breakbeat. He has a portrait hidden away, an ugly grotesque self portrait, however, I don't have one. What I have is a landscape picture, a surround landscape picture. Yes at times an ugly background, but beautiful nonetheless. I take all of my visual journey into my music regardless, always have done. I think if an artist gets to a point where you can play enough of your music, and paint and be creative, one then becomes its own paradox. I could throw a breakbeat into a harmonizer and it becomes its own music - the paintings will begat more paintings, more sound. Painting and music are very much the same. </p> \n    <p>People always ask me, I really want to do something on the label. I don't know what to do. It's not actually that hard? If you want to make something - go to an experience you have, and write what you want to achieve. Programming, engineering, these are things you can explore, but that's the difference - if you explore yourself as a character. No-one can judge individuality; if you produce something to sound like someone else, you're second best. Originality breeds contempt - you have to be contemptible, push the envelope. Being creative is not about being in front of the computer screen, like this fucking guy here who's tying so fucking fast his fingers are bleeding [namely me - Ed] it's about interaction, being open with one's idea, getting a notebook, writing ideas down. What's a vocal example? What do I want the drums to sound like? 90% of music is about not being shy of your inhibitions.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-555349f3e4b0226afc852a0a","publishedDateTime":"2015-05-13T12:56:43Z","body":"<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14898260\">Eric Yo</a> asks:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>-What is 1 piece of advice that you have received to which you live by and that you feel could encourage others?</p> \n <p>-What are 5 key books you feel we should read, and why?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/52094088\"> \n <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> \n  <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> \n   <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/14900692\" title=\"View GoldieWebchat’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2015/05/13/14900692/e45e12c4-2699-4321-9cde-5c4f95417584/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for GoldieWebchat\" /> </a> \n   <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> \n  </div> \n  <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> \n   <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> \n    <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/14900692\" title=\"View GoldieWebchat’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">GoldieWebchat</span> </a> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> \n    <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/52094088\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">13 May 2015 1:16pm</a> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"> \n    <p>&quot;When in Rome, eat lions.&quot; That was by a guy called J Pender.

I'm fed up of local authorities using the graffiti moniker which they hounded so badly in the 80s to come and cover up their building sites of unfinished business within the city. The least you could do, as I've always offered, is to fund the basic necessity of providing paint for some of these young artists, which will gladly brighten up your environment. This isn't a question of whether or not graffiti is illegal or not - from the moment you put graffiti inside the Moca gallery in LA, it's accepted. It's as much a part of our culture as a cup of tea. </p> \n    <p>We need to change the way that urban music and graffiti is accepted in this country. Why isn't yoga and parkour being taught in schools? The local authority is extremely out of touch with what the arts actually is, let alone protect it. I find it sad that there are many artists that have come through the hard slog of 30 years and learned the hard way with street culture alike that have experienced far more than academics - that could engage in their community with the help of the local authority who are still working out what to do, whilst there youth culture is imploding and slipping through their very fat fingers. Very simple in the UK: handball courts, parkour, music schools. Handball courts - you can play anything, you can paint them. Like Sidmouth Road - a grey area, local writers do it for themselves. This is something that should be built for us.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-55534c97e4b00f178abed5de","publishedDateTime":"2015-05-13T13:07:58Z","body":"<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13934575\">fundam3ntalist</a> asks:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>To what extent are involved in choosing music/artists for the label nowadays?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/52097610\"> \n <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> \n  <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> \n   <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/14900692\" title=\"View GoldieWebchat’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2015/05/13/14900692/e45e12c4-2699-4321-9cde-5c4f95417584/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for GoldieWebchat\" /> </a> \n   <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> \n  </div> \n  <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> \n   <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> \n    <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/14900692\" title=\"View GoldieWebchat’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">GoldieWebchat</span> </a> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> \n    <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/52097610\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">13 May 2015 2:03pm</a> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"> \n    <p>To the hilt.

Back in January, the <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/justin-bieber-apologizes-im-not-who-i-was-pretending-to-be-20150129\">pop star released a video</a> telling fans: “I’m not who I was pretending to be.” Now, Bieber has given a fresh interview to Seventeen magazine in which he admits he was “disappointed” in himself.</p> \n<p> “I was rebelling a little bit,” he said. “I was getting cockier and cockier. I didn’t have people to check me. I looked back and I was disappointed in myself.”</p> \n<p> At the time of his original apology, fans were unsure as to how sincere Bieber was being. In February 2015, however, the star appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres show to say that he had done “a lot of things over the past few years that I’m not proud of.”</p> \n<p> Those things may or may not have included abandoning his pet monkey in Germany, drag racing a yellow Lamborghini while under the influence, throwing eggs at his neighbours and urinating in a bucket while swearing at a picture of President Clinton. But now Bieber wants to move on from his old public image. He told Seventeen: “You have to own up to the mistakes. You have to say, ‘I’m sorry if I’ve let you down’. I always want to be honest, and let people know that those mistakes aren’t who I am. Who I am is someone who really cares about people.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/musicblog/2014/jan/23/justin-bieber-david-bowie-tim-jonze\">Justin Bieber is the Bowie of bad behaviour</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Later on in the interview, the star admitted to letting social media reactions affect his self esteem.</p> \n<p>“For a while, I was busy looking at my Instagram likes, and if a post didn’t get a certain amount, I was like, ‘Aw, they didn’t like the photo,’” said Bieber. “But there’s always a choice. You can let Instagram or stuff on the internet affect your day, or you can choose to not be bothered by it.”</p> \n<p> These days, Bieber says he chooses “not to be bothered” by comments on social media.

of the years 1939-45 acclaimed as a ‘shocking history lesson’</p>","byline":"Alison Flood","body":"<p>Years before her stories of the red-braided Pippi Longstocking would make her famous, Astrid Lindgren was a 32-year-old mother in Stockholm with two small children, recording the nightmares of the second world war in 17 volumes of diaries that have just been published in Scandinavia for the first time.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Documenting the progress of war and how it affected her family life, the diaries run from 1 September 1939 until the end of hostilities in 1945 – the year that the publication of Pippi Longstocking would change the Swedish author’s life for good. It took a team led by Lindgren’s granddaughter Annika Lindgren two years to turn the 17 handwritten volumes into the just-published <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.svd.se/kultur/litteratur/en-krigsskildring-utan-motstycke_4539668.svd\">Krigsdagb&ouml;cker</a> (War Diaries). The book includes facsimile images of the pages, which Lindgren peppered with press cuttings, as well as unpublished family photographs from the war years.</p> \n<p>“The family has always known about her diaries. We have always thought, what a pity it was that we couldn’t show them to more people, but we considered it impossible on account of their cumbersome size. At last we decided that her notes without the cuttings are interesting enough to publish. They make a coherent story,” said Lindgren’s daughter, Karin Nyman, the original audience for Lindgren’s tales of the mischievous Pippi.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"da86172be60d5a0ba8cd96227bdf0fa80bdb6557\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431447575974/4f553447-9ea3-477f-a44a-c50335b1d1aa-460x346.jpeg\" alt=\"Astrid Lindgren war diary\" width=\"460\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘God help our poor planet in the grip of this madness!’ ... press images of Jews being transported pasted in to Astrid Lindgren’s war diaries.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“They make fascinating reading, these records of happenings in a neutral, non-belligerent country, squeezed in between Hitler- or Stalin-attacked or occupied countries. Spared, but often in anguish,” said Nyman. “It seemed timely [to publish this year], 70 years after the peace of 1945.”</p> \n<p>The diaries, Nyman added, were kept by her mother “in an old chip basket, originally used as a vessel for sending food supplies from Astrid’s parents on their farm, things like eggs, butter, bread, that were scarce in Stockholm during the war.”</p> \n<p>“Oh! War broke out today. Nobody could believe it,” writes Lindgren on 1 September 1939. “Yesterday afternoon, Elsa Gullander and I were in Vasa park with the children running and playing around us and we sat there giving Hitler a nice, cosy telling off and agreed that there definitely wasn’t going to be a war – and now today! The Germans bombarded several Polish cities early this morning and are forging their way into Poland from all directions. I have managed to restrain myself from any hoarding until now, but today I laid in a little cocoa, a little tea, a small amount of soap and a few other things.”</p> \n<p>A “terrible despondency” is “weighing on everything and everyone”, she goes on, <a href=\"https://astridlindgrenmemorialaward.wordpress.com/2014/11/06/astrid-lindgrens-daughter-comments-the-war-diaries/\">in a translation by Sarah Death</a>. “The radio churns out news reports all day long. Lots of our men liable for military service are being called up. A ban has been imposed on private motoring. God help our poor planet in the grip of this madness!”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6da884f415f913b163c85744f64f377969beee23\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431447065409/c3c9a6e2-a4b1-4db0-9719-0894762ba266-460x360.jpeg\" alt=\"Astrid Lindgren war diary\" width=\"460\" height=\"360\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A shocking history lesson’ ... pages from Astrid Lindgren’s war diaries.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Six years later, on 7 May 1945, she celebrates: “The war is over! The war is over! The war is over!”, writing of the “wild sense of jubilation” on the streets of Stockholm, where “everyone’s behaving as if they’ve gone crazy”. </p> \n<p>“I’ve been drinking sherry with Linnea and Lars and feel a bit light-headed,” she continues. “It’s spring and the sun is shining on this blessed day and the war is over. I wouldn’t want to be German. Just think, the war’s over, Hitler’s dead (there are jubilant shouts and cheers on the radio now; Stockholm has completely taken leave of its senses).”</p> \n<p>There is no English publisher lined up as yet for the diaries, but <a href=\"http://www.svd.se/kultur/litteratur/en-krigsskildring-utan-motstycke_4539668.svd\">reviews in the Scandinavian press</a> have called them an “unparalled war narrative”, “<a href=\"http://www.vg.no/rampelys/bok/bokanmeldelser/bokanmeldelse-astrid-lindgren-krigsdagboeker-1939-1945/a/23446826/\">unprecedented</a>”, and a “<a href=\"http://www.gp.se/kulturnoje/recensioner/bocker/1.2708013-astrid-lindgren-krigsdagbocker-1939-1945\">shocking history lesson</a>”, bringing to life the housewives hoarding soap and eggs in Stockholm as well as being a “meticulous” reporting of the war featuring newspaper clippings, maps and photographs.</p> \n<p>Described as a “very personal account of how dramatic world events affect us all” <a href=\"http://salikon.se/krigsdagbocker/#top\">by their Swedish publisher Salikon</a>, which says the text is “laden with sadness and dismay”, the diaries show everything from Lindgren’s horror at the deportation of 1,000 Norwegian Jews to Poland – “it is diabolical!” – to her personal heartbreak after a marriage crisis. “Blood is flowing, people are maimed, misery and despair are everywhere. And I don’t care about it. Only my own problems interest me,” wrote the Swedish author in July 1944.</p> \n<p>The diaries also cover the period she worked at Sweden’s Special Intelligence Agency in the mail censorship office, reading overseas correspondence and other military mail. Lindgren had previously worked as a journalist and a secretary, leaving her home town of Vimmerby after she became pregnant and moving to Stockholm. She met the man who would become her husband, Sture Lindgren, while working as a stenographer at the Royal Automobile Club, going on to concentrate on her role as wife and mother while still writing short stories for a magazine.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"92c59bf6a0c909ed3c26e6f56e40f31e1174cc9c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431447303472/214916d5-30d0-4d8e-9312-f2c416375605-460x365.jpeg\" alt=\"Astrid Lindgren war diary\" width=\"460\" height=\"365\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">“KRIGET AR SLUT!
