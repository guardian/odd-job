He pointed out that prior to Star Wars in 1977, cinema had been about “challenging, emotional or moral journeys” rather than muscular men dressed in tight spandex.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/mar/03/marvel-us-box-office-decline-blockbusters\">The blockbuster's in decline – here's how to save it</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In his new post, titled Big Mouth Strikes Again, the former Spaced actor and star of the loose Edgar Wright-directed Three Cornettos trilogy (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and The World’s End) promised fans he was “still a nerd and proud”. However, he also referred to the French philosopher Jean Baudrillard’s views on the infantilisation of modern culture in comments that may pass somewhat over the heads of the average teenage Avengers fan.</p> \n<p>“Put simply, this is the idea that as a society, we are kept in a state of arrested development by dominant forces in order to keep us more pliant,” wrote Pegg. “We are made passionate about the things that occupied us as children as a means of drawing our attentions away from the things we really should be invested in: inequality, corruption, economic injustice etc. <br /></p> \n<p>“It makes sense that when faced with the awfulness of the world, the harsh realities that surround us, our instinct is to seek comfort, and where else were the majority of us most comfortable than our youth? A time when we were shielded from painful truths by our recreational passions, the toys we played with, the games we played, the comics we read. There was probably more discussion on Twitter about The Force Awakens and the Batman vs Superman trailers than there was about the Nepalese earthquake or the British general election.”<br /></p> \n<p>However, Pegg pointed out that he adored both Mad Max: Fury Road and Ex-Machina, two wildly differing but equally well-reviewed recent examples of 21st century science fiction film-making, and also said he appreciated Christopher Nolan’s efforts to bring adult themes into the superhero genre via his Dark Knight trilogy of Batman films.<br /></p> \n<p>“The point of all this is just to get my position clear,” he added. “I’m not out of the fold, my passions and preoccupations remain. Sometimes it’s good to look at the state of the union and make sure we’re getting the best we can get. On one hand it’s a wonderful thing, having what used to be fringe concerns, suddenly ruling the mainstream but at the same time, these concerns have also been monetised and marketed and the things that made them precious to us, aren’t always the primary concern.”<br /></p> \n<p>Pegg is currently writing Star Trek Beyond, in which he will also reprise his role as engineering chief Scotty. He will also be seen in this summer’s Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation. </p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432108613322/efbebae6-f479-4c65-a9d7-895a9073c29f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ian West/PA","altText":"Simon Pegg","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ian West/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-20T08:14:32Z","lastModified":"2015-05-20T08:35:54Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2,"contributors":[{"name":"Ben Child","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/benchild"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Film","Simon Pegg","Culture","Star Trek","Action and adventure","Superhero movies"],"tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/simonpegg","webTitle":"Simon Pegg"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"culture/star-trek","webTitle":"Star Trek"},{"id":"film/actionandadventure","webTitle":"Action and adventure"},{"id":"film/superhero-movies","webTitle":"Superhero movies"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ben Child","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/benchild"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/20/simon-pegg-still-a-nerd-and-proud-after-dumbing-down-of-cinema-comments","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/493z9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/20/simon-pegg-still-a-nerd-and-proud-after-dumbing-down-of-cinema-comments","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/20/simon-pegg-still-a-nerd-and-proud-after-dumbing-down-of-cinema-comments"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432108613322/efbebae6-f479-4c65-a9d7-895a9073c29f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Big mouth strikes again ...

Why do so many tech billionaires crave isolation?</p>","byline":"Stuart Heritage","body":"<p>Mark Zuckerberg is living several dreams at once. He’s living the dream in which he earned billions of dollars by creating a social media platform that <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/jackrivlin/100010603/revealed-why-we-hate-facebook/\" title=\"\">people actively hate</a>. He’s living the dream in which <a href=\"http://variety.com/2014/film/news/jesse-eisenberg-cast-as-lex-luthor-in-supermanbatman-jeremy-irons-set-as-alfred-1201079902/\" title=\"\">Lex Luthor got to play him in the film of his life</a>. And now he’s living the dream in which he&nbsp;gets to wander around a vast uninhabited space all alone, like Will Smith in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/122297/i.am.legend\" title=\"\">I Am Legend</a>.</p> \n<p>Over the past couple of years, Zuckerberg has made two big property purchases – last year he bought <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-hawaiian-property-photos-2014-10?IR=T\" title=\"\">750 acres of land on the north shore of Kauai in Hawaii for $100m</a>, and in 2013 he <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/zillow/2013/10/11/facebooks-zuckerberg-buys-up-four-properties-near-his-home/\" title=\"\">bought the four properties surrounding his Palo Alto home</a> – that seem to underline his rampant desire for privacy. <a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/pacific/blog/2015/05/what-facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-plans-to-do-with.html\" title=\"\">Recently revealed plans</a> indicating that Zuckerberg does not intend to build an entire compound on his land, but rather a single property, suggest that he is determined to surround himself with, well, almost no one (with the exception, presumably, of his&nbsp;wife, Priscilla Chan).</p> \n<p>At first glance these might seem like the actions of a man with something to hide; the hypocritical manoeuvrings of a man who made his fortune on social media and now wants to be as antisocial as possible. It’s as if he’s become a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2008/feb/08/paulthomasanderson.drama\" title=\"\">Daniel Plainview</a> figure, so isolated by his success that he wants to move far away from everyone and shoot at his furniture with a rifle.</p> \n<p>Admittedly, this might just be Zuckerberg following his peers, because if there’s one thing that tech billionaires apparently love doing, it’s planting flags in all the land around them. In 2013, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/trulia/2013/11/01/billionaire-tesla-ceo-elon-musk-buys-home/\" title=\"\">Elon Musk bought a mansion opposite his own mansion</a>, and Yahoo’s <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/marissa-mayer-bought-a-funeral-home-2013-10?IR=T\" title=\"\">Marissa Mayer snapped up a funeral home</a> just down from her home. But there’s a chance that something else might be at play. Mark Zuckerberg might just be sick of people.</p> \n<p>And really, could you blame him? This is the man who created Facebook, remember. When Zuckerberg looks down at the fruits of his creation, what does he see? The very worst of humanity, that’s what. Narcissists. Drunks. Racists. Joke stealers. Complainers. People who wouldn’t know the difference between “their” and “there” if you wrote it on a cricket bat and attacked them with it. If&nbsp;you spent your day endlessly scrolling through 1.3 billion soul-deadening hen party photo uploads and infinite multilingual variations of “U OK hun?”, you’d want to run as far away from people as you could too.</p> \n<p>Sequestering himself from the monsters who use his site seems like a perfectly sensible thing to do. In fact, it’s odd that more people haven’t done the same. By rights, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2012/apr/10/instagram-founders-two-years-silicon-valley\" title=\"\">the founders of Instagram</a>, should have moved away to a bricked-up cave by now. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/technology/jack-dorsey\" title=\"\">Jack Dorsey</a> and the rest of his Twitter co-founders should have bought an entire desert, and dedicated the rest of their life to scratching “I’M SORRY” in giant letters in the sand with a toothbrush. So let Mark Zuckerberg hide away from everyone. You’d do the same if you had the money.</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432066795584/1de02b3d-f760-4150-b3aa-94f64fa1325a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"JOSE MIGUEL GOMEZ/REUTERS","altText":"President, founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: JOSE MIGUEL GOMEZ/REUTERS"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-19T18:06:51Z","lastModified":"2015-05-19T23:00:38Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":120,"contributors":[{"name":"Stuart Heritage","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733749780/StuartHeritage.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stuart-heritage"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Mark Zuckerberg","Homes","Facebook","Life and style","Technology"],"tags":[{"id":"technology/mark-zuckerberg","webTitle":"Mark Zuckerberg"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/homes","webTitle":"Homes"},{"id":"technology/facebook","webTitle":"Facebook"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"}],"section":{"id":"technology"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Stuart Heritage","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stuart-heritage"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"technology"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/shortcuts/2015/may/19/unfriend-request-mark-zuckerberg-neighbourhood-privacy-settings","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/493g9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/technology/shortcuts/2015/may/19/unfriend-request-mark-zuckerberg-neighbourhood-privacy-settings","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2015/may/19/unfriend-request-mark-zuckerberg-neighbourhood-privacy-settings"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432054039234/c6a1b9e6-9bdc-4974-8a3f-730d7b50bd24-1020x691.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":691,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mark Zuckerberg’s house in Palo Alto, California.

I’m not sure this current set, compelling though it is, really delivers on that self-mythologising. But it’s worth seeing, because Hunter is a charismatic and interesting comedian, who at his best – there are examples tonight – has a refreshing capacity for honest critical thinking about himself and the world. But the bits Hunter advertises as outspoken are often conventional, propagating old-fashioned attitudes about women and a nostalgia for the disciplinarian attitudes that governed his deep south childhood.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2015/apr/30/reginald-d-hunter-interview-comedy-uk-tour\">Reginald D Hunter: ‘I know I’m gonna piss someone off this time’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The set has no theme; in fact, Hunter’s musings can be hard to follow. Some sequences – including the one where he asks the audience a question concerning their marital scruples – don’t always connect with the rest of the show. Others, such as his sister’s homily about the difference between power and authority, left me grasping for the slightest sense of what they’re on about.</p> \n<p>The happy flipside is that Hunter’s mercurial logic can lead him into territory other comics don’t occupy. OK, so the self-righteousness can grate. More often, he is emotionally frank about his life and loves in a way that is always engaging and sometimes comical. He throws curveballs. There is a wonderfully charged moment when he quizzes an audience member about his Conservative politics. And there are strong set pieces about dressing as a confederate general at an American civil war re-enactment, and being asked to discuss racism on a Russian radio show.</p> \n<p>It’s a shame his non-doctrinaire thinking about race doesn’t transfer to gender. In Hunter’s worldview, women express themselves mainly through hysteria and who they sleep with. The complaints about his tax bill also wear thin. It’s a strange mix: inconsistently funny and insightful, even as the force of personality never wavers.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> At <a href=\"http://www.readingarts.com/thehexagon/whatson/event.asp?id=SXB3B7-A7825881\" title=\"\">the Hexagon</a>, Reading, 20 May.

On Monday, the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/18/extreme-athlete-dean-potter-visionary-tributes\" title=\"\">terrible news broke that he was not</a>. I spent a remarkable day with Potter in Yosemite in the spring of 2011, part of the research for a book I was writing about what it means to be brave. And Dean was brave, I was in no doubt about that.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/gallery/2009/oct/01/dean-potter-skywalker\">In pictures: Dean Potter in Channel 4's The Sky Walker</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Famous for his exploits in some of the toughest vertical landscapes in the natural world – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/picture/2011/may/13/climbing-holidays-usa\" title=\"\">ropeless ascents of sheer rock faces</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/gallery/2009/oct/01/dean-potter-skywalker\" title=\"\">slacklining across canyons</a>, base jumping from unthinkable heights – this was a man with a formidable reputation as one of the most audacious daredevils of his generation. His stunts – although, as I would discover, Dean hated them to be called that – were highly marketable. It’s certainly not hard to find videos of him in apparently thrill-seeking mode, all whoops to the camera. Maybe that is the reputation that will survive him, but that would be wrong.</p> \n<p>Over the course of the day we spent together, the image of the daredevil, crazed adrenaline junkie with a death wish was the very one Dean went out of his way to dispel. Looking back, I guess that was the reason he agreed to talk to me in the first place. Sitting in one of his favourite places, a broad rock platform at the foot of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jan/15/el-capitan-how-climbers-do-it-big-wall-yosemite\" title=\"\">El Capitan</a>, Dean said: “It’s funny because it all started with a boy that didn’t quite fit in. I had trouble focusing as a child and I still sort of do, but when you climb and you’re going to die if you fall, you have 100% focus. That’s a rarity in life and a gift to have something that brings you that clarity.”</p> \n<p>The pursuit of clarity of mind, he told me again and again, was his raison d’etre. He described how adrenaline didn’t make him “rush”, so much as feel “hyper-alert”, the gateway to a state of mind that he believed was meaningful in and of itself.</p> \n<p>“I can calm myself by an intense will,” he said, “and also by the simple ability to focus in the most dangerous situation on breath and nothing else. And then you’re not scared any more. You perceive life in slow motion, that’s the most beautiful part, that heightened awareness. There are a few ways you can get that feeling, but the easiest way is to do something with a death consequence.” And he shrugged.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>He talked of 'rationing' his risks, as a way to play and win the odds, while continuing to live this life he’d chosen</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I asked whether the point was that life was at its sweetest when it hung in the balance, but he said, “No. That’s a little too complicated. It’s that if you mess up, you die – you focus. It’s that simple. And this lifestyle that’s on the edge, it makes me live well.”</p> \n<p>In latter years, Potter’s almost shamanic philosophy homed in on a dream of flight that he said had preoccupied him since childhood. To you and I, it’s called <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/magazine/its-more-like-a-suicide-than-a-sport.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">base jumping</a>, and, in truth, even with the wingsuit that Potter favoured, it’s as much about falling as it is about flying. But to Dean even the term base jumping was one he disliked, instead referring to it as “human body flying”, saying “the desire for human flight goes back forever and for me, it’s such a metaphor for freedom.”</p> \n<p>It would be tempting to think that Potter was in denial about how badly wrong this could go, but he told me how when his friend and pioneering <a href=\"http://www.outsideonline.com/1914776/terminal-velocity-death-master-gravity\" title=\"\">base jumper Dan Osman</a> had fallen and died in Yosemite in 1998, it had been he who’d gone to find the body and sit with it until it could be recovered by the park authorities. All night he sat there. “I idolised the guy and there he was, dead among the boulders… no matter how strong you are, you can die.”</p> \n<p>The problem, according to Dean, was that Osman had “needed it” too much and Dean swore he would never let himself make that mistake, never “need it” like that. He talked of “rationing” his risks, as a way to play and win the odds, while continuing to live this life he’d chosen with all its moments of euphoric enlightenment.</p> \n<p>Towards the end of the afternoon, as the sun began to turn the grey cliffs of Yosemite amber, I’d asked Dean if he thought something might happen to him too.</p> \n<p>“I hope not,” he replied. “I know I’m just as mortal as everybody else and I think about that quite a bit, but I really do feel like everyone lives with this – they’re just not aware of it. They walk down into the traffic, all the different ways where you could die suddenly or make a mistake. Often it’s not a physical thing, it’s just a bad decision that messes up your life. And we all live with that – mine is just very easy to see.”</p> \n<p>As the climbing world mourns one of its brightest and bravest, it seems that this may be a fitting epitaph, not to a daredevil for whom life was cheap, but to one who had decided what, for him, made life worth living and then lived it. And there’s a lesson in that for us all.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432032800351/Dean-Potter--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dean Potter was found dead in Yosemite national park, California after base jumping from Taft Point.
