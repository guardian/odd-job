But his recent lacklustre TV outings suggest he might need to rediscover the irreverence of his early days","byline":"Andrew Anthony","body":"<p>For many years now, Chris Evans has been attempting to conjure up a winning new television format. “Every day I try to think of the next big great quiz show,” he told an interviewer in 2011. “It’s an obsession.”</p> \n<p>Now, finally, the Radio 2 DJ, who enjoyed significant ratings success in the 1990s with <em>The Big Breakfast</em>, <em>Don’t Forget Your Toothbrush </em>and <em>TFI Friday</em>, has figured out what his new breakthrough show is going to be: <em>Top Gear</em>, the BBC’s biggest international success of the past two decades.</p> \n<p>Evans’s name has been consistently linked with the show since the BBC refused to renew Jeremy Clarkson’s contract in March after the controversial presenter punched one of his producers. Such was the speculation that Evans went so far as to deny categorically that he wanted the job; he now says that he took that step because, as a fan, he wanted James May and Richard Hammond to take over. It was the announcement by the pair that they would not be doing so that opened the way for Evans to accept the role.</p> \n<p>In many ways, he’s the perfect candidate: a famous face, at ease with the multiple presenting demands that <em>Top Gear</em> represents, and a recognised car nut and collector who once paid <a href=\"http://www.topgear.com/uk/car-news/chris-evans-buys-12m-ferrari-gto-2010-05-14\" title=\"\">&pound;12m for a 1963 Ferrari 250 GTO</a>. Yet it’s also one of those massive career moves that could so easily go horribly wrong.</p> \n<p>Although <em>Top Gear</em> has been around for almost 40 years, it was completely reinvented by Clarkson, recast in the distinct mould of his formidable personality. So thoroughly did he imbue the show with his personal outlook that it’s hard to think of a car review without hearing the familiar ironic cadence of Clarkson’s exaggerated delivery. And what’s more, although Clarkson is an almost comic hate figure to half of liberal Britain, he drew a devoted following who are still bitter about his exit. They will not be inclined to give the new man an easy ride.</p> \n<p>But Evans has been this way before. Five years ago, he took over from a British broadcasting institution when he replaced Terry Wogan on the Radio 2 breakfast show. Initially, he was not seen as a popular choice to succeed the mild-mannered Irishman.</p> \n<p>Brash, cocksure and with a library of tabloid headlines to his name, he seemed to represent everything that the knighted Wogan was not. It was as if he was selected to inform Wogan’s listeners that they were no longer required to tune in.</p> \n<p>But after a brief period of adjustment, Evans actually increased the listening figures to close to 10 million. And he did it by reining himself in, dropping the toxic self-indulgence that marked his short-lived but highly eventful Radio 1 show of the mid-1990s.</p> \n<p>That was the period in which Evans’s ego seemed to expand geometrically from week to week. It was the height of Britpop and lad culture, when boorish behaviour was both the prerequisite and reward for success. And Evans was very successful.</p> \n<p>A broadcasting natural, he started out as a teenager on Manchester’s Piccadilly Radio, where he played a character called Nobby Nolevel on the Timmy Mallett show. He also presented a late-night show and worked as a producer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcbb228b0b3f65681c0237b89eee352c492f3f94\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434795166647/590cf5ac-1519-4f77-9b21-34ef7a6c0594-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson being interviewed by Chris Evans in his first interview since being sacked.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson being interviewed by Chris Evans in his first interview since being sacked.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Lawrence/Splash News/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was as a producer that he made the move to London, working first for Richard Branson and then for BBC’s GLR, producing the Emma Freud show. He soon transferred to presenting and built up a reputation for a madcap approach that was somewhat constrained by BBC management.</p> \n<p>It was his move to TV, however, in 1992 that really made his name. As co-host with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MzZq4pdHtk\" title=\"\">Gaby Roslin of <em>The Big Breakfast</em></a>, Evans established himself as a star. With his riot of ginger hair and Michael Caine glasses, he was unpredictable, irreverent and appeared to be having a great time.</p> \n<p>He thrived in the pressure of live television, feeding off a seeming inexhaustible supply of nervous energy. Within a few years, he would become hugely wealthy and utterly burnt out. “Radio is non-stop,” he has said. “It picks you up and wears you out. If you’re the guy behind the microphone, you’re the maggot on the hook waiting to be eaten.”</p> \n<p>In 1995, Radio 1 controller Matthew Bannister was set on overhauling the station’s profile, consigning a previous generation of DJs to the dinosaurs’ graveyard. At the core of his strategy was his most celebrated – and expensive – signing, Evans. And Evans knew it.</p> \n<p>Increasingly coming to resemble the spoilt rock stars who appeared on <em>TFI Friday</em>, Evans’s enthusiasm declined as his demands grew. He failed to turn up for the breakfast show after a Christmas party, declaring: “We are but a mirror to what goes on elsewhere.”</p> \n<p>He insisted on shorter hours, to which Bannister agreed, and then announced that he shouldn’t have to work on Fridays, which Bannister refused. In a fit of pique, he resigned on air. He later described this desire to test his and others’ limits as a kind of loss of moral bearings: “You don’t know whether you’re right or wrong and you’ve got nobody to tell you.”</p> \n<p>As it was, no one cared that he was wrong because, more importantly, he was popular. So he just got bigger. He moved to Virgin to present a rival breakfast show that was a huge success; he liked it so much be bought the station. Within three years, he sold it in a deal that was said to have made him around &pound;35m. He continued to host the show but began to lose his audience and after repeatedly failing to turn up for work was sacked. He then launched a doomed bid to sue the station he once owned.</p> \n<p>It was a cartoon-like tale of hubris about an endearing character who became a painful caricature. His parents had managed a corner shop in Warrington and his father had died when Evans was just 13. In a remarkably short space of time, he made his way from obscurity to national fame and massive wealth.</p> \n<p>Along the way, he fathered a child at 20 and immediately turned his back on her (they are now reunited), had a brief and unhappy marriage to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_McGiffin\" title=\"\">broadcaster Carol McGiffin</a> and a series of frenetically unsatisfying relationships. In 2000, he met the then teen pop star Billie Piper and bought her a silver Ferrari decked out in crimson roses. She didn’t drive. The marriage ended four years later when he visited her on the set of <em>Doctor Who</em> and told her: “I think we’re about to start not being ‘us’.”</p> \n<p>At that stage, although his worst excesses were behind him, there was an sense that Evans had got lost in the trappings of his own celebrity. He seemed compelled to make dramatic gestures, as if their sheer size would shock the world into providing some temporary meaning. After the failure of one TV project, he opened a store at London’s Camden Market. But each attention-seeking or attention-defying act, each new acquisition and sale, opened up new vistas of emptiness. Having achieved and accrued so much, Evans looked unsure where or how to carry on.</p> \n<p>The answer, in 2005, was to go back to what he did best. Given another chance at the BBC, he began to work as a DJ again. First one-off shows, then a Saturday show, followed by a regular drive-time slot and finally the breakfast show. As the craftsman returned, the diva made an understated exit.</p> \n<p>It’s no coincidence that Evans’s stable second life at the BBC has been accompanied by marriage – to Natasha Shishmanian, a part-time model and golf columnist – and two children. “No woman has ever controlled me like Natasha does,” he said. “Psychologically, she’s got me absolutely nailed.”</p> \n<p>Instead of the relentless self-absorption of his Radio 1 days, Evans has discovered a welcome interest in his listeners on Radio 2. He was never a great funny man – his sense of humour lacked a sharp enough wit – but he can be effortlessly engaging and often amusing. There is also something quietly appealing about the idea of a once wayward celebrity falling back in love with what made him famous.</p> \n<p>But television is another matter. His recent incursions on to the box have not been conspicuously triumphant. <em>OFI Sunday</em> and <em>Famous and Fearless</em> hardly troubled the nation’s memory banks, and although his Friday stint on <em>The</em> <em>One Show</em> has gone relatively well, it’s not ground-breaking territory.</p> \n<p>If <em>The One Show</em> is a bland family saloon, <em>Top Gear</em> is a souped-up, look-at-me, monster juggernaut. Mad Max himself would struggle to stop its gears from slipping into reverse. If Evans manages to keep it going forward, he will prove himself not just a master of broadcasting, but king of the road.</p> \n<p><strong>Born</strong> 1 April 1966 in Warrington, the youngest of three siblings, to Martin Evans, a sometime bookmaker, and Minnie&nbsp;Beardsell, manager of a corner shop.</p> \n<p><strong>Best of times</strong> In terms of job satisfaction and personal happiness, now would probably be the answer. But in terms of career heat, the second-half of the 90s, when everything he touched turned to gold.</p> \n<p><strong>Worst of times</strong> The second half of the 90s, when aside from being successful, he was drunk, bullying and obnoxious. As he put it: “I stayed out all night, drinking myself half to death, running out of energy&nbsp;and running out of friends and I was so anaesthetised by alcohol I barely felt a thing.”</p> \n<p><strong>What he says</strong> “The BBC is mammoth but there’s two things you can’t do: you can’t hijack it and you can’t monetise it. You come here to do a job for a reason and you have to know the guidelines. That’s the deal.”</p> \n<p><strong>What others say</strong> “Evans’s arrival coincided with the end of the ‘Smashie and Nicey’ era of senior DJs, such as Dave Lee Travis, Simon Bates and Alan Freeman, many of whom jumped before they were pushed.</p> \n<p>Matthew Bannister, ex Radio 1 controller.</p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434788424442/Chris-Evans-to-host-Top-G-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"In pole position: Chris Evans, the newly appointed Top Gear presenter.

Born in Connecticut in 1958, she moved to New York in the 70s, where she frequented <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2015/mar/14/studio-54-ultimate-den-of-vice-photographs-hasse-persson\" title=\"\">Studio 54</a>, dated the magazine publisher <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/theobserver/2004/jul/18/features.magazine17\" title=\"\">Ron Galotti</a> – reputedly the inspiration for Bradshaw’s Mr Big – and worked as a journalist; <em>Sex and the City</em> began its life as a series of columns published in the <em>New York Observer</em> between 1994 and 1996.</p> \n<p>Bushnell’s new novel, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/293520/\" title=\"\"><em>Killing Monica</em></a>, tells the story of a bestselling writer, Pandy “PJ” Wallis, whose lucrative fictional creation, a snub-nosed, peachy-skinned good-time girl called Monica, has come to dominate her life in both good and bad ways…</p> \n<p><strong>How did the idea for <em>Killing Monica</em> come to you?</strong><br />The centre of the book was always Pandy and her sister, Hellenor. I have a sister who’s a year younger than me and when we were kids we were super-creative. We wrote plays and music and we invented this character called Marigold and we would fight over who got to be her. I was thinking about the brain of the creative person, the inherent drive in creativity. But the idea also came from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2007/sep/29/fiction.philiproth\" title=\"\">Philip Roth and his Zuckerman novels</a> and the way he’ll always be attached to those. I blew all that up and made it comic.</p> \n<p><strong>The public is unable to separate Pandy and Monica. Was that something you wanted to explore? A lot of people seem to think you and Carrie Bradshaw are the same person.</strong><br />I was playing around with that because it’s fascinating to me, this insistence that somehow a character is always based on an author’s life. I was just on a panel with a delightful young woman who’d written about Cleopatra’s younger sister, and the moderator said: “OK, so what parts of your life did you draw on to write this book?” And she was, like: “Well… I have a sister.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/mar/13/sarah-jessica-parker-kira-supernova-escape-from-planet-earth-aliens\">Sarah Jessica Parker: 'I don't think we're alone in the universe'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>The male studio bosses make more money out of Monica than Pandy. Does this also reflect a reality?</strong><br />Follow the line of the money and there’s always a man at the top. When I was [executive producer] on <em>Lipstick Jungle</em> [the NBC series based on her book of the same name], all our executives were women and there was a lot of talk about how difficult it is to get men to look seriously at women’s creative work. There’s the question of likability. It’s always in the room. We would say: we like her because she’s strong, she’s interesting. But a man would say: I’m worried people won’t like her if she does “X” or “Y”. This is why we need more female studio heads. Also, if something works, the men take the credit. If it doesn’t, they run away and it’s all the woman’s fault. That’s why I love it at the end of the novel when Pandy says to the studio boss: “Fuck you!”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/apr/19/sex-city-bushnell-hadley-freeman\">Hadley Freeman: rereading Sex and the City by Candace Bushnell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Like <em>Sex and the City</em>, the book tries to rebut the expectation that a woman must be in a couple if she does not want to be thought a freak. Why did you return to that?</strong><br />Growing up, the world was so sexist. Honestly, the very first day of school you were told who you were, what you could do and think, what your personality was supposed to be: sugar and spice and all things nice. The message was everywhere that women were second-class citizens. I’m surprised it’s still the case [that women who aren’t married are regarded with suspicion], but I’ve more understanding of it now, having been married for 10 years. When I finally got married [she and ballet dancer Charles Askegard divorced in 2012], a prominent female editor came up to me and said: “You’ll see. Now you’re married, life is going to get a whole lot better.” In a way, she was right. When you’re married, people don’t have to figure you out. You’re in a slot everyone understands and you do couple things and it’s easier to get a mortgage. It’s like you feel safe to other people.</p> \n<p>When I got divorced, I couldn’t get a mortgage; I didn’t fit into a computer model. All of a sudden, I was invited to no more couple things. Being single is hard and there’s something a bit heroic about it.</p> \n<p><strong>What did it feel like when <em>Sex and the City</em> took off?</strong><br />I’ve always been a very self-contained person. I’m me and that’s the case, no matter what happens. I don’t rely on the outside world to define me. It wasn’t something I took into my core, or relied on. It was great, but glitz and glamour don’t write the next book.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Follow the line of the money and there's always a man at the top</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Why was it such a hit?</strong><br />Impossible to say. There’s just an alchemy. In Hollywood, they call it “lightning in a bottle”.</p> \n<p><strong>Would you be happy for there to be a third <em>Sex and the City </em>movie? Or would you prefer to see <em>Killing Monica</em> make it to the big screen?</strong><br />There’s a lot of interest in <em>Monica</em> in Hollywood. But it’s not an either/or. Why can’t there be both? There isn’t that much female entertainment out there. There are a zillion guys out there making a zillion bad things. I mean, come on! Why must there only be one?</p> \n<p><strong>Pandy is in her mid-40s. Would you like to see more women her age on screen?</strong><br />Yes, because if you’re a woman, society wants to make you invisible as soon as you’re middle aged. You do need to reinvent yourself. You have to reset your goals, and you do need new passions. Nobody talks about this, but if you have the courage, it can be the time when you finally get to look at aspects of yourself that you weren’t able to explore when you were younger because you were so busy trying to live up to society’s expectations.</p> \n<p>I’m nearly 60 and, honestly, I feel great. You give yourself permission to stop doing things you didn’t really enjoy. There’s a weird kind of rebirth. There are exciting new things to do. I spend more time exercising and biking and I’ve got a horse. In a weird way, it has taken me back to that time in a girl’s life before she discovers boys. It’s like being 12 again.</p> \n<p><strong>What will you do next?</strong><br />What I really want to do is write another Monica book. She’ll be holed up in Wallis [in Connecticut, where she was born]. Maybe she and SondraBeth [the actress who plays Monica] will get their revenge on Doug Stone [a sleazy, two-timing actor].</p> \n<p><strong>What do you write in? Tell me you don’t wear Manolos.</strong><br />No, I’m in the soft pants. Like pyjamas. Maybe they’re plaid. I don’t look the way I do in photoshoots every day and I wouldn’t want to have to. Honestly, I can barely even stand to get my hair coloured.</p> \n<p><em>Killing Monica is published by Little, Brown (&pound;14.99). </em></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/293520/\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for &pound;11.99</em></a></p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434541410983/Candace-Bushnell-QA-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'I've always been a very self-contained person': Candace Bushnell at home in Roxbury, Connecticut.

But with my brother [Duane, who was killed in a motorbike accident in 1971, aged 24] there were two or three cooks in the kitchen, or more, and you need a focal point.</p> \n<p><strong>Duane and I were raised in Panhandle, Florida. </strong>We used to listen to a station that called itself “The black spot on your dial”. It played Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf, and it hit Duane and me like spaghetti hitting a wall. The DJ used to play romantic music, too, and speak to his girlfriend, saying: “I’m on my way over – so get on that black neglig&eacute;e.” He’d play <em>The Sermon!</em> by Jimmy Smith and a track called “Flamingo”, and it sent us across the tracks – because that’s where the music was.</p> \n<p><strong>I learned to play mostly from black people:</strong> the clubs on Daytona Beach, Surf Bar, Paradise, all black dudes. Once Ma came in while we were playing with Hank Moore. He was teaching us “Done Somebody Wrong” and she says: “What you doing with a nigger in the front room?” But she was just having a bad day. We were raised not to hate black people, and Mother did a good job.</p> \n<p><strong>My only regret is that we didn’t play more in Europe. </strong>Oh yes, Knebworth, 1974, that was great, and we played some great gigs in Germany, but not enough in Europe or the UK or even on the west coast of America. We had a booking agent who kept us too much in the south and on the east coast.</p> \n<p><strong>I love Sherlock Holmes. </strong>The intelligence and intuition of that cat is amazing. When I started reading Conan Doyle, I wanted to be a detective in old Scotland Yard.</p> \n<p><strong>Duane was the king of laughter</strong>, always making jokes. Just last year, the Allman Brothers played our last gig. It was at the Beacon in New York and everyone was at their best. You’ve got to keep laughing. It was what Duane would have done, and wanted us to do. The laugh has stayed the same: someone took a picture of the final bow, and I saw myself there, and it’s just the same laugh. Same posture as I’m doing on the cover of <em>At Fillmore East</em>. Same at the Beacon as right there on the cover in 1971 with Duane and Berry Oakley, who also passed on through.</p> \n<p><strong>At the time, after my brother and then Berry went</strong> we thought: “Why are we left, why us?” But after three major operations, all ways and sideways, a huge hernia and God knows what else, it’s the beginning for my new band. Big sound, good sound, some of it’s better than <em>Fillmore East</em>: three horn players, Bobby Bland’s tenor sax, me on Hammond and guitar. By coincidence, they all grew up playing my music – and by the way, I’m the oldest.</p> \n<p><em>Gregg Allman plays the Ramblin’ Man Fair at Mote Park, Maidstone, on 26 July (</em><a href=\"http://ramblinmanfair.com/\"><em>ramblinmanfair.com</em></a><em>)</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434551596180/Gregg-Allman-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'We used to listen to a station that called itself “The black spot on your dial”': Gregg Allman.

It would be enough to put anyone off even having a go, but Rhys Ifans has stepped bravely up to the plate for this hyperactive, highly coloured adaptation directed by Kevin Allen.</p> \n<p>Under Milk Wood, famously, originated as a radio play that Thomas wrote for the BBC, and was first broadcast in 1954 after the poet’s death. With its discursive verse style, it’s a resolutely uncinematic text, for all its evocative qualities: the addition of actual images, you would suppose, would be superfluous. Allen’s version has stuck largely to illustration: Ifans speaks melodically over the top, with intricately structured scenes and tableaux doing the visual heavy lifting.<br /></p> \n<p>As with the 70s version, directed by Andrew Sinclair, room has to be found for Thomas’ multitude of comedy characters – Organ Morgan, Dai Bread, Willy Nilly, and all the rest – though fortunately the new film avoids anything as idiotic as Elizabeth Taylor’s participation in the earlier film, playing passed-away good-time girl Rosie Probert. The nearest Allen gets to that is the celebrity casting of Charlotte Church as the alive-and-well good-time-girl Polly Garter; but Church is in fact pretty good in the role, a wholesome apple-cheeked type who gets up to all sorts in the woods.</p> \n<p>Allen’s film comes across as a kind of fast-moving fever-dream – appropriately enough, given the swelling tide of fantasy that Thomas instils in the drama: everyone, and everything, is operating through a sweaty film of lust or delusion. Allen also amps up what you might call the bawdiness quotient: from the orgasmic yelps in the background of the opening dream sequence, to the continual incidents of jiggling and writhing, there’s an entertaining Carry-On-ish edge to things that forestalls any hint of pomposity. With its energy and attack this is an Under Milk Wood that is funny and entertaining, and never gets bogged down.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434729369978/e26fa9a2-b5bd-4856-afe2-034e91b81c98-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Richard Brewis/PR","altText":"Under Milk Wood film still","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Richard Brewis/PR"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-20T17:20:11Z","lastModified":"2015-06-20T17:21:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":4,"contributors":[{"name":"Andrew Pulver","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/andrewpulver"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Edinburgh film festival","edinburgh film festival 2015","Festivals","Culture","Film","Dylan Thomas","Books","Film adaptations","Rhys Ifans","Charlotte Church","Music","Poetry","Radio","Television","Television & radio"],"tags":[{"id":"film/edinburghfilmfestival","webTitle":"Edinburgh film festival"},{"id":"film/edinburgh-film-festival-2015","webTitle":"edinburgh film festival 2015"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"books/dylanthomas","webTitle":"Dylan Thomas"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"film/film-adaptations","webTitle":"Film adaptations"},{"id":"film/rhys-ifans","webTitle":"Rhys Ifans"},{"id":"music/charlotte-church","webTitle":"Charlotte Church"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"books/poetry","webTitle":"Poetry"},{"id":"culture/radio","webTitle":"Radio"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Andrew Pulver","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/andrewpulver"}}],"starRating":"4","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/20/under-milk-wood-film-review-rhys-ifans-dylan-thomas-edinburgh","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ax5e","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/jun/20/under-milk-wood-film-review-rhys-ifans-dylan-thomas-edinburgh","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/20/under-milk-wood-film-review-rhys-ifans-dylan-thomas-edinburgh"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434729369978/e26fa9a2-b5bd-4856-afe2-034e91b81c98-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Under Milk Wood film still.

At 37, he seems a natural shuffler, feet moving in small increments, shoulders rounded. It’s a manner he adopted to devastating effect as the titular homeless man in the hugely moving TV film <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/sep/24/theweekendstvstuartalife\" title=\"\">Stuart: A&nbsp;Life Backwards</a>, the first time I paid him proper attention. That suggestion of tender vulnerability is Hardy’s special skill (blame the sleepy eyes and baby-face features); Brando had it, and comparisons have been made. There’s a moment in Mad Max, when he offers Splendid (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2492819/\" title=\"\">Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley</a>) a thumbs up&nbsp;and a weak smile, that really captures the Hardy brand, what I’m&nbsp;calling “tough puppy”.</p> \n<p>But Hardy can turn it on its head, too: in <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/bronson\" title=\"\">Bronson</a>, as notorious long-term prisoner Charles Bronson, he’s&nbsp;all beefed-up swagger, imbuing the character with&nbsp;more menace than wild eyes and maniacal laughter could convey. And his mumble! It would be irritating if it weren’t for all that talent.</p> \n<p>Off-screen, Hardy’s back story offers a perfect Hollywood arc: middle-class British childhood derailed by delinquency (“What an arse I must have been to my poor parents,” <a href=\"http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/film-tv/8074/tom-hardy-esquire-interview/\" title=\"\">he has said of his school days</a>), and substance abuse that almost ended his career before it took off. Then: redemption, and solid work. Plus, <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/04/tom-hardy-dogs\" title=\"\">he loves dogs</a>.
