Davies, who now lives in Lancaster, beat writers including the American authors Karen E Bender and Tony Earley, and the British writer Kirsty Gunn, to win this year’s prize.</p> \n<p>Her collection, <a href=\"http://www.carys-davies.co.uk/#/books/4564457240\">The Redemption of Galen Pike</a>, is published by the small UK independent press Salt. Its subjects span the world, with stories set everywhere from a remote Australian settlement, where a young wife has a secret, to a Colorado jail, where a Quaker woman meets a condemned man in his final hours in the title story.</p> \n<p>“Galen Pike’s crime revolted Patience more than she could say, and on her way to the jailhouse to meet him for the first time, she told herself she wouldn’t think of it; walking past the closed bank, the shuttered front of the general store, the locked-up haberdasher’s, the drawn blinds of the dentist, she averted her gaze,” <a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/fiction/the-redemption-of-galen-pike\">writes Davies</a>. “She would do what she always did with the felons; she would bring Galen Pike something to eat and drink, she would sit with him and talk to him and keep him company in the days that he had left.”</p> \n<p>The Irish novelist &Eacute;ibhear Walshe, part of the judging panel for this year’s prize, called it “a truly original and striking collection, full of funny, keenly observed stories replete with twists and turns that surprise”.</p> \n<p>Davies, Walshe said, was a “remarkable voice”, adding: “The language is economical with not a word to spare. Davies takes historical moments and themes and examines them in novel ways which intrigue the reader.”</p> \n<p>The author pronounced herself “delighted, grateful, and completely astonished” to win the prize, which is sponsored by Cork city council and by the school of English, University College Cork.</p> \n<p>Patrick Cotter, award director, praised Davies as a “gifted writer”, and her press Salt as “a small independent, gritty publisher which has been dedicated to the short story for over a decade, often publishing more short story titles in a year than the imprints of major international conglomerates”.</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436371493167/697d6396-d714-40be-ab04-d25f386c6b9e-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jonathan Bean","altText":"Carys Davies","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jonathan Bean"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-08T16:21:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-08T17:07:13Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":5,"contributors":[{"name":"Alison Flood","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/alisonflood"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Frank O'Connor award","Short stories","Fiction","Books","Awards and prizes","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"books/frankoconnoraward","webTitle":"Frank O'Connor award"},{"id":"books/short-stories","webTitle":"Short stories"},{"id":"books/fiction","webTitle":"Fiction"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"culture/awards-and-prizes","webTitle":"Awards and prizes"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"books"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Alison Flood","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/alisonflood"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"books"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jul/08/frank-oconnor-award-short-stories-carys-davies-the-redemption-of-galen-pike","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4afkf","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/books/2015/jul/08/frank-oconnor-award-short-stories-carys-davies-the-redemption-of-galen-pike","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/08/frank-oconnor-award-short-stories-carys-davies-the-redemption-of-galen-pike"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436371493167/697d6396-d714-40be-ab04-d25f386c6b9e-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Carys Davies said she was ‘delighted, grateful, and completely astonished’ Photograph: Jonathan Bean","credit":"Jonathan Bean","altText":"Carys Davies","cleanCaption":"Carys Davies said she was ‘delighted, grateful, and completely astonished’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jonathan Bean"}},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"Frank O'Connor award"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436371493167/697d6396-d714-40be-ab04-d25f386c6b9e-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jonathan Bean","altText":"Carys Davies","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jonathan Bean"}}]},{"title":"Star Wars spin-off / Should Aaron Paul play Han Solo?","rawTitle":"Should Aaron Paul play Han Solo?","item":{"type":"article","id":"film/filmblog/2015/jul/08/star-wars-spin-off-aaron-paul-han-solo-plot","title":"Star Wars spin-off: should Aaron Paul play Han Solo – and what about the plot?","trailText":"Should the younger take on the iconic space smuggler be fresh-faced or early-stage world-weary?

Here are five key questions Miller and Lord need to answer before the cameras roll.</p> \n<h2>How old should Solo be, and who should play him?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29b1188515c2cb496545582f18bfe7c96fd26988\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436357509151/96063384-d1bb-4db0-8140-ce5b87c86fe1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"From Mad Max to Han Solo? …&nbsp;Nicholas Hoult.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From Mad Max to Han Solo? … Nicholas Hoult</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/14/nicholas-hoult-mad-max-fury-road-interview\">Mad Max’s Nicholas Hoult on hanging off lorries and channeling Andrex puppies</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Reports suggest that Lord and Miller’s take will be an origins story, and Star Wars lore reckons Solo was around 29 during the events of the first movie, so it’s perhaps unsurprising that Hollywood sites have been pushing young twentysomethings such as Taron Egerton (25), Ansel Elgort (21) and Nicholas Hoult (25) for the role of the iconic space smuggler. Yet Ford himself was 33 when he began filming Star Wars, his seniority over Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) giving Solo an essential wily world-weariness. And there’s something about the idea of a fresh-faced take on the Corellian scoundrel that jars. </p> \n<p>If Disney-owned Lucasfilm is looking to ape the success of Marvel with its plan for a Star Wars cinematic universe, it should bear in mind that its sister studio has generally plumped for seasoned actors over callow ingenues when casting iconic heroes. Picking an act in their early 30s, perhaps playing a few years younger, would allow Solo to retain just enough of his “been around the block” swagger to keep him recognisable to fans. If Aaron Paul (35 and bookies’ favourite), Taylor Kitsch (34) and Chris Pratt (36) are just too old for the role – well they’d still make better choices than those previously mentioned. Paul, at least, seems more than keen, and someone at Star Wars – even if it’s just the social media editor – is evidently interested.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/aaronpaul_8/statuses/618633123304243200\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">My dreams are coming true. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarWars?src=hash\">#StarWars</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/RuyQ1iTfIg\">https://t.co/RuyQ1iTfIg</a></p>— Aaron Paul (@aaronpaul_8) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronpaul_8/status/618633123304243200\">July 8, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Then again, the American actor just doesn’t look like a Han Solo type to me, though perhaps I’m being swayed by hours of watching him as a whiny meth addict in Breaking Bad. Second-favourite Aaron Taylor-Johnson has the right mix of brawn and swagger, and is capable of playing older than his 25 years.</p> \n<h2>How did Han and Chewbacca meet?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76e1395993dbe75b156cdce8f2407c34e2d816d5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436356885117/77212129-069f-4e49-a51f-3e4437c3ff7a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Good old days …&nbsp;Han and Chewie in the new movie.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Good old days … Han and Chewbacca in the new movie The Force Awakens.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/gallery/2014/jan/16/behind-the-scenes-of-star-wars-in-pictures\">Behind the scenes of Star Wars – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Since the Wookiee co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon is more than 200 years old during the events of the original trilogy, it stands to reason that he and Solo were not always friends. Expanded-universe novels about the smuggler suggest he met his eventual sidekick while working as a pilot on an Imperial slave ship. After he refuses orders to flay the wookiee, Solo and his new pal escape with the help of rebels and the hairy eight-foot-tall humanoid swears a life debt to his saviour. Disney is highly unlikely to borrow too much from the non-canonical books, but Lord and Miller will surely take the chance to bring back one of the saga’s best-known heroes, and explain why he displays such selfless loyalty to Solo. See also: How did Han meet Lando Calrissian and successfully prise the Falcon from his old pal’s possession.</p> \n<h2>Why does Solo hate the Force?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"472fe9037ba61c27df98b06a391c60b2352e9772\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436356936799/96dee2c4-0cf8-4994-a523-6e6e4bb91adb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Gunning for the Force, but why? …&nbsp;Han Solo.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gunning for the Force, but why? … Han Solo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/LUCASFILM/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Han displays a determined scorn for Jedi-like behaviour in the events of the original trilogy. Again, the expanded universe has an answer here, suggesting that the young Solo was once the victim of a religious fraud which left him a distinct non-believer in regard to spiritual matters. The smart route for Lord and Miller would be to avoid delving too deep into such matters: it’s enough for us to know that the Jedi were almost extinct at the beginning of 1977’s Star Wars, so it would hardly be rare for more cynical citizens of the galaxy to view their supposed powers as the stuff of myth and legend. We do, however, need to know how Solo became so world-weary in the first place.</p> \n<h2>How did Han upset Jabba the Hutt?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bbde1c3a550c809f2de73d499e79ca4f2cc1067\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436356995270/62cfd932-5554-42e8-8418-97a4bdace2a8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Han and Jabba the Hut\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mountain out of a molehill? … Han and Jabba</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>George Lucas’s decision to include a CGI version of the corpulent alien in the 1997 special edition of Star Wars will always go down as one of the most misguided film-making decisions ever to rear its ugly head in Hollywood. And Miller and Lord will presumably think carefully before introducing their own youthful, perambulatory version of the iconic gangster. Nevertheless, we know from the original movies that Solo owes a large debt to Jabba that he is either unwilling or unable to pay before being captured by Darth Vader’s forces in Cloud City and transported to the repugnant alien’s Tatooinese lair. Surely the origins of this storyline will play some part in the new film.</p> \n<h2>Did Han really make the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs, and what does that even mean?</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bosSsgzgenA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bosSsgzgenA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/apr/16/star-wars-jj-abrams-the-force-awakens\">Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer – a return to the series' strengths</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Solo’s boast at the beginning of 1977’s Star Wars can be read in a number of ways. Since a parsec is a unit of distance, rather than time, the smuggler may simply have been talking a load of nonsense in order to secure the patronage of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker for their trip to Alderaan. George Lucas has said the apparent paradox of a ship covering an 18 parsec route without travelling the full distance can be explained by the Falcon’s advanced navigational computer rather than its engines, which allow it to calculate a smarter route. The expanded universe picks up on the anomaly, suggesting the route itself skirted a cluster of black holes, with Solo managing to cut down his travel time by flying dangerously close to the cosmic bodies. Now wouldn’t that make a scene to rival Han’s romp through the Hoth asteroid field in The Empire Strikes Back?<br /></p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436357459132/d5bbe472-7898-4c0a-907d-4f016e547917-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Larry Busacca/Getty Images","altText":"Aaron Paul in 2014.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Larry Busacca/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436357510527/96063384-d1bb-4db0-8140-ce5b87c86fe1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"From Mad Max to Han Solo? … Nicholas Hoult","credit":"Allstar/WARNER BROS.

What have you ever done to combat possibly the greatest terror of our time? I bet the answer is: nothing.</p> \n<p>No idea is a bad idea when we’re brainstorming counter-terrorism. Because it’s not like pop artists don’t have form for attempting to solve tricky international problems with their singing-and-dancing expertise. Look at Geldof, with his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/mediamonkeyblog/2014/nov/17/bob-geldof-cut-off-by-sky-news-for-saying-bollocks-twice\" title=\"\">angry demands for money</a>.

If history has taught us anything, it’s that the only real chance for peace and tranquillity in our time is to wrench power away from the suits and give it to our pop stars.</p> \n<p>To that end, I think it’s time more of our pop idols did a Shaggy, and mucked in to rid the world of despair and general menace. Because if just one teenager listens to Shaggy and decides, “Actually, maybe I won’t join Isis after all. Maybe I’ll sing catchy pop songs about being caught in flagrante on, of all places, a bathroom floor, the place statistically most likely to have piss on it in the whole house” – it will not have been in vain.</p> \n<p>I’d like to see more pop stars getting on board with Shaggy’s anti-Isis message, getting a bit more proactive. You feel that both <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/adele\" title=\"\">Adele</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2013/aug/09/pitbull-latin-pop-rap-review\" title=\"\">Pitbull</a> would be exceptionally handy in a fight: why have they not been airlifted in to kick seven shades out of Isis in a Syrian alleyway? <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/jessie-j\" title=\"\">Jessie J</a> can use her piercing vocal range as a noise weapon, with very little tweaking to her current musical output.

You cannot. You’ve got a rocket launcher in your hand, aimed at the clear blue sky. The sound of helicopters in the distance, hatred in your heart. “Lisa was essentially just a trumped-up dancer,” H from Steps whispers. You put your weapons down.</p> \n<p>Sam Smith, no bandwagon too desperate for him to slide on to, gently and fragilely performs <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB-5XG-DbAA\" title=\"\">Stay With Me</a> in the middle of a warzone, soldiers from both sides too confused by the fact that his haircut is consistently just a little bit too narrow for his skull to bother firing their weapons any more. And lo, once more pop has saved the day.</p> \n<p>Music is powerful and pop stars are the conduit for it. Can people get pregnant without reggae? They cannot. Can they get high on Jamaican weed without music? Also no. Can it stop wars? If Shaggy has anything to say about it, yes it can. Thank you, Shaggy, your plan is watertight. Truly, the west is blessed to have you.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436369224864/Reggae-singer-Shaggy-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Shaggy advocates 'bagging some Jamaican weed, then distribute it amongst Isis.

According to the two-time Oscar winner, an American obsession with image and social media has enabled international actors to take many of the top American roles away from US male actors.</p> \n<p>“Clearly, it breaks down on two fronts,” he said. “In Britain they take their training seriously while in the States, we’re going through a sort of social media image-conscious thing rather than formal training.

He actually gets to record on the phone and do the [table] reads on the phone. So we’ve never kept him from doing that stuff,” Jean told Entertainment Weekly in May.<br /></p> \n<p>But the door was left open for Shearer to return, and he tweeted later that month that “discussions are happening at a level where decisions can be made”.
