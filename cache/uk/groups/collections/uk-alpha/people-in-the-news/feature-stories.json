My son is getting ready to grow up in this world and I’m trying to raise a good man who values and appreciates women, and here we have this attack on women in the media that I don’t see a stop happening.”</p> \n<p>Bullock, mother to a five-year-old son, Louis, said she felt concern for children growing up in 2015. “Little girls are having the hardest time with bullying and the internet.

And I laughed when [People] said they’re gonna be generous and bestow me this wonderful privilege, but I said if I can talk about the amazing women who I find beautiful, which are these women who rise above and take care of business and do wonderful things, and take care of each other, then I’m more than honoured to be on the cover of this.”</p> \n<p>In related news, actor Anna Faris has revealed in a newly-published interview that she feels women in Hollywood are “pitted against one another”, while their male equivalents enjoy a strong support network.<br /></p> \n<p>“As women, we definitely have to generate our own work,” Faris, who produced her comedies The House Bunny and What’s Your Number, <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/halle-berry-anna-faris-patricia-805315\">told the Hollywood Reporter</a>. “Part of it is just the sad fact that something like one in every three to four roles is a woman.

It was a sanctuary for early pilgrims, a symbol of resistance in the Napoleonic invasion, and a protector of Catalan culture and language during the regime of Franco.</p> \n<p>Now this tiny chapel, still home to Benedictine monks, has once again found itself on the map. A 10 year-long project of restoration has seen the celebrated Irish painter Sean Scully transform the chapel with 22 of his works, from the vast abstract paintings for which he is famed, to frescoes, stained glass and metal candlesticks. They will hang in the chapel permanently, establishing the church as a unique cultural sanctum that will draw visitors from across the world.</p> \n<p>Scully, who has been nominated for the Turner prize twice and whose paintings now fetch upwards of &pound;1m, described the chapel as one of the most “significant and important” works of his career. </p> \n<p>Scully, who was born in Dublin but moved to London when he was five, has had a studio in Barcelona since 1994 and the <a href=\"http://www.santaceciliamontserrat.com/en/index.html\">Santa Cecilia project</a> was conceived after a chance meeting with Father Josep M. Soler, director of the nearby museum of Montserrat nearly 10 years ago. Standing in the middle of the chapel, which opens to the public on 2 July, Scully said he had no idea it would become so important.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2015/jan/07/sean-scully-painter-interview\">Sean Scully: ‘‘My therapist sent me away’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I’m very passive,” said the artist, who opened the chapel on the day of his 70th birthday. “They gave me no instructions about what I could do with the space, just gave me complete liberty so originally I thought I would put one big painting in it and then a couple of other things and that would be it. But bit by bit it grew in importance and became more and more beautiful with every artwork. It’s like everything with me, I never really make decisions, I just sail through life.</p> \n<p>Certainly Scully’s popularity speaks for itself. Having lived in New York since 1975, his work is held in most major museum collections of the United States as well as the Tate and the Royal Academy in London, and he is one of the most successful Western artists in China. He counts Bono among his collectors and guests at the opening of the chapel included former world champion boxer Barry McGuigan, who travelled from Ireland.</p> \n<p>“Look at the brutal beauty of all these things,” marvels McGuigan, walking into the monastery. “This is one of the most incredible things I’ve ever seen.”</p> \n<p>Walking into the modest chapel, which has been restored for the first time since the 1920s, the viewer is first greeted with one of Scully’s vast, grey and black Doric paintings, which he chose specifically for the space, while a small fresco made up of abstract squares of brown, black and yellow pigment is painted beneath a window filled with stained yellow glass. Candlesticks and candelabras also designed by Scully frame the altar.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cbc5618f79731b8f5de8954530225786871f1d61\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/cbc5618f79731b8f5de8954530225786871f1d61/0_0_3872_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Santa Cecilia de Montserrat, a thousand-year-old monastery on the hills above Barcelona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Santa Cecilia de Montserrat, a thousand-year-old monastery on the hills above Barcelona.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The final wing of the monastery is dominated by the largest work, a series of 14 panels embedded in dark steel. None of the works are overtly religious, and while the 14 panels make a vague reference to the stations of the cross, the work is more of a homage to Scully’s mother, Ivy, to whom the piece is dedicated.</p> \n<p>Indeed, despite agreeing to create works for a Catholic church and creating three crosses from glass – two of which hang on the wall and one which stands on the altar – Scully says he has a complex relationship with religion. </p> \n<p>“When it comes to religion I sleep with anybody,” he said. “If they wanted me to do a synagogue, I’ll do a synagogue. It’s about the spirituality for me, I’m not promoting a brand.” </p> \n<p>He continues: “The Catholicism did not feed into the work. My work is concerned with spirituality and with a belief that human beings are sacred – I think we all are – but I wouldn’t say that it’s particularly bound up with Catholicism. For me it’s bound up with something more universal rather than belief or non-belief.”</p> \n<p>Instead of religious imagery, it is his mother, who died in 2001, who is a strong presence throughout the chapel. Her musical background is felt particularly strongly in his painting Cecilia, which hangs in the heart of the chapel, with two insets that recall a musical score.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a8cbb3c8befdce6cbfba97e5ee6db609fa176221\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a8cbb3c8befdce6cbfba97e5ee6db609fa176221/0_0_3872_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sean Scully works on his art\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sean Scully works on his art</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Cecilia is the patron saint of music and my mother was a singer,” Scully said. “When we were little kids we would go to the Vaudeville and my mother would sing Unchained Melody and she would always bring the house down. So I was very struck by that musical connection when I was choosing works.” </p> \n<p>The thought behind the bright frescoes, he added, was to “to add a little joy to the chapel”. “I didn’t want it to get too heavy, because people always associate spirituality with great austerity and great deprivation and it doesn’t have to be like that.” </p> \n<p>Having first viewed the chapel when it was in a state of decay, Scully also decided to make works that were “indestructible”, meaning most of the paintings are done on metal and steel, and the artist is firm in his belief that the works will “still be here in a thousand years”.</p> \n<p>With shows currently at the Venice Biennale, the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin, in China and across Asia and with a new sculpture exhibition about to open at the estate of Chateau La Coste in Provence, his success is almost unparalleled in contemporary art. Indeed, the Montserrat chapel has already been compared to the Matisse Chapel in the French Riviera and the Rothko Chapel in Texas, though Scully has mixed feelings about the Rothko comparison.</p> \n<p>“That Rothko Chapel is very depressing and bleak and you have to really wring the paintings out to get anything out of them, it is like sucking on a stone,” he said. “It is really interesting how the myth of Rothko is bigger than the work, which is obviously assisted by suicide and the symbolism of that red colour of his works.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\"

But the reality is that Terminator Genisys is part remake, part reboot, mostly failure. Sold simultaneously on the promise of returning to the franchise’s roots and innovating for a new generation, instead, Thor: The Dark World director Alan Taylor’s sequel apes the first two films’ iconicism, but falls short of achieving any in its own right.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62E4FJTwSuc\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/62E4FJTwSuc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch the Terminator Genisys trailer\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is sent back in time by John Connor (Jason Clarke) to protect his mother, Sarah Connor (Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke), from the Terminator.

They’re aided by a version of the Terminator (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1340138/reference\">re-christened the Guardian</a> and played by Schwarzenegger) that’s been watching out for Sarah since an attack on her family by the machines left her orphaned as a child.

There’s the yellow dump truck, a lookalike of its cigar-chomping driver and naked CGI Arnold, crouched in the shallow blasted out by his time-travelling orb. The punks are still there, still wondering what’s wrong with this picture. Kyle’s feathercut has gone, but he still pulls on his stolen high tops languorously enough to give the Nike branding a good showing.

The lore is disconnected and rewired, making for a confusing, but sporadically entertaining ride for anyone who remembers the originals. At times Taylor offers a Comic Relief sketch version of The Terminator: more ridiculous than revolutionary. </p> \n<p>Genisys – because of its 12A certification – lacks the first two chapters’ wallop. Cameron’s films were unusual for mainstream cinema in that they sutured violence to character to give it meaning. The Terminator was murderous without thought, but with cause. The gore – the body horror of the Terminator repairing an eye socket or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mStmiGS43jQ\">flaying an arm to prove a point</a> – was grounded in the story. The slaughter of humanity felt real. There’s no fear here. No real sense of dread. The techno-paranoid get an Apple-ish operating system (the Genisys of the title) to worry about, but a tablet can’t inspire terror. The CGI doesn’t look to have evolved much from Judgement Day. The film feels soft and phoney. In the original Terminator Kyle Reese described how the humans could tell when the robots were trying to pass themselves off as alive: “They had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.” Watching Genisys, you can relate.</p> \n<p>Salvation was boring, but Genisys makes you sad. Risk-averse Hollywood has made a crash-test dummy of a once great franchise, simply throwing everything at it to see what it stands. It’s heartbreaking to watch Arnie execute the same old programmes: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyTHz9N5KNE\">the terrible robo-smile</a>; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHRqgxA8wZs\">the slang</a>; the wear and tear of his living tissue revealing the cyborg underneath. “Old, but not obsolete,” the Terminator/Guardian tells us when his age is brought into question. In truth, it feels like both.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f35a6d0c-f30f-47a2-836a-d69930fd0c47\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435656337224/512a7546-4910-4ff7-a91e-6d3616442c9c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Schwarzenegger in Terminator: Genisys.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old version ...

Judgment Day redefined the action genre, CGI and the star system, creating a thirst for sequels that still leads studio decision-making today. It was a radical film, one that escaped the B-movie trappings of its predecessor by locking into a genuinely terrifying vision of mankind supplanted. Cameron wasn’t scared to move on either. The penultimate scene – with the Terminator sacrificing himself to save the future – implied the director was quitting while he was ahead. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2013/jun/28/terminator-5-reanimate-ailing-franchise\">Terminator 5: how to reanimate the ailing sci-fi franchise</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Today – with our <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/23/tom-holland-spider-man-marvel-sony\">rebooted, rebooted Spider-Man</a> and ever-expanding “cinematic universes” – not even death can kill a pop culture hero.
