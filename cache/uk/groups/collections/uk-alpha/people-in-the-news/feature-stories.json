She had announced that she would <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jun/21/taylor-swift-criticises-shocking-disappointing-apple-music\">withhold her current album</a>, 1989, from the corporate behemoth’s new streaming service, Apple Music, because it would not be paying royalties to artists during the service’s first three months.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jun/22/apple-music-royalties-free-trial-taylor-swift\">Apple Music to pay royalties during free trial: 'We hear you Taylor Swift'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Apple’s subsequent climbdown – the company claims it had already been considering it after being pressurised by independent labels – is a victory for musicians, who now stand to be paid an as-yet-undisclosed royalty (rival service Spotify pays a lordly $0.006 to $0.0084 per stream). </p> \n<p>Yet it is a bigger victory for Swift, who in the last 12 months joined an elite group of artists who wield considerable clout in the music industry. </p> \n<p>Her net worth has been estimated at $200m (&pound;125m) by entertainment website Vulture. Her wealth – derived from record sales and touring, as well as her own fragrance range and property holdings – gives her the luxury of not having to care about putting bigwig noses out of joint. And she uses that power.</p> \n<p>She has form with streaming companies: last autumn, she pulled her entire catalogue from Spotify in a protest against its royalty rate, and urged others to do the same. She says musicians and producers queued to thank her for taking a stand.</p> \n<p>If she had denied Apple Music access to 1989 – which undoubtedly would have led to other artists following suit – the resulting Swift-shaped void would have seen the service launch without one of the year’s biggest-selling records. </p> \n<p>In its first week of release last October, the album sold nearly 1.3m copies in the US alone, and is now approaching 9m sales worldwide. Overall, Swift’s five studio albums have sold 40m copies globally.</p> \n<p>Viewed as both an advocate for artists and a game-changer – almost no other pop star could have made Apple Music roll over – the 25-year-old Pennsylvanian is arguably the world’s most powerful female music star. The other contender for that status, Beyonc&eacute;, is almost more brand than human being these days, promoting her new 22 Days vegan diet programme with exactly the same tirelessness as her feminist message. </p> \n<p>Swift, therefore, has a better shot at winning hearts and minds. Last November, Time magazine and Bloomberg Businessweek ran cover stories to that effect: “Taylor Swift is the music industry,” said Bloomberg, while Time headlined its piece “The Power of Taylor Swift”. </p> \n<p>Her 10-year career has reached a junction where critical approval, commercial success and cultural impact have coalesced. She is an influencer – the sort of celebrity who can say: “My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet … is that they all realise their worth and ask for it,” and know she will be listened to.</p> \n<p>Teenage fans adore her – it would be hard to be 14 years old and not see smart, talented, beautiful Swift as an aspirational figure. The music media revere her, too, for creating unstintingly honest music in a pop framework (which can be a bit shrill and preoccupied by vindictive feelings toward ex-boyfriends, but it gives a much greater insight into her inner workings than you would get from the perpetually guarded Beyonc&eacute;).</p> \n<p>Awards clutter her mantelpiece; presumably, she put up a new shelf to accommodate her most recent haul of eight Billboard gongs. And she has become a handy person to know, helping her friend Ed Sheeran before he broke big in America. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/aug/23/taylor-swift-shake-it-off\">Taylor Swift: ‘Sexy? Not on my radar'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>She is also different in having started as a country singer before successfully switching to pop. When her first album came out, she was 16 and had moved to Nashville to immerse herself in the country industry; nine years later, Country Taylor is a faint memory.</p> \n<p>The one thing she lacks – and, to judge by her lyrics, it irks her – is a mutually satisfying relationship. “I go on too many dates, but I can’t make them stay, at least that’s what people say,” she sang on the 2014 worldwide top-five single Shake it Off. The lyric was a neat send-up of the gossip magazine perception that there must be something wrong with her rather than her men, who have included One Direction singer Harry Styles and, currently, producer Calvin Harris. </p> \n<p>Moreover, the crux of the song is the defiant line: “Just think, while you’ve been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world, you could’ve been getting down to this sick beat.” (The phrase “this sick beat” became an internet meme, and Taylor subsequently applied to register the phrase as a trademark in the US.)</p> \n<p>Yet there are also songs such as the bitter We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, her first No 1 hit, which was said to be inspired by a relationship with songwriter John Mayer. For all her “this sick beat” bravado, there’s bottomless venom in the couplet: “You would hide away and find your peace of mind, with some indie record that’s much cooler than mine.” </p> \n<p>And a “feud” with singer Katy Perry – who apparently tried to hire some of Swift’s dancers – also roused her wrath to the extent that she wrote a furious track called Bad Blood. That also reached No 1. The video features a vengeful gang of her famous friends, among them actor Lena Dunham, model Cara Delevingne and rapper Kendrick Lamar, who train her up to attack a female adversary. Two things are gleaned from it: Swift’s reach extends well beyond the pop world, and she is in danger of being seen as a bully.</p> \n<p>Still, she is an interesting person to have around. Pop is currently full of strong female characters, of whom she is easily the most watchable. It would be satisfying to see her use her power for good. </p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a53374489db04aea52f87d209756bbd99380c4dc/0_202_3330_1999/3330.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1999,"width":3330,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"L.e.

He moved to England in 1965, living first in Walsall, West Midlands, where he worked in a foundry, then retiring to the north-east in 1989, living with one of his nine children.</p> \n<p>With 34 grandchildren and 63 great-grandchildren, Singh was always surrounded by family, said his grandson, Harvinder Gill, 31. “He was an incredible chap,” Gill, from Ashbrooke, Sunderland, said. “He has lived a very happy and fulfilling life.</p> \n<p>“For the past few weeks he has been suffering with a few illnesses. He has had pneumonia but he was a fighter. Unfortunately, his time has passed. It was early hours on Saturday, just before Father’s Day.”</p> \n<p>Singh was born on a farm in Punjab where he helped his family grow sugar cane, cotton, corn, wheat and later chilli, peanuts, potatoes and rice. He outlived his wife, Narajan Kaur, who died 12 years ago, as well as his two sisters and four brothers.</p> \n<p>Even into old age he kept his love of the outdoors – only giving up gardening at 107. He enjoyed drinking milk and almond oil, regularly ate fruit and had a nightly drop of whisky.</p> \n<p>After his 110th birthday, he was quoted in media reports as saying: “I feel very good and very happy. I still feel fit and strong. I pray to the lord to take me when he wants to.” He put his longevity down to “good family, good food and happiness”.</p> \n<p>“Eat healthy food and look after each other,” he said. “Family need to look after their elders.”</p> \n<p>Singh had returned to India in January, where he was being cared for by his two eldest sons. But he kept in touch regularly with relatives in the UK by phone.

DappsDaily.com’s source code appears to confirm this link.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Unitrending said they had submitted the layout of their site for public use.</p> \n<p>In an email to the Guardian, a Unitrending spokesman wrote: “I can’t view that site [DappsDaily.com], but we use the ‘newspaper’ <a href=\"http://themeforest.net/item/newspaper/5489609\">open source template</a> where you can download different versions of the template which is why it probably looked the same.”</p> \n<p>This would not explain why articles on O’Reilly’s site appeared to have been lifted from other sources.</p> \n<p>A statement on DappsDaily.com reads: “We’re always looking for high-quality content, if you feel you have something worth a look, get in touch.”</p> \n<p>So far, high-quality content includes <a href=\"http://dappsdaily.com/articles/girl-gives-guys-a-snapchat-guide-to-taking-dick-pics\">Girl Gives Guys A Snapchat Guide To Taking Dick Pics</a> and <a href=\"http://dappsdaily.com/articles/boyfriend-discovers-something-inside-his-girlfriend\">Boyfriend Discovers Something Inside His Girlfriend</a>.

It is not clear which period of his life the film will cover, but there are many to choose from: the defection itself, which took place in Paris with the help of the French police and a Parisian socialite friend named Clara Saint; his tempestuous love affair with Erik Bruhn, soloist at the Royal Danish Ballet; his forays into film via Ken Russell’s Valentino in 1967, and with Nastassja Kinski in 1983’s Exposed; his stage partnerships with dancers Margot Fonteyn and Yvette Chauvir&eacute;, or his 1983 appointment as director of the Paris Opera Ballet.</p> \n<p>Fiennes has history working with Hare, having starred in The Reader as a German lawyer who once had an affair with an older woman, Hanna Schmitz, later discovered to have previously worked as a Nazi concentration camp guard. Kate Winslet won the best actress Oscar at the 2009 awards for her role in Stephen Daldry’s film.</p> \n<p>The Nureyev drama is being put together at BBC Films by Philomena producer Gabrielle Tana and former Pathe executive Francois Ivernel. Fiennes will next be seen in front of the camera as spymaster M in the new James Bond film, Spectre, which debuts in November. He has directed two previous films, a 2011 adaptation of Shakespeare’s Coriolanus and 2013’s Charles Dickens biopic The Invisible Woman.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435044567630/7f588153-51c1-46a4-8d01-803da6afa3f3-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Michael Ward/Getty Images","altText":"Rudolf Nureyev","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Michael Ward/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T07:41:31Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T08:12:58Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ben Child","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/benchild"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Ralph Fiennes","Film","Culture","Rudolf Nureyev","Stage","David Hare","Dance"],"tags":[{"id":"film/ralphfiennes","webTitle":"Ralph Fiennes"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"stage/nureyev","webTitle":"Rudolf Nureyev"},{"id":"stage/stage","webTitle":"Stage"},{"id":"culture/david-hare","webTitle":"David Hare"},{"id":"stage/dance","webTitle":"Dance"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ben Child","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/benchild"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/23/ralph-fiennes-to-direct-but-not-star-in-rudolf-nureyev-drama","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a37p","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/jun/23/ralph-fiennes-to-direct-but-not-star-in-rudolf-nureyev-drama","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/23/ralph-fiennes-to-direct-but-not-star-in-rudolf-nureyev-drama"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435044567630/7f588153-51c1-46a4-8d01-803da6afa3f3-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Fiennes’ dancer … Rudolf Nureyev at the barre during rehearsal of Romeo and Juliet at the London Coliseum in 1980.

Not that I’m complaining,” said one of Mandelson’s supporters.</p> \n<p>The election of a new ceremonial figurehead for the university followed the completion of the seven-year tenure of current chancellor, Tom Bloxham, the founder of the Manchester-based property development company Urban Splash. Sissay will take up his new role on 1 August and an installation ceremony will take place at the university in October.</p> \n<p>Sissay is an associate artist at the Southbank Centre, patron of the <a href=\"http://www.letterboxclub.org.uk/about-us/\">Letterbox Club</a> – which provides educational support for looked-after children - and fellow of the Foundling Museum. He is also the author of a series of books of poetry, alongside articles, records, radio documentaries, public art, and plays.</p> \n<p>Brought up in Atherton, near Wigan, earlier this year Sissay made a series of programmes for BBC Manchester in which <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/poet-lemn-sissay-claims-physically-8608008\">he claimed</a> he was physically abused at a children’s home which is under investigation by police.</p> \n<p>His allegations are among more than 40 complaints of historical sexual and physical abuse at the former Wood End assessment centre in Atherton.

I look forward to welcoming him to the university community and working with him to promote our ambitious plans over the coming years.”</p> \n<p>Sissay said: “Reach for the top of the tree and you may get to the first branch, but reach for the stars and you’ll get to the top of the tree. My primary aim is to inspire and be inspired. </p> \n<p>“I am proud to be chancellor of this fantastic university and extremely grateful to everyone who voted for me.”</p> \n<p>Rothwell said she would be exploring with both Mandelson and Elder “other ways in which they may play a constructive role in supporting the university’s agenda going forward.”</p> \n<p>Michael Taylor, a Manchester-based entrepreneur and member of the university’s alumni association who helped on Mandelson’s campaign, said: “I take some comfort from Nancy’s statement that a role for Peter on Team Manchester is in her thoughts and plans. It remains a truth acknowledged where it matters that Peter has much to contribute to Manchester.</p> \n<p>“For all of us, that would be wonderful and I hope he has felt sufficiently encouraged and inspired to pursue that.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e2488a3802501bf66764b1a5ac8cf3e523c5cb25/0_355_1867_1120/1867.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1120,"width":1867,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tristram Kenton for the Guardian","altText":"Lemn Sissay in Why I Don't Hate White People @ Lyric Studio, Hammersmith\n(Opening 22-01-09)\n Tristram Kenton 01/09\n(3 Raveley Street, LONDON NW5 2HX TEL 0207 267 5550  Mob 07973 617 355)email: tristram@tristramkenton.com","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f0b1950212430a58c43fbf9395958f0637a0749b/0_276_4368_2622/4368.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2622,"width":4368,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mark Elder conducting the Hallé Orchestra in rehearsals at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester.
