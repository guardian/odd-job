Dave Franco, Alex Watson, Luke Hemsworth, the third Olsen. They can’t help but resemble knock-off versions of a designer brand: a bottle of Red Labial Johnny Walker whisky, or Hugu Boos perfume bought in a market. Only in rare cases can they hope to be judged on their own merits. So far, Kevin Dillon is being gracious about my interest in his brother, heartthrob <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000369/\">Matt Dillon</a>.</p> \n<p>“I’ve been called ‘Matt’s brother’ my whole life,” he explains. Both have always worked as actors – but while the older Dillon found fame and critical adulation in 80s classics such as <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/rumble-fish\">Rumble Fish</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2014/aug/14/why-id-like-to-be-matt-dillon-in-the-outsiders-movie\">The Outsiders</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77099/drugstore.cowboy\">Drugstore Cowboy</a>, Kevin earned his keep playing bruisers and bullies in mostly forgotten films and TV movies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44568486f75c9c7b2b68e86d8ea8c1dac48a14d4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434552576774/894ed2d6-f5ec-4a9c-af56-4a62c0e474bc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kevin Dillon (left) with his brother Matt in 2006.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Dillon (left) with his brother Matt in 2006.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: K Mazur/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And yet I am interviewing him in a plush suite at the Beverly Hilton so, at some point, something went right. That something was undoubtedly eight seasons spent portraying <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2011/sep/10/entourage-jonathan-bernstein-wahlberg\">Johnny “Drama” Chase</a> in the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/entourage\">HBO show Entourage</a>, a role he has reprised for <a href=\"http://entouragemovie.com/#/trailer\">the movie version</a>, which is released in the UK on Friday. By the end of its run, in 2011, the show was a joke stretched thinner than an A-lister’s septum. But with its mindless fun and glittering Hollywood cameos, Entourage makes more sense for 90 minutes on the big screen than a decade on small.</p> \n<p>The series followed the ascent of a hot young movie star (Vincent Chase, played by Adrian Grenier) and his hangers-on, including a less attractive, less successful, delusional wannabe actor brother, played by – well, let’s not labour the point. Most actors are flattered when you ask whether a role was written specifically for them, but Dillon’s face falls a little. “No, I auditioned,” he says. Didn’t he worry he would become a laughing stock, that people would just think the character was him? “I figured if it doesn’t get picked up, nobody would see it anyway, and if it did, it was a risk, but it’s been the greatest part of my career.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457188597__\n</div> \n<p>Dillon’s is the best character in the show, too. Entourage offered unashamed male fantasy: each week, melon-chested honeys straddled Grenier, while his beef-chested, shit-talking agent, played by <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/culture/jeremy-piven\">Jeremy Piven</a>, was a masterclass in business aggression. But great parties, good looks and multimillion-dollar deals are hard to empathise with. In Johnny Drama, the show was brilliantly able to depict the squalid desperation of most real actors’ lives.</p> \n<p>Drama was described as a “balding, unemployable douchebag” in the first episode and his tortures piled up week by week. Whether losing his temper in auditions, getting an erection in a brother-sister scene with Brooke Shields, shaving his balls or finding success voicing a cartoon gorilla called Johnny Bananas, the ritual humiliations grew laceratingly funny. “I cried myself to sleep when Roger Ebert singled out my performance in Licensed to Drive as the end of the golden age of cinema,” Drama laments at one point.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t overly protect him,” says Dillon. “A lot of actors say: ‘Oh, my character would never do that,’ but the thing is, Johnny Drama <em>would</em> do that.” We discuss my favourite storyline, in which his insecure character begs his brother for $10,000 to get calf implants. “They couldn’t shoot my legs because I actually do have good calves. They look like implants,” Dillon insists, rolling his trouser up to show me a leg that looks like it’s been padded out with sweet potatoes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d79d2d5aad5c66432c33a61f5a37a076036deed9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434549756611/a9a4f2e5-5835-4af7-8304-689da87fdfbf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cast of Entourage\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dillon (on right) with Adrian Grenier, Jerry Ferrara, Kevin Connolly and Jeremy Piven in Entourage.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Leg-pride notwithstanding, he can relate to other elements of the show. “The main reason entourages exist is what we call the ‘fallout factor,’” he says, alluding to the sexual opportunities enjoyed by anyone connected with a celebrity. “Matt was a teen idol when I was growing up, like Justin Bieber or the Beatles. Girls would figure out where he lived, drive by and ring the doorbell. And that wasn’t so bad for the younger brother … or the older ones.”</p> \n<p>What about the lifestyle depicted in the series, based on producer <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/mark-wahlberg\">Mark Wahlberg</a>’s early experiences in Tinseltown, every episode of which featured copious weed smoking, a pool party, and famous actors acting like incorrigible assholes? “Well, that’s calmed down a lot now because of social media. Everyone’s a paparazzo. But when celebrities are afraid to party openly, they go underground where some really weird shit can go down.”</p> \n<p>Probably not weirder than Drama having sex dressed as a pink rabbit, or meditating in his trailer with the mantra “I am not a pussy” to stave off panic attacks. The confused rage, insecurity and loyalty of being a sibling in the shadow made Dillon’s creation one of the more endearing characters of the noughties. He was nominated for three Primetime Emmys and a Golden Globe for his efforts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40a45d1000c7a40385c5975318219d8ef5fdd7e1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434552661872/94ada076-f77e-4c62-9598-a4ec0ee5bd7b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Entourage in 2006\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cast of the television series of Entourage in 2006.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO/Everett/REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Does he ever think Matt might be jealous now? “Nah. I asked [Matt] to be in it. I could play his stunt double.” I haven’t seen much of him since Crash, I say. “If you’re not in something successful, or you’re not around much, people think you’ve been out driving a bus,” he laughs. (I never thought Matt Dillon was driving a bus.) “He’s still banging away, he’s just picky. I couldn’t always afford to be – I had to pay the mortgage.”</p> \n<p>In person, Dillon is energetic and optimistic, though his round blue eyes suggest a hidden anxiety that makes him perfect for Johnny Drama. He is reminiscent of other people – Matt of course, shades of Kevin Bacon, even a blue-collar Benedict Cumberbatch. He has been mostly restricted to playing goofball knuckleheads, but he can do the harder stuff. He was scarily effective as Private Bunny, the baby-faced sadist in <a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/09/9a/5b/099a5b5d361b08e6f2a31ef07818f545.jpg\">Platoon</a>, one of his first jobs. “I showed Oliver [Stone] how to chew through a can in a bar, and he loved it. He said: ‘We’re putting that in!’ Mind you, in the 70s, cans would have been made of tin, not aluminium, so I would have broken my teeth. But no one ever mentioned it, so I probably shouldn’t say anything.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bdcaa9ed35109cc573fea2018068111be4cbdf5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434549903691/2f98ac48-74ea-4a6f-99de-5352302992c6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Platoon\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Charlie Sheen (left) in Oliver Stone’s Vietnam movie, Platoon.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dillon hoped the job would be his big break. But it’s a tough business, and for years he found himself propping up cheerfully trashy, late-night cable fodder such as Remote Control and The Rescue (in which a group of teenagers infiltrate a North Korean prison to rescue their Navy Seal fathers). He was reunited with Stone, to play musician John Densmore in the Doors biopic, after assuring the director that he was a great drummer – “Which I’m not.” I’m reminded of Johnny Drama’s fictional CV, particularly the special skills section, which lists “krav maga, conversational Hebrew, and skin-diving to 30m depths”.</p> \n<p>But the parts got better over time, and then Entourage turned everything around in 2004. Given its success, he must surely be in a more powerful career position now. “I still have to audition! It never ends. That’s why I love all of those audition scenes I had to shoot, because I’ve been there, walking down the tight hallway, everyone up against the wall, shooting you that look – ‘Ugh, another guy.’”</p> \n<p>Mindful that the interview has taken a turn for the bummer, I ask what he has got coming up. “That’s a little stagnant, too.” Oh. “Before this movie, I kinda felt like I was starting to fight my way out of being Johnny Drama, and then they pulled me back in. But I’m happy.”</p> \n<p>A sequel is rumoured to already be in the works. It’s gratifying that, although he now lives in Malibu, with a beautiful family and a few classic cars, there is a corner of Kevin Dillon that is forever Johnny Drama – dissatisfied, optimistic, praying he can land the next part. “Oh yeah. I’m still walking down that tight corridor. The difference is now they recognise me on the way in, so I get worse looks. It’s ‘Oh, I’m up against this guy. UGH.’”</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434549423656/f7178a04-f8dc-4c83-a625-e7e93a3000bf-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Warner Bros/AP","altText":"Kevin Dillon as Johnny 'Drama' Chase","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Warner Bros/AP"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434552580441/894ed2d6-f5ec-4a9c-af56-4a62c0e474bc-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kevin Dillon (left) with his brother Matt in 2006.

The BBC is hosting an open day to encourage potential stem cell donors to come forward after one of its journalists, Sue Lloyd-Roberts, missed out on a transplant when her would-be donor failed a

that there are now four more possible donors, but they must go through tests to see whether they are a match, which will take four to six weeks.</p> \n<p>Lloyd-Roberts, an award-winning journalist who mostly covers foreign affairs, first realised something was wrong in January at the hotel that she runs with her husband, BBC producer Nick Guthrie, in Mallorca. She wrote in her blog that she was loading the dishwasher when she collapsed.</p> \n<p> “I am a doctor’s daughter and the rule drummed in to me as a child is that you NEVER bother a doctor,” she said. “But Nick insisted. Four days later, I queued up at ‘Urgencias’ at a hospital in Palma. The blood test revealed a very low white blood cell count and I was admitted for more tests. The blood count kept falling, leaving me with severe neutropenia.

She gladly obeyed doctors’ orders to eat a lot in order to put on weight ahead of the transplant.</p> \n<p>But on 25 May there was disappointment. She wrote: “Heard from the hospital this morning that the donor has not passed his medical and so the cell transplant will not take place as scheduled.

Dadd was undoubtedly very ill. But did that make him a creative genius?</p> \n<p> In 1842, this promising young artist went on a grand tour of the east as a gentleman’s travelling companion. The people and places he saw in Turkey, Syria and above all Egypt stayed with him all his life. If Dadd was not famous as a “mad” artist he would be best known as a <a href=\"http://c252289.r89.cf3.rackcdn.com/15570.jpg\">Victorian Orientalist painter</a>. Yet Egypt got inside his head in a way that went beyond art. On the long overland journey home he started behaving strangely. He seemed to believe he was in contact with the Egyptian gods.

In August 1843 he stabbed his father – who was in his eyes the devil – to death. He escaped to France, was extradited, and spent the rest of his life in Victorian asylums. First he was in London’s Bethlem Hospital, better known as <a href=\"http://www.gutsandgore.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Bedlam-Asylum.png\">Bedlam</a>, then housed in what is today the Imperial War Museum, and later Broadmoor, where he died in 1886.</p> \n<p> Doctors’ reports describe Dadd as always remaining incoherent and deluded in his conversation, but he was able to paint – and he was encouraged to do so. Contrary to our gothic image of Victorian asylums as nightmarishly cruel, Dadd was given painting materials and a proper workspace. What he did with his paints is an eerie archive of a troubled imagination.</p> \n<p> To me Dadd’s art is compellingly odd. His <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/dadd-portrait-of-a-young-man-t06665\">Portrait of a Young Man</a> (1853), painted in Bedlam, is a wonderfully dreamlike, fantastical, intense study of someone who may be a warder or fellow patient. Magic light turns his face into a mysterious, inscrutable mask and makes the garden a place fit for fairies. The same surreal composition and weird intensity makes <a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/media/42/collection/2012AA41942.jpg\">his portrait of the “alienist” doctor Sir Alexander Morison</a> utterly beguiling.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b5ffe46127d312815e61b0bf718a1187734a8b7a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434558217486/44701916-e6d7-4d28-ab2e-39ec02d974b8-307x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Richard Dadd.

The Fairy Feller’s Master-Stroke, c.1855-64.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tate</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> It’s obvious from these paintings what Dadd’s illness did for him, as an artist. It liberated him from Victorian pedantry. He lived at the height of mechanical fussiness in British art, when <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Millais_Ruskin.jpg\">Ruskin was posing leadenly by a waterfall</a> and William Powell Frith was <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/N/N00/N00615_10.jpg\">laboriously recording Derby Day</a>. Meanwhile Dadd in his enforced seclusion was painting in a visionary way that has echoes of <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/blake-the-ghost-of-a-flea-n05889\">Blake</a> and the German Romantic artist <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Otto_Runge#/media/File:Philipp_Otto_Runge_003.jpg\">Philipp Otto Runge</a>.</p> \n<p> Far from brutal places that tortured him, Victorian asylums gave Dadd a peculiar freedom from his own time. The pure personal vision his illness unleashed will always make him one of the most captivating British artists of the 19th century.</p> \n<p> Dadd’s life was isolated and bereft. He was a murderer, guilty of a terrible crime - a guilt he may never have been sane enough to recognise. When we enjoy his art as a “crazy” imaginative trip are we feasting on tragedy? And yet the power of this visionary painter is undeniable. </p> \n<p>The sense of darkness that surrounds his glowing pictures has a unhappy footnote. Today Richard Dadd’s most famous painting is <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/images/work/T/T00/T00598_10.jpg\">The Fairy Feller’s Master-Stroke</a> (1855-64), a hypnotic vision of the microscopic secrets of the fairy realm at the bottom of every English garden.</p> \n<p> It was given to the Tate Gallery in 1963 by the first world war poet Siegfried Sassoon. He got it as a wedding present from the Dadd family, whose sons were close friends of his. He made the gift to the Tate “in memory of his friend and fellow officer Julian Dadd, a great-nephew of the artist, and of his two brothers who gave their lives in the first world war”.</p> \n<p> So three decades after Dadd’s death in Broadmoor, three of his great nephews would die in the war. Sorrow upon sorrow. Richard Dadd’s art is beauty born from anguish. The artist’s illness is unquestionable and so, I think, is his peculiar genius. Yet it is no proof that creativity and mental illness are connected – this is just one extraordinary case. One thing doesn’t always lead to another. Dadd’s life was desolate. The art he made from it, in flight from it, is a joy.</p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434558045601/36bea71f-fca5-490b-ae9f-c8f27ce633fc-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Bethlem Museum of the Mind/Bethlem Museum of the Mind","altText":"Henry Hering, Portrait photograph of Richard Dadd painting Contradiction (c.1875)","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Bethlem Museum of the Mind/Bethlem Museum of the Mind"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434558284006/3a3989ab-c1c5-416c-92c5-67a100ff09ce-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"If he wasn’t famous for being sent to Bedlam, Dadd would be known as an orientalist painter ...

While I admit that my scientific knowledge is largely limited to a combination of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/23/radiolab-podcast-abumrad-krulwich\">Radiolab podcast</a> and the Facebook page <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IFeakingLoveScience\">I Fucking Love Science</a>, that decision does not seem entirely logical. But it is a problem this profile also has to deal with. While it is supposed to be an intimate portrait of one of the world’s finest minds, it appears predicated on a new surge of interest in the man after the recent biopic <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/the-theory-of-everything\">The Theory of Everything</a>, and as such it occasionally comes across as an extended DVD extra, although there are plenty of moments when it hints at more.</p> \n<p>&Oacute; Briain immediately sets out his stall as a physics fanboy. The comedian and presenter, who studied mathematics and theoretical physics at University College Dublin, recalls asking his parents for a copy of A Brief History of Time for Christmas, and says throughout that he is fulfilling a boyhood dream by meeting his hero. He’s an excellent choice of host, asking difficult questions despite his clear reverence for his subject, and it is impossible not to feel the contagion of his sheer pleasure in finding himself in such a situation. More intriguingly, &Oacute; Briain is honest about the process of interviewing a man with motor neurone disease. He says he is not sure how easy it will be to talk to Hawking, who lost his speech in the 1980s and produces, via facial muscles which activate his voice machine, an average of one word per minute.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/may/16/jane-hawking-there-were-four-of-us-in-marriage-stephen-hawking-theory-of-everything\">Jane Hawking: ‘There were four&nbsp;of us&nbsp;in our marriage’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Upon walking into the hotel room to meet Hawking for the first time, &Oacute; Briain drops to one knee, as if the shock of finally encountering his hero has prompted a spontaneous and extremely awkward marriage proposal. He babbles about what a pleasure it is to meet him, then waits for an answer, still on one knee, and continues to wait, because a conversation with Hawking is inevitably played out to a different set of rules. An assistant eventually takes pity on him and brings him a chair. It’s one of this programme’s more charming decisions, to accentuate &Oacute; Briain’s slightly bumbling approach rather than erase it in the edit. It humanises both interviewer and subject. For their second conversation, he sends the questions through in advance.</p> \n<p>Perhaps because it is so hard for Hawking to talk, there is not much of his perspective overall but what &Oacute; Briain gets out of him over a couple of sessions is surprisingly honest and intimate. He says he worried about The Theory of Everything film initially, because it was based on a book by his ex-wife. He explains his support for assisted suicide. He talks about his condition, and how he missed playing with his children physically when they were small. He says he would like to be able to swim again. &Oacute; Briain asks him if he is lonely. “At times I get lonely, because people are afraid to talk to me, or don’t wait for me to write a response.” To the delight of &Oacute; Briain, he ends their final encounter by cracking a couple of physics jokes, one about a photon, the other about a black hole.</p> \n<p>Where Hawking is absent, others fill in the gaps. A former assistant tells a charming story about him being ill in hospital, where his colleagues decided to “burble science over him and that will get him better.” It worked, she chuckles. Two of his children offer rare and insightful contributions, too – his daughter Lucy considers the abnormality of her upbringing, while his youngest son Tim talks about how, before Hawking lost his voice completely, he could not understand his father, and says they only really began to communicate when he started to use his voice machine.</p> \n<p>The documentary is less convincing when it pitches for the broadest possible audience. Aside from the cloying, sentimental soundtrack, which signals every poignant moment with all the subtlety of a flashing neon arrow, there is too much showbiz and not enough science. Ironically, this was one of the only complaints Hawking had about The Theory of Everything. He understood the lack of physics, but wished there could have been more. While I would not expect to have quantum mechanics laid out for me in its entirety between clips of the biopic, a Red Nose Day sketch and scenes from a red carpet premiere (I have Facebook for that), it seems a shame that his work is relegated to a brief chat about Hawking radiation, right near the end – and, crushingly for fantasists everywhere, an explanation that time travel would never be possible through a black hole, because it would simply “recycle your mass”, which I imagine would not be nearly as gentle as it sounds.</p> \n<p>Still, when &Oacute; Briain gets his copy of A Brief History of Time signed by his hero, with a Hawking thumbprint, those soaring strings seem, just for a second, to be entirely justified.</p>","section":"TV &

Hyem obituary","trailText":"Actor and writer who scripted the hit TV series Tenko, a drama about the lives of women imprisoned in a Japanese internment camp","standFirst":"Actor and writer who scripted the hit TV series Tenko, a drama about the lives of women imprisoned in a Japanese internment camp","byline":"Anthony Hayward","body":"<p>The actor-turned-writer Jill Hyem, who has died of cancer aged 78, scripted 14 of the 30 episodes of Tenko (1981-84), the groundbreaking television series about British, Dutch and Australian women captured and interned in makeshift camps by the Japanese following the fall of Singapore in 1942. Hyem conveyed the overcrowding, malnutrition, violence, disease and death realistically, with no stereotypes or sensationalism.</p> \n<p>The women were from diverse backgrounds. Ann Bell played the colonel’s wife Marion Jefferson, reluctant leader of the British, with Stephanie Cole as the stern Dr Beatrice Mason, Stephanie Beacham as the spoiled socialite Rose Millar, Louise Jameson as the mouthy cockney Blanche Simmons, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2001/apr/05/filmnews.guardianobituaries\" title=\"\">Jean Anderson</a> as the suffragette Joss Holbrook and Patricia Lawrence as Sister Ulrica, the authoritarian leader of the Dutch women. None of the actors wore make-up for the cameras and, over the three series, the female prisoners were shown becoming more filthy and emaciated as a result of their daily degradation and a march through hostile jungle to a new camp at the start of the second run.</p> \n<p>Unlike many male-dominated war dramas focusing on military discipline and heroism, Tenko concentrated on friendship, motherhood, female identity, separation from family and sexual vulnerability. Nevertheless, Hyem had to fight to keep a story about a brief relationship between two of the women – and was not allowed to use the word lesbian.</p> \n<p>Several of the actors returned to their roles in 1985 for the television film Tenko Reunion, written by Hyem and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2013/may/16/anne-valery\" title=\"\">Anne Valery</a>, who had alternated with her as writer for most of the series.</p> \n<p>Hyem was born in Putney, south-west London, the daughter of Rex, a solicitor, and his wife, Hilda (nee Gladwell). From the age of eight, her ambition was to be an actor and, after leaving <a href=\"http://www.farlingtonschool.net\" title=\"\">Farlington school</a>, Horsham, West Sussex, she trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. She appeared in repertory theatre in High Wycombe, Watford and Worthing, and in the West End as Pamela Fordyce in the comedy Goodnight Mrs Puffin (Strand and Duke of York’s theatres, 1961-63).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb3a2c037cee3d07c5aa2ac5456581e20b7bfe63\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434549695129/485a3e56-ef56-41eb-9698-4cad5540dd91-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"An episode of Tenko.

She also had bit parts in popular series such as Dixon of Dock Green, The Valiant Varneys and Sergeant Cork, and several B-movies. However, playing “an assortment of nurses, air hostesses, dreary daughters, gangsters’ molls and French maids” convinced Hyem that she should become a writer and create challenging parts for women.</p> \n<p>She began in radio, which remained her favourite medium, first contributing sketches to the BBC Home Service’s Monday Night at Home (1961-62). Between 1964 and 1969, she regularly scripted The Dales, the soap opera that had begun life as Mrs Dale’s Diary and followed a doctor’s wife in a middle-class community. After writing the final episode, she co-created, with Alan Downer, its replacement, Waggoners’ Walk (1969-80), set in a large town house divided up into flats.</p> \n<p>The cancellation of Waggoners’ Walk came shortly after she separated from her husband, Dudley Savill, whom she had married in 1966 (they later divorced). Hyem’s worries about bringing up their son, Ben, and paying bills soon disappeared when she was asked by Lavinia Warner, creator of the series, to write Tenko.</p> \n<p>She and Warner went on to create Wish Me Luck (1987-90), about female agents behind enemy lines in the second world war. Hyem also wrote scripts for Howards’ Way (1985), Act of Will (1989), Campion (1989-90), The House of Eliott (1991) and Body &amp; Soul (1993).</p> \n<p>She served on the <a href=\"https://writersguild.org.uk\" title=\"\">Writers’ Guild of Great Britain</a>’s executive council during the 1980s and 90s, and was made an honorary member of the guild in 2007.</p> \n<p>Her son survives her.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Jill Hyem, writer and actor, born 8 January 1937; died 5 June 2015</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434540767057/Jill-Hyem-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jill Hyem","credit":"/public domain","altText":"Jill Hyem","cleanCaption":"Jill Hyem"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434549696652/485a3e56-ef56-41eb-9698-4cad5540dd91-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An episode of Tenko.
