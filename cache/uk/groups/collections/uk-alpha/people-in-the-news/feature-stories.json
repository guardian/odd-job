King had set up a trust for his descendants, but reportedly left sums of only $3,000 to $5,000 to his 15 children. “My guess is the children and grandchildren don’t like the fact he’s leaving them $3,000 and $5,000 each and then leaving the rest to his lineage for education,” he said. “BB did not have a very high formal education, and he wanted to have his lineage go to college, so he set up a trust that would pay for college and other expenses.”</p> \n<p>Now Larissa Drohobyczer, attorney for Williams and King has <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/legal-dispute-over-b-b-kings-last-days-gets-uglier-20150527\">issued a statement to Rolling Stone</a>. “Karen and Patty have nothing to gain financially by getting [the] truth on how their father died. Nothing<em>,</em>” she said. “Mr Bryson is unnecessarily dragging mourning daughters through the mud for no apparent reason.</p> \n<p>“Not one family member was allowed to see BB for a week prior to his death, not even his friend. That really hurt and angered Karen and Patty deeply. Ms. Toney kept BB’s family from him and he died without one family member by his side. That is what raised reasonable suspicion as to his cause of death for Patty and Karen. My clients just want answers.</p> \n<p>“Just because someone is already dying doesn’t mean they can’t be killed! This happens quite often … I think a reasonable person [would] be concerned if they were unable to see their loved one the entire time he/she was in hospice. My clients have not made public accusations about criminal activities; they just want the matter investigated and they want peace.”</p> \n<p>Bryson countered that King saw who he wanted to see, and that his granddaughter Valerie Byrd had visited before his death. “Ms. Toney has been severely disparaged, defamed, slandered and caused to suffer emotional distress all as a result of the untrue, extreme and outrageous comments made by Patty, Karen and their attorney,” he said. “Those issues will be dealt with at an appropriate time. Let our attention be presently focused on Mr King.”</p> \n<p>King’s attending physician said he died of multi-infarct dementia.

Instead, the 30-second motivational rant from the Hollywood actor is part of a unique collaboration with students from Central Saint Martins, one of the UK’s leading arts universities.</p> \n<p>The film is one of 36 brief video segments which include LaBeouf reciting his favourite poem, The Laughing Heart, by Charles Bukowski; standing in silence in front of a moving projection of clouds; repeating “ooohmn” sounds in front of a picture of a block of butter; and reading out the lyrics from the 1982 song, She Can’t Love You, by Chemise. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/dec/06/shia-labeouf-art-show-collaborators-first-interview\">Shia LaBeouf collaborator: I don’t think you need a sign saying ‘Don’t murder the artist’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The project is both part of the Central Saint Martins fine art BA degree show and the latest event in LaBeouf’s ongoing artistic collaboration with British artist Luke Turner and Finnish artist Nastja S&auml;de R&ouml;nkk&ouml;, who began working together 18 months ago. </p> \n<p>After the trio were approached by students from the London art school last year to present the online live stream of their graduate show, they were struck by what they described as “the sense of generosity and sincerity” running through the students’ work. Through a conversation with five of the course participants, they came up with the idea of an exchange where LaBeouf would film a brief intro to the students’ work in front of a green screen. </p> \n<p>All 150 were invited to “submit a piece of text lasting up to 30 seconds<strong> </strong>or no more than 100 words. This can be as poetic, abstract or literal as you like – with the emphasis on expressing the feeling and tone of the work being introduced.” The students could then change the background behind LaBeouf to anything of their choice. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/125095515\">The films can be seen online</a>.<br /></p> \n<p>“A lot of us became interested in the way that Shia was being used as an artist and engaging with his art practice, but also using his status as a celebrity as a platform for his work,” said Andrew Smith, one of the fine art students who spearheaded the project. “Shia LaBeouf is in this place that oscillates between the two worlds of his mass audience and his art audience. And this was also about branching those two audiences, making the live stream an access point for people who might not know or have visited a degree show.”</p> \n<p>Not all the students decided to get involved, but Smith said those who did had produced a range of texts that varied from “the serious and transcendental but also the comedic”, with most writing the brief pieces themselves. For Smith’s own piece, he asked LaBeouf to read a short text recalling standing on the beach and looking out at a sea filled with limp and moving jellyfish, in keeping with his final graduate piece of video art exploring a struggle to come to terms with the death of a friend. </p> \n<p>“I was really amazed by what Shia produced – a lot of people had asked for very specific things and he was totally accommodating to all of those requests,” Smith added. </p> \n<p>The project acted as a platform for LaBeouf’s versatility, requiring him at one point to speak in an English accent, do another while wearing a motorcycle helmet and perform while doing a handstand, so only his feet were visible. All 36 were recorded in an LA studio in a single day. </p> \n<p>While LaBeouf has spent most of his life in Hollywood, having begun as a child actor and then establishing himself in blockbusters such as Transformers, it is the actor’s dalliance with the art world that has recently dominated headlines.</p> \n<p>He began working with Turner and R&ouml;nkk&ouml; after he read a piece by Turner which discussed the struggle for sincerity in an age of irony. The pair met up and immediately bonded, and after Turner approached R&ouml;nkk&ouml; to come on board, the collaboration was born.</p> \n<p>Speaking about their decision to work with the Central Saint Martins art students, the trio – who spoke as a collective – said they had been struck by how in-tune the students were with their ideas.</p> \n<p>“Right from the beginning, our collaboration has been about human interaction and expression across networks,” they said. “The fact that in this connected world that we are all seeking the sense of humanity in the shared experience and a way of expressing and articulating ourselves sincerely. </p> \n<p>“The audience for our projects and experiences are as much part of the work as we are – they complete the work. It comes from this idea that we are all artists really, and we are all expressing ourselves more than ever across Twitter and social media. The Central Saint Martins students seemed to get that intuitively.”</p> \n<p>In the past 18 months, the trio’s collaborations have included several publicity stunts, including LaBeouf turning up to the premiere of Lars von Trier’s Nymphomaniac with a paper bag over his head scrawled with the words: “I am not famous anymore.”</p> \n<p>Another performance piece, titled #IamSorry, was staged last year after the actor suffered a “genuine existential crisis” when he was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/jan/02/shia-labeouf-skywriting-daniel-clowes-plagiarism\">accused of plagiarising a short story by Daniel Clowes</a> for a film he was making.

I felt so inadequate that, in an effort to make it sound more official, I started with the words, “Mr Barenboim...” This so surprised him and was so out of keeping with the spirit of our relationship that he shot out of his chair like a rocket – right across to the other side of the room, voicing a fitting high-voltage expletive – an echo of the uninhibited spirit that I had already come to know and a fine start to a collaboration that has endured for more than 50 years.</p> \n<p>Daniel’s next big idea was to play the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnXVeV3mW3k\">Mozart Two Piano Concerto</a> with Vladimir Ashkenazy and the English Chamber Orchestra in the Fairfield Halls in Croydon, but they could not find the funding.</p> \n<p>He asked whether I could persuade BBC Television to join us and I took the idea to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huw_Wheldon\">Huw Wheldon</a>, saying that there was a story to tell about my two friends and their super-talents in addition to a high-quality concert to broadcast. Huw proposed it to David Attenborough, then Controller of BBC2, and they accepted the idea of a 50-minute concert preceded by a nine-minute introduction to enable me to tell the story that I wanted, so much, to tell. It was made a condition of the acceptance that the finished programme be ready for transmission within three weeks of the concert date because of a current Musicians Union regulation about the television relay of live concerts.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456926609__\n</div> \n<p>We shot over three days and turned the material into a 61-minute documentary without a single soul in the BBC management knowing what we had done. When the news leaked out much consternation flitted round the sixth floor of Television Centre on the Friday preceding the Sunday broadcast, and the Management demanded a screening but there was nothing for them to see because the negative was still being cut and the first show print had yet to be made.</p> \n<p>As a consequence, most of the BBC top management, in a state of quite some anxiety, watched the transmission on the Sunday evening and Daniel Barenboim, Vladimir Ashkenazy and the English Chamber Orchestra were catapulted into the television stratosphere in the space of 61 minutes. The film, which we called <a href=\"http://www.allegrofilms.com/about/\">Double Concerto</a>, subsequently won two international prizes and introduced the protagonists to 18 countries in the next 12 months. It won them a public in two years of a size that it took, <a href=\"http://www.arims.org.il/artist.htm\">Rubinstein</a>, <a href=\"http://www.menuhin.org/\">Menuhin</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Horowitz\">Horowitz</a> 35 years to build.</p> \n<p>Daniel Barenboim’s star was already high when, in 1968, John Denison, General Manager of the Southbank Centre, came up with a bold idea for the first season of Southbank Summer Music (a two-week festival that was continue into the 80s). His first step was to appoint the 26-year-old Daniel Barenboim – at that time living in London with his new wife <a href=\"http://www.jacquelinedupre.net/jdupre/whoisjdp.htm\">Jacqueline du Pr&eacute;</a> – as Artistic Director.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4a2166d789d91c03e513e181ab5aea2cc25082ee\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432733607957/630e85f4-defe-48a2-af7e-1e32ca249965-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Filming the Trout at the SBC 1969, Daniel Barenboim et al\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacqueline du Pre (centre), with Daniel Barenboim at the double bass and Zubin Mehta at the piano (the two in reversed positions)</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allegro Films</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Barenboim’s astonishingly compendious knowledge of music and his extraordinary repertoire were already legendary. He also had an unusually wide circle of friends whom he knew he could call on to join him with enthusiasm. I remember only one complaint: <a href=\"http://www.itzhakperlman.com/\">Itzhak Perlman</a> with a bad cold, dripping with sweat and with no shirt on, backstage, “I’m suffering from Barenboim scheduling.”</p> \n<p>The pace was dramatic, riding on Barenboim’s exceptional gifts for programming. The public quickly picked up the spirit and came running. Denison programmed a second season for 1969 and Barenboim came up with a surprise that was to scamper around the world in double-quick time and continues to delight thousands of people to this day.<br />He invited Itzhak Perlman, <a href=\"http://www.kirshbaumassociates.com/artist.php?id=pinchaszukerman\">Pinchas Zukerman</a>, Jacqueline duPr&eacute; and <a href=\"http://www.zubinmehta.net/5.0.html\">Zubin Mehta</a> to join him in an afternoon performance of Schubert’s Trout Quintet. Zubin had not played the bass professionally in many years but he agreed it, nevertheless – there is no more telling testimony to the spirit of the occasion.</p> \n<p>I knew, at the very moment when Daniel first told me of his idea, that this was something that needed to be filmed. More than that, I knew that it had to be filmed in close up – as distinct from the way in which concerts were generally shot at that time.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We called the film The Trout, despite the BBC’s complaint that the public would think it a fishing film</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I went, cap in hand, to Denison to ask whether I might have permission to put five cameras on the stage with the artists. Such a thing had never been done before. I expected either an outright rejection or a long, weary battle but no, the same far-sightedness that had prompted the idea of Southbank Summer Music in the first place took him straight to the crucial question. </p> \n<p>He asked whether I could disguise the cameras in some way. He suggested importing vegetation. That gave me the idea of building tongue-and-groove screens for each of the cameras, removing just one plank from each at the appropriate lens height.</p> \n<p>Denision, bless his soul, gave us the permission that so many others would have refused and, after filming rehearsals and other story-telling material during the preceding week, we shot the complete performance of The Trout with five film cameras on the stage, all loaded with 1200-foot magazines. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"69e59eaa45bd858ec1a439f69eee8cb8c257b18d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432733988533/c7ae3d4f-d07f-405b-8302-b958f1752fe0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Filming the Trout at the SBC 1969, Daniel Barenboim et al\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I asked permission to put five cameras on the stage with the artists.

In spring this year, she opened New York fashion week on the VFiles catwalk wearing a “girl power” hoodie and walked for Hood By Air. While Nef is actually IMG’s second transgender signee, the first being <a href=\"http://www.styleite.com/news/valentijn-de-hingh/\">Valentijn De Hingh</a>, Nef is the only one signed globally (De Hingh is only represented by the Paris branch). “I can’t verbalise how thrilled I am to be joining the <a href=\"https://instagram.com/imgmodels/\">@imgmodels</a> family,” Nef announced on her Instagram.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/apr/29/bruce-jenner-transgender-narrative-stories\">Bruce Jenner and the 'trans narrative': it's time for a little bit of Transgender 201</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A graduate of Columbia NYU, Nef’s agency signing marks yet another interesting shift in the industry’s agenda. In the last 12 months, transgender model Andreja Pejic, 23, underwent sex reassignment surgery, while Lea T became the face (or rather hair) of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/theguardian/shortcuts/2014/nov/05/lea-t-the-transgender-hair-care-model-whos-shifting-our-perception-of-beauty-norms\">Redken</a>, marking stepping stone in changing attitudes towards diversity and gender. </p> \n<p>Last month, Tess Munster became <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/shortcuts/2015/apr/15/agency-signs-size-24-model-tess-munster\">the first size-24 model</a> to be signed to a mainstream agency, while <a href=\"https://instagram.com/stefania_model/\">Stefania Ferrario</a>, the activist model who spearheaded the #droptheplus campaign, was signed to Models 1. Late last year, gay couple <a href=\"http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/12/instagram-s-jarlos-closet.html\">Jarlos</a> became the first couple to front a campaign (DKNY).</p> \n<p>Nef has never modelled in menswear (she says she is “a lot prettier as a girl”) and according to her IMG agents, is still “in the process of transitioning”. Streetwear label Hood By Air tends to lean towards diversity, but as Nef recently <a href=\"http://galoremag.com/hari-nef-on-being-a-successful-transgender-model-in-the-binary-fashion-industry/\">explained</a> the fashion industry remains relatively slow on the diversity uptake. But with her signing, fashion’s relationship diversity looks set to change from tokenistic move and more towards the norm.</p>","section":"Fashion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432736822400/1f1b34d1-a8fa-456f-a00c-85b823aac14e-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"2015_SERGIO_KURHAJEC/Paper magazine","altText":"Hari Nef shot by Kathy Lo for Paper magazine","cleanCredit":"Photograph: 2015_SERGIO_KURHAJEC/Paper magazine"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432736576505/8299c819-7ac7-4cc6-83a1-2b8e9d204b04-1357x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1357,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Hari Nef in New York in spring Photograph: D Dipasupil/Getty Images","credit":"D Dipasupil/Getty Images","altText":"Hari Nef in New York in spring","cleanCaption":"Hari Nef in New York in spring","cleanCredit":"Photograph: D Dipasupil/Getty Images"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-27T15:19:13Z","lastModified":"2015-05-27T15:21:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":21,"contributors":[{"name":"Morwenna Ferrier","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/15/1413394247883/Morwenna-Ferrier-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/morwennaferrier"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Models","Fashion industry","Fashion","Life and style","Transgender","Society"],"tags":[{"id":"fashion/models","webTitle":"Models"},{"id":"fashion/fashion-industry","webTitle":"Fashion industry"},{"id":"fashion/fashion","webTitle":"Fashion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/transgender","webTitle":"Transgender"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"}],"section":{"id":"fashion"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Morwenna Ferrier","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/morwennaferrier"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"fashion"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/2015/may/27/top-modelling-agency-img-signs-transgender-model-hari-nef","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4998e","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/fashion/2015/may/27/top-modelling-agency-img-signs-transgender-model-hari-nef","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/may/27/top-modelling-agency-img-signs-transgender-model-hari-nef"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432736822400/1f1b34d1-a8fa-456f-a00c-85b823aac14e-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Hari Nef shot by Kathy Lo for Paper magazine Photograph: Paper magazine","credit":"Paper magazine","altText":"Hari Nef shot by Kathy Lo for Paper magazine","cleanCaption":"Hari Nef shot by Kathy Lo for Paper magazine","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Paper magazine"}},"importance":3,"kicker":{"title":"Hari Nef"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[]}],"lastModified":"2015-05-28T07:55:46Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/uk-alpha/people-in-the-news/feature-stories","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/uk-alpha/people-in-the-news/feature-stories"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"uk-alpha/people-in-the-news/feature-stories/front"}
