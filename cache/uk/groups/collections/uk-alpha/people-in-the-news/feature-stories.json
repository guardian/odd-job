So, when Kylie Jenner, Kim’s younger sister, posted an <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/5AWcLYHGty/?taken-by=kyliejenner\">Instagram selfie</a> on Sunday featuring a new hairstyle, a noisy reaction was to be expected.</p> \n<p>But Jenner might not have bargained for accusations of cultural appropriation. These came from 17-year-old Hunger Games actor <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3964350/\">Amandla Stenberg</a>, who <a href=\"http://www.justjared.com/2015/07/12/kylie-jenner-gets-called-out-on-instagram-by-amandla-stenberg/\">posted a comment</a> that read: “When u appropriate black features and culture but fail to use ur position of power to help black Americans by directing attention towards ur wigs instead of police brutality or racism #whitegirlsdoitbetter”. By Jenner’s next selfie, the braids were gone.</p> \n<p>Inspired by celebrities including <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13269878/braided-hairstyles-instagram-beyonce-solange-knowles/\">FKA twigs</a> and <a href=\"http://blackgirllonghair.com/2015/05/this-picture-of-willow-smith-braiding-zoe-kravitzs-hair-is-the-sweetes-thing-youll-see-today/\">Zoe Kravitz</a>, braids like Jenner’s are gaining popularity across ethnicities. They have been a festival favourite this year, with the back-from-the-forehead cornrow particularly popular. I’m white, and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/2015/apr/13/the-rise-of-the-in-store-braiding-bar\">I had my hair braided for the Guardian earlier this year by Keash</a>, a braiding service set up by school friends Taiba Akhuetie, 25, and Jessy Linton, 24.</p> \n<p>Akhuetie, whose mother is Nigerian, said she liked the idea of these styles going across races and ethnicities, despite some negative comments from black people. While she is frustrated that braiding might be seen as a trend, rather than something here to stay, she says: “If other people want to appropriate the style, I think that’s a good thing.” She compares white women braiding their hair to the now-commonplace fashion for black women to wear weaves to give the effect of straight, caucasian hair. “Now no one thinks about that,” she says. “Hair is political, definitely, but I hope we get to a point when there’s no segregation.”</p> \n<p>Stenberg, who posted a video about cultural appropriation of hairstyles on YouTube earlier this year entitled Don’t Cash Crop <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1KJRRSB_XA\">On My Cornrows</a>, might have her work cut out campaigning against other non-black women having their hair braided. Kenya Hunt of ElleUK.com, who regularly writes about black beauty, praises Stenberg as a “really bright young voice”, but says: “I think when it comes to conversations about race and cultural appropriation, we need to pick our battles. We’re seeing people burn down black churches in America right now, people killing young black women and men because of the colour of their skin. Kylie Jenner’s cornrows that she wore for hours? That doesn’t strike me as the battle we need to have.”</p>","section":"Fashion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436810497392/b169fcec-bfca-4887-bd41-cdb3f78d308e-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Kylie Jenner/Instagram","altText":"Kylie Jenner's cornrows","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Kylie Jenner/Instagram"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-13T18:22:22Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T23:00:47Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":412,"contributors":[{"name":"Lauren Cochrane","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/11/18/1416324858025/Lauren-Cochrane-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/laurencochrane"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Fashion","Life and style","Women's hair","Beauty","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"fashion/fashion","webTitle":"Fashion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"fashion/womens-hair","webTitle":"Women's hair"},{"id":"fashion/beauty","webTitle":"Beauty"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"fashion"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Lauren Cochrane","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/laurencochrane"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"fashion"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","navigationButtonColour":"#ffffff","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","quoteColour":"#fdadba","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/shortcuts/2015/jul/13/kylie-jenner-cornrows-racial-politics-hair","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aj99","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/fashion/shortcuts/2015/jul/13/kylie-jenner-cornrows-racial-politics-hair","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2015/jul/13/kylie-jenner-cornrows-racial-politics-hair"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436810497392/b169fcec-bfca-4887-bd41-cdb3f78d308e-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kylie Jenner’s controversial cornrows.

Wrong, as BBC3’s new doc carefully shows</p>","byline":"Filipa Jodelka","body":"<p>I think my interest in Big Brother has finally flatlined. By now, and having presented every possible variation of “women with severe personality disorders”, “relatable fatties” and “wacky guys in hats”, the show seems less a slick machine giving people their 15 minutes of fame and more like a compulsory internment camp that all citizens must pass through. It wasn’t always like this, but fairytales don’t exist any more, unless you count the distant chance of winning big on the scratchies and spending your days in a secondhand Lambo, doing doughnuts on the lawns of your enemies shouting “SUCK IT YOU DICKHEADS!” from the window for ever and ever, and Snapchatting the whole thing.</p> \n<p>Jane Park, who won &pound;1,000,000 at the age of 17, is one of the youngest people in the country to become a lottery millionaire. Jane chose to take full advantage of this new and unique opportunity and ticked “yes” on all publicity. And so, after her win, a BBC Scotland crew followed her for a year, the fascinating results of which are now being shown nationwide on BBC3 In <strong>Teenage Millionaire</strong>.</p> \n<p>The best thing about Jane, and there’s a lot to choose from, is that coming from the Niddrie estate in Edinburgh she never once lets fatuous tripe like “money doesn’t buy happiness” leave her gob. Jane knows full well that money buys happiness, because Jane’s No 1 priority – after procuring roughly 97% of Topshop’s inventory, a tiny chihuahua puppy called Princess and an immaculate, new-build house – was sorting her loved ones out. As the year rolls by, this desire is manifested in mountains of Christmas presents and frequent holidays to Spain. Jane is the kind of girl to sort TripAdvisor reviews by their happy hour offers and “OAPs doing Tom Jones on karaoke” ranking. On a birthday trip to Benidorm for mama Park, Jane nonchalantly explains that she isn’t impressed by five-star resorts. “Watching sunsets?” she scoffs, pulling a face like a bulldog having trouble digesting lunch. Whether such behaviour is evidence of her inherent realness or someone trying to retain an important part of her identity, I’ll let you judge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtGIY3y7LQ0\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dtGIY3y7LQ0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Either way, I love Jane for idly sticking two fingers up at the idea of a spa break in Rhodes or other emblems of “sophistication” being the only thing to aspire to. I love her twice as hard for depriving a certain type of viewer of the chaotic chavs-on-tour spectacle they might have been expecting by taking entirely normal holidays and considering sound financial options. The neat conclusion to undeserving wealth, in the British mind, is the newly rich spaffing their money on one too many signet rings and losing everything. There’s a bitter streak running through all of us, so it’s no surprise that the programme is heavy on people muttering things like: “It’s mad isn’t it? Seventeen and winning a million pounds” from the sidelines. (“It’s fucking brilliant,” Jane replies drily.)</p> \n<p>Personally, I’m delighted she got lucky. For a start, she suits the zero-frigs lifestyle to a tee. She takes a job as a Magaluf shot girl in order to make her million go further. But that million also gives her the freedom to observe that the job is “shit”, and quit. Most people, I suspect, would be hard-pressed to conceptualise what a million quid truly is. Jane, though, is clever enough to know that the figure pitches unnervingly between “flipping loads” and “might not last a lifetime”. In a meeting with a financial advisor which has clearly eroded Jane’s abundant natural vitality, she’s told a lot of stuff about investing her remaining money. Stocks and shares, Jane says, have been explained to her thousands of times, but she doesn’t really care to commit to the precise details to memory. She doesn’t care for someone else making her decisions, either; so when she gets bored of reading Pick Me Up in the various rooms of her brand new home, she moves back in with her mum and rents it out for a very tidy monthly sum.</p> \n<p>I think Jane will be all right. Besides, she says: “If I was to spend it all, then YOLO. I don’t care!”</p> \n<p><strong><em>Monday, 9pm, BBC3</em></strong></p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436369162333/Jane-Park-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jane Park.

Whether it’s members of the public starting moronic petitions, or former boyband members <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brianmcfadden/status/614907991679217664?lang=en-gb\">declaring him “shite”</a>, nobody can stand the man (apart from the millions of people who have made him the biggest pop star on the planet, as I pointed out earlier). </p> \n<p>Yet there’s one group of people who seem to have reserved a special amount of ire for West, and that’s the greying old guard of rock’n’roll. Ageing white men in bands whose time has been and gone. Now those guys <em>really</em> hate Kanye.<br /></p> \n<p>“He can’t write, sing, or play. At all,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thedavidcrosby/status/619007384174747648 \">tweeted David Crosby</a> last week, adding: “He is an egomaniac, he is dumb as a post, he creates nothing, helps no one.”</p> \n<p>It wasn’t the first time Crosby had attacked West. Back in March, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thedavidcrosby/status/572878210544738304\">he claimed</a> the Yeezus mastermind was “an idiot and a poser … has no talent at all.” This time he backed up his attack by saying West’s music seemed “like percussive poetry to me ... but not very good poetry. Mostly very bad poetry”, which sounds like something my mum might possibly say about him, and she hasn’t engaged meaningfully with pop music since Adam Faith made her go weak at the knees in 1959.</p> \n<p>Crosby’s not alone. “Kanye West. Utter shit”, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/liamgallagher/status/570753709032017920\">tweeted former Oasis singer</a> Liam Gallagher after the rapper – backed by an entourage of UK grime stars – pulled off the most astonishing performance at this year’s Brit awards. At least it was an improvement on his brother Noel’s viewpoint: “Kanye West? I’d have knocked him out,” ran a recent NME coverline. Devoid of the guitarist’s usual comic wit, it seemed like a weirdly Neanderthal-like threat.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, Michael McDonald of Doobie Brothers fame <a href=\"http://hypetrak.com/2015/02/michael-mcdonald-latest-artist-to-criticize-kanye-wests-grammy-comments/ \">opined</a> that the multiple Grammy-award-winning artist who’s only ever released critically acclaimed albums is unable to “put a couple of notes together either vocally or two bars of valid music playing an instrument … I don’t know if I call it songwriting from a musician’s standpoint. Beck is obviously a consummate musician. He plays instruments, many instruments.” <br /></p> \n<p>So what is going on? You could argue that all this was simply a case of older generations not understanding the younger upstart. But then Glastonbury happened, Kanye declared himself “the world’s greatest living rock star”, and rock’s old timers revealed what it is that really irks them.<br /></p> \n<p>“Who’s the biggest rock star in the world? That must be Elvis Presley,” <a href=\"http://hollywoodlife.com/2015/06/29/pete-townshend-blasts-kanye-west-glastonbury-music-festival-the-who/\">said the Who’s Pete Townshend </a>from the stage the following night, failing to grasp Kanye’s use of the word “living”.</p> \n<p>Slipknot’s Corey Taylor was even moved to record a video message, complete with a slapped wrist, to tell Kanye that he had to “stop it”.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOyfWUq_214\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MOyfWUq_214?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Could the reason creaking rock’n’rollers are getting all upset is that they see the “ownership” of rock’n’roll under threat? Ever since white guys got to rewrite rock history on their own terms (as Mos Def eloquently pointed out on his 1999 track Rock’N’Roll), they’ve been relatively content to pass down from white guy to white guy, but don’t seem to be able to handle it when it’s suddenly claimed back by a black man.</p> \n<p>Just look at the criticisms, which seem to attack Kanye West for the very things rock’n’roll supposedly celebrates: bad behaviour and egocentricity. Liam Gallagher can walk out of US tours, Slipknot can declare “people = shit”, and countless metallers can spend a lifetime consuming drugs and groupies on the Sunset Strip. But when it comes to Kanye, suddenly everyone’s talking about “manners” and “showing respect” – classic tropes displayed by white people when faced with the <a href=\"http://www.thewire.com/politics/2011/11/yep-uppity-racist/45321/\">“uppity” black person</a>. </p> \n<p>The irony is that Kanye’s behaviour isn’t even bad – he’s a married man with a child who works obsessively and never seems to be out of control on drink or drugs. He’s better behaved than Justin Bieber! Sure, he likes to proclaim his own greatness a lot, but isn’t that what rock’n’rollers have been doing since the dawn of time? Wasn’t that part of the thrill of Oasis? Isn’t it the kind of thing even pondlife like Catfish and the Bottlemen get away with, week in, week out, on the pages of NME? So why is it OK for them but not for Kanye?<br /></p> \n<p>Notable exceptions who are happy to let Kanye join the party are scarce. Paul McCartney, who recently collaborated with him, shows the same kind of open mind that made the Beatles a unique musical proposition. Lou Reed – who always boasted a more advanced empathy with, and understanding of, identity than his peers – wrote a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2013/jul/03/lou-reed-kanye-west-yeezus\">brilliant review of Yeezus</a>. That he (mostly) admired it is almost beside the point – the fact Reed engaged with West’s music, regarded him as a musical equal, is what elevates his opinion above all the others. </p> \n<p>“The guy has a real wide palette to play,” he wrote, adding: “Very often, he’ll have this very monotonous section going and then, suddenly – “BAP! BAP! BAP! BAP!” – he disrupts the whole thing and we’re on to something new that’s absolutely incredible. That’s architecture, that’s structure – this guy is seriously smart. He keeps unbalancing you.” It’s a far cry from the typical “he just uses computers” and “can’t sing” jibes. </p> \n<p>Elsewhere, though, there’s little love for Kanye, and even less reflection. Maybe self-examination of your kneejerk opinions is not very rock’n’roll. But it’s not doing the old guard any favours, and they’re not winning the war.<br /></p> \n<p>When Corey Taylor was asked if he enjoyed the frenzied reaction to his Kanye rant, he let his mask slip: “No! God no! Here’s the thing: I’ve written three books, I’ve sold millions of albums, I’m in two different bands, I’m in movies and shit. And this is what it took? This is what it took?”<br /></p> \n<p>When it comes to rock’n’roll, it’s clearly Kanye’s world. All the other rockers are just whining in it.<br /></p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436797665625/030e7dd3-6ec8-49c0-a263-fd6182f8488c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jonathan Hordle/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Kanye West at Glastonbury 2015","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jonathan Hordle/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-13T14:53:30Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T20:15:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":513,"contributors":[{"name":"Tim Jonze","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733750336/TimJonze.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/timjonze"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Kanye West","Pop and rock","Rap","Hip-hop","Music","Culture","Oasis","Slipknot","The Who"],"tags":[{"id":"music/kanyewest","webTitle":"Kanye West"},{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock"},{"id":"music/rap","webTitle":"Rap"},{"id":"music/hip-hop","webTitle":"Hip-hop"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"music/oasis","webTitle":"Oasis"},{"id":"music/slipknot","webTitle":"Slipknot"},{"id":"music/who","webTitle":"The Who"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tim Jonze","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/timjonze"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/musicblog/2015/jul/13/kanye-west-why-cant-rocknrolls-old-guard-handle-him","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4atpg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/musicblog/2015/jul/13/kanye-west-why-cant-rocknrolls-old-guard-handle-him","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jul/13/kanye-west-why-cant-rocknrolls-old-guard-handle-him"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436797665625/030e7dd3-6ec8-49c0-a263-fd6182f8488c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"He’s alive, and Elvis isn’t … Kanye West at Glastonbury 2015.

The film, which will be released in UK cinemas this month, was written by a first-time screenwriter and directed by Hobson, who has spent the last 15 years designing title and credit sequences for other people’s films. It had a budget of $1.4m (&pound;900,000) the director said.</p> \n<p>Yet Schwarzenegger came on board as both actor and producer after reading the script, playing against type as a protective father who fights to save his adolescent daughter when she becomes infected with a walking-dead virus.

His father is a university lecturer, his mother a radiographer. He could barely believe it as he watched the footage produced during the film’s 25-day shoot. Schwarzenegger is in almost every scene. </p> \n<p>“[I thought] this isn’t quite normal. This is someone I’ve grown up with seeing on screen … a pinch-yourself moment,” he said.</p> \n<p>Schwarzenegger became intrigued by the script – written by John Scott, a Nasa engineer – after it appeared on the industry’s “black list”, for the best unproduced screenplays.</p> \n<p>“When I read it, I knew I had to do it,” the actor recalls in the production notes. “It is more vulnerable than any role I have played, more real, more emotional. You’re used to seeing me play the <em tabindex=\"-1\">ubermensch</em>, the action hero bullets can’t seem to hit. </p> \n<p>“In Maggie, I am the everyman … dealing with the most basic concerns – protecting his family.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWU0D9K1g5E\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWU0D9K1g5E?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>After training at the Royal College of Art – inspired by another former student, Sir Ridley Scott, who went on to become an Oscar-winning director – Hobson designed the title, end and credit sequences for films such as Robin Hood and Sherlock Holmes.</p> \n<p>There is a “community of ardent graphic design fans”, but audiences are generally more interested in their popcorn or in grabbing their coats when the credits roll: “You’ll see the film, watch your work come on – and then you see all these faces turning [away from the screen],” Hobson said.</p> \n<p>He used his skills as a visual artist to woo Schwarzenegger, producing storyboard images that were so intricate and extensive, they spanned some 200 pages. They detailed “my thoughts behind each scene”, he said. “[Schwarzenegger had] never seen that before … It put him in my headspace.”</p> \n<p>Hobson produced similar images for the rest of his cast, including Abigail Breslin, Oscar-nominated for Little Miss Sunshine, and Joely Richardson, whose recent films include Endless Love.</p> \n<p>Despite taking a break from movies to become California’s governor from 2003 to 2011, his popularity remains high. Having struggled to interest financiers, Maggie’s budget was found as soon as Schwarzenegger was attached to the project.</p> \n<p>“He was such a dedicated actor,” said Hobson. “I felt I was able to get an untapped gem with Arnold. He’s such an amiable personality. He puts everyone at ease.”</p> \n<p>The film will be released on 24 July. It premiered at the Tribeca film festival in April to mixed reviews.</p> \n<p>Rupert Preston, managing director of Vertigo, the film’s UK distributor, said: “For a first-time director on a fairly low-budget, very independent movie, to attach one of the biggest stars in the world is extraordinary.” </p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4b5422fae7b9e4be7068ca969f649ee28dc101cb/0_0_1410_846/1410.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":846,"width":1410,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"YONHAP/AAP","altText":"Schwarzenegger said he was looking forward to playing an everyman character in Maggie.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: YONHAP/AAP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-13T16:19:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T23:21:11Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":53,"contributors":[{"name":"Dalya Alberge","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/dalya-alberge"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Arnold Schwarzenegger","Film","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"film/arnold-schwarzenegger","webTitle":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Dalya Alberge","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/dalya-alberge"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jul/13/arnold-schwarzenegge-british-film-maggie-henry-hobson-arnie","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4atn5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/jul/13/arnold-schwarzenegge-british-film-maggie-henry-hobson-arnie","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/13/arnold-schwarzenegge-british-film-maggie-henry-hobson-arnie"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4b5422fae7b9e4be7068ca969f649ee28dc101cb/0_0_1410_846/1410.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":846,"width":1410,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Schwarzenegger said he was looking forward to playing an everyman character, as a father trying to save his daughter, in Maggie.

Within 24 hours, 300,000 users had signed up to the site, with most of the (actually affordable) stock selling out. </p> \n<p>The main difference between <a href=\"http://www.edbyellen.com/\">EDbyEllen</a> and, say, Gwyneth Paltrow’s <a href=\"http://goop.com/\">Goop</a> or Blake Lively’s <a href=\"https://www.preserve.us/\">Preserve</a> is that it focuses less on prescriptive seed advice and more on the joys of homemaking, Monopoly-inspired pig pins and baseball caps. Ellencore, if you will. Because the internet’s capacity is almost as unlimited as our need for celebrity-endorsed lifestyle advice, it’s perhaps unsurprising that she has branched out into a lifestyle site.
