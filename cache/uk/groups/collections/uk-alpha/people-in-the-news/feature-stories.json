Diagnosed during a routine <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/feb/19/iron-maiden-cancer-bruce-dickinson-chemotherapy-radiology-tumour-tongue\">checkup just before Christmas in 2014</a>, the seven-week course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for a cancerous tumour on his tongue has been successful: “We are very happy to announce that following his recent MRI Scan, Bruce was today officially given the all-clear by his specialists,” the band said in a statement.</p> \n<p>In a post on the <a href=\"http://www.ironmaiden.com/bruce-dickinson-update.html\">Iron Maiden website</a>, the 56-year-old artist thanked his fans, family and his medical team for their support and treatment which has led to this “amazing outcome” </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I’m a firm believer in trying to maintain a positive attitude, and the encouragement from the global Maiden family meant a great deal to me. Right now, I’m feeling extremely motivated and can’t wait to get back to business as usual, as soon as I can!</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Despite this good news, the band will not be performing until 2016, Rod Smallwood stated. “We are of course all absolutely delighted that Bruce’s doctors have pronounced him free of cancer. Although Bruce is naturally eager to resume Maiden activities, it will take a while before he is completely back to full strength, as we explained previously. Because of this, the band will not be touring or playing any shows until next year. We know our fans will understand the situation and, like us, would prefer to wait until Bruce is back to his usual indefatigable levels of fitness before going out on the road.”</p> \n<p>Instead, the band will be concentrating on spending time in the studio, with Smallwood explaining that Iron Maiden’s forthcoming album would “definitely” see the light of day this year. </p> \n<p>He added: “Meanwhile, I’d like to echo Bruce’s words and thank all Maiden fans. You have been incredibly patient, putting Bruce’s health and well-being first during this difficult time and the band and I appreciate all your positive support.”</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431935770351/bd61e18a-6919-4f06-b8e3-d97fd958cb11-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graeme Robertson/Graeme Robertson","altText":"Bruce Dickinson, of Iron Maiden","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graeme Robertson/Graeme Robertson"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-18T08:07:54Z","lastModified":"2015-05-18T08:07:55Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Guardian music","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/guardianmusic"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Iron Maiden","Music","Culture","Metal","Pop and rock","Health"],"tags":[{"id":"music/iron-maiden","webTitle":"Iron Maiden"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"music/metal","webTitle":"Metal"},{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Guardian music","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/guardianmusic"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/18/iron-maiden-bruce-dickinson-gets-cancer-all-clear","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49xqk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/may/18/iron-maiden-bruce-dickinson-gets-cancer-all-clear","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/18/iron-maiden-bruce-dickinson-gets-cancer-all-clear"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431935770351/bd61e18a-6919-4f06-b8e3-d97fd958cb11-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bruce Dickinson, of Iron Maiden Photograph: Graeme Robertson/Graeme Robertson","credit":"Graeme Robertson/Graeme Robertson","altText":"Bruce Dickinson, of Iron Maiden","cleanCaption":"Bruce Dickinson, of Iron Maiden","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graeme Robertson/Graeme Robertson"}},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"Iron Maiden"},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Lauren Child / I never know whether writing is more difficult than illustrating","rawTitle":"I never know whether writing is more difficult than illustrating","item":{"type":"article","id":"childrens-books-site/2015/may/18/lauren-child-interiew-ruby-redfort","title":"Lauren Child: I never know whether writing is more difficult than illustrating","trailText":"Polly and Faye from Heartlands High School library book group find out about Lauren Child’s favourite books, childhood ambitions – and why Marcus du Sautoy writes all the codes in Ruby Redfort.

I think that there were a lot of books that I really loved. The book which I keep going back to is The 18th Emergency by <a href=\"http://www.betsybyars.com/\">Betsy Byars</a>, she’s an American writer and I can read that or any of her other books now and they still feel quite modern. </p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-455663794__\n</div> \n<p><strong>So what inspired you to be an author and illustrator? Have you always liked reading and writing?<br /></strong>I have always liked reading and writing and I have always loved drawing. So I think drawing has always been my passion. I didn’t especially want to become an illustrator or an author – so it kind of happened accidentally.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ce39fd062d10c2cc719d724c305014087ba69e06\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431932104475/670be6e9-c748-46b8-9d3a-e032a777b36a-330x420.jpeg\" alt=\"clarice bean\" width=\"330\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>So what did you want to become?<br /></strong>I wanted to do so many things, that was almost my problem. There were a lot of jobs that I thought would be nice, maybe furniture or interior design or fabric design or ceramics, or making a film. There were just too many things that I wanted to do! I remember one day a friend telling me I should write down a story and illustrate it so somebody could see my ideas for a film or animation. So that’s what I did – and it turned into Clarice Bean, the picture book. Clarice Bean was actually written to become a film and became a book series. Then I wrote Charlie and Lola, and that seemed the simpler one to turn into a TV series.</p> \n<p><strong>Were you the troublesome type or cheeky when you were at school?<br /></strong>I wasn’t really bad but too much yakking was my problem. I was quite a keen pupil, I was quite competitive and always wanted to learn.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/childrens-books-site/2015/feb/15/my-inspiration-lauren-child-alfred-hitchcock-ruby-redfort\">My inspiration: Lauren Child on Alfred Hitchcock</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>So what was your easiest book or series to write?<br /></strong>Oh, I have never been asked that question. It’s funny, they all have difficulties and I never know whether writing is more difficult than illustrating. They are both equally hard in a way. Writing the <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/look-into-my-eyes.html\">Ruby Redfort</a> books is particularly difficult as they are very plot based. There are lots of little threads and you have to pull them together. If you don’t draw up all those dots you’re in trouble. I think probably the easiest book I have done for a very, very long time was my latest picture book which is called the <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/new-small-person.html\">New Small Person</a>. It is about a little boy who gets a brother and really doesn’t want one. For some reason that book was so clear in my head that I knew exactly how I was going to do the pictures, and that practically never happens. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b10a830747e0d0ff054be857f8f36bc046959a68\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431705533872/05858303-83ce-408e-aa16-f7ffde4a98f2-382x420.png\" alt=\"Small person\" width=\"382\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Ruby Redfort is quite confusing with all the codes and equations, how did you come up with all of them?<br /></strong>Ah, well it’s all very clever here, as I am not very good with all that stuff and I have written about a child who is meant to be a genius. The problem is when you about someone who is meant to be really clever is that you have to convince your reader. So I got someone really clever to write all the codes, maths and puzzles. He’s called Marcus du Sautoy, a maths professor . You will probably have seen him as he is on television a lot talking about maths and how to get you really interested in it. I now see maths as something that is much more colourful than we are led to believe and it was only when I grew up that I began to see that maths is really interesting as there are so many different levels to it. There is maths in music as well and fans will notice that there is a maths in music code in one of the Ruby Redfort novels. </p> \n<p><strong>The code I thought was clever was in Catch your Death, where they have the smell code with perfume<br /></strong>That really did test Marcus because it was very difficult to show it pictorially – as we had to make the book interesting and understandable. Although it’s hard to follow, at least you can see all the diagrams and how it makes sense. In an ideal world we would have sold the book with lots of little bottles of perfume so that you could smell the smells. But that would have been a bit tricky (and expensive!)</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Do you prefer to work in silence or with things going on around you?<br /></strong>Bit of both actually. Sometimes I like writing in a cafe where there is just noise. Not noise that is distracting but just that hubbub so I don’t feel that I am completely on my own. Somehow it helps me concentrate as I know that other people are doing things and are there. Other times I like to be quite quiet as my head is just too full. Other times I like to have music because it sets me in that world and I have this sort of little Ruby Redfort soundtrack that I listen to of all my songs that I think suggest thrillers, that kind of slightly creepy sound or music that I think she might like or listen to.</p> \n<p><strong>So when you are sitting around people or listening to music do you hear words that might be useful in what you are writing?<br /></strong>That’s interesting. Sometimes music can be too interfering if it has lyrics. In the first book, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/look-into-my-eyes.html\">Look into my Eyes</a>, there’s a eerie song called Mr Sandman that’s playing as this tower is filling with sand. It’s going to suffocate Ruby. It’s almost like a lullaby. I was listening to Mr Sandman over and over when I wrote that – and somehow the words of that really helped conjure this terrible death. Ideas feed in and give you a whole chain of other ideas.</p> \n<p><strong>Are the Clarice Bean or Ruby Redfort series’ going to be a TV series or film?<br /></strong>Do you know, I would love nothing more. There was a point when I had done Charlie and Lola that I really wanted to just sit back and do not do any more TV for a while because it was exhausting. It was really interesting but I have never worked harder and I felt that I just wanted to go back to my lovely books. When you’re quiet and you are just working with your editor and your designer and it is such a simple process. But now I think I would love to do a stage show with Clarice because I just think that it would be really nice</p> \n<p><strong>When I read Ruby Redfort, I really think about how she is a really, really good character as she’s brave, she’s popular and clever<br /></strong>Aw, I’m so glad you think that, as I didn’t write her to be particularly there as a girl character, I just want her to be a great character. But I thought it would be really nice if she was in a girl’s body - as we don’t see enough clever, courageous, sassy girls.</p> \n<p><em>And now we want to share the newly re-issued covers of the first three of Lauren Child’s Ruby Redfort books.

His work contributed significantly to defining the global public health importance of the leishmaniases, a group of neglected tropical diseases.</p> \n<p>These are caused by parasites from more than 20 species of <em>Leishmania</em> being transmitted to a variety of mammals, including humans, by the bites of phlebotomine sandflies. There are three main forms of the disease – cutaneous, visceral and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis – that affect between 1 and 2 million people each year.</p> \n<p>Lainson first went to the tropics in 1960 as director of the Dermal Leishmaniasis Unit in British Honduras (now Belize). His aim was to find the source of cutaneous leishmaniasis, known locally as “chiclero ulcer”. In 1965, he established the Wellcome Trust Parasitology Unit at the Evandro Chagas Institute in Bel&eacute;m, northern Brazil, with a three-year grant. He stayed for five decades, and under his direction the unit made many significant discoveries about leishmaniasis and other parasitic diseases. Together with his collaborators, he described more than 100 species of protozoan parasites in Brazil alone and published more than 150 scientific papers. He even had a parasite named after him: <em>Leishmania (Viannia) lainsoni</em>, discovered in 1987.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c21b761300a21f6d7576d4184aa45fb62a87ffcc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431875805627/3435220b-fddf-48c7-aff4-94c0bbae4b39-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Leishmaniasis: bone marrow smear.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leishmaniasis: bone marrow smear.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wellcome Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In 1969, he published the first record of Chagas disease, another infection of great public health importance for Latin America, in the Amazon region of Brazil, demonstrating that it could spread easily through food contaminated with faeces from species of blood-sucking triatomine bugs. By 1979, 13 <em>Leishmania</em> species had been discovered in the Americas, eight of which infected humans, and Lainson proposed a new classification system, which has helped to define outbreaks of the disease in the region.</p> \n<p>This improved knowledge of the complex ecology, epidemiology and distribution of each leishmania species has had considerable public health and therapeutic implications for the control of the wide range of symptoms caused by these parasites. Brazil’s increasing urbanisation has meant that groups are often exposed to different species and the variety of sandflies that transmit them.</p> \n<p>Lainson was born in Upper Beeding, West Sussex, to Anne (n&eacute;e Denyer) and Charles, a chemist who worked for Portland Cement. His love affair with the parasitic world began, far from the tropics, while fishing with his father on the rivers of Sussex. He was educated at Steyning grammar school, and served in the army during the second world war, before reading biology at Brighton Technical College and then joining the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), where he completed his PhD and worked as a lecturer under the supervision of Professor Cyril Garnham.</p> \n<p>Lainson recalled that, one day, the professor called his young lecturer into his office. “He said to me, ‘Lainson, you can’t learn anything about tropical medicine in London, you’ve got to go to the tropics.’” Garnham arranged for Lainson to go to British Honduras to work on the epidemiology of leishmaniasis. “He had a very dry sense of humour. I was a bit disappointed with the low salary, and he said, ‘Oh Lainson, you needn’t worry, there are all sorts of bush meat you can eat. I understand that the iguana tails are very nice … ’”</p> \n<p>Lainson was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1982 and in the same year was awarded an honorary fellowship at LSHTM, the school’s most prestigious honour. He received the Chalmers medal (1971) and Manson medal (1982) from the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, alongside a string of awards for services to parasitology in Brazil. In 1996 he was made OBE.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"deaf549a2f15930165c13b864cd5db211d060be3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431875954182/d9bb6182-ae64-435d-806d-5310e1b9c790-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ralph Lainson, right, being congratulated by the Duke of Edinburgh.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ralph Lainson, right, being congratulated by the Duke of Edinburgh. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wellcome Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Although the Wellcome Unit closed in 1992, its legacy continues at the Instituto Evandro Chagas, now a hub for visiting scientists researching all aspects of <em>Leishmania</em> and other parasites, from ecology to epidemiology, immunology and the genetics of host responses to infection. Lainson continued to be funded by the Wellcome Trust and held the record as their longest-serving grant-holder at 47 years.

Call me old fashioned but I thought one’s job as an actor was not to present one’s boring, small, microscopic universe but to make a psychological connection to another character’s experiences. My own life is of no interest to anyone else. Or maybe it is. But I certainly have no interest in putting my own thoughts and opinions out there.”</p> \n<p>Blanchett said she admired the restraint exhibited by the characters in the film, who speak about the sex lives only sparingly. “[Carol’s] sexuality is a private affair. What often happens these days is if your are homosexual you have to talk about it constantly, the only thing, before your work. We’re living in a deeply conservative time.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-211b05d5-9144-4a7f-9e6a-cf6f5a123df3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431864318518/eba4ac61-fbf8-4937-814f-8e1964a821e2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett in Carol, directed by Todd Haynes.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett in Carol</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The actor confirmed that her research had involved consuming countless lesbian novels written in the middle of the last century, of which Carol appeared to be “the only one with a happy ending”. “They were outsider novels. Carol was not a card-carrying member of any sexual persuasion. That’s also important to remember: those labels, those groups, the comfort of them, didn’t exist then. The resultant isolation was very important.”</p> \n<p>The film is the most mainstream American depiction of a lesbian relationship made to date. Its screenwriter, Phyllis Nagy, has spent 14 years attempting to get it made; that she finally had, she said, amounted to “a huge political statement.” In the time since Highsmith wrote the novel, “nothing has changed and everything has changed. Because we can have this movie now. It starts the kinds of discussion we need to have about this issue. We do not we politicise the material by just allowing people to live their lives honestly. [Gay people] are expected to make it an issue front and centre in our lives.

Her <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcOYx4_72Zo\">ghostly chants, guttural growls, gasps and moans</a> are enough to make Bj&ouml;rk, her sometime collaborator, sound as demure as a choirgirl.</p> \n<p>Her latest album, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItYoFr3LpDw\">Animism</a> (which fought off competition from Drake and Arcade Fire to win the <a href=\"http://polarismusicprize.ca/\">Polaris prize</a>, Canada’s answer to the Mercury), fuses her musical roots with everything from punk to electronica: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCuayGvy3i8\">the result is sometimes haunting, sometimes orgiastic, and always extraordinary</a>. So it comes as no surprise when she tells me that not only are her concerts entirely improvised but “If they are good shows, I pretty much lose consciousness. Nothing exists, but it’s not scary, it’s total peace. I will hear a tiny voice, and it sounds like it is far away and it gets louder and louder, and then I realise it’s coming from my mouth.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e74a7a5dda80b12649857b75810d0f1230637ed\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431703910765/f2a1390f-66d9-4e40-9595-f2c1849575eb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tagaq with her mother\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tagaq with her mother </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If all this sounds rather intense, Tagaq is happy to laugh at herself: “I find the idea of covering songs from an indigenous woman’s perspective really funny,” she admits. “For instance, the idea of [Pixies track] Caribou being sung by someone who eats and hunts caribou, is … just funny to me.”</p> \n<p>Her Inuit heritage is never far from her mind, but instead of making her music nostalgic or folky it brings a political edge. Growing up in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunavut\">Nanuvat</a>, a majority Inuit area, Tagaq saw the effect of Canadian attempts to systematically dismantle Inuit culture. Her mother, she tells me, was “born and raised in an igloo” in <a href=\"http://www.nunavuttourism.com/regions-communities/pond-inlet\">Pond Inlet</a>, a pristine area above the Arctic Circle. It is magical, Tagaq says: “Huge, jagged mountains rise out of the water. There are bears, seals, and it’s rich in marine life.”</p> \n<p>Yet in the 1950s, the family were relocated to <a href=\"http://www.nunavuttourism.com/regions-communities/resolute\">Resolute Bay</a> (“a shithole”) by the Canadian government, making it harder to live off the land. Later, the family moved even further away from their roots – to the larger Cambridge Bay. Tagaq was sent to a residential school – a system created to forcibly assimilate indigenous children into Canadian culture. (The <a href=\"http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2008/06/11/pm-offers-full-apology-behalf-canadians-indian-residential-schools-system\">Canadian prime minister has now apologised</a> for the “damaging impact the schools had on aboriginal culture, heritage and language”.)</p> \n<p>“During my childhood, everyone was trying to throw away Inuk culture,” she tells me sadly. So it was not until she was at university in Nova Scotia, and homesick, that her mother thought to send her tapes of traditional throat singing. “I woke up,” she says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCuayGvy3i8\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BCuayGvy3i8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Although it is traditionally a duet form passed on through generations, Tagaq learnt to sing it alone, often in the shower. “When I started, it felt like I was flushing out all the pain,” she recalls. “It has taken me 40 years to have a true pride in who I am.”</p> \n<p>Now Tagaq is determined to use her growing profile to highlight her community’s issues. Animism includes a frightening track called Fracking, and Tagaq is quick to point out that the government wants to start seismic testing in Pond Inlet. “In the Canadian prime minister’s eyes, Inuit people are a problem because we are demanding our rights and blocking resource development because we don’t want our land to be ruined.”</p> \n<p>But it is her opposition to curbs on seal-hunting that has brought her the most attention. Last year, Tagaq joined other indigenous activists posting a “sealfie” on Twitter to combat the anti seal hunting message Ellen Degeneres sent out while hosting the Oscars.</p> \n<p>Tagaq says few people seem to understand the frightening levels of deprivation among the Inuit. “There are reserves in Canada which are like third world countries.”. Seal-hunting, she explains, allowed communities in remote areas to at least feed themselves and use the money from selling pelts to pay their rent. “All the groceries have to be flown up, and you would not believe how much they cost. I have seen a roast for $130 in the store. My mother didn’t grow up with money – it’s very new for people, but you need it.”</p> \n<p>When an international ban on seal products came in in the 1970s it caused real problems – despite the exemptions for the Inuit communities – because pelts were no longer seen as desirable. “Our only sustainable natural resource was taken from us. The suicide rate spiked because all of a sudden … people can’t feed their families and sell the pelt to provide rent, clothing and all the things we need in this new monetary culture. I work as a substitute teacher when I go home, and some of the kids just don’t have enough food. Their teeth have all fallen out and they are skinny and malnourished.”</p> \n<p>Because she had grown up hunting for food, Tagaq said it felt natural to post a <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=tanya+tagaq+sealfie+guardian&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1693&amp;bih=932&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Gu9VVeLkNoSt7Ab6gIMI&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAw&amp;dpr=1#imgrc=hhqgk0I0yvuvRM%253A%3B1DgnMv_Z38fSFM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fcklbradio.com%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2014%252F03%252FSEALFIE2-665x363.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fcklbradio.com%252F2014%252F03%252F31%252Fsealfie-campaign-photo-draw-ire%252F%3B665%3B363\">photo of her baby daughter next to a seal her family had killed</a>. “To me, that picture is like the photo with all the family around the turkey at Thanksgiving,” she explains. “That’s the effect of that photo on Inuit people – they are like ‘that’s so cute’. If you are going to eat meat, you shouldn’t be grossed out by where it comes from. When Inuit kill seals, we pour snow into their mouths so that their souls are not thirsty in the afterlife. There is a lot of respect there.”</p> \n<p>Yet the reaction was terrifying. “I had people petitioning to take my child away. I had death threats. I had someone photoshopping my baby being skinned. I had to go to the police.”</p> \n<p>Undeterred, Tagaq used her acceptance speech at the Polaris award to encourage people to eat seal meat, wear seal fur and finally shouted “Fuck Peta!” on stage. Today she is unrepentant, insisting that those who oppose hunting by the Inuit or poor communities on Canada’s east coast should send parcels to the food banks – or campaign closer to home. “In Canada, 660m farm animals are killed annually. Those poor animals have lived in a cage, pumped with antibiotics. I think these animal-rights activists should be marching to the slaughterhouses in their vicinity. March on McDonald’s.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14954e5a478a95c7916f63485434194c3a4ab0ac\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431704140011/b47f81eb-082a-420f-ae06-81bb89d3da20-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tagaq, with her daughter\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tagaq, with her daughter</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What Tagaq does regret is how the row has obscured another pressing issue. During her Polaris performance, the names of the 1,200 indigenous women who have been murdered or gone missing in the past 30 years scrolled down a screen. It is something the UN has taken up, saying the Canadian government has repeatedly failed to stop decades of violence against First Nations women. It is a statistic that terrifies her and she hopes to raise the issue in London. “If your daughter was four times more likely to be murdered than the girl across the street, what would you do to stop it? ”</p> \n<p>If all this seems dour, Tagaq is also keen to stress Inuit success stories and the strength of Inuit women (her mother has a BA in education, “that’s quite a leap in one generation,” she points out). She uses her concerts, too, to explore sexuality and femininity.</p> \n<p>“In mainstream culture, women are not supposed to enjoy their flesh. Inuit women have to be strong … and sex wasn’t seen as dirty. There are rules and taboos, but there are literally three months when the sun never rises and it is minus 50. So when you are watching your fifth movie, you look over at your best friend and you say, ‘Do you want to hook up?’</p> \n<p>“It was such a huge culture shock when I went to university. The rules were: you act like you are a virgin, pretend you are drunk and then you hook up. I didn’t understand why I had to pretend to not like sex! I love the ecstatic and extreme emotions I can convey on stage, but I like to mix together what is sexy. There’s sex and death – procreation, fear, anger and laughter.”</p> \n<p>For someone specialising in wordless singing, Tagaq has a lot to say. And she hasn’t finished yet. “If my singing is a platform to help these issues being raised, then I will do it with love, with laughter and with fists.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Animism is out now.
