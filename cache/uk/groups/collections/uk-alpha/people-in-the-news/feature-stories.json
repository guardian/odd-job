But he’s gotta realize many of the old fans aren’t big on this new stuff. And being happy doesn’t = saying you’re happy all the time. It means making great stuff.”<br /></p> \n<p>The thread prompted a <a href=\"http://new.spring.me/#!/wolfhaley/q/735688173690057665?utm_source=social\">lengthy response from Tyler </a>on the question and answer social network Spring.me. Over the course of nearly 1,000 words, he wrote: “why cant i share my joy with the world? ohhh, it was cool when i was raping girls” – a reference to his <a href=\"http://genius.com/182000/Tyler-the-creator-blow/And-you-call-this-shit-rape-but-i-think-that-rapes-fun\">controversial early material such as Blow</a> – “and telling you how sad i was on records, but when shit changes and im feeling great and i fuck with myself you cant deal with it? cause you cant relate? is that why?”</p> \n<p>He continued to say: “its crazy, all im doing is spreading good vibes and tryna give some confidence to people and at least telling them they can accomplish something. sometimes giving some people some hope can really push people to be great.”</p> \n<p>Tyler also took issue with the criticism that his life was no longer relatable to the average fan. In the Reddit post, the former fan, apparently 19, writes: “I’m tired of his arrogant, braggadocios and unrelatable recent attitude. I can’t relate to him talking about wanting a McLaren, having big chains, or being a god like I related to him rapping about his life and feeling depressed because he was stuck in a house arguing with his grandma or about girl trouble.”</p> \n<p>Tyler took particular issue with this criticism, responding: “dude, that was in 2011. its 2015, if he really thinks that 4 years later i would still be living on my dead grandmothers floor, and still be sad with all these amazing things happening around me, then he is stuck in 2011.</p> \n<p>He added: “i dont know what to tell you, my life is in a different spot right now and like on every album, i talk about whats going on in my life AT THAT MOMENT. shit, that would be sooo sad if i was making the same album over and over again.”</p> \n<p>There was also a cryptic allusion to the current relationships within Odd Future, after the fan had said: “Honestly I’m not surprised most of OF no longer hangs out with him.”</p> \n<p>Tyler hit back to say: “the thing that does suck is that people that dont know what goes on in our personal lives always seems to think they know whats really going on. trust me, you dont know.”<br /></p> \n<p>Tyler’s message ended on a defiant note, even if it was laced with an element of self-doubt. He concluded: “sorry that i like cars and like to talk about it, soooo sorry that ive turned into the guy i hated ( idk if thats true but that what yall think , i have not worn leather pants or been to the club ha) sorry for being me, i apologize in advance cause IM GONNA CONTINUE TO DO THAT FOREVER.”<br /></p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/7/25/1406290397159/Tyler-The-Creator-Perform-012.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Joseph Okpako/Redferns via Getty Images","altText":"Tyler, the Creator performs at the Forum in London","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Joseph Okpako/Redferns via Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T07:06:16Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T07:52:41Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":3,"contributors":[{"name":"Guardian music","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/guardianmusic"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All","Rap","Pop and rock","Hip-hop","Music","Culture","Urban music"],"tags":[{"id":"music/odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all","webTitle":"Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All"},{"id":"music/rap","webTitle":"Rap"},{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock"},{"id":"music/hip-hop","webTitle":"Hip-hop"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"music/urban","webTitle":"Urban music"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Guardian music","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/guardianmusic"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/19/tyler-the-creator-hits-back-at-reddit-critic-sorry-for-being-me","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avyk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jun/19/tyler-the-creator-hits-back-at-reddit-critic-sorry-for-being-me","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/19/tyler-the-creator-hits-back-at-reddit-critic-sorry-for-being-me"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2014/7/25/1406290397159/Tyler-The-Creator-Perform-012.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘All I’m doing is spreading good vibes’ ...

But she is only just beginning to get the kind of roles she really wants</p>","byline":"Ryan Gilbey","body":"<p>It’s 10am in Los Angeles and Kathryn Hahn is sitting in her car, having just dropped her children off at school. Only recently did her young son and daughter cotton on to what their 41-year-old mother does for a living. “We were having dinner,” she tells me on the phone, “and my son said: ‘So you’re an actor, right?’ I&nbsp;was, like, ‘Yeah.’ He said: ‘Show me your act, then.’ ... Boy, he really put me on the spot. I tried to bust out some dinosaur noises for him; told a joke. I gotta say, it was not impressive. It fell flat.”</p> \n<p>What she really needs, I suggest, is some Pixar voice work. “That would swing it. Though my kids did see me in that Disney movie, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/tomorrowland\" title=\"\">Tomorrowland</a>. They were very excited that Mummy got her head blown off and turned out to be a robot. It was much better than when they saw me on <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YsrxtAyhpKY/VSE3tb7rG7I/AAAAAAABpfU/6cemGbcAlVU/s1600/happyish-header.jpg\" title=\"\">billboards with some strange man</a>. ‘Oh look, Mummy’s in bed with a man who isn’t Daddy and the whole of Los Angeles can see …’”</p> \n<p>Suddenly she lets out a little gasp. “I’ve been parked here the whole time we’ve been speaking,” she says, “and now there are a couple of uniformed officers circling the car.” There’s a brief moment of silence while she keeps an eye on their movements. “I’m just wondering if I put enough money in the meter …” Another pause. “No, it’s fine. They’re gone. We’re all good.”</p> \n<p>While it’s nice that she didn’t get into any trouble, the world has now been denied an entertaining and not-untypical Kathryn Hahn scene that might have been. Chances are the cops would have recognised her. Most likely from one of the raucous comedies to which she has added pep over the past decade. Maybe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBVGs8YXoJc\" title=\"\">Step Brothers</a>, where she jumped John C Reilly’s bones at every opportunity. Or <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2013/aug/22/were-the-millers-review\" title=\"\">We’re the Millers</a>, in which she played the chirpy matriarch in a motor home who cosies up to <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/jennifer-aniston\" title=\"\">Jennifer Aniston</a> and her fake family. Or <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2012/mar/01/wanderlust-review\" title=\"\">Wanderlust</a>, again with Aniston, where Hahn played an abrasive hippy. If the cops are telly fans, they might have caught her as the working mother who <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/girls\" title=\"\">employs Jessa as a nanny in Girls</a>, or as the fierce, dazzling campaign manager who tells Amy&nbsp;Poehler in <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/parks-and-recreation\" title=\"\">Parks and Recreation</a>: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0rBZz4_iJE\" title=\"\">“You can trust me because I don’t care enough about you to lie.”</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"73829418f7fb02e4bf0bfa982b6b0e4b5d131af6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434638078952/37b546fc-c587-4930-a436-dc3619dd9e75-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"We're the Millers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Motor-home madness in We’re the Millers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Failing all that, it would simply have been a blast to hear Hahn talk her way out of a parking ticket. In a short space of time, she has become one of those performers on whom audiences can depend to produce results out of all proportion to the size of her role. Her latest is as the wife of an unfaithful theatre director (Owen Wilson) in the lightweight farce <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/aug/29/shes-funny-that-way-bogdanovich-is-back-but-the-laughs-arent-review\" title=\"\">She’s Funny That Way</a>. It’s her third film with her old chum Aniston (Hahn <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQlx9nLo9lc\" title=\"\">gave a speech</a> when the Friends actor got her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame) and is directed by the&nbsp;<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/aug/29/peter-bogdanovich-venice-film-festival-shes-funny-like-that\" title=\"\">Peter&nbsp;Bogdanovich</a>.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think Peter likes the kind of improv-heavy, nasty comedy that there is so much of these days – and which I’m personally all for, I gotta tell you. There’s a buoyancy he brings to this movie that is amazing when you step back and look at what it’s about. I mean, my character’s husband has a weakness for prostitutes – come on!”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"923bc73e071fbd997fd3eb6ea76e43e09b1ac14c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434638406625/df9e36a5-1064-473f-9cb2-2799e8928b8a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hahn with David Harbour in Revolutionary Road.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hahn with David Harbour in Revolutionary Road.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar/BBC FILMS</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The best you could say about the film is that it would have been worse in the hands of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/woodyallen\" title=\"\">Woody Allen</a>. But Hahn is magnificent, her performance escalating from casual jauntiness to righteous mania as she confronts the scale of her husband’s infidelities. “I don’t know if you’re with me or not on this,” she says, “but, to me, it’s never that interesting when someone is reaching for the laugh. You have to have it rooted in truth otherwise it’s all just artifice. It&nbsp;doesn’t matter how crazy it gets, it still has to be recognisable.”</p> \n<p>In her controlled hysteria there are echoes of the comic legend <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/1999/dec/06/guardianobituaries2\" title=\"\">Madeline Kahn</a>, who played another wronged woman in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_Up,_Doc%3F_%281972_film%29\" title=\"\">Bogdanovich’s 1972 screwball masterpiece What’s Up, Doc?</a>. At the comparison, Hahn releases a shriek loud enough to bring those cops scurrying back. “OK, I am gonna hang up now because this day cannot get any better! She was a doll. The idea that I could get anywhere close to that is just … She has inspired everything I’ve done. She is a genius.”</p> \n<p>Some of us are starting to feel the same way about Hahn. It isn’t just that she can convey an entire life in one incredulous grimace or narrow-eyed smile. There is also her dexterity. As wild as she got in Step Brothers, flinging herself at the object of her affection in the men’s bathroom before peeing nonchalantly at a urinal, she never let the comedy obscure her character’s desperation (“I hate my life!” she wailed). Her dramatic work is just as impressive: she was Kate&nbsp;Winslet’s neighbour in <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/revolutionary-road\" title=\"\">Revolutionary Road</a>, and gave her most complex performance yet as a married mother drawn to a young female sex-worker in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/mar/27/afternoon-delight-review-hahn-juno-temple-stripper\" title=\"\">Afternoon Delight</a> (written and directed by Jill Soloway, who also cast Hahn as a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/mar/31/jill-soloway-afternoon-delight\" title=\"\">troubled rabbi</a> in her Amazon Prime <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/26/jeffrey-tambor-transparent-interview\" title=\"\">series Transparent</a>).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0a418998841e5e97233b2ce48dad51bcba31055\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434638338835/16968ddc-b207-493c-8752-27946d91f07a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Owen Wilson and Kathryn Hahn in She's Funny That Way.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Owen Wilson and Kathryn Hahn in She’s Funny That Way.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Clarius Entertainment</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I don’t make any distinction between comedy and drama. My favourite summer of all was when I&nbsp;was shooting Revolutionary Road and Step Brothers back to back, or We’re the Millers and Afternoon Delight. I love comedy and feel like I fit into that world, but I also feel like I’m a visitor there sometimes. I never say I’m a natural improviser but, if I&nbsp;have that bulletproof shell of knowing the character inside out, then I can do it. On Step Brothers there were a lot of shitty takes we didn’t use, but it’s all part of the creativity.” One of her favourite films, she says, is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2011/jul/03/film-changed-life-cameron-mitchell\" title=\"\">John Cassavetes’s A Woman Under the Influence</a>. “It’s not comic, but there’s a&nbsp;fearlessness about <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2001/mar/02/culture.features3\" title=\"\">Gena Rowlands</a> that is unhinged.

Now I’m not sure what I am. Afternoon Delight was probably the first time I thought, ‘This is what I wanted someone to ask of me.’” That 2013 film helped awaken the industry to the extent of Hahn’s capabilities. The epiphany might have come even sooner if the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2011/aug/29/absolutely-fabulous-prescient-ab-fab\" title=\"\">US TV version of Absolutely Fabulous</a>, in which she played Eddy opposite her Girls co-star <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2014/jan/19/zosia-mamet-shoshanna-girls\" title=\"\">Zosia&nbsp;Mamet</a> as Saffy and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Johnston\" title=\"\">Kristen Johnston</a> as Patsy, had been greenlit.</p> \n<p>“We did the pilot, but it was the worst timing: right in the middle of the financial crisis. No one wanted to hear about excess. But they were such despicable people that there was something very liberating about doing it. I love the comedy of unearned confidence: people wanting something so badly that they stop themselves getting it. Happiness always just out of reach.”</p> \n<p>She addresses a similar subject in her latest TV series, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2015/apr/24/happyish-steve-coogans-new-vehicle-has-some-growing-paynes\" title=\"\">Happyish</a>. The pilot starred the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/feb/03/philip-seymour-hoffman\" title=\"\">late Philip Seymour Hoffman</a> as a dissatisfied advertising executive; it was retooled several years later for his’s replacement, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/culture/coogan\" title=\"\">Steve Coogan</a>. “It’s looking at how to be present and happy in your life,” Hahn explains. “How do you stop searching for happiness when it could be right in front of you? It’s something I’ve come across so many times. It’s about not always reaching for something else. There’s a certain point in your life when you’re like: ‘Oh, wow. Maybe I won’t win the Academy award. Now what?’”</p> \n<p><em>She’s Funny That Way is released in the UK on 26 June.</em></p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434636644816/Kathryn-Hahn-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kathryn Hahn: 'I love comedy and feel like I fit into that world.'
