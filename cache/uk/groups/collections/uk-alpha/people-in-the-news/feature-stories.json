If it is in crisis, Britain is in crisis. For reasons that may never be fathomed, the motoring show joins the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/may/20/marks-spencer-profits-jump-mark-bolland\" title=\"\">health of Marks &amp; Spencer sales</a> and the porosity of Manchester United’s back four as key indicators of Where We Are At as a&nbsp;country.</p> \n<p>Maddeningly, some people still haven’t got the memo. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02v7q9l/player\" title=\"\">Interviewing Tony Hall on his programme last Sunday</a>, Andrew Marr completely let the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/media/tony-hall\" title=\"\">BBC director general</a> off the hook, questioning him for what felt like a mere 37 minutes on the matter of Top Gear. Disappointing, Marr: I accept you&nbsp;asked 98.7% of all possible questions relating to the programme in&nbsp;its past and future incarnations, but you had a real opportunity to probe Hall on the precise clauses relating to hot-steak provision in Chris Evans’s contract, and you flunked it. Is it true that the DG personally ordered the destruction of all footage of the time James Spader and Rosanna Arquette did <a href=\"http://www.topgear.com/uk/track-guide?LapType=Kia-Ceed\" title=\"\">Star in a Reasonably Priced Car</a>, believing its depravity capable of destroying the corporation? It would have been nice if he had been asked.</p> \n<p>That said, could the current motoring show battle be any sexier? In&nbsp;the south, Jeremy Clarkson marshals his forces to unleash a rival programme, probably via <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/media/netflix\" title=\"\">Netflix</a>, while undermining his successor by claiming a BBC executive offered him his job back in&nbsp;the days before Chris Evans was announced as the new Top Gear host. In the north, Evans retaliates by alluding to “the voices” in Jeremy’s head. Then, purring up on the inside in&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://wackyraces.wikia.com/wiki/Penelope_Pitstop\" title=\"\">Compact Pussycat</a> comes Carol Vorderman, who says she was in the hotel bar where Clarkson met the BBC executive and that he told her the job offer story at the time. By Christmas, every British citizen will have had to pick a&nbsp;side – if you can’t choose, just do Eeny Meeny Miny Mo – and the country will erupt into cathartic civil war.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a4cea0ed0b8ec42c91ad8845d585d3377c0180f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435246255326/fbce44db-3ad0-43d5-8f69-c55b8fab92bb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The old guard: (left to right) Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May in Top Gear earlier this year.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The old guard: (left to right) Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May in Top Gear earlier this year.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC Worldwide Limited/BBC Worldwide Limited</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The main thing to realise is that it can only be this way. Like “desert mode” on a Range Rover Vogue, controversy comes as standard, because if you can’t use cars to examine the fissures in civil society, then what on earth is the point of cars? My feeling is that the breakaway Clarkson show will consider revisiting the segment in one of last year’s Top Gears when Richard Hammond revealed he had painted a confederate flag on the roof of his Toyota Corolla when he was 17. “Twelve Years a Hammond,” observed Clarkson, much to the delight of the studio audience. (I&nbsp;have a terrible weakness for the studio audience: where else can you see crowds of blokes gathered round a&nbsp;car, shifting slightly awkwardly from foot to foot and trying not to meet each other’s eyes? All right, where else apart from a&nbsp;secluded layby off the A404 of a&nbsp;Saturday night?)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3337e5ea50e3c5e14bc42f7cc10f8726a0c26e0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435246484207/d60ffdfc-6703-41ae-b643-9eb89dd8814c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Way to go?

When David Cronenberg tried something extremely similar with his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSsYUAKGQs4&amp;oref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DiSsYUAKGQs4&amp;has_verified=1\" title=\"\">brilliant movie Crash</a>, where did it get him? <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/crash-faces-ban-from-west-end-1351586.html\" title=\"\">Banned (shamefully) by Westminster council</a>. That, I’m afraid, is what market failure looks like, and it&nbsp;is to the eternal credit of the BBC that it realised the national broadcaster needed to step in and covertly service those given to lurking in motoring forums and typing “I would literally have sex with this car” under pictures of a blacked-out Audi RS5.</p> \n<p>Indeed, it is a tribute to the gossamer touch of the show’s production team that this surreptitious celebration of the other kind of auto-eroticism was possible for so long. It certainly required extensive misdirection. Biannual race rows, international diplomatic incidents: these were all wildly successful ploys to get the spluttering classes to look the other way while Clarkson &amp; Co took a hot hatch to the dark side.</p> \n<p>Clearly, both the Evans and Clarkson vehicles will now be looking for eye-catching initiatives to draw the headlines and ratings. Might Lost in&nbsp;Showbiz respectfully suggest a&nbsp;campaign for the decriminalisation of mechanophilia? Heaven knows how it is still possible in this day and age that those whose only crime is to have had it off with a car are still required to sign the sex offenders’ register if they’re caught – <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanophilia\" title=\"\">but it is</a>. In the name of sanity, let one or other of these vehicular warrior programmes use their immense power for good. Let’s end the stigma. Let’s get this show on the road.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435244403942/ab295bf9-08c5-4e33-89c6-9795f7470918-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Beretta/Sims/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Chris Evans (left), who will now be in the driving seat at Top Gear following the departure of Jeremy Clarkson.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Beretta/Sims/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435246256781/fbce44db-3ad0-43d5-8f69-c55b8fab92bb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The old guard: (left to right) Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May in Top Gear earlier this year.

With a title like <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2014/oct/21/dear-white-people-a-black-satire-whose-sark-is-worse-than-its-bite\">Dear White People</a>, you would expect Simien’s movie to be confrontational and racially charged, which it is, but it navigates its way through the contemporary minefield of not just racial but also gender, generational and power inequalities with honed wit and audacious humour. Simien’s script is jam-packed with whip-smart dialogue, pop-culture references and penetrating one-liners - “People who say ‘African-American’ are only too scared to say ‘black’ because they actually want to say ‘nigger’” - all culminating in a <a href=\"http://www.thegloss.com/2014/10/17/culture/dear-white-people-review-racist-college-parties-blackface-mexican-stereotypes/\">frat-house “blackface” party</a> that would be absurd it it wasn’t ripped from the actual headlines. It never occurred to him to make Dear White People as a serious drama, Simien says. “If you examine any aspect of the human condition long enough, you really do have to start laughing at it. Because the business of being human is kind of ridiculous.”</p> \n<p>There’s rarely been a better time for a movie tackling US race issues, what with the steady stream of outrages against African-Americans in recent years: the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/us-news/trayvon-martin\">shooting of Trayvon Martin</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest\">civil unrest in Ferguson</a>, Missouri, the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/us-news/eric-garner\">police killing of Eric Garner</a>, the<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/apr/12/walter-scott-shooting-officer-michael-slager-audio-recording\"> police shooting of the unarmed Walter Scott</a>, the Texas policeman pulling his gun on a teenage black girl. The <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/us-news/charleston-shooting\">racist church shootings in Charleston</a>, South Carolina happen the day after I speak to Simien over the phone. For now, the news cycle is dominated by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/12/civil-rights-activist-rachel-dolezal-misrepresented-herself-as-black-claim-parents\">Rachel Dolezal’s outing as a “culturally black” person</a> who is actually not black at all, and Simien gets round to that pretty quickly. “If what she’s saying is to be believed, racial identity is something that everyone should have the right to pick and choose, but the rub is, most black people don’t really have a choice in that matter.” He’s more intrigued than offended by the Dolezal case, he says. “One of the reasons she makes us so uncomfortable is because she’s forcing everyone to examine what they even mean by being black. If this woman can call herself black and get away with it for so long, what does it mean for all of <em>us</em>?”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwJhmqLU0so\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XwJhmqLU0so?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch the trailer for Dear White People.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s the same question Simien’s movie asks. Black people certainly don’t get a free pass in Dear White People. Its four central characters are African-American students at an Ivy League college, all of whom have trouble fitting into their supposed category. The lead character Sam, for example, creator of the vlog that gives Dear White People its name, is a mixed-race student who embraces black history and politics with almost militant zeal, all the while keeping quiet about her white boyfriend – “Your favourite director is Bergman but you tell people it’s Spike Lee,” he chides her.</p> \n<p>Then there’s the clean-cut dean’s son, who smokes weed and cosies up to the entitled white elite; and the hair-straightening, coloured contact lens-wearing Coco, who only turns on her blackness when there’s a chance of getting leverage from it. Meanwhile Lionel, the gay outsider, doesn’t feel black enough for the black students or white enough for the white ones (he also likes Mumford &amp; Sons, to cloud the issue further). Rather than boiling down racial politics to a set of simplistic platitudes, Simien thrives in pointing out the complexities and ironies, but he does so with commendable fairness. “I’m sort of like Lionel in the film,” he says. “I have a hard time choosing a side. So as I sit with a work for a long period of time, I can’t help but counter-argue my own points. One of the most powerful lessons I learned is when you make an argument in a film, you have to make sure both characters are right.”<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3cc07507ba7afb0d8cb4a55a7295135be0005d29\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435241248973/659a70be-286e-401d-b674-83cbafea1589-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Dear White People movie poster.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dear White People movie poster.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Lionsgate/Allstar/Lionsgate</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dear White People has been a critical success – it won prizes at Sundance and the Independent Spirit Awards – if a modest commercial one (just under $4.5m and counting). Simien has even published a spin-off <a href=\"http://books.simonandschuster.com/Dear-White-People/Justin-Simien/9781476798097\">Dear White People book</a>: a field guide to the current racial landscape (sample chapter headings: We Don’t Know Why Kanye West Did That, Please Stop Touching My Hair, Please Stop Insisting That You’re “Practically Black”). “Maybe I should change that to ‘culturally black’,” Simien laughs, coming back to Dolezal. “For a long time we could pretend that black identity was very simple. But in this particular day and age, racism is hard to spot in some instances because it’s so baked into the DNA of various institutions. So when you start talking about things like ‘the black experience’, it is harder to define. There is no monolithic black culture. It’s completely different for someone born in Harlem to someone born in Houston, or London, with one exception, which is that people contributing to black culture have the experience of being black.”</p> \n<p>Inevitably, attempts have been made to pigeonhole Simien himself. What with the film’s subject and tone, and Simien’s skin colour, Spike Lee comparisons were quick to arise – even if Dear White People is closer to John Singleton’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4KVCVX1MrQ\">Higher Learning</a> than Lee’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kTOohbg4eE\">School Daze</a>, and Simien is just as likely to cite Stanley Kubrick, Robert Altman and Woody Allen as influences. Then again, labels have their uses, he acknowledges, instinctively counter-arguing his own point. As always in Simien’s world, it’s complex. “Yes I’m black, yes I’m a man, yes I’m gay, but really, truly I’m more than all of those things. But at same time, to function in the world, I do need these identities.”</p> \n<p>Simien’s own experience was not dissimilar to that of Lionel. As a teenager growing up in Houston, Texas, he remembers concealing not just his sexuality but also his love of Nine Inch Nails, Green Day and Alanis Morissette. “At 14 years old, that is just a recipe for being a total outcast for a black kid in the south.” His father died when he was six years old. His mother was an educator and an academic, who put a lot of store by schooling, and was thus concerned when Simien struck out in an arts direction. He describes performing arts high school as “probably the most formative time of my life, outside of the past year”. Unsurprisingly, he started thinking about Dear White People while he was at college: California’s Chapman University. This was in 2005, just as Barack Obama’s presidential term was about to begin, but things only got finally moving in 2012, when Simien cut a home-made trailer and <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/dear-white-people#/story\">raised $40,000 through crowd-funding</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>When 96% of backers won’t take a look because it has black characters. That is the definition of institutional racism</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite></cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Dear White People’s long gestation at least explains why those one-liners are so honed. But it also points to a continuing resistance on the part of the industry. As Simien’s characters complain in the movie, the only African-American-related films that generate mainstream interest seem to be ones of suffering and hardship, from 12 Years a Slave and Selma to Fruitvale Station and Precious: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t4LwTFDc7c\">“Black people dying in the past or black people dying in the present.”</a> Stories about white people saving African-Americans from their suffering and hardship also go down well (The Help, The Blind Side, Lincoln). Simien has experienced that resistance first-hand, trying to get backing for Dear White People: “When you walk into a room to talk about financing, you find 96% of them won’t even take a look at the project because it has black characters and a black cast and they ‘don’t think they’ll be able to sell it internationally’. That is the definition of institutional racism.”<br /></p> \n<p>His problem was doubtless compounded, in those early days of the Obama administration, by the prevailing, ultimately misguided sentiment that America was entering a “post-racial” era. “I really felt like I was crying wolf,” he says. Now, as Obama’s second term draws to a close, Simien jokingly refers to our present time as “the post-post-racial era”. Not that nothing has changed. “I think that a lot of stuff that was underneath the surface has bubbled up, and I’m proud to say I think my film was part of this. At least we are talking about these so-called micro-aggressions, and talking about how in certain parts of the country being black can get you killed.” Things could also be changing in the movie world. The recent announcement that Selma director <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/13/ava-duvernay-marvel-direct-black-panther-selma\">Ava DuVernay is in line to direct Marvel’s Black Panther movie</a> (as in the superhero character, not the black-power movement) can only be encouraging. Simien will be directing Captain America’s buddy, Anthony Mackie, in a comedy titled <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2014/12/anthony-mackie-captain-america-justin-simien-dear-white-people-make-a-wish-paramount-1201329503/\">Make a Wish</a> (which he did not write), and has another “big announcement” coming up soon, he says. He was also involved in DuVernay’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/28/ava-duvernay-rebel-a-thon-black-film-makers-symposium\">social-media symposium of black film-makers last month</a>, which united talents as diverse as John Singleton, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haile_Gerima\">Haile Gerima</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/may/18/amma-asante-belle-bicultural-ghanaian-british-director-grange-hill\">Amma Asante</a> and Tyler Perry.</p> \n<p>Post-Dear White People, with the post-post-racial era tragically becoming ever more apparent, Simien now finds himself in another pigeonhole: as an unofficial spokesperson for black America. “A professional black person!” he laughs. Somewhat predictably, he has mixed feelings about it: “I don’t like being put in a box. People expect me to have certain opinions about things and I don’t necessarily always have them. Sometimes it’s awkward, because people want you to be the voice of reason, or sometimes you’re not as mad as everybody else is. But it’s cool that people care about what I think.”</p> \n<p><em>Dear White People is released in the UK on 10 July</em></p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435241082353/96282f1f-0a82-4253-ae2d-81b37afc3890-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Courtesy/Rex Shutterstock/Courtesy/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Teyonah Parris, Nia Jervier and Brandon P Bell in Dear White People","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Courtesy/Rex Shutterstock/Courtesy/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435241248336/659a70be-286e-401d-b674-83cbafea1589-680x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":680,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Dear White People movie poster.

<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/08/tom-bradby-news-at-ten-itv-news\">Tom Bradby</a> stepping down as<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2014/jul/03/itv-tom-bradby-anchor-general-election\"> political editor </a>to become the main presenter of News at Ten.</p> \n<p>The bulletin is returning to its 1990s format with a single anchor, which for most of the year will be Bradby. </p> \n<p>The rest of the time it will be fronted by current co-anchor <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2012/may/13/julie-etchingham-news-at-ten-interview\">Julie Etchingham</a> and, occasionally, international affairs editor Rageh Omaar, who currently presents some weekend bulletins. </p> \n<p>It means that after eight years at the helm of the flagship bulletin, Mark Austin will move to co-anchor the early evening news with Mary Nightingale. </p> \n<p>Austin has fronted the 6.30pm bulletin before, when Sir Trevor McDonald returned to News at Ten for its relaunch in 2008. </p> \n<p>Some within ITN have expressed their surprise at the move given that Austin has twice won the Royal Television Society presenter of the year award. Although the 6.30pm gets substantially more viewers than News at Ten it is still viewed as a prestigious position and earlier this year it won the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/feb/18/bbc-rts-award-cliff-richard-raid-home-fails-win\">RTS Daily News Programme of the Year. </a></p> \n<p>However ITV is understood to be keen to make Bradby one of the key faces of its channel. He has established the well-regarded political show The Agenda and also wrote drama The Great Fire, which drew almost 5 million viewers to ITV. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/08/tom-bradby-news-at-ten-itv-news\">Tom Bradby tipped to front News at Ten in ITV shakeup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He is close to the royal family, having been royal correspondent and hit the headlines globally with his exclusive interview with Prince William and Kate Middleton on their engagement. He has also been Ireland correspondent, Asia correspondent and UK editor.</p> \n<p>Bradby said: “News at Ten is one of the best known and loved news brands in the country and I have hugely enjoyed working for it in 25 years on the road with ITV News. The chance to help lead it into a new era is a unique and incredibly exciting challenge – and, given the programme’s heritage, a great honour, too.”</p> \n<p>As part of the changes, Etchingham – who was acclaimed for her part in the ITV general election debate – will also front more of ITV’s current affairs shows Exposure and continue to present Tonight. </p> \n<p>ITV stalwart Alastair Stewart, who fronted ITV’s general election night coverage until Bradby took over this year, will regularly anchor both the ITV News at 1.30 and 6.30pm.</p> \n<p>Austin commented: “After eight really enjoyable years on News at Ten I leave the show in great shape, as current RTS Daily News Programme of Year, and in good hands. I look forward to joining the evening news programme. It’s an exciting challenge and also means a bit more sleep.”</p> \n<p>Etchingham said: “Following an exciting few months covering every twist and turn of Election 2015, I’m delighted to continue presenting and reporting for ITV News at Ten in this fascinating new political landscape we find ourselves in. From covering the biggest stories affecting our viewers to exclusive investigative journalism, I’m looking forward to dedicating more time to ITV’s award-winning current affairs programming, across special national events,<em> </em>Tonight and Exposure.”</p> \n<p>The changes are due to take place in the autumn.</p> \n<p>ITV director of news and current affairs Michael Jermey said: “ITV News is fortunate to have an exceptionally talented line-up of experienced and knowledgeable newscasters. They bring vast reporting and presenting experience to our programmes and their journalism enhances all our news output. I’m delighted Tom is joining our very strong and well established presenting line-up. His expert knowledge of British politics and international affairs will be very valuable as we develop News at Ten.”</p> \n<p>ITV News editor Geoff Hill added: “I’m thrilled with the new line-up. It builds on our success and signals the start of an exciting chapter for ITV News. We’re blessed with an incredibly talented group of presenters who will add tremendous value to our award-winning journalism.”</p> \n<p>However some within the ITV News newsroom have questioned the moves.</p> \n<p>It is understood that after the changes were announced by management, veteran reporter Paul Davies asked for an explanation as to why, with their respected track records, Austin and Etchingham were being reshuffled, given that News at Ten is RTS programme of the year.</p> \n<p>Hill responded by saying that the right time to introduce innovation and change is when a programme is ahead and that ITV News could not stand still in a changing news market, given that the channel has had the same format for almost a decade.</p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435236354644/Tom-Bradby--010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Yui

pressure</p>","byline":"Associated Press in Miami","body":"<p>Two prize-winning, US-based authors with roots in a divided Caribbean island have called for protests against the deportations of migrants from the Dominican Republic.</p> \n<p>Dominican-American writer Junot D&iacute;az and Haitian-American writer Edwidge Danticat rallied Wednesday night with about 150 activists and community members in Miami, calling for political pressure, travel boycotts and consumer choices over items such as sugar to strip power from the governments and corporations benefiting from a policy that they say targets black migrants.</p> \n<p>“Starting in the community where we live – how we are spending our money to make these choices, from your sugar to your vacation – to think about what’s being done in your name, what you’re subsidizing. What your presence means – and what your absence means,” said Danticat, whose memoir Brother, I’m Dying, about her elderly uncle’s fatal attempt to immigrant from Haiti to the US, was a National Book Award finalist.</p> \n<p>Haiti and the Dominican Republic share the island of Hispaniola, but the countries have long had an uneasy relationship, particularly over migrant workers. An estimated 460,000 Haitian migrants live in the Dominican Republic, but Dominican officials have said just 10,000 have provided the documents required by an immigration registration program aimed at regulating the flow of migrants across its border.</p> \n<p>The Dominican government <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/16/dominican-republic-haiti-deportation-residency-permits\">says it will deport non-citizens</a> who didn’t submit applications to establish legal residency before a 17 June deadline.</p> \n<p>Advocates for the migrants say the program is discriminatory, and both Haitian and Dominican communities have led protests in Miami and New York since last week.</p> \n<p>D&iacute;az, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his novel The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, said he found the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo in “a state of terror” last week just as the deadline passed, with the government’s critics receiving death threats and taking their families into hiding.</p> \n<p>Danticat said she was worried about images of women and young children who had nowhere to go after being deported to Haiti.</p> \n<p>D&iacute;az and Danticat linked the deportations to violence against blacks in the US, including the mass shooting of nine people last week at a South Carolina church, as well as migrant surges at Mexico’s border with the US, across the Mediterranean into Europe, and in Asia.</p> \n<aside class=\"element

reflects its racist history | Jason Nichols</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At blame, D&iacute;az said, is indifference to racial and political tensions that exploit migrant workers and their countries’ resources while stripping humanity from people “who are attempting to save themselves from the ruin inflicted by other people”.</p> \n<p>But the Dominican government is vulnerable to political pressure from travel boycotts and protests wherever Dominican officials make trade trips, D&iacute;az said.</p> \n<p>“I’ve been working on targeting all the intellectual authors of this, not only identifying them but also boycotting and finding that way to interrupt their access to their easy privilege here in the United States,” D&iacute;az told the Associated Press. “There’s a lot of us who are putting a lot of money in these corrupt human beings’ pockets, and questions have to be raised at a personal level and at an organizational level.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/1693899fc0db3fa0737b5bc7f77fc9efeacf41d0/0_0_4716_2830/4716.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2830,"width":4716,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"J

The clip, entitled Kramer, kick-started what would soon become an obsession. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2012/oct/02/michael-richards-daniel-radcliffe-jon-hamm\">Michael Richards’s infamous racist rant</a> at the same venue had made headlines a few years earlier and now Chappelle – back from his highly publicised self-exile – was hypothesising on what the event taught him about himself (“I’m 20% black, 80% comedian”) and how lucky the people in the crowd were to witness the outburst in person (“You don’t go to the tiger show to see someone be safe with tigers”). </p> \n<p>The whole thing seemed so natural and improvised, so raw and apposite. Completely effortless and in the moment. As I watched more of his work, I realised it all feels like that. Even his <a href=\"http://www.cc.com/shows/chappelle-s-show\">Comedy Central series Chappelle’s Show</a> doesn’t make you feel like you’re watching a man in a TV studio. He’s just in his living room telling a few jokes to his friends. And I’m not at home watching it on Netflix years later – I’m in the room, invited to the party, laughing both with and at my funniest mate. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kth0UOU5a_M\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kth0UOU5a_M?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Warning: strong language\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>His characterisation in the show is next level, whether it’s the blind, black, white-supremacist Clayton Bigsby or – in probably the show’s most famous sketch – the hysterically obnoxious <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHZL7RdQsaw\">Rick James</a>, he occupies this space of complete comedy. Every line he says is hilarious. It’s impossible for him to play the straight man, he’s too funny. </p> \n<p>This is arguably even more evident on stage. He inhabits the roles of the characters in his stories so perfectly he can sell difficult points with what, when you’re watching it, feels like proof. So little as a “hmmmm” in the right accent or his trademark white-man voice to hammer home an argument, followed by a wide-eyed knowing glance back to the audience. It’s perfect and considered, but performed so nonchalantly it feels as though he’s saying it for the first time. He uses pacing better than anyone, slowing down in set-ups to convince you he’s turning serious and then speeding up to rapidly fire off three or four killer lines that reveal the entire thing was a rouse.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I’m in the room, invited to the party, laughing both with and at my funniest mate</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I recently butchered his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoOLSOrrVFE\">Michael Jackson routine</a> in my retelling of it when I was asked what the funniest joke I’d ever heard was. The routine is so funny and original it wouldn’t seem dated if you saw it performed for the first time now, 11 years later.</p> \n<p>His standout routine, though, involves him repeatedly asking: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ZxdSXTLx8\">How old is 15 really?</a>” In a five-minute bit he tackles politics, racism, celebrity and hypocrisy while maintaining the same level of audience laughter as before. He’s somehow able to be stern and sincere to make an important point ring true, but without losing any of his natural silliness in his telling of it. It’s a faultless routine in an impeccable special from a comedian who has only ever done things on his own terms, and is all the better for it.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Dave Chappelle is at the <a href=\"http://www.eventimapollo.com/events/detail/dave-chappelle\">Hammersmith Apollo</a>, London, 8-13 July.
