I started really enjoying it at school, and had fun solving problems at home. One of the most clearly recognisable events in my memory that I can quote as a “spark” of my interest in science was a book I read when I was 16, written by Albert Einstein and Leopold Infeld, The Evolution of Physics. I remember reading the last page, and then sitting there with the book in my hands and having this sort of epiphany. I suddenly knew my future was going to be in science.</p> \n<p><em>What’s your favourite piece of mathematics and why?</em></p> \n<p>The Navier-Stokes equations, because together with conservation of mass and energy they are the governing equations of fluid mechanics. They represent the ultimate ability of the modelling of a natural system through mathematics, and they don’t (yet) have a known closed analytical solution.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c07487892437fac2e46ece988bbc45f2b8676ea\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433864233753/17dfa106-70eb-4ffa-8d57-654b1e29e9d2-370x420.jpeg\" alt=\"boselli\" width=\"370\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Possibly the only model who can explain the trajectory of a baseball.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pani Paul/Models 1</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>When and why did you choose engineering over maths?</em></p> \n<p>I always loved maths for its purity, and physics for its beauty. But I soon realised how innovation in these fields now pushes into metaphysics and it has become something that will be discussed in philosophy books in the future, when all theories will have been confuted. I am very creative and too much “hands on” for this sort of endeavour, and I realised this very soon too. Engineering seemed like the perfect choice for me, since it allowed me to use the maths and physics I loved, to create things that “work in real life”.</p> \n<p>I love engineering, everything manmade that surrounds us required so much thought and knowledge, and studying engineering really made me see things around me in a different light. Also my way of tackling everyday problems and finding solutions has been affected.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456453838__\n</div> \n<p><em>What was the subject of your PhD?</em></p> \n<p>I specialise in computational fluid dynamics, and more specifically as applied to the design of turbo machinery. My PhD research consisted of the modelling of wet steam flow in large turbines, and the invention of new algorithms to automatically modify turbine blades during the simulation of the fluid flow.</p> \n<p><em>How do you make students interested in maths and science?</em></p> \n<p>It’s a relatively easy task, given that I was teaching in an engineering course, most people were already interested in science.

A system that had been largely centralised was devolved to municipalities, teacher training was changed, exams and grades changed, and a voucher system was introduced giving parents the power to choose which school to send their child to. Each child was funded by the state, and if the child chose to go do a different school, the money would follow.</p> \n<p>Since then, almost 800 publicly funded private schools – or free schools – have been set up across Sweden, many of them by companies who are allowed to make a profit. In England, the education secretary, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/forprofit-schools-have-no-place-in-britain-says-tory-education-secretary-nicky-morgan-10257148.html\">Nicky Morgan</a>, has ruled out allowing free schools to be run for profit. This is one of key concerns in the current education debate in Sweden. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/swedish_schools_confidence/giv-21277Eh4dD0jEEpCM/\" data-alt=\"Swedish schools graph\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/swedish_schools_confidence/giv-21277Eh4dD0jEEpCM/\">Swedish schools graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Critics on the left in Sweden blame the voucher system for declining results, saying it has opened the door for schools more interested in making a profit than providing education. Conservatives who support free choice say students have been given too much influence in the classroom, undermining the authority of teachers.</p> \n<p>Fridolin’s line is that it was not one single change that caused the problems, but a combination that helped create a “fragmentary school system” which lacked steering and sowed the seeds for growing inequality.<br /></p> \n<p>“The school system is not a market where everyone has the same possibilities and the same information. It becomes that some parents, the educated parents with strong resources, use the possibility to choose schools.”</p> \n<p>His government’s aim, he says, is to make sure that public money spent in schools stays in schools. But it will not be easy. “It’s a genie-in-the-bottle situation. How do we change a system that has gone on so long in allowing quite big profit in schools?”</p> \n<p>Fridolin has a fight on his hands. On the opposing side is Barbara Bergstr&ouml;m, founder and chair of Internationella Engelska Skolan (IES), one of the largest providers of free schools in Sweden. IES currently educates 20,000 pupils in 30 schools across Sweden. Its success is such that a further 94,000 children are on its waiting lists, some as young as three weeks have their names down for a place.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7dfc45b9c22b9d3b0f48389ed3d9cc06e4939275\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433936966217/48944cd1-6422-42ca-86b1-710189d95c9a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Barbara Bergstr&ouml;m\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbara Bergstr&ouml;m, founder and chair of Internationella Engelska Skolan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arni Torfason/Demotix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We meet in the polished corridors of the first IES school to open, in Enskede, a suburb of Stockholm. It’s almost the end of term and many of the children are going to visit museums around the city. The school is orderly, the pupils courteous – the regime is stricter than in many of Sweden’s state schools – and results are strong, exceeding those of neighbouring municipal schools.</p> \n<p>“This is more organised than my last school,” says one 12-year-old girl. “It was all relaxing on the table there.”</p> \n<p>“In my last school they were really messy,” says her friend. “They didn’t really listen to the teachers. Here it’s more respectful.”</p> \n<p>When Gove visited this school he liked what he saw, and when Bergstr&ouml;m met him in London later he asked her: “How many schools are you going to open in the UK? A hundred, 200?”</p> \n<p>In fact IES has opened just one, IES Breckland, in Brandon, Suffolk, which was placed in special measures by Ofsted but is now making “reasonable progress”. Bergstr&ouml;m, a former science teacher from Buffalo, New York, says there will be no more schools in England for the time being.</p> \n<p>She has had meetings with Fridolin. “There’s an awful lot of rhetoric about for-profit companies. If we were not for profit we would not be where were we are today. There’s no way we would be able to do what we are doing in our schools without the security of a solid financial base.”</p> \n<p>Ulla Hamilton, chief executive of the Swedish Association for Independent Schools, agrees. “The market is working,” she says. The theory is that competition forces flagging schools to up their game. </p> \n<p>She says the decline in Sweden’s schools has nothing to do with the introduction of free choice or the emergence of independent schools. Hamilton quotes research by the IFAU, the Swedish Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy, which suggests that results had started to drop even before the changes. “The free schools are not the cause,” she says.</p> \n<p>But as the postmortem continues into what has gone wrong in Sweden’s education system, the free school movement is faltering. Because of the uncertainty about the future, fewer companies are coming forward to open new schools, banks are afraid to provide loans, and the numbers being approved to set up schools is going down. Meanwhile, waiting lists for places in many of Sweden’s independent schools are going up.</p> \n<p>Like Bergstr&ouml;m, Hamilton is in favour of profit. “You need to be able to make a margin otherwise people will not be interested in setting up,” she says. She adds that the payback for shareholders is tiny compared with public preconceptions.</p> \n<p>There are no profits at Frejaskolan, a state school in Gnesta, just south of Stockholm. There’s a happy, informal atmosphere (uniforms are unheard of in Sweden, in any school) but in the last two years a small number of parents have chosen to take their children out and put them in an independent school 25 miles away.</p> \n<p>“The parents know about the school,” says one of the teachers. “It stands up quite well. There’s good marketing. When they go, we lose the money we get from the state. I’m a parent myself and I’m a little bit worried. </p> \n<p>“My youngest is 10 years old. Will she have teachers who are really qualified? We don’t really know how it will be.”</p> \n<p>The Guardian asked Andreas Schleicher, the OECD’s director for education and skills, what lessons the UK might learn from the Swedish experience. He said: “When establishing school autonomy and choice, the Swedish system did not strengthen oversight and intervention functions (which were traditionally weak in Sweden). So the system had no means to learn from successful schools and scale their success, and it had no means to detect and address educational underperformance.</p> \n<p>“I think the UK needs to watch out for that as well, unless it is willing and able to upscale Ofsted by dimensions. Successful school systems are more than a collection of independent schools.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433943031056/2e61ef3e-b976-4b8f-b334-5e662f9132c6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Arni Torfason/Demotix","altText":"Students at the Swedish free school.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Arni Torfason/Demotix"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433936474512/d0d12650-6288-451b-bde2-f70790f11ae6-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Gustav Fridolin (front left) with his prime minister, Stefan Lofven, and cabinet colleagues in October 2014.

Some fiction and memoir reached us in translation, including the work of Dubravka Ugrešić, Slavenka Drakulić and Semezdin Mehmedinović, but not enough. Now a&nbsp;generation of novelists has appeared: the last children of Yugoslavia, still close yet removed enough from the heat of collective trauma to create fresh narratives. Joining the stunning fictions of Olja Savičević, Selvedin Avdić and T&eacute;a Obreht comes a debut novel by the young American-Croatian Sara Nović. I read it in one night.</p> \n<p>“The war in Zagreb began over a&nbsp;pack of cigarettes,” the 10-year-old narrator tells us. In the first of the novel’s four parts, tomboy Ana describes what made her world precious (parents and baby sister, her best friend Luka), and how that world collapsed in just a few months. Disintegration begins with a cancelled holiday because of road blockades; then the newsagent’s dark question about cigarettes, “Serbian or Croatian?”; the missing kid at school; the first refugees from out of town, and the appalling whispered details (one man’s wife was taken by a paramilitary with a necklace of human ears). Nović follows the lurch into total nightmare all the way to the event that terminates the first section, and Ana’s childhood. This is tough territory for any novelist, and it takes guts to go there. This key scene is written with chilling restraint: in the unspeakable moment, that crisp voice is devastating.</p> \n<p>The young perspective is the novel’s principal charm, but the tone is disrupted with too many overstretched exchanges anxious to tell us things we already know. This may be a problem of balancing the emotional pitch between the solemn adult and the fresh child-narrator. But when it works, it’s terrific: “As a side effect of modern warfare, we had the peculiar privilege of watching the destruction of our country on television.” In a&nbsp;childish war game, “Those who died&nbsp;with their limbs bent in unnatural angles and could hold their positions the longest were the winners.” At her best Nović is a poet: “Summer gave way to fall in the abrupt, unbeautiful way Zagreb always changed its seasons”; and later, at university in the&nbsp;US, Ana’s sympathetic professor “seemed to know I was not at home in the world”. I longed for more of these perceptive asides, a sensitivity to language that is particularly striking if you read Nović’s fascinating reflections on <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/23/what-its-like-to-be-a-deaf-novelist\" title=\"\">what it’s like to be a deaf author</a>.</p> \n<p>In the next section of the book, “Somnambulist”, Ana is suddenly 20,&nbsp;living in the United States with adoptive parents and a false persona that begins to crack. In many ways the rest of the novel is a variation on the traditional emigrant narrative of fragmented selves, but with the added baggage of trauma. Ana’s discussions with her professor about WG Sebald reference this explicitly, though the novel doesn’t need the literary sign-posting. The American scenes are tart with tragicomedy, and Ana’s drive for psychic resolution is compelling. There are memorable set pieces involving an&nbsp;intellectual college boyfriend, criminally well-meaning UN workers, the pitfalls of language (“I&nbsp;didn’t know what soccer was, but was pleasantly surprised to find out it was football”) and the impossibility “to contain Gardenville and Croatia in the same thought”. Nović sustains the non-linear structure, and while some of the American territory is a little familiar (reminiscent of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2000/apr/16/fiction.reviews\" title=\"\">Aleksandar Hemon’s <em>The Question of Bruno</em></a>, which is no bad thing), that’s part of Ana’s sorrowful insight – once you lose what you love, the rest of the world feels a bit empty. But there is more for her to discover on&nbsp;her return to Croatia, including old friends and new facts about Chetniks and Ustaše in&nbsp;the Serbo-Croatian conflict. The attempt to extract meaning from the conflict doesn’t go&nbsp;further than this, but perhaps it doesn’t&nbsp;need to – this is Ana’s story, and she is a&nbsp;satisfyingly complex character of such resilience and heart that I couldn’t sleep until I&nbsp;had followed her to the end.</p> \n<p>Nović excels at distilling visual poetry from action scenes, and there is one section in the middle that steals the show, when the shellshocked young Ana drifts into a twilight community and becomes an accidental combatant. “Suspended between living and dead”, Ana has become mute, except for the mantra: “Forward grip, gas chamber, cleaning rod, bolt, frame, magazine, function check.” Nović has breathed fire and ice into these pages. Immersing herself in the darkest materials, she has given us the real stuff dystopian fantasies are made of.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> To order <em>Girl at War</em> for &pound;11.99 (RRP &pound;14.99) go to <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/285593/s/girl-at-war/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Even those who work in the food industry stumble over some terms. River Cottage chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall reassures me. “I say ‘ex-presso’,” he says. “I get most of these words wrong. I don’t mind,” he tells me, stoutly. “When quinoa first cropped up 10 years ago, I assumed it was ‘kwin-oa’. Other people can call it ‘keen-wa’ – good luck to them – but I won’t be joining in.” There is one example that makes him furious. “There is a guy I know in the food business who likes the finer things in life,” he tells me. “He calls truffles ‘troofles’. In France, a truffle is a ‘truffe’, but that doesn’t mean in English you pronounce them ‘troofles’. I blame myself that I have never confronted him – but I don’t trust myself.

That’s fantastic.” But he does have a pet hate – when people say ‘bruschetta’ with a soft ‘shh’ (which I think a fairly easy mistake to make).“That is the one that kills me,” he complains, as I make a mental note never to do this again. “‘Sch’ in Italian is pronounced ‘sk’, so it should be ‘broo-sket-ta’,” he continues. “If I was with a friend, I would correct them, because I would always want people to correct my English.”</p> \n<p>The problem is, even if your pronunciation is perfect, that doesn’t mean you will escape being chastised, as <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/marina-oloughlin\">Guardian restaurant critic Marina O’Loughlin</a> points out. “An actual conversation with a waiter I had recently went like this: Me: ‘I’ll have the broosketta.’ Waiter: ‘One brooshetta, then.’ Me: ‘Yes, the broosketta’. Waiter, kindly, pityingly: ‘Brooshetta it is.’”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/felicity-cloake\">Food writer Felicity Cloake</a> has suffered similarly. “It’s not often that I’m lucky enough to be offered Mo&euml;t &amp; Chandon,” she says. “But since learning that the correct way to pronounce it is with a hard ‘t’ (mo-wett), I tend to avoid saying the name at all, because people often gently repeat it back to me as ‘mo-way’, as if I’m some unsophisticated hick who needs saving from myself.” It’s a middle-class dilemma that has her stumped, she says. “Where do you go from there – copy them to spare their blushes, or carry on regardless?”</p> \n<p>Guardian columnist <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/zoewilliams\">Zoe Williams</a>, who writes restaurant reviews, has the opposite problem. “I remember when I realised ‘scallop’ was pronounced ‘scollop’ – it gave me a real anxiety. When you know one thing is wrong and one is right, you will never get them the right way round. Then I hated myself for caring, because it’s obviously just a posh thing.”</p> \n<p>But she says there is something about the way the English approach foreign languages that escalates the awkwardness. “It’s that unique English pretence of not being pretentious: people who pronounce ‘<a href=\"http://www.lafromagerie.co.uk/ami-du-chambertin/\">Ami du Chambertin</a>’ in perfect French accents are considered despicable, and people who pronounce it wrong are even worse, so you just say ‘that cheese’.” The whole thing is so exhausting that she suggests – only half-jokingly – that we should just return to ordering things by numbers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff6fde6e7a381f36699af0ebef50265c6edbb8a0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433939026738/ece25337-fa87-4407-896d-cca2a4b4a6ca-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake suffers the middle-class dilemma of ‘mo-wett’ v ‘mo-way’\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake suffers the middle-class dilemma of ‘mo-wett’ v ‘mo-way’.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Luckily, when you are the one who runs the restaurant, you can make sure the menu only has easy-to-say words on it – which is an approach championed by <a href=\"https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/contacts_and_people/fergus/\">Fergus Henderson, the founder of St John restaurant</a>. He is happy to confess that there are words he stumbles on. “‘Physalis’ I struggle with – I can barely remember the name, let alone pronounce it,” he tells me. “Mind you, it’s one of those ingredients that turns up on plates where it’s not needed, so it can be safely ignored.” So, what should you do if you are faced with an unpronounceable word? Henderson insists it’s best to “just steam in”, but that, if you think you could really offend someone with your pronunciation, there are ways around it.</p> \n<p>“I find that the best course of action is to mumble. If you go to China, for instance, and there is an egg-fried rice that looks like it is called ‘fuck you’, just mumble.”</p> \n<p>And if this sounds like an unlikely situation, it’s one that <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jayrayner\">food writer Jay Rayner</a> can relate to. “In a restaurant on holiday, in Normandy, I ordered tripe in the local ‘Caen’ style, using my best terrible French,” he says.</p> \n<p>“The waitress sniggered. A French friend leaned across the table and said: ‘You just asked for your tripe to be cooked in the style of a chronic masturbator.’</p> \n<p>“I’m still not quite sure what I mispronounced.”</p> \n<h2>Menu unmentionables<br /></h2> \n<p><strong>Chipotle</strong><br /></p> \n<p>When the Mexican fast-food chain came to the UK, it helped the British out with an advertising campaign teaching the correct pronunciation of its name, derived from the Nahuatl for a smoked and dried jalape&ntilde;o chili pepper. Which you say as “chee-poat-lay”.</p> \n<p><strong>Pho</strong><br />There’s still much debate over the correct pronunciation of this fragrant noodle dish, which originated in Hanoi. Some say the recipe came about under French colonial rule, therefore the name should be pronounced with a long “o”, but the consensus is “fuh”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"213105fcaa588f4710d19b179f06de9ade06ca4d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433940240455/16654580-97e7-4040-8839-c02e6a4310ee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pho, a fragrant noodle dish, which originated in Hanoi.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pho, a fragrant noodle dish, which originated in Hanoi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Edamame</strong><br />When these immature soya beans crossed over from east-Asian cuisine to stud salads in your local M&amp;S, it led to a spate of mispronunciations. “Ed-a-mah-meh” is correct.</p> \n<p><strong>Sriracha</strong><br />The hottest sauce to hit your table in the past few years, this fruity number now graces supermarket aisles and burger chains alike, but people are still saying it wrong. “See-ratch-a”’ is what you want.

A sequel to the original Goldilocks story, Leigh Hodgkinson’s book imagines Baby Bear when he’s grown up and gets lost in the city. Luckily for him he finds a nice cosy flat to rest in.

Not Very Little Red Riding hood, who insists on calling him “Foxie” and invites him back to her grandma’s house for a “cuppa tea”. What’s <em>really</em> scaring her is being away from her mummy for the night. A gorgeous take on the original, which perfectly captures the voice and fears of young toddlers and contains a delightful twist at the end.</p> \n<p><strong>5. <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/princess-and-the-peas.html\">The Princess and the Peas</a> by Caryl Hart and Sarah Warburton</strong></p> \n<p>When Lily-Rose May refuses to eat her peas and lets the world know about it VERY loudly, her dad decides that enough is enough. Declaring her to be suffering from a horrible case of princess-itus, he sends her packing to the royal palace to see if having to live the life of a <em>real</em> princess might cure her. A lovely rhyming story that pays humorous homage to the original Princess and the Pea tale.</p> \n<p><strong>6. <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/shhh.html\">Shhh!</a> by Sally Grindley and Peter Utton</strong></p> \n<p>So brilliantly interactive, it’s easy to forget that this book has been around for years.

Finding the giant to be old and rather lonely, Jim helps him to feel his old self again.

Most nights a well known park near the City Theatre and the university of Tehran becomes a vibrant cruising ground for gay men. They come to trawl the park, to look, to show off, exchanging furtive glances in the dark, occasionally meeting for a few minutes in the public facilities or heading to some third location for more comprehensive interaction.</p> \n<p>Gay couples recline in remote corners, arms around each other, stealing kisses. Sometimes I don’t even see them until I’m alerted by their giggles. If you sit on a bench and have a certain look, eventually someone will sit next you and offer a knowing “khaste nabashi” - a common greeting - that depending on your mood and the moonlight can lead anywhere.</p> \n<p>Down Revolution Street, men lean against the shuttered store front of the Institute For The Compilation and Publication of the Works of Imam Khomeini making eyes at passing motorists. Sometimes a car stops, a conversation ensues through a rolled-down window, someone gets in, and off they will go to perform acts punishable by violent flogging.</p> \n<p>Police do patrol the park, going about in packs of three and four, but they seem to show little interest in disrupting proceedings.</p> \n<p>“The police can’t do anything,” said one man I met in the park. He was wearing women’s shoes, heavy make-up, with a jewelled barrette in his hair and a small black leather purse in the crook of his elbow. “You need three people over the age of eighteen to go to court and swear on the Qur’an that they actually saw you having sex.” As he spoke he had his arm around his male friend’s waist.</p> \n<p>“It’s not the police I’m worried about,” said another. “It’s the reaction of the people that’s unpredictable, they’re so homophobic.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2014/mar/14/iran-youth-property-job-market\">Why Iran's youth don't fly the nest</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It’s not the police or the mullahs who are the biggest obstacles to having a successful homosexual relationship in Iran. It’s the utter lack of opportunities for any kind of intimate contact with your significant other. This is a combination of two factors: the first is that most unmarried Iranian men seem to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2014/mar/14/iran-youth-property-job-market\">live with their families</a>, the second is that public spaces are no-go zones for anything above hand-holding. Every relationship I’ve pursued has run into this problem.</p> \n<p>There was M, a 26-year-old branding and advertising consultant who lived with his parents and sister. We used to meet at the movie theatre and make out in the back row, but it was usually too crowded to attempt anything more serious.</p> \n<p>There was P, a 30-year-old waiter who lived with his grandmother. We would get a hotel room sometimes, but he always insisted on going in separately and besides it got to be way too expensive.</p> \n<p>And then there was A, my boyfriend. I met him at a party at a villa in Lahejan, near the Caspian Sea. We were both pretty sloshed on arak cocktails. He was wearing a ‘93 Bulls Michael Jordan T-shirt and green camouflage pants. His hair was dyed red and he had a scar across the whole right side of his head, which I later found out was from a piece of shrapnel when a motorcycle engine exploded.</p> \n<p>From the moment I saw him, I knew in the marrow of my spine. There was just no question about it. The infinite possibilities of the universe collapsed in that moment into a singular inescapable fact: we were going to have sex. I wasn’t sure when or where exactly, but I knew it would happen. I was so certain that I didn’t even feel the need to pursue it. This was a done deal.</p> \n<p>We made heavy eyes at each other the across the room. He came over and we had a forgettable conversation laden with pregnant pauses, lingering eye contact, and lots of incidental touching. When we were finally able to get into a room by ourselves, we didn’t even need to say anything, we just started making out.</p> \n<p>That lasted about a minute. Then we heard the doorknob turning and A ripped himself away from me and pretended to be looking at a pile of papers on the desk as one of our friends walked in. I was left standing not sure what gear to be in. I didn’t know it then but that initial encounter was emblematic of our relationship.</p> \n<p>When we walk in public, he refuses to let me hold his hand or even walk too close to him. Kissing or other public displays of affection are off limits. Occasionally when we spend a long weekend in one of our friends’ houses in Oshun or Lavasan, we manage to abscond to a bedroom with a locked door and yet he is still preoccupied by the notion that “someone might see us”.</p> \n<p>I can’t count how many time I’ve been forced to bail mid-make out and pretend to be sleeping because he has heard footsteps down the hall. Sometimes he’ll do ridiculous things like sit at the opposite end of a long dinner table just for appearances. When he does that, I wink at him from across the table just to watch him get flustered.</p> \n<p>“I’m a bit paranoid, I don’t know why, I know it’s not a big deal,” he tells me. “But I just can’t help it.” A has never even considered telling his father, a working-class house painter and devout Muslim, about his sexual orientation. “It’s not the same here, people don’t understand.”</p> \n<p>Even among our friends - who take absolutely no issue with homosexuality and who have expressed their support - he bristles when I try to be affectionate. When we walk through the Gay park he takes a step away from me. “We can’t touch here,” he says. “This is the gay part of town, everyone will know.”</p> \n<p>Despite these issues, I’ve decided to pursue the relationship, and in every other respect it’s been great. When I met A, being just a stupid <em>khareji</em> (foreigner) I’d mostly been exposed to overpriced caf&eacute;s in Tajrish and the posh high rises of Niavaran.</p> \n<p>A has shown me another side of Tehran. He took me to the south, to the old parts, to Gomrok, Berynak and Doolab. He showed me around his neighbourhood of Darveseh Dolat, down narrow winding alleys, past buildings that haven’t changed in a generation. We went to the local Sufi khanegah (‘institute’), tucked away in dark side street, to see their ecstatic religious dancing.</p> \n<p>He showed me how to light candles in the sagh-e khane, little alcoves built into walls around the city that are usually covered by metal bars and may feature an image of an Imam or famous martyr. I rode around Haft-e Tir and Enghelab on the back of his motor scooter. He took me to the avant-garde studios of young artists where we smoked hash and engaged in meandering discussions of Bruce Nauman and abstract expressionism.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/may/07/prayer-food-sex-and-water-parks-in-irans-holy-city-of-mashhad\">Prayer, food, sex and water parks in Iran's holy city of Mashhad</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We have talked about all the trips we plan on taking, to Mashhad, and Esfahan, and Bandar Abbas, about how we are going to buy a motorcycle and ride it to India together. None of which we have actually done. But still it is magical. Everything is great, but we have kept running into one big problem: intimacy. The whole first month we were dating, we spent most days together but we managed to have sex only once.</p> \n<p>No matter how well things are going in our relationship, there’s always an 800lb gorilla in the room. We say we love each other regularly, we call each other azizam (my darling) - when no one is listening of course - and all I want to do is grab him and kiss him when we greet each other but we have to pretend we’re just friends because he has a debilitating fear of stigma, because he’s grown up in a society that systematically delegitimises our sexual orientation.</p> \n<p>The constant code switching is dizzying. One minute we’re in the shower together, the next minute we’re sitting on opposite ends of an empty couch. I grew up in Los Angeles, and have been living in New York, so there’s simply no way for me to empathise with the years of destructive internalisation that he must have experienced growing up gay in the Islamic republic. I try to sympathise, but at times it’s just too frustrating.</p> \n<p>“Things are definitely getting better,” said Sina, a gay 32-year-old Tehrani, “but we never touch and kiss in public.”</p> \n<p>I’ve met a lot of nice gay men in my time in Tehran. I’ve loved at least one of them. And yet I have not been able to find one who has ever introduced a boyfriend to his parents. It’s striking how universal it is. Men in their 30s who are successful, well-adjusted, and live alone: they still would never consider telling their parents about their sexual orientation.</p> \n<p>This is the strange grey area that gay men in Iran find themselves in. The government appears to be loosening its grip, it’s becoming easier for LGBT people to move in Iranian society without fear of arrest and prosecution, but a deeply engrained shame lingers, stunting the development of a truly ‘out’ LGBT culture.</p> \n<p>“We all want to be more open in public,” A said to me once, “but it’s just not the proper place or the proper time.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/6/1433592886438/1855c71b-0238-49ca-82d4-df7b86dd6e66-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Enric Marti/AP","altText":"Iranians look at Andy Wharhol's portraits of rock star Mick Jagger during an exhibition of Pop Art at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tehran, Iran.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Enric Marti/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-11T04:00:00Z","lastModified":"2015-06-11T04:00:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":5,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Iran","Gay and lesbian travel","Middle East and North Africa","World news","Travel","Mahmoud Ahmadinejad","Hassan Rouhani"],"tags":[{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran"},{"id":"travel/gay-and-lesbian-travel","webTitle":"Gay and lesbian travel"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"travel/travel","webTitle":"Travel"},{"id":"world/mahmoud-ahmadinejad","webTitle":"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad"},{"id":"world/hassan-rouhani","webTitle":"Hassan Rouhani"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"Tehran Bureau","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/series/tehran-bureau"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/11/iran-gay-coming-out-intimate-spaces","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49en5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/11/iran-gay-coming-out-intimate-spaces","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/11/iran-gay-coming-out-intimate-spaces"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/6/1433592886438/1855c71b-0238-49ca-82d4-df7b86dd6e66-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Iranians look at Andy Wharhol’s portraits of rock star Mick Jagger during an exhibition of Pop Art at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tehran, Iran.

Today, as companies win billions in damages, insiders say it has got dangerously out of control</p>","byline":"Claire Provost and Matt Kennard","body":"<p>Luis Parada’s office is just four blocks from the White House, in the heart of K Street, Washington’s lobbying row –&nbsp;a stretch of steel and glass buildings once dubbed the “road to riches”, when influence-peddling became an American growth industry. Parada, a soft-spoken 55-year-old from El Salvador, is one of a handful of lawyers in the world who specialise in defending sovereign states against lawsuits lodged by multinational corporations. He is the lawyer for the defence in an obscure but increasingly powerful field of international law –&nbsp;where foreign investors can sue governments in a network of tribunals for billions of dollars.</p> \n<p>Fifteen years ago, Parada’s work was a minor niche even within the legal business. But since 2000, hundreds of foreign investors have sued more than half of the world’s countries, claiming damages for a wide range of government actions that they say have threatened their profits. In 2006, Ecuador cancelled an oil-exploration contract with Houston-based <a href=\"http://www.oxy.com/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Occidental Petroleum</a>; in 2012, after Occidental filed a suit before an international investment tribunal, Ecuador was ordered to pay a record $1.8bn – roughly equal to the country’s health budget for a year. (Ecuador has logged a request for the decision to be annulled.)</p> \n<p>Parada’s first case was defending Argentina in the late 1990s against the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2004/mar/21/theobserver.observerbusiness9\" title=\"\">French conglomerate Vivendi</a>, which sued after the Argentine province of Tucuman stepped in to limit the price it charged people for water and wastewater services. Argentina eventually lost, and was ordered to pay the company more than $100m. Now, in his most high-profile case yet, Parada is part of the team defending El Salvador as it tries to fend off a multimillion-dollar suit lodged by a multinational mining company after the tiny Central American country refused to allow it to dig for gold.</p> \n<p>The suit was filed in 2009 by a Canadian company, Pacific Rim –&nbsp;later bought by an Australian mining firm, <a href=\"http://www.oceanagold.com/\" title=\"\">OceanaGold</a> – which said it had been encouraged by the government of El Salvador to spend “tens of millions of dollars to undertake mineral exploration activities”. But, the company alleged that when valuable deposits of gold and silver were discovered, the government, for political reasons, withheld the permits it needed to begin digging. The company’s claim, which at one point exceeded $300m, has since been reduced to $284m&nbsp;–&nbsp;still more than the total amount of foreign aid El Salvador received last year. El Salvador countered that the company not only lacked environmental permits but also failed to prove it had obtained rights to much of the land covered by its request: many farmers in the northern Caba&ntilde;as region, where the company wanted to dig, had refused to sell their land.</p> \n<p>Every year on 15 September, thousands of Salvadorans celebrate the date when much of Central America gained independence from Spain. Fireworks are set off and marching bands parade through villages across the country. But, last year, in the town of San Isidro, in Caba&ntilde;as, the festivities had a markedly different tone. Hundreds had gathered to protest against the mine. Gold mines often use cyanide to separate gold from ore, and widespread concern over already severe water contamination in El Salvador has helped fuel a powerful movement determined to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2014/apr/11/el-salvador-communities-battle-gold-in-ground\" title=\"\">keep the country’s minerals in the ground</a>. In the central square, colourful banners were strung up, calling on OceanaGold to drop its case against the country and leave the area. Many were adorned with the slogan, “No a la mineria, Si a la vida” (No to mining, Yes to life).</p> \n<p>On the same day, in Washington DC, Parada gathered his notes and shuffled into a suite of nondescript meeting rooms in the World Bank’s J building, across the street from its main headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue. This is the <a href=\"https://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSIDWEB/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes</a> (ICSID): the primary institution for handling the cases that companies file against sovereign states.<strong> </strong>(The ICSID is not the sole venue for such cases; there are similar forums in London, Paris, Hong Kong and the Hague, among others.) The date of the hearing was not a coincidence, Parada said. The case has been framed in El Salvador as a test of the country’s sovereignty in the 21st century, and he suggested that it should be heard on Independence Day. “The ultimate question in this case,” he said, “is whether a foreign investor can force a government to change its laws to please the investor as opposed to the investor complying with the laws they find in the country.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The ultimate question is whether a foreign investor can force a government to change its laws to please the investor</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Luis Parada</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Most international investment treaties and free-trade deals grant foreign investors the right to activate this system, known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), if they want to challenge government decisions affecting their investments. In Europe, this system has become a sticking point in negotiations over the controversial <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</a> (TTIP) deal proposed between the European Union and the US, which would massively extend its scope and power and make it harder to challenge in the future. Both <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/sections/trade-society/france-and-germany-form-united-front-against-isds-311267\" title=\"\">France and Germany</a> have said that they want access to investor-state dispute settlement removed from the TTIP treaty currently under discussion.</p> \n<p>Investors have used this system not only to sue for compensation for alleged expropriation of land and factories, but also over a huge range of government measures, including environmental and social regulations, which they say infringe on their rights. Multinationals have sued to recover money they have already invested, but also for alleged lost profits and “expected future profits”. The number of suits filed against countries at the ICSID is now around 500 – and that figure is growing at an average rate of one case a week. The sums awarded in damages are so vast that investment funds have taken notice: corporations’ claims against states are now seen as assets that can be invested in or used as leverage to secure multimillion-dollar loans. Increasingly, companies are using the threat of a lawsuit at the ICSID to exert pressure on governments not to challenge investors’ actions.</p> \n<p>“I had absolutely no idea this was coming,” Parada said. Sitting in a glass-walled meeting room in his offices, at the law firm Foley Hoag, he paused, searching for the right word to describe what has happened in his field. “Rogue,” he decided, finally. “I think the investor-state arbitration system was created with good intentions, but in practice it has gone completely rogue.”</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>The quiet village of Moorburg in Germany</strong> lies just across the river from Hamburg. Past the 16th-century church and meadows rich with wildflowers, two huge chimneys spew a steady stream of thick, grey smoke into the sky. This is Kraftwerk Moorburg, a new coal-fired power plant – the village’s controversial next-door neighbour. In 2009, it was the subject of a <a href=\"http://www.italaw.com/cases/1148\" title=\"\">€1.4bn investor-state case</a> filed by <a href=\"http://corporate.vattenfall.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Vattenfall</a>, the Swedish energy giant, against the Federal Republic of Germany. It is a prime example of how this powerful international legal system, built to protect foreign investors in developing countries, is now being used to challenge the actions of European governments as well.</p> \n<p>Since the 1980s, German investors have sued dozens of countries, including Ghana, Ukraine and the Philippines, at the World Bank’s Centre in Washington DC. But with the Vattenfall case, Germany found itself in the dock for the first time. The irony was not lost on those who considered Germany to be the grandfather of investor-state arbitration: it was a group of German businessmen, in the late 1950s, who first conceived of a way to protect their overseas investments as a wave of developing countries gained independence from European colonial powers. Led by Deutsche Bank chairman Hermann Abs, they called their proposal an “international magna carta” for private investors.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The investor-state arbitration system was created with good intentions, but in practice it has gone completely rogue</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Luis Parada</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In the 1960s, the idea was taken up by the World Bank, which said that such a system could help the world’s poorer countries attract foreign capital. “I am convinced,” the World Bank president George Woods said at the time, “that those … who adopt as their national policy a welcome [environment] for international investment – and that means, to mince no words about it, giving foreign investors a fair opportunity to make attractive profits –&nbsp;will achieve their development objectives more rapidly than those who do not.”</p> \n<p>At the World Bank’s 1964 annual meeting in Tokyo, it approved a resolution to set up a mechanism for handling investor-state cases. The first line of the ICSID Convention’s preamble sets out its goal as “international cooperation for economic development”. There was sharp opposition to this system from its inception, with a bloc of developing countries warning that it would undermine their sovereignty. A group of 21 countries –&nbsp;almost every Latin American country, plus Iraq and the Philippines –&nbsp;voted against the proposal in Tokyo. But the World Bank moved ahead regardless. Andreas Lowenfeld, an American legal academic who was involved in some of these early discussions, <a href=\"digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1109&amp;context=gjicl\" title=\"\">later remarked</a>: “I believe this was the first time that a major resolution of the World Bank had been pressed forward with so much opposition.”</p> \n<p>Global development remains the ICSID’s stated goal. “The idea,” said the institution’s current secretary-general, Meg Kinnear, “is if an investor feels that there is a fair, impartial mechanism should they ever get to a dispute, then they will have that much more confidence and it will help to promote investment … and when you invest in a country you obviously bring jobs, revenue, technology and the like.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2ffe58071b444a46ea1ea0038acebd3a0088591\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433866595669/8d6d4b31-f4fe-41d3-96bc-c0eca6ea2d8e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Giacomo Gambineri\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Giacomo Gambineri</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But now governments are discovering, too late, the true price of that confidence. The Kraftwerk Moorburg plant was controversial long before the case was filed. For years, local residents and environmental groups objected to its construction, amid growing concern over climate change and the impact the project would have on the Elbe river. In 2008, Vattenfall was granted a water permit for its Moorburg project, but, in response to local pressure, local authorities imposed strict environmental conditions to limit the utility’s water usage and its impact on fish.</p> \n<p>Vattenfall sued Hamburg in the local courts. But, as a foreign investor, it was also able to file a case at the ICSID. These environmental measures, it said, were so strict that they constituted a violation of its rights as guaranteed by the <a href=\"http://www.encharter.org/\" title=\"\">Energy Charter Treaty</a>, a multilateral investment agreement signed by more than 50 countries, including Sweden and Germany. It claimed that the environmental conditions placed on its permit were so severe that they made the plant uneconomical and constituted acts of indirect expropriation.</p> \n<p>“It was a total surprise for us,” the local Green party leader Jens Kerstan laughed, in a meeting at his sunny office in Hamburg last year. “As far as I knew, there were some [treaties] to protect German companies in the [developing] world or in dictatorships, but that a European company can sue Germany, that was totally a surprise to me.”</p> \n<p>Vattenfall v Germany ended in a settlement in 2011, after the company won its case in the local court and received a new water permit for its Moorburg plant – which significantly lowered the environmental standards that had originally been imposed, according to legal&nbsp;experts, allowing the plant to use more water from the river and weakening measures to protect fish. The European Commission has now stepped in, taking Germany to the EU Court of Justice, saying its authorisation of the Moorburg coal plant violated EU environmental law by not doing more to reduce the risk to protected fish species, including salmon, which pass near the plant while migrating from the North Sea.</p> \n<p><strong>A year after the Moorburg case closed,</strong> <a href=\"http://www.italaw.com/cases/documents/1655\" title=\"\">Vattenfall filed another claim</a> against Germany, this time over the federal government’s decision to phase out nuclear power. This second suit –&nbsp;for which very little information is available in the public domain, despite reports that the <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL6N0SA3AK20141015\" title=\"\">company is seeking €4.7bn from German taxpayers</a> –&nbsp;is still ongoing. Roughly one third of all concluded cases filed at the ICSID are recorded as ending in “settlements”, which –&nbsp;as the Moorburg dispute shows – can be very profitable for investors, though their terms are rarely fully disclosed.</p> \n<p>There are now thousands of international investment agreements and free-trade acts, signed by states, which give foreign companies access to the investor-state dispute system, if they decide to challenge government decisions. Disputes are typically heard by panels of three arbitrators; one selected by each side, and the third agreed upon by both parties. Rulings are made by majority vote, and decisions are final and binding. There is no appeals process – only an annulment option that can be used on very limited grounds. If states do not pay up after the decision, their assets are subject to seizure in almost every country in the world (the company can apply to local courts for an enforcement order). While a tribunal cannot force a country to change its laws, or give a company a permit, the risk of massive damages may in some cases be enough to persuade a government to reconsider its actions. The possibility of arbitration proceedings can be used to encourage states to enter into meaningful settlement negotiations.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If states do not pay up after the decision, their assets are subject to seizure in almost every country in the world</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In Guatemala, internal government documents obtained through the country’s Freedom of Information Act show how&nbsp;the risk of one of these cases weighed heavily on one state’s decision not to challenge a controversial gold mine, despite protests from its citizens and a recommendation from&nbsp;the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights that&nbsp;it&nbsp;be closed down. Such an action, the documents warned, could provoke the company, owned by Canadian mining giant Goldcorp, to activate the ICSID or invoke clauses&nbsp;of the Central American Free Trade Agreement (Cafta)&nbsp;to gain “access to international arbitration and subsequent claims of damages to the state”. The mine, which&nbsp;had been closed temporarily by the government in 2010, was allowed to reopen.</p> \n<p>As the claims made by companies get bigger, it seems increasingly likely that the massive financial risks associated with investor-state arbitration will effectively grant foreign investors a veto over government decisions.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>When companies are unsuccessful </strong>in their claims against states, there may be other advantages to be gained. In 2004, South Africa’s new, post-apartheid Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA) came into force. Along with a new mining charter, the act sought to redress historical inequalities in the mining sector, in part by requiring companies to partner with citizens who had suffered under the apartheid regime. The new system terminated all previously held mining rights, and required companies to reapply for licences to continue their operations. It also instituted a mandatory 26% ownership stake in the country’s mining companies for black South Africans. Two years later, a group of Italian investors, who together control most of the South African granite industry, filed a <a href=\"http://www.italaw.com/cases/446\" title=\"\">landmark investor-state claim</a> against South Africa. The country’s new mining regime, they argued, had unlawfully expropriated their investments and treated them unfairly. They demanded $350m in compensation.</p> \n<p>The case was filed by members of the Foresti and Conti families, prominent Tuscan industrialists, and a Luxembourg-based holding company, Finstone. They cited two bilateral investment treaties, both signed in the late 1990s, during Nelson Mandela’s presidency. Jason Brickhill, a lawyer at the Johannesburg-based Legal Resources Centre, said the new, post-apartheid government seemed to view these agreements “more as acts of diplomatic goodwill than serious legal commitments with potentially far-reaching economic consequences”.</p> \n<p>During that time, officials would be invited to meetings in Europe, he said, “and there would be all sorts of discussion about [South Africa’s] economic and trade direction, and part of that was an expectation that they would conclude an investment treaty – but they had no real understanding of what they were committing to in law”. Peter Draper, a former official in the South African Department of Trade and Industry, put it more starkly: “We were essentially giving away the store without asking any critical questions, or protecting crucial policy space.” &nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8fa35d7b4310ae3fa28d2ea17cdb4e262441b6f6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433866721653/6d6115a9-151b-4ee8-8435-d4ba848d10c7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Giacomo Gambineri\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Giacomo Gambineri</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The companies’ case against South Africa dragged on for four years, before ending abruptly when the Italian group dropped its claims and the tribunal ordered them to contribute €400,000 (&pound;290,000) towards South Africa’s costs. At the time, a government <a href=\"www.thedti.gov.za/editmedia.jsp?id=1941\" title=\"\">press release </a>celebrated it as “successful conclusion” – despite the fact that South Africa was still left with €5m in unreimbursed legal fees. But the investors claimed a more significant victory: the pressure of the case, they said, allowed them to strike an unprecedented deal with the South African government that allowed their companies to transfer only 5% of their ownership to black South Africans –&nbsp;rather than the 26% mandated by the state mining authority. “No other mining company in South Africa has been treated so generously since the advent of the [new mining regime],” one of the investors’ lawyers, Peter Leon, <a href=\"www.miningweekly.com/article/arbitration-battle-ends-as-granite-claimants-withdraw-sa-awarded-costs-2010-08-05\" title=\"\">boasted</a> at the time.</p> \n<p>The government seems to have agreed to this deal, which goes against the spirit of post-apartheid reparations in South Africa, to prevent a flood of other claims against it. “If the merits of the case were decided against the government, they thought, ‘That’s it, we are going to go down.’ And I think that’s why they were happy to agree to that settlement,” Jonathan Veeran, another of the company’s lawyers said, in an interview at his office in Johannesburg. His clients, he said, “were most pleased with the result”.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>A small number of countries</strong> are now attempting to extricate themselves from the bonds of the investor-state dispute system. One of these is Bolivia, where thousands of people took to the streets of the country’s third-largest city, Cochabamba, in 2000, to protest against a dramatic hike in water rates by a private company owned by Bechtel, the US civil engineering firm. During the demonstrations, the Bolivian government stepped in and terminated the company’s concession. The company then filed a $50m suit against Bolivia at the ICSID. In 2006, following a campaign calling for the case to be thrown out, the company agreed to accept a token payment of less than $1.</p> \n<p>After this expensive case, Bolivia cancelled the international agreements it had signed with other states giving their investors access to these tribunals. But getting out of this system is not easily done. Most of these international agreements have sunset clauses, under which their provisions remain in force for a further 10 or even 20 years, even if the treaties themselves are cancelled.</p> \n<p>In 2010, Bolivia’s president, Evo Morales, nationalised the country’s largest energy provider, Empresa El&eacute;ctrica Guaracachi. The UK power investor Rurelec, which indirectly held a 50.001% stake in the company, took Bolivia to the <a href=\"http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=363\" title=\"\">permanent court of arbitration</a> in the Hague demanding $100m in compensation. Last year, Bolivia was ordered to pay Rurelec $35m; after months of further negotiations, the two sides settled on a payment of just over $31m in May 2014. Rurelec, which declined to comment for this article, celebrated the receipt of this award with a series of press releases on its website. “My only sadness is that it has taken so long to reach a settlement,” said the fund’s CEO in a statement. “All we wanted was a friendly negotiation and a handshake from President Morales.”</p> \n<p>Even states that first objected to the introduction of the investor-state dispute system at the 1964 World Bank meeting have since signed dozens of agreements expanding its reach. With the rapid growth in these treaties –&nbsp;today there are more than 3,000 in force&nbsp;–&nbsp;a specialist industry has developed in advising companies how best to exploit treaties that give investors access to the dispute resolution system, and how to structure their businesses to benefit from the different protections on offer. It is a lucrative sector: legal fees alone average $8m per case, but they have exceeded $30m in some disputes; arbitrators’ fees at start at <a href=\"https://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSIDWEB/arbitrators/Pages/Claims-for-Fees-and-Expenses.aspx\" title=\"\">$3,000 per day, plus expenses</a>. While there is no equivalent of legal aid for states trying to defend themselves against these suits, corporations have access to a growing group of third-party financiers who are willing to fund their cases against states, usually in exchange for a cut of any eventual award.</p> \n<p>Increasingly, these suits are becoming valuable even before claims are settled. After Rurelec filed suit against Bolivia, it took its case to the market and secured a multimillion-dollar corporate loan, using its dispute with Bolivia as collateral, so that it could expand its business. Over the last 10 years, and particularly since the global financial crisis, a growing number of specialised investment funds have moved to raise money through these cases, treating companies’ multimillion-dollar claims against states as a new “asset class”.</p> \n<p>One of the largest of these funds to specialise in backing corporations’ suits against governments, Burford Capital, is based just a few blocks from East Croydon train station, on the&nbsp;fifth floor of a nondescript brown brick building. Companies rarely disclose when their cases are being financed by one of these third-party investors, but in the Rurelec suit against Bolivia, Burford issued a <a href=\"www.burfordcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-06-03-BUR-Rurelec-press-release-Final.pdf\" title=\"\">triumphant press release </a>celebrating its “groundbreaking” involvement. Typically, funders like this will agree to back companies’ claims against states in exchange for a cut of any eventual award. In this case Burford gave Rurelec a $15m loan, using the claim against Bolivia as security.</p> \n<p>“Rurelec did not need capital to pay its lawyers. Rather, it needed capital to continue to grow its business,” Burford said in a statement. “This is a good demonstration that the benefits of litigation finance go far beyond that of simply helping to pay legal fees,” the CEO added, “and in many cases can provide an effective alternative method of financing to help companies achieve their strategic goals.” It was highly rewarding for Burford as well: it announced a net profit of $11m from the dispute.</p> \n<p>A spokesman for Burford explained further: “Burford did not fund Rurelec’s arbitration claim, which had been under way for two years before our involvement with the company. Rather, we provided a corporate debt facility to enable Rurelec&nbsp;to expand its South American operations, but we looked to the arbitration claim (a contingent asset) to assist in the repayment of the loan.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4857f8587a7e1ee417565e6abe5fe226f12d168b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433867184358/60cbe7ac-5935-4811-a7d3-bae5b7c8b971-199x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Giacomo Gambineri\" width=\"199\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Giacomo Gambineri</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>From the beginning, part of the justification for the international investor-state dispute system has been to create a “neutral forum” for conflicts to be resolved, with investors giving up the right to seek diplomatic support from their home countries when they file cases like this. But documents obtained in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that Rurelec was also able to rely on the British government, which actively intervened to support its case.</p> \n<p>The 44-page disclosure includes dozens of emails and internal briefing notes from May 2010 to June 2014, several of which explicitly reference British lobbying on behalf of the company. One email, to the UK ambassador to Bolivia, Ross Denny, whose sender has been redacted, includes the line “Lobby on Rurelec, yes.” Another, from Denny, said: “Our regular high-level lobbying on behalf of Rurelec has helped to demonstrate the seriousness with which we take protection of our companies’ interests.” Yet another said simply: “Rurelec needs our help.”</p> \n<p>It seems the British embassy was aware that the arbitration system is supposed to be impartial. One email, which appears to be about how to respond to an enquiry from a member of the public, said: “All things being equal, our line would be that HMG does not get involved in legal proceeding as brought under the investment treaties we have signed.” The message, whose sender and receivers are both redacted, continues: “If FCO [the Foreign and Commonwealth Office] has had an ongoing dialogue with the company on this topic, it would probably be more appropriate for you to respond with some general lines from us on the benefits of investment treaties.”</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>El Salvador has already spent more than $12m</strong> defending itself against Pacific Rim, but even if it succeeds in beating the company’s $284m claim, it may never recover these costs. For years Salvadoran protest groups have been calling on the World Bank to initiate an open and public review of ICSID. To date, no such study has been carried out. In recent years, a number of ideas have been mooted to reform the international investor-state dispute system – to adopt a “loser pays” approach to costs, for example, or to increase transparency. The solution may lie in creating an appeals system, so that controversial judgments can be revisited.</p> \n<p>Last year, David Morales, El Salvador’s human rights ombudsman (a state post created as part of the peace process after the country’s civil war, fought between 1979 and 1992) took out a full-page ad in the national newspaper <a href=\"http://www.laprensagrafica.com/\" title=\"\">La Prensa Gr&aacute;fica</a> calling on the government to review all of the international investment treaties it has signed, with a view to renegotiating or cancelling them. Luis Parada, representing El Salvador in its dispute with Pacific Rim, agrees that this would be a wise move: “I personally don’t think countries get as much from these treaties than the risks that they incur in international arbitration.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>El Salvador has already spent more than $12m defending itself against Pacific Rim. It may never recover these costs</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Other countries have already decided to cut their losses, and tried to get out of these trade treaties. Shortly after settling the lawsuit with foreign mining companies over its new post-apartheid mining rules, South Africa began to terminate many of its own investment agreements.</p> \n<p>“What was concerning for us was that you could have an international arbitration&nbsp;– three individuals, making a decision –&nbsp;on what was in effect a legislative programme in South Africa that had been arrived at democratically, and that somehow this arbitration panel could potentially call this into question,” said Xavier Carim, a former deputy director-general in South Africa’s Department of Trade and Industry. “It was very, very clear that these treaties are open to such wide interpretations by panels, or by investors looking to challenge any government measure, with the possibility of a significant payout at the end of the day,” said Carim, who is now South Africa’s representative to the World Trade Organisation in Geneva. “The simple fact is that these treaties give you very little benefit and they just pose risk.”</p> \n<p>Before moving to terminate its agreements, the South African government commissioned an internal study to help determine whether such treaties actually did help boost foreign investment. “There was no pattern between signing treaties and getting investment,” Carim explained. “We’ve had huge investments from the US and Japan and India and a number of other countries where we don’t have investment treaties. Companies don’t come and invest in a country or not because it does or doesn’t have a bilateral investment treaty. They invest if there is a return to be made.”</p> \n<p>Brazil has never signed up to this system – it has not entered into a single treaty with these investor-state dispute provisions – and yet it has had no trouble attracting foreign investment.</p> \n<p>Parada said it would take “a broad consensus of determined states” in order to truly rein in this system. “The states that created the system are the only ones that can fix it,” he said. “I have not seen a critical mass of states with the political will [to do this] … much less a broad consensus. But I still hope it happens.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <strong>Claire Provost</strong> and <strong>Matt Kennard</strong> are Bertha fellows at the Centre for Investigative Journalism.
