Epically telling a story of love against a background of war, this ninth work of fiction from Louis de Berni&egrave;res most resembles, in form and effect, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2007/sep/01/louisdebernieres\"><em>Captain Corelli’s Mandolin. </em>That book,</a> published two decades ago, made the author’s name but has subsequently overshadowed it.</p> \n<p>Unusually for an English writer, albeit one whose surname suggests a far-reaching family tree, De Berni&egrave;res has only intermittently written about England: tellingly, the title characters of his first four novels were Don Emmanuel, Se&ntilde;or Vivo, Cardinal Guzman and Captain Corelli.</p> \n<p><em>The Dust That Falls from Dreams</em>, though, leaves “Blighty”, as the large military cast calls it, for horrific interludes in French trenches, tribal conflict in Afghanistan and a coda set in colonial Ceylon. The novel begins in 1902, with a Coronation garden party in the London suburb of Eltham, at The Grampians. This is the home of Hamilton McCosh, a Scottish businessman and inventor, who has acquired the trappings of success (big pile, servants) but not quite the social standing to which his snobbish wife aspires.</p> \n<p>The McCoshes’ bash to welcome Edwardian times economically establishes the three families who mainly people the pages and who, an afterword suggests, may return in further instalments of this saga. Among the neighbours of the McCosh clan, with its four sparky Austenish daughters, is an American family with three sons and the Thackerayesque surname of Pendennis. Along the street are the Anglo-French Pitts, whose number has been reduced by the deaths, told in flashback, of a father and two of his four sons. Daniel Pitt, who holds a secret childish passion for Rosie McCosh, is dismayed during the shindig for the new king to observe the young girl declaring eternal love to Ashbridge Pendennis.</p> \n<p>A sudden time jump (not the only overlap between the novel and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/downton-abbey\"><em>Downton Abbey</em></a>) reintroduces us to the characters as neo-Georgians in 1914, from where the main action takes place over eight years. The first world war attrition rates are high and the odds are heavily stacked against the characters surviving; readers may note with foreboding that the McCoshes, having only daughters, and the Pendennises and Pitts, with only sons, face unequal jeopardy.</p> \n<p>As the plot plays cleverly with our fears and guesses, it would be unfair to reveal precisely who is lined up in the writer’s cross hairs, but much of the novel’s considerable emotional power comes from the manner in which Rosie, before becoming a wife, lives as a widow. De Berni&egrave;res vividly brings to life a world stalked by death. In France, soldiers shot on the battlefields have their falls broken by the cushions of bloated corpses hidden in the mud; in England, mothers who have lost their children sit silently black-clad in living rooms or gather in the parlours of spiritualists who promise them posthumous contact. Even the most unsympathetic characters have their behaviour excused by bereavement.</p> \n<p>Although its biggest concerns are love and death, the novel also deeply explores religion – Rosie is an Anglican with Catholic leanings, while another key figure is a military chaplain – and class and gender politics of the time: the McCosh daughters and their servants variously benefit from new professional and personal freedoms for women in a society where the absence of men is felt at almost every kitchen table and office desk.</p> \n<p>The best historical novelists research widely but use the findings sparingly and De Berni&egrave;res selects small but powerful time references both at home – an overheated car outside Euston Station is cooled by water from the trough still provided for horses – and abroad: in the trench latrines, soldiers use the letters from their sweethearts first for masturbatory and then lavatorial purposes.</p> \n<p>Efficiently told in a variety of voices – third- and first-person, letters, diaries, poems, songs – the book sometimes falters in its vernacular dialogue. The toffs are top-hole and the Anglo-French speak a plausible blurring of two tongues, but others are left to get by on a repeated verbal tic: “bairn” for a Scot, “Jasus” for an Irishwoman, Cockneys droppin’ their final “g”s.</p> \n<p>While some period fiction offers an escape from contemporary concerns, the best stories of the past illuminate the present. The boom in Tudor fiction addresses modern concerns with the operation of state power and the suppression of women, and, in De Berni&egrave;res’ book, someone in the second decade of the 20th century warns of what can happen “when the government promises to prop up the banks”, while the Afghanistan subplot, involving western treatment of what are then called “Mohammedans”, previews a pay-off in our own day.</p> \n<p>Some of De Berni&egrave;res’ readers will not forgive him for failing to write another <em>Captain Corelli’s Mandolin</em>. But<em> The Dust That Falls from Dreams</em>, while not a follow-up to his signature title, deserves a large following for its own story of war and love.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Mark Lawson’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/deaths.html\"><em>The Deaths</em></a> is published by Picador.

So what’s next – could he be the next Paxman? O’Leary talks about James Joyce, politics and his hero Terry Wogan</p>","byline":"Sophie Heawood","body":"<p>When Dermot O’Leary was asked to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/mar/13/dermots-24-hour-danceathon-comic-relief-oleary-red-nose-day\">dance outside BBC Broadcasting House for 24 hours</a> for Comic Relief, he thought he might make a hundred grand. In the end, he raised over &pound;1m for the charity, as people across the nation kept pressing the red button, utterly intoxicated by the sight of him bouncing along, in a cheery sort of trance. “Someone asked me how I was feeling and I said, “Oh I’m really fucked” – I swore a few times, my producer had to come and have a word.” He says he had given his team a list of 500 songs that make him happy, to ensure the visiting celebrity DJs would play at least some of them. “They played three. In 24 hours. Everybody decided disco would keep me going instead – if I have to hear Boogie Wonderland again, I’m not joking …”</p> \n<p>When we meet, in a spare studio at the Radio 2 building, I am instantly struck by the fact that Dermot O’Leary is exactly the same in real life as he is on the telly, and how great it must be to have a job where you just put your whole cheery, chatty self out there. After talking to him for an hour, and realising how much more is going on, I’m left wondering how peculiar it must be to have a job where you hold so much of yourself back.</p> \n<p>Of course, O’Leary, 41, is most famous for presenting The X Factor, the talent show dominated by judges who long to play god and contestants who long to be stars, and on which he has always been the gentler, human bridge between them all, never taking himself as seriously. Personally, I hate X Factor so much that being cajoled into watching it always makes me feel unwell – but I love <em>him</em> on it. “You <em>hate</em> X Factor?” he says. “REALLY?” he adds, looking a bit surprised.</p> \n<p>“Why? It’s odd, because … I don’t usually get on with people who don’t like it,” he adds. Ah. I thought he might secretly be pleased, given that he recently quit the show after eight years. He says he just woke up with a gut feeling one day that it was time to go, that he had had the best of it now, that he should move on. “But I’ll never say anything bad about it because it bought me my house. And I did enjoy it – the trust they put in me. I just wanted to make a good TV show, I wasn’t bothered if we found the next superstar.” Now he has lots of free time to think up new TV shows and do things like celebrating James Joyce day by giving a reading at the Irish embassy.</p> \n<p>“Though we’re not really a Joycean family – the O’Learys are all big readers but Joyce is so modernistic and we were raised on slightly more romantic stuff, like Yeats. There’s a strange thing in Ireland – and it’s similar in Norway, where my wife’s from – when you’re a small country and you punch above your weight literarily, then that literature permeates.”</p> \n<p>His Irish parents, who raised him in a village in Essex, had c&eacute;il&iacute;s in their front room on Sunday nights, and instilled a sense of social justice and Irish history in their children, as you discover reading his 2014 memoir, The Soundtrack To My Life. “1798,” he says proudly, the very second I mention the Wexford rebellion. The book is also a bit of a love letter to his inspiration: Terry Wogan, the man who gave him his best radio advice ever, which was “Don’t be afraid of the silences.” I ask him what Terry’s response to such humble adulation has been. “Er, I don’t think he’s aware of its existence,” he admits, laughing at himself again. “When I did the danceathon I did <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Y4HufJ1oE\">the Floral Dance</a> with him, and about two thirds of the way through he couldn’t be arsed any more and he literally gave up. So I’m there with Morris dancers, Wogan’s just walked off and I KNOW there’s another verse still to come. I’m like, you’re only here for ONE SONG Terry, where are you going?”</p> \n<p>After passing only two GCSEs, “the biggest wake-up call of my life”, O’Leary resat them, then did A-levels (getting an A in politics) and went to Middlesex University in London. He didn’t spend his time there on girlfriends and raves, but on going to see politicians from both sides of the house speak: Tony Benn, Edward Heath, Michael Heseltine, Robin Cook. The more we talk, the more I wonder if his long-term television goal is really to move towards Westminster – to be more of a Paxman than an Ant or Dec. He says no, he likes doing a bit of everything, but when I ask him to name the Labour party leadership candidates he doesn’t miss a beat, can tell me all of their individual policies, and becomes truly animated when discussing what went wrong for Ed Miliband.</p> \n<p>“I did the party leadership interviews last time. Clegg came across as a decent human being. Gordon Brown came across as a decent human being with the weight of the world on his shoulders. But Cameron walked in and you just went, yeah, he’s the prime minister. Now this is literally my back-of-the-fag-packet theory here, but we trust an old Etonian in this country. We just do – even if we don’t know we’re doing it. It’s bred into us that they can run the country.” Not that that means other people should pretend to be such – O’Leary says the current Labour leadership debates are awful to watch, because people are already speaking in their campaign spiels, rather than just showing us who they are.</p> \n<p>“And Ed was obviously an honourable guy, but I just wanted to media-train him to be fallible – none of this ‘hell yeah’ posturing.</p> \n<p>“It’s like when Gordon Brown said he liked the Arctic Monkeys. No! He should have just said, ‘I like my kids and I like maths and I like politics and that’s it.’ Why I love Ars&egrave;ne Wenger is because he’s honest. He once said: ‘I only like football and a certain Alsatian wine, and if you put me two blocks from my house I won’t be able to get home.’ People do respond to that sort of honesty.”</p> \n<p>When you work for the BBC you aren’t supposed to reveal your political allegiances – something that O’Leary admits can be a struggle. He’s happy to say that he identifies as centre-left; he once called himself a socialist, but now says there are certain Tories he might have voted for, and says he thinks it’s “more about politicians than it is about politics”. He’s been invited to go on Question Time, and would love to accept. But the powers that be at Radio 2 aren’t keen on him doing it. “And everyone’s convinced the BBC is Trotskyite anyway, so people are terrified here. I don’t know. It’s that weird thing, even with sport, the guys on Five Live tell me they won’t say publicly which team they support. I love this place so much but it’s funny that the Reithian principles that still govern the BBC were decided by one man and when you find out about him, he was <em>pretty</em> bonkers.”</p> \n<p>We are actually here to talk about Dermot O’Leary: The Saturday Sessions 2015, his latest compilation album from his Radio 2 afternoon show – it’s largely cover versions. I put the CD on, thinking the tracklisting of Sam Smith and Elbow and Morcheeba looked nice enough and wouldn’t have any surprises, but then Will Young came on singing Take My Breath Away at a stark, slowed-down tempo and, anyway, there must have been something in my eye. “I’m never making a compilation album without Will on it,” agrees O’Leary. “Have you heard him doing Hanging on the Telephone?” he says, before whipping his phone out and playing an extraordinary cover version of Blondie. The album also includes The Levellers covering ABBA, which was not a combination anyone ever saw coming. But then neither was O’Leary presenting Newsnight, and after an hour in his company that’s starting to seem like the obvious pairing too. He has an infectious way of making life itself seem like an extraordinarily good idea. Perhaps this is exactly what British politics needs.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Dermot O’Leary Presents The Saturday Sessions 2015 is out now on Sony Music.</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435600470140/Would-love-to-go-on-Quest-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Richard Saker/Richard Saker","altText":"Would love to go on Question Time … Dermot O'Leary .

Director of editorial policy, David Jordan, has <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9ldOjDyJW24?t=45m37s\">termed</a> it “unsearching – an ugly word for an ugly process”. Big data advisor, James Leaton Gray, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI_an5HHTWU\">says</a> it makes him nervous. And now Neil McIntosh, managing editor of BBC Online, has <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/entries/1d765aa8-600b-4f32-b110-d02fbf7fd379\">republished</a> a list of 182 BBC links that have been partially obscured by Google over the past year, after Europe’s highest court commanded Google to start respecting European data protection law.</p> \n<p>Crucially, the BBC links are not removed from Google or the web, as McIntosh’s post misleadingly implied. Instead, as Google <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/entries/1d765aa8-600b-4f32-b110-d02fbf7fd379\">corrected</a>, they are only delisted in a very selective way - from top search results on particular individuals’ names, where those individuals have made a solid case for obscurity. </p> \n<p>They are a modest <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/aug/08/jimmy-wales-right-to-be-forgotten-wikipedia\">correction</a> against failures in algorithmic prioritisation on the indelible web. Before the requests go to the BBC, individuals must prove to Google – which has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/feb/18/the-right-be-forgotten-google-search\">every interest</a> in rejecting their claim – that the links contain personal information that is inaccurate, irrelevant or out of date, and holds no public interest.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/14/google-right-to-be-forgotten-academics-letter\">Google must be more open on 'right to be forgotten', academics warn in letter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>McIntosh wrote that the decision to republish the links was “primarily as a contribution to public policy”, made out of concern for the “integrity of the archive”. It is an important move, from a weighty institution. But it needs to be viewed with considerable caution. </p> \n<p>Placed in its proper context, as representing a tiny proportion of right to be forgotten requests (182 out of more than <a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/europeprivacy/?hl=en\">one million links</a>), the BBC’s list – and the media’s response to it – only accentuates the demand for data protection rights. It mandates a much richer public debate, and deeper introspection from the media, than we’ve seen to date.</p> \n<h2>The ‘man bites dog’ problem</h2> \n<p>The reaction to McIntosh’s post was predictable, inaccurate and devastating. The Times <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/medianews/article4480385.ece\">led with</a> “BBC lists stories on abusers and rapists hidden under ‘right to be forgotten’”, gratuitously highlighting two stories. </p> \n<p>The first was a 12-year-old story about a settlement between an alleged rape victim and the Catholic church, over incidents that occurred a half-century ago. The long-deceased abuser clearly couldn’t have filed the obscurity request with Google – leaving, rather less salaciously, the victim. </p> \n<p>The second case concerned a nanny jailed for child abuse. Even a cursory Google search coupled with the basics of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act would have told the journalist that an unspent conviction for such an offence clearly denied any reasonable claim to delisting. Caution raised, a bit more searching would have revealed the truth: that the conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeal. That former nanny has been exculpated under the law of the land – but not by Google and not, it seems, by the press either.</p> \n<p>Other publications followed suit. Boing Boing <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2015/06/28/bbcs-list-of-pages-de-indexe.html\">drew attention</a> to a rape story. Given it concerned a fairly recent conviction in 2012, clearly the sex offender has no entitlement to be delisted. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Acquittals and people moving on with their lives are boring – they are not news</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But what about his friend who was also named in the article because he happened to be in the house where the attack took place? His Google page is now plastered with the incriminating word ‘rapist’, albeit in reference to his convicted friend. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing on his part, does he not have a right to be forgotten in this context?</p> \n<p>These examples shine a light on the very problem that the right to be forgotten in part addresses, even if only imperfectly (other solutions <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/jul/22/a-manifesto-for-the-future-of-the-right-to-be-forgotten-debate\">could have been</a>, and should still be, explored). Journalistic logic is curiously asymmetrical. “Dog bites man” is not news; “man bites dog” most certainly is. Similarly, arrests are more newsworthy than exculpations. </p> \n<p>If the former nanny, or the rapist’s friend, are otherwise unremarkable, publication by a reputable press outlet will rocket to the top of their results, and effectively stay forever. Acquittals, and people moving on with their lives, are boring – they are not news, and they are rarely reported with the same intensity as crimes, arrests and convictions. And court records are often not online or readily searchable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/feb/18/the-right-be-forgotten-google-search\">How Google determined our right to be forgotten</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So what’s the result, in the imperfect mirror of reality that is the web? Next time you search for these people – or a potential employer or possible date does, as we all do – these results come up.</p> \n<h2>Compounding damage in an age of public shaming</h2> \n<p>The BBC is not the first publication to republish links, hazarding collateral damage, and undermining data subject’s rights. Wikipedia is maintaining a public list, and the Daily Mail and Telegraph have consistently republished requests – even going so far as to rewrite new stories about them, directly undermining and compounding the challenge of complainants and other parties, often in an entirely unfair manner.</p> \n<p>This is not some inherent or natural consequence of the web - the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect\">Streisand effect</a> beloved of cyber-libertarians. It is deliberate journalistic choice that causes public shame, and has not meaningfully contributed in any way to better policy making. It looks petulant, not constructive. And in some cases, it deceptively withholds crucial details, like certain Telegraph stories that have been republished, without also identifying that the original story has been modified simultaneously to remove the complainant’s name. So much for transparency.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Post-Leveson, the British press has a potent vitriol for anything it deems a limitation or restriction on its freedom</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Here, it is worth noting that the British press is an outlier in Europe. No other countries have been republishing requests. Post-Leveson, the British press has a new, potent vitriol for anything it deems a limitation or restriction on its freedom. There is also a strong tinge of Euroscepticism about rights emerging from the cultural sensibilities of continental Europe. </p> \n<p>But some healthy British humility wouldn’t go astray here. In many countries, the press only publishes partial names on stories concerning accused criminals. In others, archives and official bulletins are delisted from Google as a rule, to prevent situations like those that are traced in the quiet pathos of those dull BBC links.</p> \n<h2>What a more constructive press approach looks like</h2> \n<p>Burrowing further into the BBC’s own policies reveals considerably more sensitivity to the issues at stake, and suggest that the organisation’s petulance is a result of being disempowered in Google’s delisting process, rather than a more fundamental objection to individual interests. </p> \n<p>The BBC’s detailed guidelines include a willingness to consider small modifications, such as the pseudonymisation of an abuse victim’s name, which, ultimately, is all that a lot of people are requesting. </p> \n<p>However, the idea expressed by the BBC that the entire archive should be completely and timelessly<em> </em>accessible through search interfaces (as opposed to available, through the BBC front page, which it most certainly should be, and will continue to be), shows an unwillingness to engage with the required nuance regarding the dangers of the internet’s perpetual present, and removal for lesser reasons than harm. No one here is burning archives. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The BBC is unwilling to engage with the required nuance regarding the dangers of the internet’s perpetual present</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>A salutary contrast with the BBC here is the British Library’s measured <a href=\"http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/webarchive/2014/07/a-right-to-be-remembered.html\">response</a> after the European ruling, clearly rejecting the inapt book-cutting, or library-burning, <a href=\"http://informationrightsandwrongs.com/2014/06/27/google-is-not-a-library-dr-cavoukian/\">analogies</a> erected by opponents of the right to be forgotten, and stating, simply, that it is unlikely to affect the Library’s practices, but they are keeping a watching brief.</p> \n<p>At present, press outlets like the BBC have lavished praise on Google for notifying it of delisted articles. This is partially because of a perceived threat to the ongoing availability of notifications, given that the chief body of European regulators have advised that this should be a selective practice only, rather than routine. </p> \n<p>What regulators are concerned about is precisely what the BBC has done - republication, and ready reidentification, of complainants in a way that directly undermines their demand for practical obscurity, not notoriety, on old or irrelevant personal information. But the regulators’ solution of dramatically reducing notification is clearly inadequate. Far better is to make earlier, more robust, more informed, productive and considerate contact between Google and the press.</p> \n<p>As a litmus test of the societal response to how we deal with the digital traces of our lives, the story of the right to be forgotten over the last year has been a rather sorry tale. The BBC, in republishing this list and misjudging even the most basic details, does little to assure that the debate has advanced. It would do better to agitate for a robust and confidential pre-decision procedure with Google to assure that good decisions are made in the public interest. </p> \n<p>And if the BBC is really interested in public policy, then let’s have a deep debate about the public interest itself, about the role of archives, and about information retrieval and sedimentation that is appropriate to our digital present.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/14/dear-google-open-letter-from-80-academics-on-right-to-be-forgotten\">Dear Google: open letter from 80 academics on ‘right to be forgotten’</a></strong><br /></li> \n</ul>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/38371681f77810a5307ab5cbbc2009d3374b52a3/0_0_5760_3455/5760.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3455,"width":5760,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian","altText":"BBC Pacific Quay is BBC Scotland's television and radio studio complex at Pacific Quay, Glasgow, Scotland.

The company my father worked in had relocated its head office in the face of growing labour unrest; the move was part of the general egress of industry from the city.</p> \n<p>We continued to visit Calcutta once, sometimes twice, a year. My mother’s brother lived there with his family in Pratapaditya Road, in the historic neighbourhood of Bhowanipore, South Calcutta. He is a Jadavpur University graduate and German-trained civil engineer. By the time I got to know him as a child, he’d abandoned his job and set out with friends, establishing a factory that made machines in Howrah, Calcutta’s industrial district across the river Hooghly. Given the political turbulence of the 1960s, the business was a long-drawn-out failure. My uncle, however, never wavered from his faith in the Left. </p> \n<p> In 1977, the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/may/23/india-communists-bjp-neoliberalism-left\">Left Front</a> was elected to form the government in the state of West Bengal; it then won eight successive elections until finally being voted out of power in 2011. The tenure of the Left in West Bengal was marked by genuine achievements and plenty of failures. Perhaps one of its legacies was to create a microcosm that was entirely out of tune with the free-market zeitgeist whose vanguard assumed power in other parts of the world soon after the Left came to power in Bengal: one thinks of Margaret Thatcher’s election victory in 1979, and Ronald Reagan’s in 1981. India itself embraced free-market deregulation in 1991. Of course, there’s no reason why Bengal shouldn’t have explored an alternative path on its own terms; it’s just that actual faith in what these terms might be was, by the 80s, lacking.</p> \n<p> I learnt two things from my visits to Calcutta in the 1960s and 70s, and to my uncle’s house in particular. The first was that there was an alternative to the corporate world I inhabited in Bombay. Culture did not have to be anglophone to be exciting or sophisticated. In fact in India at that time, it seemed sophistication and excitement often lay outside the realm of the anglophone. Second, it appeared that culture and learning did not have to be exclusive to privileged, stable or well-to-do lives. In my uncle’s house, the opposite seemed true: the energy I encountered in it as a child was a remnant of a cultural and political force-field that began to come into existence in the city in the 19th century.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>My uncle's house contained an interior narrative whose echoes I'd discover later in other parts of the world</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3acfa6f987a71ea471436cac6beb32ef67964cbf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435746005730/d59ada71-f099-4651-8bf2-9c2d99f8f863-460x301.jpeg\" alt=\"Pratapaditya Road in the historic neighbourhood of Bhowanipore, South Kolkata.\" width=\"460\" height=\"301\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pratapaditya Road in the historic neighbourhood of Bhowanipore, South Kolkata.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sanjoy Ghosh</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> This house was the only piece of property my uncle owned, and it had been gifted to him by his father-in-law. My family came from Sylhet, now in Bangladesh, and they’d lost whatever land or property they might have owned with Partition. This was one of the reasons I never associated the sort of house of my uncle lived in with privilege. Also, Pratapaditya Road had become a slightly disturbed and down-at-heel area by the 1960s. Nevertheless, the house itself contained space and life, and an interior narrative whose echoes I’d discover later in other parts of the world, but never their exact prototype.</p> \n<p>These were the house’s features: a porch on the ground floor; red oxidised stone floors; slatted Venetian or French-style windows painted green; round knockers on doors; horizontal wooden bars to lock doors; an open rooftop terrace; a long first-floor verandah with patterned cast-iron railings; intricately worked cornices; and ventilators the size of an open palm, carved as intricate perforations into walls. (Some houses built in the 1940s also incorporate perky art-deco elements: semi-circular balconies; a long, vertical strip comprising glass panes for the stairwell; porthole-shaped windows; and the famous sunrise motif on grilles and gates.)</p> \n<p> My uncle’s house no longer stands. It came down as part of the property boom that happened in Calcutta in the 1990s, in anticipation of the Left Front government’s resolve to bring industry to Bengal – a belated stirring of ambition arising from a desire not to miss out on the apparent benefits of economic deregulation that were transforming cities like Bombay, Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore. The destruction of these houses would also be a consequence of the house-owner’s inability to maintain property in an economically depressed city.</p> \n<p>Industry never came, partly because of the complex issue of land acquisition as well as the insurmountable populism of West Bengal’s politics. But existing houses and neighbourhoods continued to be destroyed because of the ethos created by “developers” – a euphemism, often, for a new breed of land sharks. This ethos dictated that houses on prime land needed to be bought up and immediately destroyed for the price of the land they stood on. So the houses were never put on the market, and their market value was never determined. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"526ecd60ea764dda82b9f71d464f8a4c7650a7d3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435750733053/20a52442-b89f-47c7-8088-b62bfe44a280-460x304.jpeg\" alt=\"House on Hindustan Park.\" width=\"460\" height=\"304\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hindustan Park: ‘The houses I’m speaking of were built for middle-class Bengali professionals.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sanjoy Ghosh</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Among the principal candidates for buying the new “condos” were non-resident Indians: Bengalis settled abroad, mainly in America. They never thought to purchase these houses to live in, though they would, of course, be open to buying such houses to inhabit in London, Marrakech or Goa. Family-owned houses that could no longer be maintained were, meanwhile, frequently sold to developers by non-resident Indians.</p> \n<p>Soon, the near-simultaneous purchase and destruction of a house seemed like an inevitability. So, paradoxically, did the acquisition of the accoutrements of globalisation: industry and investment didn’t come to Bengal, but the ancillary features of a deregulated economy – shopping malls, new five-star hotels, multiplexes, gated properties – began to adorn Calcutta. </p> \n<p> These days, the prices of new properties here are fuelled mainly by speculation. This means that new housing is hardly a response to demand; it’s an invitation to investors who’d previously have put their money in equity. Advertisements are a reliable integer of the desires of the new well-to-do: in Calcutta (officially “Kolkata” since 2001), adverts for gold jewellery – an attractive form of investment – are ubiquitous. Yet in the last 10 years, I’d hazard a guess that these have been overtaken by adverts for apartments in tower blocks and improbably named (Highland Park, <a href=\"http://www.diamondgroupweb.com/\">Diamond City</a>) gated enclaves. Rival newspapers carry full-page ads for the same construction on their front pages. Until 2013, property seemed a less volatile form of investment than the market.</p> \n<p>But property prices in Calcutta have now reached a plateau, and the only people making money off new flats are developers and estate agents. In fact, they seem to be almost the only people making money in Calcutta at all. <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Kolkatas-super-rich-count-soars/articleshow/46765117.cms\">A newspaper report revealed</a> two months ago that there has been a dramatic and counter-intuitive surge in “dollar multimillionaires” in this city.

Without such resistance, no vestiges of the great urban churning of the last two centuries would remain in the world today – in Europe, Australia, the United States and even Latin America. Calcutta, too, was powerfully and uniquely a part of this urban churning (I say “uniquely” because the neighbourhoods and type of house I’ve described above have echoes, but no counterpart, in any other city – in India or abroad).</p> \n<p>When we speak of Calcutta’s architecture, we usually mean the colonial institutions that the British erected, or the aristocratic mansions of North Calcutta (once called the “Black Town” by the English) built by Bengali landowners. But the houses I’m speaking of were built by anonymous builders for middle-class Bengali professionals: lawyers, doctors, civil servants and professors. They’re to be found throughout the city, from north to south, in Bhowanipore, Sarat Bose Road, Lake Road, Southern Avenue, Hindustan Park, Bakul Bagan, Paddapukur, Kidderpore, Ahiritola and more.</p> \n<p> They all possess the family resemblances I’ve enumerated above, to do with slatted windows, cornices, open rooftops and red floors. What is remarkable, though, is that no two houses are identical: a house with a broad facade might stand next to a thin house, both sharing various characteristics – and there are many other ways in which each house you encounter is a fresh conjuring-up or experiment. This makes for an unprecedented, <em>sui generis</em> variety in a single lane or neighbourhood; a variety I have seen nowhere else (think, in contrast, of the identical Victorian houses on a London street). And the style – which can only be described as Bengali-European – is neither renaissance (hardly any Corinthian pillars, as you might spot in the North Calcutta villas) nor neo-Gothic (as Bombay’s colonial buildings are) nor Indo-Saracenic, which expresses a utopian idea of what a mish-mash of Renaissance, Hindu and Moghul features might be. It’s a style that is, to use <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/amartya-sen\">Amartya Sen</a>’s word, “eccentric” and beautiful, and entirely the Bengali middle class’s. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6f6e48a31489fd2ec8672cfaa223d18520a5fc9d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435749401032/2ae808fa-ca6f-456d-a3cd-d427b1aeea0c-460x298.jpeg\" alt=\"Neighbouring houses on Dover Lane in Kolkata, each differently designed from the next.\" width=\"460\" height=\"298\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neighbouring houses on Dover Lane in Kolkata, each differently designed from the next.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sanjoy Ghosh</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Old” is a misnomer for these buildings: they’re the products of the “new” Calcutta, the Calcutta of modernity and modernism that arose in the 19th century and took on a new identity in the 20th; a Calcutta that evaded, became a counterpoint to, took from, and was far richer than both the British-created city and any idea of the “Black Town”.</p> \n<p>In a way, many of these buildings, which came up from the early 20th-century onwards, testify to why Calcutta continued to be a political, and especially a cultural, hub in India long after the British took away its status as capital city to contain its revolutionary nationalism in 1911 – and even a century after the “Renaissance”, the efflorescence in Bengali culture in the middle of the 19th century. It’s this Calcutta whose buildings are poised to vanish, and whose survival some of us are arguing for. <a href=\"http://www.outlookindia.com/article/an-open-letter-on-saving-calcutta/294298\">Two letters were sent in May</a> to the chief-minister of West Bengal: one signed by 15 people who cut across party lines and persuasions; the other by Amartya Sen, addressed to me and written in support of the project.</p> \n<p>Among the ideas that have been put to the government is that of “transfer of development rights” – which would see a house-owner sell the developer “rights” equivalent to the price of the land on which his or her house stands, which could then be used by the developer to extend constructions to a commensurate value in another location. Whether or not this model will “work” cannot be ascertained unless it’s adopted.</p> \n<p>The letter also refers to the MIT economist Esther Duflo’s observation<strong> </strong>– glaringly obvious to the outsider who knows a bit about Calcutta’s cultural history, but perhaps not so to the resident who is inured to their city – that, properly showcased, these neighbourhoods (Duflo compares them to Prague’s) could make Calcutta a tourist destination, and bring it the revenue it so badly needs. The ensuing danger of gentrification is a real one, but a fine line divides it from genuine cultural reinvention.</p> \n<p> The basic aims of our campaign are these: first, to work towards and arrive at a working solution, however improbable this seems; second, to find new ways of looking at, and discussing what’s important about, these houses and neighbourhoods. Although it would appear that the problem needs to be addressed primarily by the heritage commissions in the city, it’s also clear that “heritage”, as a notion and definition, is part of the problem. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>In Calcutta, 'heritage' means we cease to engage with the architectural individuality and difference of buildings</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12ccf6a31c6578a379db9eb519abd9f40504afb3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435748808513/9c213be4-a281-4c48-a102-3b585072398e-460x320.jpeg\" alt=\"House on a lane off Sarat Bose Road.\" width=\"460\" height=\"320\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">House near Sarat Bose Road: ‘Architectural distinctiveness is often a secondary concern.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sanjoy Ghosh</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In Calcutta, a “heritage” building is a landmark that is important for either being a significant institutional building, or because a famous person frequented it or lived there. The architectural distinctiveness of the building is a secondary concern, or is a pre-ordained, generic feature of the structure: that is, we already <em>know</em> it qualifies as a heritage structure because it adheres to our idea of what a heritage colonial building looks like.<br /></p> \n<p>In Calcutta, “heritage” means we cease to engage with the architectural individuality and difference of buildings and precincts. We don’t periodise, falling back on catch-all terms like “colonial”; or historicise; or describe; or define. Simply put, “heritage” means we don’t see, or think about, buildings. (And yet, even as a rubric to be blindly followed, “heritage” is ignored astonishingly in Calcutta: iconic people’s houses are unmarked and repeatedly destroyed; grade-A “listed” structures are torn down.)</p> \n<p> In July, Mamata Banerjee, the chief-minister of West Bengal, whose government succeeded the Left Front’s in 2011, will make her first trip to London. It will be an intriguing event, as Ms Banerjee’s fascination with the British capital is well-known, and has caused mirth in the past. On assuming power, one of her first startling remarks had to do with her desire to turn Calcutta into London. She clarified later that what she meant was that both cities had grown alongside rivers, and that Calcutta could do much more with its riverfront.</p> \n<p>If she studies her surroundings on this trip, she’ll discover that Calcutta doesn’t actually look very much like London. The main reason has to do with the two cities’ notably different architectural styles: London’s elegant Victorian, Gothic, Georgian and Edwardian buildings (jealously protected from destruction, on the whole, by conservation laws) are shaped by a distinct Puritanism very unlike the slatted, openness-loving, loiterer-friendly Bengali-European style of, say, Bhowanipore. This disjunction is another reminder of why Calcutta’s neighbourhoods can’t be reduced to colonial history, and must be understood in terms of their own peculiar, cross-referencing cosmopolitanism.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/apr/10/writers-building-kolkata-history-cities-50-buildings\">The Writers' Building, Kolkata: a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 13</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> To move on this matter hasn’t been easy, and not only because of governmental inaction and the absence of actual powers where the West Bengal Heritage Commission and the Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s Heritage Committee are concerned. What’s more difficult is people’s inability to recognise the architectural legacy they’ve taken for granted for more than a century, and their mysterious disconnect from the history that produced these neighbourhoods. <br /></p> \n<p>This is the reason I provided the short personal note at the beginning: to explain my outsider’s point of view. It may be why I see these buildings as I do, without that special Bengali nostalgia that expresses itself, generically, in songs by Bangla bands and in recent Bengali films, which occasionally conflate North Calcutta and any one of its decaying mansions with a sentimental idea of the city’s true heritage. There’s a certain quietism, a sweet apathy, in such nostalgia that I feel even more distant from than the moral superiority I’ve had to confront from people who feel this architecture is too minor and remote an issue for intelligent people to be concerned with. </p> \n<p>What’s at stake here is a discussion on urban regeneration – which is connected to, but distinct from, economic revival. For the urban revival of any city, it’s a prerequisite that citizens engage with the spaces, buildings and histories that characterise it, rather than deny those features; that they understand and reuse them. Calcutta, in the last two decades, has largely failed to do this. But the narrative of every great city must contain such episodes of failure, before it begins to look at itself anew.</p> \n<p><em>A petition calling for a plan to save Calcutta’s cosmopolitan architectural inheritance has been <a href=\"https://secure.avaaz.org/en/petition/West_Bengal_CM_Mamata_Banerjee_Kolkata_Mayor_Sovan_Chatterjee_Launch_a_plan_to_save_Calcuttas_cosmopolitan_architectural/\">set up here</a>.

to hit the mainstream, says Renault-Nissan’s head, Carlos Ghosn</p>","byline":"Damian Carrington","body":"<p>Carlos Ghosn, the fast-talking head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, is not keen to be drawn on targets for electric car sales. A 2011 prediction of 1.5m Renault-Nissan electric vehicles by 2016 <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6a843e1a-486d-11e3-a3ef-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3eSkq3rdu\">turned out to be wildly optimistic</a>. The group just passed the 250,000 mark.</p> \n<p>Ghosn was not alone. President <a href=\"http://time.com/money/3677021/obama-electric-cars-gas/\">Barack Obama predicted 1m electric cars in the US</a> by 2015: in January the total was 280,000. Virgin boss Richard Branson, adept as ever at grabbing headlines, said this week that “no new road cars will be petrol driven” within 20 years, calling combustion engines “complicated and antiquated”.</p> \n<p>Unlike Branson, Ghosn does not want to stick his neck out. But as head of the companies which sell more than half the electric cars in the world, what Ghosn thinks about how fast the market will grow matters.</p> \n<p>Transport contributes 23% of global greenhouse gas emissions, so the fundamental driver will be the ambition of the world in tackling climate change, Ghosn told the Guardian in an interview. “When we know exactly where the EU, US, China will be heading in 2030, I can tell you exactly how much electric cars will be needed,” he says, referring to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jun/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-paris-climate-summit-and-un-talks\">a crunch UN summit in Paris in November</a>.</p> \n<p>The reasons for people being relatively slow to buy electric cars are simple, Ghosn says: “If there is a price penalty, they just don’t buy. If there is range anxiety, they just don’t buy.”</p> \n<p>He says Renault-Nissan are working on cutting the cost of the cars, which he says largely comes down to volume, with electric cars currently making up a tiny proportion of the 85m new cars sold globally each year.</p> \n<p>“This is a scale problem,” Ghosn says. “The technology fundamentally has nothing expensive. If you come to the basic physics of an electric car, it is not supposed to be more expensive than a combustion engine.” Government subsidies for cars are also key, he says, as is the building of a network of charging points.</p> \n<p>Ghosn is also president of ACEA, the European automobile manufacturers association, which has been criticised for lobbying to weaken EU fuel efficiency targets. It is a charge he robustly rejects: “If you are worried about the total CO2, there is an obvious solution. It is to stop the old cars. This would be radical, but politically extremely difficult.” But he says emissions limits will also be important in accelerating electric car sales.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jun/24/formula-one-e-uk-race-solar-cars\">Move out Formula One, hello Formula E: UK race first to use solar-charged cars</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ghosn was in London for the finale of the first <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jun/24/formula-one-e-uk-race-solar-cars\">FIA Formula E</a> all-electric race series, in which Renault took the team title and were pipped in the final laps for the drivers’ championship by Nelson Piquet Jr from the China Racing team. Ghosn says the races, on city centre circuits around the world, have helped solve the image problem of electric cars.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7208bfa4cbaf2af141fdf598637ddc4ff6f3a7a4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673695646/927faf2d-e8b0-48aa-881f-9c7cb6fdf797-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"e.dams Renault driver Sebastien Buemi during the Visa London ePrix at Battersea Park, London, June 28, 2015.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">e.dams Renault driver Sebastien Buemi during the Visa London ePrix at Battersea Park, London, 28 June 2015.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Davies/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Ten years ago people thought that electric cars would never make it, they thought electric cars were like a golf cart, something slow, bulky, not very attractive,” he says. “Now they see the [Renault] Zoe, the [Nissan] Leaf, the Teslas etc and they think electric cars can be fun. They see Formula E and see the cars can be very powerful and go very fast. The idea that electric cars are normal cars, which is a big revolution from 10 years ago, has taken place.”</p> \n<p>Ghosn raised the intriguing prospect of Renault, a major player in Formula One for many years, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/28/renault-f1-\">exiting the high-octane race series</a> as it increases its involvement in the nascent Formula E series.</p> \n<p>“The only thing that is certain today is that we are going to be bigger in Formula E,” he says. “We could be big in Formula E and absent in Formula One. Everything is open.” </p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-420842890__\n</div> \n<p>Ghosn also delivered a barely-disguised barb at the F1 Red Bull team boss, Christian Horner, who has criticised the Renault engines it uses. Red Bull won four F1 championships in a row up to 2013, and Ghosn says that in F1 “you have the honour to be forgotten when you win and highlighted when you lose.”</p> \n<p>Renault hope that electric racing will deliver technology benefits to its road cars, and Patrice Ratti, head of Renault Sport and Technology, says they have already learned from Formula E how to use software to manage energy better. “In a few years, we will have three to four times the range [in road cars] and the anxiety will go away,” he says. How long is a “few years”, I ask. “Maybe five to 10,” he says.</p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673460182/df0dbc98-6486-4e0d-b930-0b195e051f99-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Japan's auto Nissan president Carlos Ghosn charges the electric vehicle 'Leaf' during an announcement of the the company's new mid-term environment plan","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673697135/927faf2d-e8b0-48aa-881f-9c7cb6fdf797-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"e.dams Renault driver Sebastien Buemi during the Visa London ePrix at Battersea Park, London, 28 June 2015.

It intersects not just with similar problems faced by black people in other countries, but with a historic shared sense of culture, of hopefulness, of joy even in the fight.</p> \n<p>And that is why it was so wonderful, just a week after <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/commentisfree/2015/jun/18/people-killed-charleston-america-racist-present\">nine black Americans</a> were killed in church, to see a beautiful black woman, Bree Newsome , scale a flagpole and take down the Confederate flag: it was joyous, as was seeing her replicated within hours in <a href=\"http://cdn1.pri.org/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/11698644_829808560444165_7962656601307422015_n%20(1).jpg?itok=VCQQeamS\">art</a>, depicted as <a href=\"http://blackgirllonghair.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CImIbEDWoAAQfRA.png\">Wonder Woman</a>, and even inserted into <a href=\"https://www.colorlines.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_lead_normal/public/images/2015/06/Bree%20Newsome%20Meme%20Screencap.png?itok=SIRGLVAe\">Super Mario Brothers</a> memes.

Being free to fight back, or to publicly feel much except depression, can be a hard thing in blackness.

These young people took over the intersection outside of the CVS drugstore which had been burned the night before, and they filled it with dance.</p> \n<p>It was a scene which could have been visually synonymous with the rioting pain of black people in<a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/theguardian/2013/may/01/la-riots-rodney-king-race\"> Los Angeles</a> in 1992,<a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/world/2012/nov/03/estate-racial-hatred-poisoning-france\"> Paris</a> in 2005, <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/uk/series/reading-the-riots\">London</a> in 2011 or <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/commentisfree/2014/nov/24/ferguson-no-indictment-darren-wilson-protest\">Ferguson</a> last fall.

They refused to give in to the spectacle of death and abjection. They made that intersection, if only for a little while, into a space of black life. And they turned the connective tissue of blackness into one of shared black joy. <br /></p> \n<p>Black culture has the power to do this: to connect us to one another in a higher plane, to let us know we’re not alone in either our sorrow or our joy. Even as black lives are under assault, I’ve been pleased to see the joy of blackness seeping into popular culture, into news, even into museums. I’ve been especially (and surprisingly) pleased to watch this happening in Hollywood – not a place I’d typically look to for affirmation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e0585d5b3ce19421e6ffe9a1f95ad4f65fa9962\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/8e0585d5b3ce19421e6ffe9a1f95ad4f65fa9962/0_21_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chiwetel Ejiofor (L) and John Boyega attend the front row at Burberry Menswear Spring/Summer 2016 show\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chiwetel Ejiofor, left, and John Boyega attend the front row at Burberry Menswear spring/summer 2016 show</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Marvel Comics and Star Wars are two of the biggest entertainment franchises on the planet right now. They are are two of the largest vehicles by which American culture is being exported worldwide.</p> \n<p>And they’re starting to reflect an interplanetary blackness, in content and in creative talent.</p> \n<p>Last November, Marvel<a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvel-casts-chadwick-boseman-as-744491\"> announced</a> Chadwick Boseman will play T’Challa, head of the fictional African country Wakanda, in its upcoming Black Panther franchise. Black Panther featured the<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.slashfilm.com/who-is-the-black-panther-movie/\"> first black superhero</a> in mainstream American comics when it debuted in 1966, and the forthcoming film<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/film/2015/may/13/ava-duvernay-marvel-direct-black-panther-selma\"> could be directed</a> by Selma director Ava DuVernay . (DuVernay recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AVAETC/status/614803521351725056\">tweeted</a>: “Yes. I hope I get the call to direct the motion picture about a black superhero I admire. Her name is<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BreeNewsome\">@BreeNewsome</a>.”) In May, American actor Michael B Jordan was<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2015/05/all_the_superheroes_are_white_all_the_thugs_are_black.html\"> cast</a> as “Human Torch” Johnny Storm in Marvel’s Fantastic Four; and British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor was<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2015/05/all_the_superheroes_are_white_all_the_thugs_are_black.html\"> cast</a> as Baron Mordo in Marvel’s Doctor Strange.</p> \n<p>All three are fantastic actors, and Boseman is already known for expressing black joy, having played Jackie Robinson in<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453562/\"> 42</a> and James Brown in <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/film/2014/aug/01/get-on-up-review-james-brown-biopic\">Get On Up</a>. But seeing Jordan and Ejiofor will be especially fantastic in how they hopefully have fun, given how their work so far is associated mostly with pain.</p> \n<p>Jordan is known for playing Wallace on <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/media/wire\">The Wire</a> and for his his brilliant portrayal of Oscar Grant, the young<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmJukcFzEX4\"> unarmed black man killed by police</a>, in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2334649/\">Fruitvale Station</a>. Many comic book fans didn’t take well to news of his casting. In “Why do all the superheroes have to be white, and the thugs black?”, Kirsten West Savali of the Root<a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2015/05/all_the_superheroes_are_white_all_the_thugs_are_black.html\"> wrote</a> that “some white people have had a deep investment in the ‘white superhero’ since the creation of blond-haired, blue-eyed Jesus”. Jordan himself<a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2015/05/22/michael-b-jordan-fantastic-four-race\"> addressed</a> such criticism directly in his essay “Why I’m torching the color line.” Both critiques were eerily prescient when, shortly thereafter, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/news/sony-hack-peter-parker-spider-man-white-straight-1201524150/\">leaked Sony emails</a> revealed that Spider-Man must always be white and heterosexual on film. (Days later, Marvel revealed that a <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/marvel-inclusion-biracial-spider-man-article-1.2265591\">biracial version</a> of Spider-Man would be joining the Marvel comics universe.)</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/04/fantastic-four-film-makers-respond-to-criticism-of-decision-to-cast-black-actor\">Fantastic Four film-makers respond to criticism of decision to cast black actor</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ejiofor was cast just a few weeks later in Marvel’s Doctor Strange, signaling a cultural victory on several fronts. First, despite the fact that<a href=\"http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/neil-patrick-harris-flubs-chiwetel-ejiofors-name-at-oscars-2015-video-2015222\"> Neil Patrick Harris</a> embarrassingly couldn’t say it at the Oscars, it’s great to see an actor like Ejiofor becoming a movie star without having to <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/culture/2015/apr/11/chiwetel-ejiofor-interview-12-years-a-slave\">change his name</a>. Uzo Aduba , who won an Emmy for playing Crazy Eyes on Orange is the New Black, was<a href=\"http://www.improper.com/features/the-eyes-have-it/\"> told by her Nigerian mother</a>: “If they can learn to say Tchaikovsky and Michelangelo and Dostoyevsky, they can learn to say Uzoamaka.” Born to Nigerian parents, Ejiofor is further proof that there is no need to hide the blackness of one’s name to make it in Hollywood.</p> \n<p>Ejiofor is also known primarily in the United States for his portrayal of Solomon Northup in<a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/film/2014/jan/09/12-years-a-slave-review\"> 12 Years a Slave</a>. The transatlantic creative forces behind making that film a reality included Northup, the author of the source material, a free-born American black man; his portrayal by the British actor Ejiofor; the Oscar-winning performance by Mexican-born Kenyan actor Lupita Nyong’o ; and direction by the black British director Steve McQueen. The international cast and crew reflected how American slavery and British colonialism were cousins in<a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/world/2015/jun/12/rachel-dolezal-race-versus-ethnicity-explainer\"> erasing “ethnicity”</a> and <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/commentisfree/2015/jun/12/rachel-dolezal-delusional-construction-perception-of-race\">forging the creation</a> of both whiteness and blackness, as “race” was constructed across borders.</p> \n<h2>The lighter, beautiful side of blackness</h2> \n<p>But blackness exists beyond slavery, and the civil rights movement of a half century ago depicted in <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/film/2015/feb/20/selma-american-sniper-film-oscars-race-part-two\">Selma</a>. So it will be a delight to see Ejiofor reflect not just Northup’s bondage and his<a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/10/23/what-really-became-of-solomon-northup-after-his-12-years-a-slave/\"> uncertain fate</a>, but something as light as a Marvel comic flick. It would also be great to see DuVernay, who helmed the international cast and crew of Selma, have fun with Black Panther.</p> \n<p>It’s not that black actors don’t do lighter fare or comedy, of course. There is no shortage of comedic talent like Chris Rock, who is able to bank from the comic to the serious in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/135735/good-hair\">Good Hair</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/top-five\">Top Five</a>. But black actors rarely get to be the one to nab the love interest, or save the world like Luke Skywalker or Superman. This is why my brown skin got all goose-pimply watching the<a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/film/video/2015/apr/16/star-wars-the-force-awakens-video\"> new Star Wars trailer</a>. It was partly because seeing that<a href=\"http://humboldt.craigslist.org/rvs/4986649886.html\"> downed Imperial Star Destroyer</a> and hearing Han Solo say, “Chewie, we’re home” gave me a feeling I never once had while watching<a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/film/2013/aug/19/star-wars-darth-vader-dislikes-recent-trilogy\"> Episodes I, II or III</a>.</p> \n<p>But it was also because I got a sense that John Boyega , in the role of Finn, is going to be a major hero in the movie. Finn looks poised to experience a Jedi awakening, and maybe to serve as a moral compass and guide through the Star Wars universe. To have a black man in such a role would be a beautiful thing. After the first trailer, I had high hopes that Finn would not be a sidekick<a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/film/filmblog/2014/dec/29/star-wars-force-awakens-black-stormtrooper\"> like Lando Calrissian </a>, nor a minstrel caricature like<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jmF900DHKk\"> Jar Jar Binks</a>. And after the second trailer, I feel at one with the Force in hoping we’ll experience the<a href=\"http://www.ign.com/wikis/star-wars/Jakku\"> deserts of Jakku</a> through the eyes of a<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087004/\"> brother from another planet</a>.</p> \n<p>There are many black creative voices who have taken blackness to the stars before. Nichelle Nichols as <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/95b6ki\">Lt Uhura</a> did so a half century ago. The writers <a href=\"http://www.nyrsf.com/racism-and-science-fiction-.html\"> Samuel Delany </a> and<a href=\"http://octaviabutler.org/\"> Octavia Butler </a> have been elevating our thoughts with a black consciousness to the realms of heavens for decades. The Afrofuturists have been <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/jul/24/space-is-the-place-flying-lotus-janelle-monae-afrofuturism\">dreaming of an afrocentric future in space </a> – through music, literature, art and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djBKQNVj5Cc\">film</a> – for years. But in 2015, Star Wars and Marvel have the power to touch nearly every child with access to a screen across the globe. Finn’s interplanetary blackness has the power to inspire kids to think that blackness has a role in imagining a world beyond this wretched planet. It’s a message black kids, who are often not allowed to <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/06/09/editorial-cartoon-black-kids-swimming-pool/HRAMR8hG7s8JAPDg57tujP/story.html\">swim</a> or play or just be kids, need to hear. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a1b4a20a3d47b5b916c52efb98c020e6ac0ec01\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/8a1b4a20a3d47b5b916c52efb98c020e6ac0ec01/0_15_2343_1408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trevor Noah\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trevor Noah takes over from Jon Stewart at the helm of The Daily Show in August.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Exploring blackness through sci-fi or fantasy is a lot more plausible for Hollywood than doing so through comedy. Humor notoriously gets lost in translation. So an arguably even more radical form of transnational blackness may occur when Trevor Noah takes over The Daily Show.</p> \n<p>The Daily Show is an inherently American institution. Like the<a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/diversity_report/\"> majority of the news broadcasts</a> it parodies, it has been presented by white men since it began in 1999. (Lester Holt only just became the the first solo black anchor of a nightly network news broadcast <a href=\"http://www.theroot.com/blogs/journalisms/2015/06/lester_holt_1st_black_solo_network_anchor_of_a_weekday_nightly_news_show.html\">last month</a>, after Brian Williams lost the job for lying.) It delivers a daily dose of fake news about the absurdity of American politics to its American audience. Its authority is not just in satire; for<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/22/time-magazine-poll-jon-st_n_242933.html\"> a long time</a>, its host has been<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/10/jon-stewart-more-trusted-msnbc-poll_n_5479859.html\"> a more trusted news source</a> than “real” news outlets. In replacing Stewart with Noah, Comedy Central not only doubled down on having black hosts, after<a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/16/larry-wilmore-promises-politics-comedy-virality-late-night-slot\"> replacing Stephen Colbert</a> with the<a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/20/larry-wilmore-the-colber-report-talk-show-revolutionary\"> understated and hilarious Larry Wilmore </a>. They picked a mixed-race South African of black, Jewish and European roots, whose parents’ interracial marriage under apartheid (like<a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/commentisfree/2015/jun/26/gay-marriage-lgbt-rights-equality-fight\"> my parents’ in Nebraska</a>) was illegal when they wed.</p> \n<p>This is a revolutionary moment for international blackness in mass media. In his <a href=\"http://time.com/3763174/trevor-noah-daily-show-clips/\">handful of Daily Show appearances</a>, Noah has used humor to create new, uncomfortable and exciting ways to think about South African and American blackness, as well as why 2,000 Nigerians killed by Boko Haram are considered less newsworthy than the dozen French people killed in the Charlie Hebdo attacks. As fantastic as it is when <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/world/2015/jun/19/daily-shows-jon-stewart-on-charleston-shooting-this-was-a-terrorist-attack\">Jon Stewart waxes philosophical about a tragedy like Charleston</a>, it will be something else entirely to have Noah do the same.</p> \n<p>Stewart is often described as a hero of the American left. Will Noah emerge as the same? Only time can tell. Noah has already been accused of being sexist and antisemitic for <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/trevor-noah-twitter-tweets.html\">controversial jokes on Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/04/07/398035333/watch-jon-stewart-defend-trevor-noah-on-the-daily-show\">Stewart himself admits</a> Noah will have to earn his audience’s trust. But just as Disney is banking that Boyega can connect to many races across borders, Comedy Central is trusting that Noah has the ability to become a hero, and that his international blackness can be a lens to critique both the United States and the world at large. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88e821f3447b5083a33bfc711969bc22bfe11da4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435762842982/40eb57b9-d1ec-4e0d-bc9b-43f999345470-460x343.jpeg\" alt=\"Kehinde Wiley's artwork\" width=\"460\" height=\"343\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kehinde Wiley’s artwork.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kehinde Wiley</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>International black beauty was obvious in the fine art world in the recent Brooklyn Museum show <a href=\"https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/kehinde_wiley_new_republic/\">Kehinde Wiley: A New Republic</a> (<a href=\"https://www.seattleartmuseum.org/Exhibitions/Details?EventId=29707\">opening</a> at the Seattle Art Museum in February 2016). The American-born Wiley, known primarily for his portraits, depicts black people with a respect and placement in which they are rarely shown. Walking through the Brooklyn Museum on the way to the exhibit, it was no big deal to see white people painted by European masters with reverence and in positions of authority. Viewers are very used to that. But viewers are far more used to seeing black people in a mugshot, being arrested or being <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/us-news/walter-scott-shooting\">killed by police</a> than they are to viewing black people sitting for a portrait. Prior to the Wiley show, two of the most influential art shows I’d experienced seeing were Kara Walker’s <a href=\"http://www.walkerart.org/calendar/2007/kara-walker-my-complement-my-enemy-my-oppress\">2007 retrospective</a> My Complement, My Enemy, My Oppressor, My Love and her <a href=\"http://creativetime.org/projects/karawalker/\">2014 installation</a> A Subtlety, o r the Marvelous Sugar Baby – odes to grotesque sexual and physical violence.</p> \n<p>I viewed the Wiley show with my friend Bertram, a black, out, gay Presbyterian minister. I noticed while we looked at Wiley’s portraits that he keeps a picture of a chiseled, muscular black man on his iPhone screen. “To remind myself of the beauty of black men,” he explained, “which is not a message the world gives me very often.” Wiley, he noted, also gives us a message we don’t get often: one of an international blackness rooted in honor and royalty.</p> \n<p>Seeing so much of Wiley’s work at once was revelatory to me in understanding how programmed my brain is, as much as I’d like to think otherwise, to view blackness primarily through abjection and to view whiteness through dominance. There is nothing unusual about viewing Jacques-Louis David ’s painting <a href=\"http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/napoleon/art-and-design/A-Closer-Look-Jacques-Louis-David\">Bonaparte Crossing the Alps at Grand-Saint-Bernard</a>; from Napoleon to<a href=\"http://snowbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/White-Hores.jpg\"> Ronald Reagan</a>, we are totally inured to seeing a white colonialist on a horse off to conquer some peoples somewhere. But it’s shocking to see Wiley’s<a href=\"http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/169803/Napoleon_Leading_the_Army_over_the_Alps\"> Napoleon Leading the Army Over the Alps</a>, with its black rider on horseback clad in a bandana, cargo fatigues and Timberland boots. It’s transgressive to see a young black man portrayed that way, just as it is to see the King of Pop portrayed in <a href=\"http://www.kehindewiley.com/misc2010/Equestrian_Portrait_MJ.html\">Equestrian Portrait of King Philip II (Michael Jackson)</a> replete with pink cherubs to watch over him; to see the chiseled form of a black man in the pose of a white Jesus in<a href=\"http://www.kehindewiley.com/down/Sleep.html\"> Sleep</a>; to see a black man in a vest and a halo cast in stained glass in Wiley’s <a href=\"https://itsnewstoyou.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/saint-amelie.jpg\">Saint Amelie</a>.</p> \n<p>Fights I get into with people about the the harm young black children endure, from Trayvon Martin to Mike Brown to the kids at the McKinney pool party, have usually centered on one argument: if the black people were just more meek in the face of authority, they would have been fine. The murder of nine black worshippers in a church ought to put an <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/commentisfree/2015/jun/18/people-killed-charleston-america-racist-present\">end to that lie</a>. Still, meekness and depletion are how we tend to tend to see black people represented in art and in life; it’s not by accident <a href=\"https://indypendent.org/2014/06/30/why-i-yelled-kara-walker-exhibit\">Kara Walker’s artwork</a> or the films <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/why-i-wouldnt-see-em-12-years-a-slave-em-with-a-white-person/281883/\">12 Years a Slave</a>, <a href=\"http://newsone.com/431382/opinion-why-white-people-love-precious-and-black-people-hate-it/\">Precious</a> and <a href=\"http://newblackman.blogspot.com/2012/09/bell-hooks-no-love-in-wild.html\">Beasts of the Southern Wild</a> are so popular.</p> \n<p>Wiley’s busts of black faces, like<a href=\"http://blogs.artinfo.com/lacmonfire/2014/09/23/a-houdon-in-a-hoodie/\"> Houdon Paul-Louis </a> (with full lips and wearing a hoodie) or<a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/kehinde-wiley-likunt-daniel-ailin-the-world-stage-israel-1\"> Likunt Daniel Ailin </a> (with a pick in his hair), make you stop and think about how rare and revolutionary it is to see a black face standing unabashedly proud without any weakness.</p> \n<p>Wiley’s series<a href=\"http://www.kehindewiley.com/Kalkidan_Mashasha.html\"> The World Stage</a> connects blackness from<a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/kehinde-wiley/abed-al-ashe-and-chaled-el-awari-the-world-stage-a-xU4szPxnGY9k7UoGQy4UwA2\"> Israel and Palestine</a> to <a href=\"http://www.kehindewiley.com/jamaica_pages/Naomi_and_her_Daughters.html\">Jamaica</a> to<a href=\"http://www.kehindewiley.com/The_White_Slave.html\"> India</a> to<a href=\"http://www.kehindewiley.com/brazil/Jonaton_Schimitt_Barcellos.html\"> Brazil</a> and beyond. The subjects are positioned not within scenes of violence or poverty, but in poses white figures in European art usually occupy – such as the young brown man in<a href=\"http://akkad-design.com/KehindeWiley/Gallery/index_Project_13.html\"> The White Slave</a>. And, though much of his work focuses on men, his recent series an<a href=\"http://www.kehindewiley.com/an_Economy_of_grace/Dacia_Carter.html\"> Economy of Grace</a> features black women in defiant positions. They are not invisible, as black women often are in the art world. There is none of the body shaming which often happens in American visual culture: these women are painted with love and beauty (<a href=\"http://www.kehindewiley.com/an_Economy_of_grace/Mrs_Graham.html\">Mrs Graham</a>), reclining in leisure (<a href=\"http://www.kehindewiley.com/an_Economy_of_grace/Juliette_Recamier.html\">Juliette R&eacute;camier</a>), and giving their faces to the painter with as much pride (<a href=\"http://www.kehindewiley.com/an_Economy_of_grace/Mrs_Waldorf_Astor.html\">Mrs Waldorf Astor</a>), as white women do in portraiture. Yet, white women did not appear in this show – except in the lone instance of the decapitated head of a white woman in<a href=\"http://www.kehindewiley.com/an_Economy_of_grace/Judith_and_Holofernes.html\"> Judith and Holofernes</a>.</p> \n<p>Leaving the Wiley show left me with something I rarely have when I spend a lot of time thinking about black people worldwide: a sense of hope. Politics, except during <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/commentisfree/2015/jun/28/confederate-flag-rainbow-american-pride-obama-amazing-grace\">very rare moments</a>, have ceased to give me much hope, even though I am optimistic about the consciousness-raising which has happened because of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>But when I’ve been most down lately, transnational black culture has stepped in, reminding me that it’s not all about poverty and death in this moment in America. “I am a global citizen,” Bree Newsome <a href=\"http://bluenationreview.com/exclusive-bree-newsome-speaks-for-the-first-time-after-courageous-act-of-civil-disobedience/#ixzz3eZUa6NEM\">wrote</a>, noting that “humanitarianism has no borders”. After she got out of jail, she was effusive with praise about how “the artwork, poems, music and memes are simply beautiful”, while encouraging “everyone to understand the history, recognize the problems of the present and take action to show the world that the status quo is not acceptable”.</p> \n<p>Art and comedy and comics can both bring us joy and help us to challenge the status quo. Black pain is real, and its documentation and expression are important. But blackness also exists worldwide beyond pain: it can be at one with the Force, with the painted subject, with the hero who tears down the flag or the superhero who saves the world.</p> \n<p>It can remind me that “I love my blackness”, as the activist Deray McKesson<a href=\"https://twitter.com/deray/status/609087939050659841\"> often tweets</a> – “and yours”.</p>","section":"Culture","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a5f2354379386c9bfb14be1c4ec5a0fe5851f875/412_409_2118_1269/2118.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1269,"width":2118,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP","altText":"Michael B Jordan on stage at the BET Awards","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/8e0585d5b3ce19421e6ffe9a1f95ad4f65fa9962/0_21_3000_1801/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1801,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chiwetel Ejiofor, left, and John Boyega attend the front row at Burberry Menswear spring/summer 2016 show Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images","credit":"David M Benett/Getty Images","altText":"Chiwetel Ejiofor (L) and John Boyega attend the front row at Burberry Menswear Spring/Summer 2016 show","cleanCaption":"Chiwetel Ejiofor, left, and John Boyega attend the front row at Burberry Menswear spring/summer 2016 show","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/8a1b4a20a3d47b5b916c52efb98c020e6ac0ec01/0_15_2343_1408/2343.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1408,"width":2343,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Trevor Noah takes over from Jon Stewart at the helm of The Daily Show in August.
