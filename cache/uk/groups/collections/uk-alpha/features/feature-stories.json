The first time we did it, we unwittingly joined the cottage industry of people who imitate or portray the <a href=\"#imgrc=7REv3BJg7ao8BM%253A%3BtUSQUjhgFlAKJM%3Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%252F736x%252F1c%252F62%252Fb8%252F1c62b8550e07fe845c291b415e3e552f.jpg%3Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.pinterest.com%252Fpin%252F27162403976767003%252F%3B736%3B952\">love and terror cult</a>. Even though Manson has appeared as a character in everything from B-movie exploitation films – there’s a whole Manson-inspired <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070602709/\">subgenre</a> – to the works of National Book Award winners, via an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXzlZy6lrgs\">opera</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.thalia-theater.de/de/spielplan/repertoire/charles-manson-summer-of-hate/\">German musical</a> and a novelization of <a href=\"http://www.thalia-theater.de/de/spielplan/repertoire/charles-manson-summer-of-hate/\">Columbo</a>, I’m often amazed at the running for best Manson Family impersonators – not only how insurmountable the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQC7LN_KTrY\">Fat White Manson Family</a>’s lead appears to be, but how the competition can be so weak. </p> \n<p>Enter NBC. New crime drama Aquarius joins the imitation game this week like a uniformed cop at a hip happening. David Duchovny plays a square-faced detective whose missing-persons investigation leads to Charles Manson (a straw ascot-wearing Gethin Anthony), who somehow manages to lure young women to join his communal ranch with peaches like, “I pulled her out of the womb of ignorance and into the light of now”. It isn’t glorifying Manson to observe that the <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/charles-manson-the-incredible-story-of-the-most-dangerous-man-alive-19700625\">Most Dangerous Man Alive</a> must have had better lines than that. In episode one, when Anthony fluffs the song Look At Your Game, Girl (as covered by Guns N Roses and the Fat White Manson Family), it’s clear this show’s as good at portraying Manson as Manson is at presenting himself to a parole board. </p> \n<p>If people know anything about the Manson case, it will most likely come from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/law/2014/jun/27/lawyers-defended-toughest-cases-charles-manson-jon-venables-ted-bundy-charles-ng\">state prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi’s best-selling Helter Skelter</a>. Despite taking a criminal justice perspective – Bugliosi’s no stoned slacker and has no time for them either – it’s the most complete account of what actually happened in the Tate/LaBianca houses when members of the Manson Family butchered seven people, supposedly on Manson’s orders, on two consecutive nights, including the pregnant actress Sharon Tate. The 1972 documentary Manson, based on the book, is worth watching for the original Super 8 footage of Spahn Ranch, the girls singing Look At Your Love outside the courthouse and Manson’s soaring oration. In these key documents, Bugliosi famously attested – and this was presented to the court as a motive – that Manson believed he had heard hidden messages in the Beatles’ White Album, telling him that there would be a global race war in which the blacks would win, and his Family would eventually rule the world. <br />“I may have implied on several occasions to several different people that I may have been Jesus Christ, but I haven’t decided yet what I am or who I am,” says Manson in Bugliosi’s book.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2014/jul/10/julian-wasser-my-best-shot-photography-manson-murders\">Julian Wasser's best shot: Roman Polanski at the scene of the Manson family killings, 1969</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Manson was in fact a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/aug/21/manson-life-times-guinn-review\">13-year-old runaway who was sold by his mother for a bottle of vodka</a>, before being beaten, buggered and learning to rape in sadistic correctional facilities where he spent a lot of his youth. This makes the core of the other essential book in the canon, Manson In His Own Words, an “autobiography” co-authored in the 80s by Nuel Emmons during prison visits. Manson believed that after spending most of his life behind bars, he was so unfit for life outside jail that before his release in 1967, he asked to stay in prison but his request was refused. He got out and became a pimp on Hollywood Boulevard before moving to San Francisco, where he started to sleep with the mostly suburban young women from good homes who would become the Manson Family. When he describes what happened at Sharon Tate’s house, the reader should be aware that they’re probably being conned by a master of the art.</p> \n<p>There is no attempt at psychological or even biographical realism in the 1976 TV dramatization Helter Skelter (also based on Bugliosi’s book), which offers nothing to people who’ve seen the documentary with original footage. It’s the same stuff hammed up, and with Manson speeches that no actor has ever delivered with as much menace as Manson himself. Surprisingly the 2004 remake, also called Helter Skelter, boasts the only passable depiction of Charles Manson by an actor, Jeremy Davies. He masters the eyes, the voice and the paranoid preacher’s charisma. In campfire light he could be mistaken for the real thing, but the CSI-style helicopter music defiles it.</p> \n<p>These TV and film adaptations are all a bit “hippie wigs”, then, as Danny in the cult British film Withnail &amp; I describes the summer of love’s death. They imitate the aesthetics but not the spirit. Although you start talking about the spirit in pubs around London and people look wary. You have to have your arguments ready about <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2009/jul/28/phil-spector-charles-manson\">Phil Spector being a convicted murderer too</a>, and a good folk band that looks the part and knows how to play Ra-Hide Away.</p> \n<p>Thomas Pynchon lampoons the idea of Manson as shorthand for the failure of alternative culture in his 2011 novel Inherent Vice. While <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jan/29/inherent-vice-review-paul-thomas-anderson\">Paul Thomas Anderson’s film cuts all but the author’s best riffs on Manson hysteria</a> – a policeman declaring that all groups of three or more are a suspected cult – the novel has a Manson Family gag in pretty much every chapter. It’s also very good at describing, more than anything else in the canon, how you notice that strange moment when a scene starts to go sour; when older, more serious-looking dudes with an “unwillingness to blur out” start appearing at gatherings of carefree youths: “If everything in this dream of pre-revolution was in fact doomed to end and the faithless money-driven world to assert control over all the lives it felt entitled to touch, fondle, and molest, it would be agents like these, dutiful and silent, out doing the shitwork, who’d make it happen.” </p> \n<p>In The White Album, Joan Didion describes the scene starting to go bad and hints at how she wound up in a psychiatric hospital. “In this light all connections were equally meaningful, and equally senseless.” It makes you wonder if Didion hadn’t broken down a year early, would she have joined Manson on the ranch? She describes how later, she shopped for the right kind of dress for Linda Kasabian, the Manson Family informant turned state witness, under the instructions of the tale’s ever-present director Bugliosi, who has been a master – perhaps even surpassing Manson – at controlling the narrative.</p> \n<p>Manson’s prosecutor admitted recently that Charlie has “more supporters and sympathizers now than he ever did”. It doesn’t flatter Bugliosi to hold him partly responsible, seeing as he’s still <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1915134,00.html\">giving interviews</a> and selling books, albeit one-sided and, like the adaptations they sprung, unwilling to consider that Manson’s history of abuse and imprisonment may be as important to the horrors as the song White Rabbit, new-age spiritualism or bell-bottom flares. </p> \n<p>Unlike the prosecutor who seems sure of the meaning he has impressed on the case with the blunt instruments of the law, Didion admits that even though she shares a godchild with the murdered Tate, writing about it “has not yet helped me to see what it means”. For me, it’s still all about The Family Jams album, the songs Look At Your Game, Girl and Garbage Dump – where trash like Aquarius belongs.</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432744933168/95d53df4-4c22-4e9d-82ad-8cea4c09da7e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Bettmann/CORBIS","altText":"Charles Manson at his trial in 1970, Santa Monica, California","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Bettmann/CORBIS"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-27T17:43:39Z","lastModified":"2015-05-27T23:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":108,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["US television","Charles Manson","Culture","US news","Television","David Duchovny","Television & radio","Society","Joan Didion","Books","Documentary","Film","Film adaptations","Music"],"tags":[{"id":"tv-and-radio/us-television","webTitle":"US television"},{"id":"us-news/charles-manson","webTitle":"Charles Manson"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"culture/david-duchovny","webTitle":"David Duchovny"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"books/joan-didion","webTitle":"Joan Didion"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"film/documentary","webTitle":"Documentary"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"film/film-adaptations","webTitle":"Film adaptations"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"}],"section":{"id":"tv-and-radio"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"tv-and-radio"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/may/27/charles-manson-family-pop-culture-aquarius","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/499ht","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/us-news/2015/may/27/charles-manson-family-pop-culture-aquarius","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/27/charles-manson-family-pop-culture-aquarius"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432744933168/95d53df4-4c22-4e9d-82ad-8cea4c09da7e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Charles Manson: still relevant.

They were seized by Ansar Dine, an Islamist group that had recently occupied the village. The couple had two children, but were found to be unmarried. Soon afterwards, they were buried up to their necks and stoned to death.</p> \n<p>Early the next year, director Abderrahmane Sissako began work on a movie about the takeover of a town by jihadis. He planned to shoot in Timbuktu, the desert city in Mali from which <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/may/14/cannes-film-festival-review-timbuktu\">the film</a> would take its title. For months, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2012/dec/05/malian-rebel-groups-agree-ceasefire\">Ansar Dine (Defenders of the Faith in Arabic)</a> had advanced through Mali, seeking to impose sharia law, but by then the French military had intervened. Just before filming began, a checkpoint near the airport was struck by a suicide bomber. The entire production moved across the border into Mauritania.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"82e36ed2b012f62b83cf1739a1d736f029554aec\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432747798964/a71f279b-ab17-4d46-85a2-74481a91f14c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Director Abderrahmane Sissako\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The west isn’t interested in Africa’ … director Abderrahmane Sissako planned to make Timbuktu as a documentary</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bertrand Langlois/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sissako sits drinking mineral water in a London hotel. Outside the door, suited figures are noisily schmoozing. He keeps his voice just loud enough to be heard above them. A neatly self-contained man of 53 with a professorial bearing, Sissako is currently Africa’s most prominent director. Both Mali and Mauritania are important to him: he was born in the second, brought up in the first. (There have also been spells in Paris and Soviet Moscow.) His English is strong enough to understand my questions, but he would rather answer in French. He speaks one sentence at a time, waiting for the translator to catch up before he continues.</p> \n<p>Timbuktu had been planned as a documentary, but he realised it would be impossible when most of the gunmen were still at large. “You can’t make a documentary where people aren’t free to speak. And the risk is that you make a film for the jihadists – because they’re the ones who are going to do the talking.” When we meet, recent reports say they have returned to Mali in force. He half smiles. “They never left.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/may/14/cannes-film-festival-review-timbuktu\">Cannes 2014: Timbuktu review – searing fundamentalist drama</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As is now customary, when the couple in Aguelhok were killed, a video was posted online. Sissako is all too aware the modern jihadi is an eager film-maker. In one scene in Timbuktu, a young recruit is coached through an appearance on camera by his commander, who is as finicky as any auteur. You can see Timbuktu as Sissako’s retort to the propaganda: he offers humanism and grace in answer to the savagery. When sport is banned and footballs are confiscated, a match goes ahead anyway, beautiful and gymnastic – it’s just that the ball is imaginary.</p> \n<p>At first, the jihadis aren’t monsters, but muddled kids and puffed-up buffoons, ordering women who are selling fish to cover their hands, haranguing old men about the length of their trousers. “The most terrible thing about this is that they are people like us. It’s always hard to say. But they are.” Then the film darkens. You can almost sense Sissako raging off-camera. “It’s the only film of my own that makes me cry. I’ve cried several times watching it.”</p> \n<p>Since it premiered at Cannes in 2014, Timbuktu has become a quiet sensation, nominated for an Oscar and winning seven French C&eacute;sars. It was also withdrawn from the African film festival Fespaco amid security concerns and was briefly banned in a Paris suburb following <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/charlie-hebdo-attack\">the Charlie Hebdo murders</a> (the local mayor, who hadn’t seen it, assumed it was pro-jihad). All told, Sissako’s film has probably aroused more interest from the world’s press than the horrors that inspired it. “The media are interested when someone from France or Britain is taken hostage,” he says. “But the townspeople who are hostages, no one’s really interested in.”</p> \n<p>To Sissako, himself a Muslim, the other hostage in Timbuktu is Islam. He says he doesn’t recognise his own faith in Ansar Dine. Their violence “makes Islam into something imaginary”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7034ae9d831f63162dfe9d4fe83440b9a52524fa\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432747951401/557f5c2c-cf79-495f-8be1-7e3827b53a53-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Timbuktu, a film by Abderrahmane Sissako\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Timbuktu</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Timbuktu is the latest film in a career spanning more than 25 years. Since the 90s, Sissako has been a regular on the festival circuit, yet little known beyond the arthouse. In 2007, when he was in Cannes with his film <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2007/feb/23/drama.worldcinema\">Bamako</a>, he complained about the west’s lack of interest in African film. He gives a small shrug. “The west isn’t interested in Africa, full stop.”</p> \n<p>But the west has never been the world. In the 70s and 80s, the Soviet Union fostered relations with much of Saharan Africa. In 1980, the teenage Sissako stayed with his mother in the Mauritanian capital, Nouakchott, and found himself visiting the Russian Cultural Centre. He was drawn there largely by a liking for ping-pong. Later, it was Russian literature. The director of the centre encouraged him to pursue a scholarship. When the chance came to go to Moscow to study at the VGIK – the Soviet state film school that also trained <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/andrei-tarkovsky\">Andrei Tarkovsky</a> – he took it and lived there for 11 years. In 1993, the year he left for Paris, he made a film, October, about the relationship between an African student and his Russian girlfriend.</p> \n<p>His feelings about Moscow are mixed. He remembers feeling faintly patronised: “There was a cliche of Africans as people who come to learn but who aren’t artists.” But the notion of Russia as particularly racist irritates him. “People in the west always like the idea that someone else is racist. It’s true that it’s easier in Russia to run into someone who calls an African a monkey. But in London, you can easily get into a lift with a racist. You just wouldn’t know it, because they’ll smile at you.”In Bamako, Sissako staged a mock trial that debated the role of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in keeping Africa poor. The film was personal: Bamako, the Malian capital, was where Sissako’s father lived, and where he spent most of his childhood, in a house with a well in the yard. He has said there were never fewer than 25 relatives living there. The film was also a fiercely intelligent breakdown of the crises that have beset Africa since colonisation, although new forces, he says, have come into play.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2013/dec/04/songhoy-blues-mali-africa-express\">Songhoy Blues: the lost sound of northern Mali emerges from civil war</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“When Mali was a colony, there was one bridge on the river Niger that goes through Bamako. After independence, the French were supposed to build a second. They never did. In the end, the second bridge was built by Saudi Arabia. The third was built by China. All the sports grounds have been built by the Chinese. The roads are being built by the Chinese. And in the west, they keep telling us, ‘Watch out for the Chinese.’” He mentions a Malian proverb: a drowning man grabs hold of the crocodile. “The west thinks China is a danger to Africa because the west was a danger to Africa. But really it’s a danger to the west.”</p> \n<p>While the west may be indifferent to African movies, the situation is worse in his homeland. “Africa isn’t interested in African films.” Across the continent, he says, governments see no value in culture. In Mali, he says, Timbuktu has yet to be screened, but the problem isn’t the Islamists. “There are no cinemas.”</p> \n<p>Yet recently, after a decade in Moscow and almost two in Paris, Sissako moved back to Mauritania. “Happiness is the ability to choose to go back. But I’m no happier there than I am anywhere else. It’s just different.</p> \n<p>“I was unhappy living in Paris with two children. My set-up is very insecure, because I’m freelance, and Paris isn’t a good place to be insecure. I had to look in my letterbox every day and it was never good.

Don’t you agree?</p>","byline":"Jon Henley","body":"<p>Along with when it will take place and who will be permitted to vote, one of the factors most likely to influence the outcome of the EU membership referendum confirmed in the Queen’s Speech on Wednesday is: what question will it ask?</p> \n<p>Getting the question right in a referendum is important not just because, as any politician involved in last year’s vote on Scottish independence will confirm, it is far easier to campaign for a yes than for a no. It also matters because how a question is worded can sometimes affect the response to it. When the SNP was asked to propose its preferred question for the independence referendum, for example, it came up with: “Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?”</p> \n<p>The Electoral Commission, which says questions must be clear, simple and neutral, and should avoid misleading voters or encouraging them to consider one response more favourably than another, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-20512743\">stripped out the “Do you agree …”</a>, leaving just: “Should Scotland be an independent country?” The original question implied that the person posing it is pro-independence, and expects the answer yes. This plays unfairly to what is known in the jargon as “acquiescence bias”: the tendency of most respondents not to want to challenge an assumption implicit in the question.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/05/economist-explains-31\">Psychologists also believe</a> that the implication of a downside (or possible loss) can produce a stronger negative reaction than the positive response usually triggered by mention of an upside (or eventual gain) – which is partly why “Should Britain leave the European Union?” and “Should Britain stay …” are each, to some extent, biased no matter where you stand on the issue.</p> \n<p>Most experts agree that referendum questions must be easy to understand, unambiguous and to the point. Asking, as the Scottish devolution question did in 1979, “Do you want the provisions of the Scotland Act 1978 to be put into effect?” was maybe not ideal. Nor was the <a href=\"http://independencereferendum.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/1995-quebec-referendum-question.html\">legalistic, jargon-filled 54-word question</a> that the citizens of Quebec were asked to vote on in the second of their independence referendums in 1995. (Like the previous plebiscite in 1980, that one failed, despite including the word “agree” in its proposition.) And the question put to Californians in 2008 on proposition 8, a constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage, confused even some politicians: voting No meant saying yes to same-sex unions, while voting yes meant they would be disallowed.</p> \n<p>For Britain’s in/out EU referendum, due before the end of 2017, the Electoral Commission has already given a hint of the kind of question it would like to see. A private member’s bill introduced last year by the Eurosceptic MP James Wharton included the question: “Do you think the UK should be a member of the European Union?”</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24726054\">The electoral watchdog tested this</a>, found some people didn’t know Britain was already in the EU, and reckoned it might confuse them. It suggested: “Should the UK remain a member of the European Union?”, which was “clear and straightforward”, but still contained “a degree of perceived bias” because it would allow the “in” camp to campaign for a yes.</p> \n<p>The alternative, “most neutral wording” was: “Should the UK remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?” (with “Remain” and “Leave” as the two options on the ballot paper). <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32894220\">According to a BBC report</a> on Wednesday, the government favours the first option – an indication, perhaps, of its preferred outcome.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432746933615/EU-referendum-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"EU membership referendum – watch what you're asked.

When he was a student in China his history textbook dedicated just one sentence to the incident, trivialising it as “political turmoil”. </p> \n<p>“That was the closest we came to achieving democracy,” says Wu. “Many people died and lots of people lost their family, friends and classmates.” </p> \n<p>The letter’s public critique of the government is unusual, more so because it comes from a new generation of Chinese students who are too young to remember the massacre first-hand and have grown up in a ruthless media blackout, with government censors actively scrubbing the Chinese internet clean of any frank discussion about that fateful week in 1989. </p> \n<p>A fraction of China’s 600 million internet users, including Wu, use a VPN to “jump the firewall” and access censored content and global perspectives on blocked sites like Twitter.</p> \n<p>The letter triggered an angry editorial by China’s nationalist paper The Global Times, <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/923528.shtml\">which accused the authors</a> of trying to “tear society apart”, adding: “When China is moving forward, some are trying to drag up history in an attempt to tear apart society.” </p> \n<p>The lead signatory to the letter, Gu Yi, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/26/chinese-students-uk-us-australia-tiananmen-square-letter-china\">called the paper’s response</a> “the best advertisement” the letter could have ever received.</p> \n<p>Last week the Chinese president Xi Jinping <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-05/21/content_20785494.htm\">rallied overseas students</a> to “serve the country” and become a “united front” – a term Wu says was “first applied by Chairman Mao”. “Even in western countries most Chinese students are under the control of Chinese authorities,” he says.</p> \n<p>Not one of the Chinese student groups at any Australian university can be called autonomous and they are all funded by the Chinese embassy, he claims. Student leaders overseas are not elected but installed by the Chinese government, just as they are at home, he says. </p> \n<p>Political action is considered a taboo subject in China, one in which personal risks are high and the rewards low. “I was imprisoned for it – so it is dangerous,” Wu says. He used to work as a lecturer at a training college in Bengbu, a town in the northern Chinese province of Anhui, and says some of his fellow teachers knew nothing of the massacre.</p> \n<p>Wu is in the habit of apologising for his heavy Chinese accent, yet he commands an impressive vocabulary, using words like “apostate” and “jingoist”. He describes one of his tweets – the one eventually used by authorities as evidence to detain him – as doggerel, poetry that is irregular in rhythm and rhyme, often deliberately for burlesque or comic effect.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MerlotN/statuses/50626436272373761\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"zh\" dir=\"ltr\">在中国找不到茉莉花 在中国找不到茉莉花 手上拿着公安抓 一拳一脚就来打 中国人～不是哑巴 却少敢说话 茉莉花呀茉莉花</p>— lebao wu (@MerlotN) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MerlotN/status/50626436272373761\">March 23, 2011</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>In 2011 whispers that the political uprising in Tunisia, known as the Jasmine Revolution, would come to China were blowing like seeds in the wind. While the talk bore no real fruit, the rumours alone were enough to rattle the authorities who came crashing down on anyone suspected of being involved. </p> \n<p>Wu had visited Chinese artist and famous pot-stirrer Ai Wei Wei in his Beijing studio earlier that year. Authorities would later use this fact and cherry pick a few of Wu’s tweets, including one that stated “if you hold jasmine in your hand the police will arrest you”, as evidence he had plans to incite an overthrow of the government – something Wu denies.</p> \n<p>After 107 days of detention, filled with endless hours of interrogation, Wu was released to house arrest. The following year he decided he could no longer live under such conditions and in early 2013 fled to Australia where he was eventually granted refugee status.</p> \n<p>Wu lives a lonely life in Melbourne. At times he is gripped by powerful feelings of homesickness. “Sometimes in my dreams I’m in China,” he says. “After I wake up I must find something, like a flag, to make sure I am in Australia.” He is on medication to treat his depression; he does not know when he will see his family in China again and is concerned for their safety.</p> \n<p>In the south-west Melbourne suburb of Leveton, he keeps his refugee status hidden from his Chinese landlord and flatmate. A previous tenancy application had been rejected after the landlord searched his name and uncovered his history.<br /></p> \n<p>Renting hasn’t been easy without steady work, but he has a part-time job managing a website and every afternoon takes English classes at a language centre for new migrants. </p> \n<p>Right now his goals are modest. “I want to improve my English,” he says. “Then I will apply to go to university and continue my study.”</p> \n<p>He has few Chinese friends. There is a kind of gap between him and other young Chinese people in Australia. “I know some Chinese students in Australia, for example,” he says, “who will tell their teachers and classmates, ‘If you want to keep me in this classroom, you can’t criticise the Chinese political system’.</p> \n<p>“They think if you criticise the party, you criticise China. And if you criticise China, you insult them. In my opinion, that’s very ridiculous.”</p> \n<p>Wu, on the other hand, is taking full advantage of Australia’s relative freedom of expression and has felt “more responsibility to say something about Chinese politics” since his exile. He says on the whole western countries are deluded in thinking the political situation in China is getting better. “On the contrary,” he says, “it’s becoming worse.”<br /></p> \n<p>But he still hopes it will improve. “Not just the Communist regime being overthrown, but many deep-rooted aspects of Chinese culture need to be revolutionised,” he says. “Every culture has its pros and cons. Something wrong cannot be justified simply because it belongs to a culture.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/9a24d34d5e3c932d2d5e1695f47c744bb835dbd8/324_279_2737_1643/2737.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1643,"width":2737,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Wu Lebao","altText":"Wu Lebao, a 31-year-old Chinese refugee living in Melbourne, Australia","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Wu Lebao"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-28T05:01:30Z","lastModified":"2015-05-28T08:23:18Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":29,"contributors":[{"name":"Monica Tan","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/8/1428489426429/Monica-Tan-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/monica-tan"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["China","Tiananmen Square protests 1989","Australia news","Asia Pacific","World news","Protest","Human rights","Australian immigration and asylum"],"tags":[{"id":"world/china","webTitle":"China"},{"id":"world/tiananmen-square-protests-1989","webTitle":"Tiananmen Square protests 1989"},{"id":"australia-news/australia-news","webTitle":"Australia news"},{"id":"world/asia-pacific","webTitle":"Asia Pacific"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/protest","webTitle":"Protest"},{"id":"law/human-rights","webTitle":"Human rights"},{"id":"australia-news/australian-immigration-and-asylum","webTitle":"Australian immigration and asylum"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Monica Tan","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/monica-tan"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/28/chinas-lonely-voice-of-dissent-refuses-to-forget-the-victims-of-tiananmen-square","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/499vj","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/may/28/chinas-lonely-voice-of-dissent-refuses-to-forget-the-victims-of-tiananmen-square","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/28/chinas-lonely-voice-of-dissent-refuses-to-forget-the-victims-of-tiananmen-square"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/9a24d34d5e3c932d2d5e1695f47c744bb835dbd8/0_0_3264_2004/3264.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2004,"width":3264,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Wu Lebao, who lives in Melbourne, has signed a letter condemning the secrecy around the Tiananmen protests.

We will eat water lily bulbs and fish, and listen to the Tswororo, the traditional melody of our compatriot Ba’Yei.” <br /></p> \n<p>The Ba’Yei are the traditional people of the Delta, who have long used dugout canoes – known as mokoros – to survive in the watery landscape. The team will be travelling on these mokoros – far more flexible than motorboats – propelled by Ba’Yei expedition members.</p> \n<p>The journey will result in a feature story in National Geographic, a documentary and a book. But, most of all, the team hopes their efforts will push policymakers to protect the Okavango’s source waters in Angola, which Boyes called “a landscape unseen by science and last explored by non-military personnel almost 100 years ago.”</p> \n<p><strong>The kinda famous Okavango Delta</strong></p> \n<p>Although well-known to researchers, conservationists and even some intrepid tourists, the Okavango Delta does not have the same international profile as many other African wildernesses, such as the Serengeti and the Congo. Still, Kydd said the Okavango Delta is arguably the continent’s most pristine wildlife area. </p> \n<p>“There is no wilder place on Earth: this is the Africa of a hundred thousand years ago.”</p> \n<p>Elephants illustrate this point. The team estimates that the Delta is home to around half of the continent’s elephants. Indeed, a <a href=\"http://zambezitraveller.com/chobe/great-elephant-census\">recent survey</a> by the Great Elephant Census counted 129,000 elephants in northern Botswana. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6c3859bd5947bec2385087cdeb3ea9b269e9f3a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432742024456/090bccc2-b7fe-4a44-a8de-e6b3d3702179-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Elephant in the Okavango Delta, one of the great strongholds for the species.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elephant in the Okavango Delta, one of the great strongholds for the species.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Kydd/Into the Okavango</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Moreover, compared to most regions of the continent, elephants are relatively safe in the Okavango. The most recent census found no evidence of poaching. Researchers also believe that more elephants are moving into the Delta from neighbouring countries. These are psychologically-scarred immigrants fleeing poaching hotspots. </p> \n<p>The landscape is also home to key predators like cheetah, African wild dog, leopard and lions – many of which have vanished or crashed in other protected areas. The Delta is also the global stronghold for the red lechwe, a water-loving antelope.</p> \n<p>Rhinos are even making a comeback here, after nearly being wiped out in the last poaching epidemic of the 1980s and 90s. Desperate to save black and white rhinos from the poaching crisis in South Africa, conservationists have begun moving small populations to the Delta for safe-keeping. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3866c09c3333d4ec74801ca44d6d4b589af45c45\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432739550528/54591fdb-0c4d-4e1a-b1f4-2c62205da47e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A herd of African buffalo in the Okavango Delta from the air.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A herd of African buffalo in the Okavango Delta from the air.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tiffany Roufs</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This doesn’t mean that the Okavango Delta is wholly immune to the threats present in other African wilderness, such as habitat fragmentation, deforestation, human-wildlife conflict and poaching. Indeed another <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2011/jun/18/botswana-natural-wonder-brink-of-catastrophe\">survey</a> in 2011 by Mike Chase found that some populations of animals had crashed in the delta, most particularly wildebeest, ostrich, giraffe and several antelope species. However, scientists suspect the largest driver behind these drops was cyclical drought. <br /></p> \n<p>Although still a place of incredible abundance, the Okavango Delta remains somewhat obscure. Its humble place on the world stage is best illustrated by the fact that UNESCO only gave the vast freshwater wilderness World Heritage status last year, listing 999 other sites before getting around to the Delta. </p> \n<p><strong>The other end of the Okavango: bloodied Angola</strong></p> \n<p>However, the Delta’s wildlife riches and political stability couldn’t contrast more sharply with the Angolan highlands. And even as the Okavango Delta may not be as famous as it should be, the Angolan highlands remain wholly obscure. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We hope to rediscover the Angolan lion, wild dogs, elephant, buffalo and cheetah</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Steve Boyes</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Boyes called the Angolan highlands “a landscape preserved in time by war, blood diamonds and instability” where the “deep Kalahari sand” makes vehicle travel so difficult that the “war was fought on foot and using helicopters.” <br /></p> \n<p>The quarter century conflict left an estimated half-million people dead and an additional million displaced. And it’s still killing people today. </p> \n<p>“The people along the [Cuito River]...have to exist with the constant threat of a mine going off,” noted Boyes, whose expedition could only make their way to the river after a route had been cleared by the de-mining NGO, Halo Trust. </p> \n<p>The war also decimated the country’s once great wildlife spectacles. </p> \n<p>“Almost 30 years of civil war and border wars depopulated the landscape, leaving it with one of the world’s highest concentrations of land mines and very few animals,” said Boyes, who noted that the region suffered both from deforestation and poaching during the long, internecine conflict. </p> \n<p> But, he added, there are signs that after more than a decade of peace, wildlife are beginning to return. For example, he said “elephants are slowly coming back [to Angola] as de-mining NGOs and government agencies lift the curtain of mines.”</p> \n<p>As the team makes their way further down river, they may uncover a lost world. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a411349d171b2a4df5df9a3c871666284746543f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/28/1432769138855/0d40dfa2-e459-4203-ab20-153a95747bc2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A destroyed bridge in Angola with a shell beneath it and a boy standing on top. \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A destroyed bridge in Angola with a shell beneath it and a boy standing on top.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Kydd/Into the Okavango</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“We hope to rediscover the Angolan lion, wild dogs, elephant, buffalo and cheetah,” said Boyes. “We are expecting to find new species of fish, dragonflies, reptiles, plants and even birds and mammals. We are looking for the first confirmed sightings of wattled crane and slaty egret [in Angola], as well as the first records of crocodiles breeding along the river system in Angola.”</p> \n<p>He added that the local governor told the group the Cuito River “has the highest density of crocodiles in the world.”</p> \n<p>Already, the team has <a href=\"https://instagram.com/intotheokavango/\">uncovered</a> lion and leopard footprints, heard bushbabies, found evidence of pangolins and listened to a strange story about a mystery antelope that plays dead to avoid predation. <br /></p> \n<p><strong>Conservation goal</strong></p> \n<p>The transnational journey by mokoro is not just about scientific discovery, though. Arguably more important is harnessing the political will, both locally and internationally, to protect the long-neglected Angolan highlands. Not only are the highlands unprotected at the moment, but they are not even included in the UNESCO listing. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiZH4xuDoJM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XiZH4xuDoJM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Steve Boyes talks about the importance of the Okavango Delta. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“If the river upstream of the delta in Angola is not protected, the consequences for the Okavango Delta, its people and wildlife could be catastrophic,” said photographer, James Kydd.<br /></p> \n<p>Boyes added that the team is pushing for a “a multinational World Heritage Site that includes the rivers that sustain the Okavango Delta.”</p> \n<p>If the listing expands to include the Angolan highlands this could also help drive tourism – and international funding – to the forgotten part of the world. </p> \n<p>“We need to act now to save this river before it is too late [from] charcoal production and ill-planned agriculture and mining,” said Boyes, who noted that people were returning to the river now that the war has ended. <br /></p> \n<p>“Economic development is incredibly important, but we need to make sure the Angolan government has all the information they need for decision-making,” he added.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f30ffd5b05cb8e2be3140b2c2f8fd9808d71f3bc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432740800679/19f6afa7-7f52-4c45-822b-b5ad17a745a5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Goitseone Basiamang plays the swororo, a traditional instrument traditional of the Ba'Yei people. \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goitseone Basiamang plays the swororo, a traditional instrument traditional of the Ba’Yei people.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Kydd/Into the Okavango</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Even more than the Okavango Delta is at stake in the highlands, though.

At its inception in 2000, the maternal health goal was also limited to a single target : to reduce the maternal mortality ratio by three-quarters. In 2005, global leaders added an additional target to achieve universal access to reproductive healthcare. Progress on th e latter is measured by the prevalence of contraception, adolescent birth rate, antenatal care coverage and the unmet need for family planning, which refers to the number of women who want but do not have access to contraception.</p> \n<h2>Will the child health goal be met?</h2> \n<p>There has been substantial progress in reducing child mortality over the past 15 years, but not enough to achieve the goal of a reduction by two-thirds. Between 1990 and 2012, the child mortality rate <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/childhealth.shtml\">almost halved</a>, meaning that 6 million fewer children died in 2012 than in 1990. But while child mortality rates ha ve fallen, progress has been too slow. According to <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/2014%20MDG%20report/MDG%202014%20English%20web.pdf\">UN figures</a>, it would take until 2028 to achieve MDG4 globally. Less than one-third of all countries have achieved or are on track to meet the goal by the end of this year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2015/05/mdg-four/child-mortality-scatter/index.html\" data-alt=\"Child mortality\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2015/05/mdg-four/child-mortality-scatter/index.html\">Child mortality</a> \n</figure> \n<h2>What are the leading causes of child death ?</h2> \n<p>Globally, the most dangerous day in a child’s life is the day it is born. Data indicate that <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs363/en/\">preterm birth complications</a> are now the leading cause of under-five deaths, accounting for 17% of all deaths in this age group. Prematurity, which applies to babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy , is a <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs363/en/\">global problem that is increasing</a> in almost all countries with reliable data. The majority of premature babies in high-income countries survive, but a lack of basic and cost-effective care such as breastfeeding support, warmth and treatment for infections means the chance of survival is reduced in low-income countries. Also, women who were undernourished during their own childhood and pregnancy are more likely to deliver babies who are preterm or small at birth.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2015/05/mdg-four/mortality-causes/index.html\" data-alt=\"Child mortality causes\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2015/05/mdg-four/mortality-causes/index.html\">Child mortality causes</a> \n</figure> \n<p> Other leading causes of under- five mortality are pneumonia, diarrhoea and birth asphyxia – a failure to establish breathing at birth. <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/child_health/mortality/mortality_causes_region_text/en/\">Between 2000 and 2012</a>, deaths due to measles fell by 80% and there were also considerable reductions in deaths due to HIV and Aids (-51%), diarrhoea (-50%), pneumonia (-40%) and malaria (-37%). In contrast, relatively little progress was made in reducing the number of deaths due to prematurity, which had a decline of only 14%.</p> \n<h2><strong>Will the maternal health goal be met?</strong></h2> \n<p> The world is likely to fall far short of the targeted 75% reduction in the number of women dying due to complications from pregnancy or childbirth by 2015. The data collected so far is from 1990 to 2013, and shows a 45% drop in the global maternal mortality rate. The World Bank says that, of the eight millennium development goals, the one on maternal health has made the <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/mdgs/maternal_health.html\">least progress</a>. Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest maternal mortality ratio of developing regions, with 510 deaths for every 100,000 live births, followed by southern Asia, Oceania and the Caribbean.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2015/05/mdg-four/maternal-health-scatter/index.html\" data-alt=\"Maternal mortality\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2015/05/mdg-four/maternal-health-scatter/index.html\">Maternal mortality</a> \n</figure> \n<p> The reproductive health target is a similar story of progress achieved at too slow a rate. The number of women in developing countries who saw a skilled birth attendant at least once during their pregnancy <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/2014%20MDG%20report/MDG%202014%20English%20web.pdf\">increased from 65% in 1990 to 83% in 2012</a>, but only half of those women received the recommended four antenatal check-ups. Access to antenatal care differs widely from region to region – 80% of women in south-east Asia and the Caribbean reported at least four antenatal care visits, compared with 50% in sub-Saharan Africa and only 36% in southern Asia.</p> \n<p>Improved access to safe, affordable and effective methods of contraception has led to an increase in its use. In sub-Saharan Africa, the proportion of women between the ages of 15 and 49 who were using contraception doubled between 1990 and 2012, from 13% to 26%. Tthe unmet need for family planning has decreased, but the issue remains problematic. In sub-Saharan Africa in 2012, 25% of women aged 15 to 29 who were married or in a partnership and wanted to avoid or delay pregnancy did not have access to any form of contraception.</p> \n<h2><strong>What still needs to be addressed?</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>While significant progress has been made in tackling child mortality, experts say closer attention must be paid to growing inequalities within countries. In its report, <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/resources/online-library/lottery-birth\">The Lottery of Birth</a>, Save the Children found that country-level statistics on child mortality often masked inequalities between different social and economic groups, including children from the poorest sections of society, those from disadvantaged regions, those from rural areas and those belonging to ethnic minorities.</p> \n<p> Campaigners argue that women’s sexual and reproductive rights must be at the centre of any discussion about maternal and reproductive health. Women’s rights groups say that provision of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/apr/18/sustainable-development-women-sexual-health-rights\">health services is not enough</a> . They argue that girls and women must have the ability to decide if, when and how many children they have, and to have control of the reproductive healthcare services they receive.</p> \n<h2>How do MDG4 and 5 fit into the next set of goals ?</h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-united-nations\">sustainable development goals</a>, set to replace the MDGs next year, will aim to resolve the unfinished business of the maternal and child health MDGs and drive further progress. The three health-related MDGs, which focus on child health, maternal health and diseases, will <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/ng-interactive/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-changing-world-17-steps-interactive\">merge into one sustainable development goal</a> to “ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages”. The 13 proposed targets include an aim to reduce the <a href=\"http://data.unicef.org/maternal-health/maternal-mortality\">global maternity mortality ratio</a> to less than 70 for every 100,000 live births. The goal also includes a target to end all preventable deaths of newborns and under-five children.</p>","section":"Development","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431537168198/d5b06894-af4c-49f7-8f17-b5be7e49c931-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ton Koene/Alamy","altText":"maternity ward at MSF spain hospital in batangafo, central african republic","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ton Koene/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-28T06:30:00Z","lastModified":"2015-05-28T06:33:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":3,"contributors":[{"name":"Carla Kweifio-Okai","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/carla-kweifio-okai"},{"name":"Achilleas Galatsidas","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/achilleas-galatsidas"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Global development","Sustainable development goals","Millennium development goals","Maternal health","Maternal mortality","Infant and child mortality","Health"],"tags":[{"id":"global-development/global-development","webTitle":"Global development"},{"id":"global-development/sustainable-development-goals","webTitle":"Sustainable development goals"},{"id":"global-development/millennium-development-goals","webTitle":"Millennium development goals"},{"id":"global-development/maternal-health","webTitle":"Maternal health"},{"id":"global-development/maternal-mortality","webTitle":"Maternal mortality"},{"id":"global-development/child-mortality","webTitle":"Infant and child mortality"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"}],"section":{"id":"global-development"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"Millennium development goals: the final countdown","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/global-development/series/millennium-development-goals-the-final-countdown"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"global-development"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#005689","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#005689","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#63717a","colourPalette":"analysis"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/may/27/millennium-development-goals-child-mortality-maternal-health-explainer","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48zh4","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/global-development/2015/may/27/millennium-development-goals-child-mortality-maternal-health-explainer","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/may/27/millennium-development-goals-child-mortality-maternal-health-explainer"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431537168198/d5b06894-af4c-49f7-8f17-b5be7e49c931-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Children at a maternity ward at an Médecins Sans Frontières hospital in Batangafo, Central African Republic.

Having emerged an utter wreck from the Korean War in the early 1950s, by the 21st century the country had become a rich, infrastructurally impressive, technologically forward-thinking global economic and cultural force. But South Korea’s unprecedentedly rapid entry into the first world has taken its tolls, and no one event of its dizzying 20th-century period of growth forced as many of its people to face them as the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20070314002032/http://times.hankooki.com/lpage/opinion/200410/kt2004101418510554130.htm\">collapse of the Sampoong Department Store</a>.</p> \n<p>Those who endured the hardships of the Korean War and its aftermath had to welcome whatever prosperity the future could bring, despite the repression of the dictators who oversaw it and the grinding nature of a national life rigorously dedicated to nation-building. But from the 1970s through to the early 1990s, even the most development-minded Korean couldn’t help but suspect that something had gone wrong. An <a href=\"http://www.connectkorea.com/11-notable-south-korean-disasters/\">apartment block falls to the ground, a hotel catches fire, a train station explodes, a bridge collapses</a>: the built environment that had risen so recently and triumphantly around them had already begun to crumble. </p> \n<p>From the beginning, South Korea has understood that development and urbanisation go hand in hand. In fact, it understands that almost too well, resulting in what ranks today as one of the most capital-centric countries in the world. The resources it has devoted to Seoul make the rest of South Korea seem almost like a mere support system for that 24-hour high-rise megalopolis of 25 million people, built over the rubble of the modest Japanese colonial city it had been before the second world war.</p> \n<p>The creation of postwar Seoul involved plenty of rebuilding, but even more new building. The “old” city lies north of the Han River, which runs through Seoul much as the Thames does London. On the Han’s other side, the area known as Gangnam (literally, “south of the river”), made famous in recent years <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH1XGdu-hzQ\">by pop music</a> and television dramas, has grown since the 1970s as a deliberately designed hub of private affluence, corporate investment, and skyline-defining towers – a concrete advertisement for just how far up South Korea has come in the world. </p> \n<p>A former landfill in Gangnam’s especially wealthy district of Seocho made the perfect location for the upscale Sampoong Department Store. Construction on this bright pink symbol of Seoul’s advanced consumer culture began in 1987, the year South Korea became a democracy and the year before the modernised country made its debut on the world stage by hosting the Olympic Games.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2648fea2a3cd99481e2e4093fa9dd1381b603c24\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432657975767/6954fd73-d55f-45c7-9ebe-edecf4cf1bb2-460x303.jpeg\" alt=\"US military troops and South Korean army soldiers look for survivors in the rubble. 502 people died, and almost 1,000 were injured in the collapse.\" width=\"460\" height=\"303\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US and South Korean soldiers look for survivors in the rubble: 502 people died, and almost 1,000 were injured in the collapse.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Choo Youn-Kong/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But it didn’t enter construction as a department store: the original plan called for a large four-storey apartment complex. After work had already begun, owner <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9512/skorea_store/sentencing/index.html\">Lee Joon</a>, in the first of many ill-considered decisions, switched the project from a residential one to a commercial one, a conversion which necessitated the removal of support columns to make room for escalators. When the contractors balked at this, Lee exchanged them for a more obedient in-house crew.</p> \n<p>Using a building of this size entirely as a department store went against zoning regulations, which Lee circumvented by ordering the addition of a skating rink on an originally unplanned-for fifth floor. Again, when the first building company he hired advised against such a structure-compromising modification, he simply sacked them. The firm that did build the fifth floor even went along when he changed his mind once again, turning it into a gallery of restaurants heated by a system of under-floor hot-water pipes, increasing the stress on the already overburdened columns remaining.</p> \n<p>Still, the Sampoong Department Store might stand today if not for the air-conditioning machinery installed on top. When tenants of neighbouring buildings to the east complained about the noise it made, management moved the three units to the west, not by lifting them with cranes, but by dragging them – their combined 45-tonne weight four times what the building was designed to handle – all the way across the roof. This opened up cracks that widened each and every morning the air conditioners clicked on and vibrated to life over the next two years.</p> \n<p>Then came the morning of 29 June 1995. The structure’s visible cracks had widened alarmingly and continued to do so as the day wore on, provoking enough concern to force two executive decisions: first, to switch off the air conditioning, and second, to close the top floor. But Lee refused to evacuate the day’s unusually large and lucrative shopping crowd, and so in the store they remained at 5:52 pm, when the air-conditioning units fell through the roof and the support columns gave way, resulting in the deadliest building collapse since antiquity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34a0d93c422595a9bfb4ec37ca8f0dd4433b7f43\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432658073620/49d5d4bc-4ade-4be9-8263-2bea2406bc50-460x287.jpeg\" alt=\"After the collapse, inspections of many of Seoul’s towers revealed that just one in fifty could qualify as safe.\" width=\"460\" height=\"287\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inspections after the collapse revealed that just one-in-50 of Seoul’s towers were safe.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Jae Hwan/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>More than 500 people died in the Sampoong Department Store – not because of a gas explosion or a North Korean bomb (two early suspicions) – but because of <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/02/18/south-koreas-history-of-building-collapses/\">sheer negligence in construction and maintenance</a> of a building not yet six years old. As the facts emerged, Lee and his associates became the most reviled men in South Korea, not just for their own actions (most damningly, their <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/seoul-department-store-collapses\">selective evacuation of Sampoong’s executives</a> from the building, hours before the collapse) but for the shameful strain they represented in the country’s modern history: their reckless corner-cutting, bribery and irresponsibility, far from isolated tendencies, had become endemic in a society desperate to develop as rapidly as possible, a sensibility which renders the law nothing more than an obstacle to prosperity.</p> \n<p>“Endless Disaster, Disaster, Disaster,” declared one local headline in the wake of the Sampoong collapse. Not only had the public caught on to that pattern, but the investigation of the Sampoong Group and the government officials with which they dealt threw light on a staggering depth and breadth of corruption. Worse still, the thoroughgoing inspection of Seoul’s by then proudly characteristic towers found that one out of seven needed rebuilding, four out of five needed major repairs, and just one in 50 could qualify as safe.</p> \n<p>“People should do their best at their jobs,” said Jeong Gwang-jin, a prominent lawyer who lost three daughters in the Sampoong Department Store. “This accident happened because they didn’t.” The prioritisation of size and quantity over safety and quality demanded by South Korea’s ideology of accelerated nation-building, expressed as a practice of accelerated city-building, visited this resoundingly third-world accident on Seoul’s newly minted upper-middle class.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/apr/23/rana-plaza-factory-collapse-history-cities-50-buildings\">Reliving the Rana Plaza factory collapse: a history of cities in 50 buildings, day 22</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And Lee, born in 1922, would have come of age in a time when Korea was a land that still relied to a great extent on horse carts and thatched roofs, one where nobody considered the prospect of opulent shopping complexes, let alone of the prospect of opulent shopping complexes suddenly falling down. Like most of South Korea’s ruling class in the 1970s and 1980s, Lee found himself in a position of power in a reality almost incomprehensibly different from any he’d known before, with a mandate only to generate wealth, and he made decisions that reflected his circumstances.</p> \n<p>The story offers a lesson to all the cities currently and dramatically expanding in developing countries over the world, most notably China, where the impressive and frightening aspects of South Korea’s development now play out on a larger scale and shorter timeline. It also continues to offer a valuable lesson for South Korea. Despite the insistence that a Sampoong Department Store must never happen again, a similar disaster did indeed happen again: last year, this time at sea rather than in the city. On 16 April 2014, 304 passengers, many of them high school students, died in the sinking of the badly overloaded, procedurally <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/south-korea-ferry-disaster\">unprepared MV Sewol</a>, a tragedy which echoed not just Sampoong but the earlier MV Seohae, another ferry which claimed 292 lives when it went under in 1993.</p> \n<p>On the whole, South Korea has built a formidable city in Seoul, and one that will serve ably as a model for other countries looking to craft world-class urban environments of their own. If a living city is a changing city, Seoul counts as one of the most intensely city-like cities going today. Seoul seems to remain in a constant state of architectural and infrastructural metamorphosis – and not always because pieces have fallen off. But that constant revision of the built environment can also feel like an erasure of history. Visit the site of the Sampoong Department Store, and you’d never guess what happened there almost exactly 20 years ago – a luxury apartment complex now stands in its place.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Which other buildings in the world tell stories about urban history? <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/mar/23/50-buildings-great-stories-urban-history\">Share your own pictures and descriptions with GuardianWitness</a>, on Twitter and Instagram using #hoc50 or let us know suggestions in the comments below</em></li> \n</ul>","section":"Cities","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432657685876/bc1704b0-0413-49f8-a013-91ec540e1e96-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Choo Youn-Kong/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"The remains of the Sampoong Department store on the 29 June 1995 just hours after it collapsed, when air conditioning units on the roof crashed through to the top floor.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Choo Youn-Kong/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432657976400/6954fd73-d55f-45c7-9ebe-edecf4cf1bb2-620x409.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":409,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"US and South Korean soldiers look for survivors in the rubble: 502 people died, and almost 1,000 were injured in the collapse.
