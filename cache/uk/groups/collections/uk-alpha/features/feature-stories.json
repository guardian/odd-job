He fled Paris on a bicycle during the Nazi Occupation and, after a stint in the French Resistance, later found himself by chance serving as an air force photographer in France’s Indo-China war in the early 1950s, travelling through Vietnam and then Cambodia, completely self-taught. (“Take the photographs yourself, it can’t be that difficult,” his army superior had told him.)</p> \n<p>But it was his 10 years as a Paris set-photographer, from 1959 to 1969, on some of the most important films of the French new wave — from Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg ambling up the Champs Elys&eacute;es in <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/jeanlucgodard\">Jean-Luc Godard</a>’s &Agrave; Bout de Souffle (<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2010/jun/24/breathless-godard-film-review\">Breathless</a>) to Jeanne Moreau running over a bridge with her two lovers in <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/francoistruffaut\">Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut</a>’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2008/jun/01/drama.romance\">Jules et Jim</a> — that made Cauchetier’s name worldwide, even if many of his stills languished for decades in boxes in French production offices before Hollywood and London first hailed him as a great uncredited genius.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dac33cfcb917e9ff8ed712532637445f021888a6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433260211846/94be3f76-4409-4319-ba57-200ff57e896e-460x349.jpeg\" alt=\"Director Jean-Luc Godard with Anna Karina filming Une Femme est une femme, 1960.\" width=\"460\" height=\"349\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Director Jean-Luc Godard with Anna Karina filming Une Femme est une femme, 1960.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymond Cauchetier/Courtesy James Hyman Gallery</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When Cauchetier began taking set photographs in the late 1950s, the job was to stand unobtrusively next to the cameraman, take a quick snap at the end of a scene and make yourself scarce. The pictures would be used for continuity and makeup — at best for publicity. Cauchetier broke the rules. He saw himself as a photojournalist, turning his camera on the directors and the very workings of the films. The results — from pictures showing Godard using a wheelchair for a travelling shot to Truffaut giving directions to his actors — were a precious chronicle of one of the most important moments in French cinema. He showed how the auteurs of the new wave, venturing out into realism and location shooting with handheld cameras and natural lighting, were often flying by the seat of their pants. </p> \n<p>Cauchetier liked to capture the conversations and the rows. On Godard’s first feature film, Breathless, he quietly photographed the director’s initial meeting in a cafe with the American star Jean Seberg, who bit her nails nervously when she heard just how Godard intended to work. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Godard would have only a vague idea of what to shoot that day … When Seberg found out, she wanted to go back to Iowa</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“Godard arrived in the morning with only a vague idea of what he would shoot that day,” Cauchetier says. “He had a school exercise book and he’d jot down some dialogue and copy it out on pieces of paper and hand them to the actors. When Seberg found out about this she wanted to go back to Iowa. She was used to Hollywood and its armies of assistants, technicians and studios. The idea of making a film with lines written on bits of paper left her panic-stricken.” </p> \n<p>In one photograph, Godard walks along dictating dialogue as his cameraman is wheeled up the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es hidden inside a post trolley so as not to attract crowds. “You thought, ‘This can’t possibly work.’ But it did,” Cauchetier says. “Godard was an inventor.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7215d9f8dd40cca0f8ab7da3d04621296a198454\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433254762080/0055e288-1816-4c18-9836-3c797c03d4d2-460x358.jpeg\" alt=\"Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg on the Champs-Elys&eacute;es while filming Breathless (A Bout de Souffle), 1959.\" width=\"460\" height=\"358\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg on the Champs-Elys&eacute;es while filming Breathless (A Bout de Souffle), 1959.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymond Cauchetier /James Hyman Gallery</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Intriguingly, many of Cauchetier’s most famous pictures epitomising the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2009/apr/18/nouvelle-vague-film-cinema\">new wave</a>, weren’t actually in the films themselves. One day shooting Breathless on the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es, so many onlookers gathered that Cauchetier couldn’t get close. He asked Belmondo and Seberg to come for a quick walk down a quieter stretch of the avenue away from the crowds, getting his famous shot of them ambling along chatting. “You can see the happiness in it,” he says. The same was true of his classic picture of Seberg kissing Belmondo on the cheek. “That day, to avoid the crowds, Godard shot from up high on the fifth-floor of a building. You could just make out this minuscule couple parting with a chaste kiss in front of a newspaper stand. I went down afterwards and said I wanted to do a close-up of a kiss because it summed up their characters so well. They obliged. It lasted five seconds.”</p> \n<p>Likewise, his astonishing photograph of Belmondo’s naked torso hugging Seberg in a bedroom scene. In the film you only see a close-up of their faces but Cauchetier’s image goes much further. “It’s been a very successful picture because people see the erotic side to it. I was just beside the camera, yet it’s not in the film.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f8bd8debe988d5b6e195330c63bff2511cbc3b3e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433255120243/fe4faf92-a099-41ec-8f93-d7640af8a1fc-355x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Director Francois Truffaut gives a cigarette to an extra dressed as a choirboy during the filming of Jules et Jim, Rouen, 1961.\" width=\"355\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Director Francois Truffaut gives a cigarette to an extra dressed as a choirboy during the filming of Jules et Jim, Rouen, 1961.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymond Cauchetier/courtesy James Hyman Gallery, London</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At other times, with his Rollieflex camera, he only had one shot per take, such as Jeanne Moreau and her lovers running over the bridge in Jules et Jim. “She was dancing, they were running,” he says. As a director Truffaut was “calm and shy”, afraid “of being judged”, he says; Moreau was “divine, extraordinary”.</p> \n<p>Cauchetier had to be unobtrusive because even the boldest screen actor could turn self-conscious at the sight of a stills camera. “No one noticed me, and I congratulated myself on that because once a photo is posed, it’s a failure,” he says. </p> \n<p>Cauchetier’s start in photography was down to chance. Although he once won a Leica camera in a crossword competition aged 18, his mother wouldn’t let him accept it, saying they were too poor to pay for the film to be developed. Later when Henri Cartier-Bresson suggested he work for <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/artanddesign/magnum\">Magnum</a>, he refused to buy the required Leica, sticking with his trusty Rollieflex that had so often survived being dropped in the Mekong river, thus forfeiting his chance to work for the agency.</p> \n<p>As Cauchetier stands in his apartment, he says he owes his whole career to his kitchen window. As an 11-year-old in 1931 he would look out towards the vast <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54tkAKLy_pg\">Paris Colonial Exhibition</a> set up on the edge of the nearby Bois de Vincennes, and gaze in wonder at the <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=paris+colonial+exhibition+1931&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TZ9tVamLJJLQ7QbIoIOwBA&amp;ved=0CDQQsAQ&amp;biw=1679&amp;bih=935#imgrc=SJbybHHr0nMYYM%253A%3BWxB82gkF1lf5mM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fjournals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de%252Findex.php%252Ftranscultural%252Farticle%252FviewFile%252F9083%252F3101%252F9772%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fjournals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de%252Findex.php%252Ftranscultural%252Farticle%252Fview%252F9083%252F3101%3B1024%3B664\">replica of Cambodia’s Angkor Wat temple</a>. </p> \n<p>“A window changed my life,” he says. “Out of that window, I saw Angkor Wat, which made me want to go to Indo-China, and Indo-China made me want to start taking photographs. And so without me really knowing it, that window changed my life.”</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Raymond Cauchetier’s New Wave runs at the <a href=\"http://www.jameshymangallery.com \">James Hyman Gallery</a> London from 17 June-14 August 2015.

aversion therapy was used to ‘treat’ homosexuality exposes a nasty episode in recent British history</p>","byline":"Sarah Wise","body":"<p>Between 1935 and 1974 a range of chemical and electrical experiments were carried out on homosexual men in psychiatric institutions. “Aversion therapy” was intended to alter sexual orientation and was based on the notion that sexual preference was a choice and not innate. “How it was presented to us was that these behaviours were deviancies ... an adoption of a lifestyle that you chose,” recalls one of the 17 retired mental health nurses interviewed by Tommy Dickinson for his book. The interviewees (eight male and nine female, aged from 63 to 98) had administered aversion therapy as instructed by the consultants under whom they worked. Dickinson, a historian of nursing, has written his detailed study as an attempt to access the thoughts and feelings of ordinary men and women who were asked to carry out procedures many of them believed to be barbaric.</p> \n<p>He also interviewed eight men who had undergone the therapy. All but one&nbsp;of these former patients had self-referred, having approached their GPs in the hope that they could be “cured” and made heterosexual. Just one man in Dickinson’s survey had arrived via the alternative route – agreeing to treatment in order to avoid prison, following a conviction for engaging in&nbsp;homosexual activity. (This was the lethal trade-off offered to Alan Turing in 1952 – oestrogen injections or jail.)</p> \n<p>So aversion therapy was not carried out against patients’ wishes, but as Dickinson points out, their choices were hugely compromised. Not one of&nbsp;the GPs cited by the interviewees had suggested anything other than aversion therapy, while having to choose between prison and treatment scarcely qualifies as consent.</p> \n<p>He cites psychiatrist Louis Max as the first to have used the treatment in the UK, in 1935. Subsequently, the removal of all norms during the second world war seemed to promise new possibilities for stepping outside traditional gender identities and sexual behaviour. But “the horrors of peace were many”, as Quentin Crisp would later write; the family and domesticity were revered in the late 1940s and 50s. Aversion therapy was deemed to have had positive results on alcoholics: its use on homosexuals, transvestites and&nbsp;fetishists was now stepped up. Dickinson writes that “homosexual men were seen to be a&nbsp;contagious risk, who undermined postwar social reconstruction by turning their backs on family life”.</p> \n<p>Dickinson is careful not to take the easy (and anachronistic) approach of attacking one era for not sharing the ethics of our own. However, he reveals that by the mid-1950s there were a number of dissenting voices opposing the sexual conservatism of the age: psychiatrist <a href=\"http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/3303\" title=\"\">Dr Walter Lindesay Neustatter</a> pointed out that while we may know what is “customary”, we cannot state what is “normal” with regard to desire. The Church of England itself, as early as 1954, called for the legalisation of sex between consenting males over 21. The Sunday Times sought a public inquiry, since the law on homosexuality was “not in accord with public opinion”. The Wolfenden report of 1957 favoured decriminalisation, but the law in England and Wales remained unchanged until 1967. The following seven years saw the gradual petering out of aversion therapy for homosexuality in the UK.</p> \n<p>The influence of popular and highbrow culture on nurses emerges from the testimonies given to Dickinson. In the 1950s, both tabloid and broadsheet newspapers carried reports of how science was now able to cure the “illness” that was homosexuality. Such journalism allowed some hospital staff to feel that they were being cruel to be kind – that aversion therapy would put an end to the psychic agonies endured by the men who presented themselves for treatment. However, newspaper stories could also help nurses to empathise fully with their patients, as did novels and, later, films. <a href=\"http://www.valancourtbooks.com/the-heart-in-exile-1953.html\" title=\"\">Rodney Garland’s 50s novel <em>The Heart in Exile</em></a>, for example, brought one female nurse “an understanding of the challenges homosexual men face. I never realised how difficult it must have been for them”. Given no ethical guidance in their training or workplace, many of the nurses found that it was culture that helped them establish for themselves why what they were being asked to do was wrong.</p> \n<p>What were they being asked to do? In chemical therapy, an emetic was injected by the nurse, and as nausea took hold, the subject was given pictures of an unclothed or barely clothed male. In some hospitals, the patient was confined to his room and left surrounded by his vomit, his latrine bucket unemptied too, so that the link could be forged in his subconscious between his sexual preference and physical squalor. One&nbsp;variant added torment by tape recorder: a consultant recorded statements of how disgusting the patient and his sexuality were, and the tape was played as the emetic began to take effect. The same consultant asked the nurses to wake the patient every two hours and play another tape, in which the benefits of having a wife or girlfriend were intoned. This could go on for three days and nights.</p> \n<p>With electrical aversive techniques, electrodes were placed on wrists, calves and feet, and shocks administered when a picture of an&nbsp;unclothed male was displayed, or&nbsp;when the subject was&nbsp;asked to fantasise about a male. Alternatively, the entire floor would be covered with&nbsp;an electric grid, with the current passing through the feet when arousal&nbsp;was detected. In both types of&nbsp;treatment, it was thought that sleep&nbsp;deprivation and provoking emotional crises made subjects more&nbsp;easily persuadable.</p> \n<p>Does it even need to be said that none of Dickinson’s interviewees became heterosexual? Many patients were shattered by the process, though. One told Dickinson: “I think three days [of treatment] has destroyed 25 years.”</p> \n<p>The hierarchical nature of hospitals meant that objecting to aversion therapy, or refusing to carry out tasks related to it, would result in dismissal. All that was available to nursing staff was subversion, and one of Dickinson’s female interviewees confessed to only pretending to have given the emetic injections, and instead sitting down to&nbsp;chat to the patient, unseen by other staff. In the late 60s, a female nurse agreed to go on&nbsp;a “date” with a patient (as advised by a consultant), and the pair spent the evening laughing at the&nbsp;whole stupid, sorry story of aversion therapy.</p> \n<p>There are also tales of colleagues who appeared to enjoy the brutality of&nbsp;the procedures (“you could just tell&nbsp;they did”), as well as the paradox of homosexual nurses having to administer aversion therapy. One of&nbsp;the latter stated that there was no contradiction or hypocrisy involved, since “all of these men were willing to try or do anything to make them straight. Although my experience of&nbsp;being gay was very different, I suppose&nbsp;I just thought: ‘I’ve got to help them’.” However, the same nurse also pointed out that objecting would have led to dismissal, and it is this tangle of motivations, self-justification and self-blame that is at the heart of Dickinson’s powerful and moving book.</p> \n<p>It is not a smooth, elegant or jargon-free read, but since ‘<em>Curing Queers’</em> isn’t a book aimed at the general reader, it would probably be unfair to expect it to&nbsp;be so. Dickinson blends the&nbsp;personal testimonies with a helpful synthesis of&nbsp;much recent outstanding work in “queerstory”. He&nbsp;also generously points the reader in the direction of further documentary sources on this peculiarly nasty episode in recent British history.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Sarah Wise’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/inconvenient-people.html\" title=\"\"><em>Inconvenient People</em></a> is published by&nbsp;Vintage. <em>Curing Queers</em> is published by Manchester University Press (&pound;70). <a href=\"http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9780719095887\" title=\"\">manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk</a>.</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433262652453/-The-horrors-of-peace-aft-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘The horrors of peace after the second world war were many’ … Quentin Crisp.

Her death led to a public inquiry and produced major changes in child protection policies in the United Kingdom.</p> \n<p>NRPF families – including those on visas, overstayers and those applying for British citizenship who cannot work or claim benefits – were being abandoned by the Home Office while their status applications were being processed, leaving cash-strapped local authorities struggling to cope with the burden of caring for children whom they had a legal obligation to protect from destitution.<br /></p> \n<p>“There is a real tension between the desire to keep these people out of the welfare state and the legal obligation that falls on local authorities,” said co-author Jonathan Price. “There is a question to be asked about the long-term impact on children of living on subsistence rates that are well below welfare rates.”<br /></p> \n<p>The report, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, found that support from local authorities varied wildly. Families were grateful for any support they received, but subsistence payments “in all cases were well below support for destitute asylum seekers and hard case support rates”, said the report. One authority provided &pound;23.30 per child per week and nothing for parents: for a family with two parents and one child, a little over &pound;1 per person per day.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4eb2496f1de522d357c5933879d7cc25939fca3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433261718132/243e2aab-4887-447b-b479-aec427025f5d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Christiana at her home.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christiana at home in Lancashire.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Families told the study they struggled to feed and clothe their children and pay for transport or school meals, because they did not qualify for free school meals.</p> \n<p>The report, which surveyed 137 children’s services departments in England and Wales as well as 105 voluntary sector organisations, and carried out 92 interviews in eight local authority research sites, found that before receiving help from social services, children were “living highly precarious lives”, with families and particularly mothers sometimes subject to exploitation, prostitution and domestic violence.</p> \n<p>Local authorities had a legal duty to protect children from destitution, but the report warned that there was evidence councils (which have had their <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jan/28/social-care-funding-ridiculous-situation-local-government-association\">central funding cut by 40% overall</a> since 2010, according to the<a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/\"> Local Government Association</a>), were reluctant to assess families referred to them, with many charities arguing they had to threaten with a legal letter before an assessment was carried out.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/healthcare-network/2015/feb/13/day-in-life-specialist-midwife-drug-alcohol-addiction\">Seeing my mum give birth in our living room inspired me to do midwifery</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Jean Demars, housing project lead at Praxis, a charity in Bethnal Green, east London, estimated that 90% of cases they refer are initially knocked back without assessment. According to the report, because of changes to immigration rules there was a 19% increase in the number of NRPF families getting emergency support from local authorities. “To be fair it’s hard for local authorities, they act unlawfully some times and unfairly at others but the Home Office has created a monster and they have been lumped with it,” he said.</p> \n<p>Henry St Clair Miller, team manager of the no recourse to public funds (NRPF) team at Islington council in north London, and manager of the national NRPF network, said authorities were trying to work more closely with the Home Office to resolve cases quicker, but it was a “grey area” that needed more guidance. “It’s a significant problem, primarily from a resource perspective,” he said. “We don’t have sufficient resources to provide accommodation and subsistence. There is a big responsibility placed on social services, but not a statutory clarity about how we should be doing it.”</p> \n<p>A family may receive help in one borough but not get an assessment in another, he added. “There will be people falling through the cracks and getting no support at all [...] If you have a report about safeguarding concerns then surely something needs to be done about it, you can’t just ignore it.”</p> \n<p>Rita Chadha at the Refugee and Migrant Forum of Essex and London (Ramfel) said the charity used to deal with one case a week, but now is dealing with cases daily. “The real issue is getting social services to accept they have a responsibility and admit they have a duty of care to make an assessment, but it is extremely difficult to get past the gatekeepers,” she said.</p> \n<p>While the report noted that “few local authority interviewees considered taking children into care to be a legitimate consideration at any stage. Advocate and parent interviewees said such ‘threats’ are often made.”</p> \n<p>“I cannot think of a single family we have helped who have not been threatened with a phrase like: ‘You have to go back or your children will be taken away,’” said Chadha. “It’s horrendous. We have to tell them they have a right to an assessment, but they are very fearful.”</p> \n<p>The report warns that there are “real concerns” about the long-term impact of poverty on these children, but Chadha fears the consequences may come sooner than that.<br /></p> \n<p>“In my opinion it is only a matter of time until a serious case review like the Victoria Climbi&eacute; case, involving a child with no recourse to public funds, happens,” she says. “We are just waiting for a tragedy to happen.”</p> \n<p>A Home Office spokesperson said: “We welcome those who wish to make a life in the UK with their family, work hard and make a contribution. But family life must not be established here at the taxpayer’s expense.</p> \n<p>“We work closely with local authorities to ensure that immigration decisions in cases receiving local authority support are made as quickly as possible.</p> \n<p>“In exceptional circumstances, or where people granted leave on family grounds show that they would otherwise be destitute, they are granted recourse to public funds.”</p> \n<h2>Case studies: Christiana</h2> \n<p>Christiana* was only 18 when she came to London from Sierra Leone, with the promise from an older woman that she could work for her and get an education at the same time. But when she arrived the reality was very different. The woman brought men to the house, and Christiana was forced to have sex with them or she would be thrown into the street. “It was horrible, I didn’t come here for that – I was so scared I had no option but to do what she said,” she says. One night an old man took her to his house, and she refused to do what he wanted – the next day she was homeless. <br /></p> \n<p>She slept for several weeks on the streets, trying to avoid men until she finally met a friend and went to live with her. A few years later she met a British man, and thought she was in love. “He said for him to help me I needed to get pregnant, so I got pregnant for him but after he would bring women to the house, he said if I said anything he would call the police and get me sent home. I had to move out.” After the birth of her child, she escaped briefly back to the friend, but because she couldn’t support herself the friend refused to help any longer. Finally, she went with her baby and asked social services for help. </p> \n<p>After a day of questioning she was sent to a hostel but no one answered the door. She started to cry, and a passing man said she could stay at his house. “He could have been a killer, he could have killed us both,” she says. Instead he put a roof over her head, and in the morning he and his housemates clubbed together to get her a few pounds to get back to the council offices. <br /></p> \n<p>Eventually, she was given a place in a hostel, and &pound;25 in food vouchers a week. Then the local authority told her she had to move to a small Lancashire town, where she now lives with her two-year-old little girl, receiving &pound;50 a week for food, clothes and travel. <br /></p> \n<p>“They gave me a train ticket, then I got a bus and the man was waiting with the keys. I’m totally alone here, I don’t know anyone. I’m too scared to leave the house,” she says. <br /></p> \n<p>Christiana is now 25. Since they moved over a year ago, they have been visited twice, she says. “You come here to work, to follow your dream – I just want to be given a chance to be a better person for my child,” she says. “I want to help my daughter to be beneficial to society, but Home Office, immigration, social services, they just make it so hard.”</p> \n<h2>Josie</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6757c35524ce0ed46584079cebe8b5d2e6896c66\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433262871087/dc941bd2-7092-4bee-badd-a9e0a3da99be-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Josie says: 'They try and make our life more miserable, they want us to be stressed, depressed and give up.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josie says: ‘They try and make our life more miserable, they want us to be stressed, depressed and give up.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner/Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Josie came from the Carribean in 2010 and worked as a home help in south London. “I just wanted to earn some money to send home and then go back, but when you come here you can save almost nothing, I ended up just surviving,” she says. After falling pregnant by accident, to a British man, she lost her place as a home help and got kicked out of a friend’s house because she was unable to contribute. <br /></p> \n<p>“I left three times to have an abortion, but I just couldn’t do it,” she says. “I didn’t want to go to social services, I heard so many bad stories and I was so scared they would send me back, but I had no choice.” She had her daughter, and was put in a hostel with five families. “It was not a place for a child,” she says. “There was one bathroom, one cooker, mice and roaches everywhere – there were so many people.” <br /></p> \n<p>The Home Office have been processing her application since 2013, and the local authority have since given her a small flat and around &pound;70 a week for food. “Now I have no idea what is going to happen,” she says, beginning to cry. <br /></p> \n<p>“I am grateful for what they have given me but I just want to live and work like a normal person – I don’t want to die like this. They try and make our life more miserable, they want us to be stressed, depressed and give up. I want to contribute. Not all immigrants are the same. But what can I do. I cannot beat the system.”</p> \n<h2>Ashake</h2> \n<p>Ashake, 27, has been living in east London for 17 years, since coming from Nigeria with her sister when she was 15. She had gained papers in order to work, and worked as a cleaner to support her and her son. But when she became sick and had to give up work, they had no recourse to public funds. She stayed with friends, but charity soon ran out. <br /></p> \n<p>With nowhere to go and a seven-year-old child to support, she went to the local authority and was told that, because she had &pound;1,800 in her bank account, which she had saved for a decade to pay Home Offices fees for her ongoing application for leave to remain, they would offer no support. <br /></p> \n<p>With night drawing in, she presented herself at the local police station, where for two nights her and her son slept on the floor. “It was very cold, my son was crying – we are very unhappy,” she says. <br /></p> \n<p>The next day, without being able to wash or change his clothes or eat, her son was unable to go to school. “He is a very well-behaved child, he loves school and he would not stop crying. I just had to take him,” she says. <br /></p> \n<p>The council dealing with her section 17 application for support have still not fully assessed Ashake, although they have provided a room in a shared house, but no financial assistance. She lives thanks to the help and food bank at <a href=\"http://www.ramfel.org.uk/wordpress/\">Ramfel</a>, but she remains hopeful about her future. <br /></p> \n<p>“This government likes people to work, they don’t like giving money out. My hope is that they will see when I am better I want to work, I will clean, I will do care work. I want to work. Yes.”</p> \n<p><em>*Names have been changed to protect identities</em></p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433261154218/093c4b02-7aa3-4db3-9dbb-552f46d296d0-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christopher Thomond for The Gua/Christopher Thomond","altText":"Christiana was moved by the local authority to the town, where she now lives with her two-year-old little girl on £50 a week for food, clothes and travel.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Gua/Christopher Thomond"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433261719543/243e2aab-4887-447b-b479-aec427025f5d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Christiana at home in Lancashire.

Those who know their biblical history will have heard of Patmos, where St John wrote his Book of Revelation. In recent years canny visitors have been heading for lesser-known islands. Karpathos, the third biggest of the chain, has a stunning coastline divided between the beaches and bays of the south, and the rough crags of the north. Smaller Kalymnos, Kasos, Kastellorizo and Symi are less lush than their bigger companions but all have elegant harbours – a legacy of their trading past – and rocky interiors that offer good walking.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/may/27/top-10-active-volcanoes\">Nisyros, built on a still-active volcano</a>, is a different story, and its dramatic, blackened, landscapes will please geology lovers. Astypalea, on its own to the west of the other islands, feels more part of the Cyclades than the Dodecanese. The more benevolent landscape of Leros and the low-key, and little-visited, charms of Tilos bring the count of 12 to an end.</p> \n<p>This is not the end of the Dodecanese, however. The chain includes 14 other, smaller, islands that are inhabited to some degree, as well as the normal countless rocks that boast a few goats and a beach. What binds them all is a common history, mainly due to their location. The coast of western Asia is less than 100 miles away and these strategically located rocks have been fought over for centuries – by the Crusaders, the Ottomans, the British and the Germans, among others. History has long swirled around these fascinating islands.</p> \n<p>There has been recent press coverage reporting that Kos is being overrun by refugees from the Middle East. While it there is an issue, this has been exaggerated by parts of the British media.</p> \n<p><em>Prices are for one week’s accommodation for two in August and include breakfast, unless stated.

Unfortunately, it attracts excursions from nearby Kos and Kalymnos that mar the seclusion. The trick, then, is to stay here as when the boats have gone you have the place almost to yourself. These studios offer simple but perfectly adequate accommodation.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>&pound;150, no breakfast, some studios are self-catering, +30 69803 89276</em></p> \n<p><strong>Where to eat</strong> Sevasti Pikou<br />Most tavernas and cafes here cater to the excursion crowd. This place is more local and serves freshly-caught fish, as well as delicious vine leaves stuffed with rice, meat and tomato.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>+30 22430 29337</em></p> \n<p><strong>Don’t miss</strong><br />The beaches. When the tour boats are around there is some nice hiking to be done, and most of the tourists don’t make it past the most obvious patches of sand. The best of the bunch is perhaps Grafiotissa, with its sandy beach overlooked by a ruined church.</p> \n<h2>Tilos</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7896013dc38695e8eb70c80be469698980ef3c12\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433259865252/89261751-ae06-4ad2-b5ba-60c201154658-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The beach at Tilos.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The beach at Tilos.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Where to stay</strong> Eristos Beach<br />Camping outside of an official campsite in Greece is officially illegal but often tolerated, especially away from other accommodation. This is the case at Ersitos, where a mini village of tents and palm frond-shaded shelters pops up each summer; some visitors have been returning for over 20 years. The beach itself is a kilometre of sand that often has a pinkish tinge from the surrounding reef.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Free</em></p> \n<p><strong>Where to eat</strong> Kali Kardia<br />The nearest bit of civilisation is the inland capital of Tilos, Megalo Horio. There are only two tavernas here, but fortunately both are excellent. The Kali Kardia is a great place to hang out with the locals.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>no phone</em></p> \n<p><strong>Don’t miss</strong><br />If you can tear yourself away from the sand, Megalo Horio is well worth a visit, not least for the food (see above). Unusually for the Dodecanese, this island capital has retained its traditional character. A stiff walk takes you up to the acropolis that towers above the town. Obviously there is a Crusader castle at the top to entice you, as well as great views.</p> \n<h2>Symi Town</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66cc98d916855b214d511a62d2255078453a5712\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433262639336/d9090689-bf49-458a-a068-23064326256a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Symi, Dodecanese, GreeceThe Old Marketshttp://theoldmarkets.compress image\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Old Markets, Symi</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Where to stay</strong> The Old Markets<br />It’s not often you get to stay in a registered national monument. The Old Markets used to be the heart of the spice, silver and sponge trade on Symi. Unfortunately, it was bombed in 1944 but Andrew, from England and Carlo, his Italian partner, have restored it into a gem of a place.

But that visit was unlike any I’d made before.</p> \n<p> It was the height of the measles outbreak earlier this year, when over 50 people caught the disease at the theme park, flying home from vacation before anyone knew what had happened. The news reports were calling it the “Disney Outbreak,” which sounded like a horror movie that would top box office charts. But it also sounded like there’d be no line to ride Space Mountain. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b624cbd01746240961c6111491e07b8fb8f5779f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433251263412/a97089d5-bcfc-4cb4-a4e6-5d5bca6a9331-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Robyn\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robyn Schneider: When I was 16, some of my classmates walked out on an exam review in history when a student under SARS quarantine showed up without a surgical mask. </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> So my friends and I went, joking that it was a good thing we’d had our vaccinations. But as bizarre as it was to visit the near-empty theme park, I’ve always had a strange history with infectious diseases. A history that seems at odds with having grown up in a world of text messaging and online profiles. </p> \n<p> Everyone caught chickenpox when I was a kid. I came down with the illness at age four and our neighbours promptly sent over their kids to catch my chickenpox and “get it over with.” This was just a few years before the vaccine, which our younger siblings received, sparing them.</p> \n<p> When I was 16, some of my classmates walked out on an exam review in history when a student under SARS quarantine showed up without a surgical mask. That year, while we all worried over university examinations, I’d catch glimpses of students wearing surgical masks in the quad. Or, in the case of one friend, wearing a Hello Kitty mask, ironically.</p> \n<p> My freshman year at university, I caught scarlet fever while studying quietly at my desk. The campus nurse couldn’t believe it, but it turned out my roommate had gone home for the weekend and had picked up the germs from her little brother. It sounded ridiculous, like something out of a classic novel, and my English professor laughed when I told him why I had to miss class, thinking I was joking. </p> \n<p> Bird flu struck next. I sat in the library, secretly checking Facebook, where my friends’ statuses announced that they’d caught it. They updated us on their symptoms the same way they shared bar pictures and hilarious quotes from their econ professor. </p> \n<p> Then there was the term when my university offered swine flu vaccinations. They had a limited amount, like concert tickets for Spring Fling. A queue of students snaked through the quad for days, waiting all afternoon for the injection, which was given in front of everyone, in a huge lecture hall. I was a postgraduate in medical ethics at the time, and as I sat in class learning about the form of illness narratives, I couldn’t help but see the parallels. </p> \n<p> I became interested in the idea of the journey as a metaphor, the journey into the land of illness in particular. It went like this: a patient was sent into confinement, where they entered a new world with special rules. Only there, removed from their daily routine, could they break free of its constraints and be cured of what ailed them. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1966b5311e98175ab1e83624b69149ffed9ce14\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433245616346/6e8e51a4-2226-4ec7-b001-473895a5c2ea-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Katniss\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katniss Everdeen (seen here played by Jennifer Lawrence in the movie version of Suzanne Collin’s masterpiece) is plucked from her life by the Capitol, but disease can also get you to new places and spaces.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/LIONSGATE/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> But I was also interested in those who were taken from their everyday lives and found it difficult to return.

And I wondered what it would be like if a similar journey happened to a character with no special powers, no magical destiny, no Capitol to overthrow.</p> \n<p> I didn’t become a doctor after all. Instead, I took a master’s degree and moved to Los Angeles to become a writer. I’d always pictured my stories as coming-of-age anthems about suburban teenagers, but as I wrote, the stories emerged differently. They were about modern teenagers, but they were also about medicine. </p> \n<p> I dismissed this as a side effect of all those years studying physiology, chemistry and genetics. But as I continued writing, my encounters with these strange contagions persisted. As my first novel was about to be published, some of my friends announced on Facebook that they’d caught whooping cough. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4e6c29a42c81ad028c6a2f38e6458f58042d551b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433245283083/1f7062af-0a2b-4b67-acc3-f387a41958a5-276x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Extraordinary means\" width=\"276\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> But it wasn’t until that afternoon at Measles Disney that I realised what was really going on with my writing: there was a strong current of contagion running through my millennial childhood, flowing parallel to the invention of the iPhone and the selfie stick.

Not to minorities, not to anybody else.”</p> \n<p>As for the alleged policy of unopened cans that led to this mishap: Shuttle America who was operating the United Airlines flight 3504 that Ahmad was on doesn’t actually have one that discusses cans being used as potential weapons if unopened.</p> \n<p>“There is no policy difference in serving alcoholic or non-alcoholic canned beverages to passengers,” says Bob Birge, director of corporate communications at Republic Airways Holdings, which owns Shuttle America, “no differentiation in opened or unopened cans, and no policy speculating what may or may not be done with a container.”</p> \n<p>Birge also tells the Guardian they have yet to receive a formal complaint from Ahmad on their end, unlike United Airlines, and cannot further formally address the issue with staff because like beverage services on a flight, “there is a process passengers are expected to follow if they have a complaint or issue they would like addressed”.</p> \n<p>“The extraordinarily unprofessional and humiliating treatment of one of our community members is shockingly disappointing,” the Northwestern University president, Morton Schapiro, said in an official statement released on Monday. </p> \n<p>As Ahmad’s story continues to garner more attention, she has also begun receiving an enormous amount of hate-filled messages and phone calls.</p> \n<p>“Somebody called me and acted like they were a United representative,” Ahmad told the Guardian. Realizing that the caller might not be an actual employee of the airline, Ahmad asked for evidence of his employment. “So he said, ‘What? You don’t believe me? You want to see my dick? You want to suck on my dick?

Because the image of Caitlyn Jenner – winner of an Olympic gold medal as a man named Bruce, and member of the Kardashians, the family pop culture loves to hate – brought no controversy, only applause. Kim Kardashian may have broken the internet, but Caitlyn Jenner did something even more astonishing. She united it.</p> \n<p>Jenner, Annie Leibovitz and Vanity Fair produced an image that won the world over. And this, in a society where acceptance and understanding of transgender issues – while progressing – is still in its infancy. The magazine is not yet on newsstands, and while the interview is <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-cover-annie-leibovitz\">available online for digital subscribers</a>, the overwhelming majority of comment has been based on the cover image. In it, Jenner wears an ivory satin corset, so that her cinched waist, falling just above the coverline (“Call me Caitlyn”) forms the central focus. An hourglass woman’s body in white, in a 1950s cut bodice, surely references Marilyn Monroe – in the minds of Leibovitz and the Vanity Fair art directors, anyway, if not of Jenner. Monroe stands for all-Americanism, for blue-chip Hollywood glamour (as opposed, perhaps, to the modern Kardashian brand of fame), for ultimate femininity and for vulnerability. But while Jenner’s hands are out of shot, behind her back, the photo spotlights the strong muscles of her arms and thighs, reminding us of those Olympic medals, and serving as an antidote to the unguarded, exposed, Monroe-ish appeal of her corsetted waist and coy, expression, half-turned from the camera.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80988e100189594c409add1b8c0890d939c6ac40\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433265989702/8dad914e-d3c9-4f68-b885-4ea9d42c2b1b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lauren Bacall\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There’s something of Lauren Bacall in the image Annie Leibovitz and stylist Jessica Diehl came up with.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex Features</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.glaad.org/reference/transgender\">In guidelines reissued yesterday</a>, the media-monitoring organisation GLAAD warns against “superficial critiques of a transgender person’s femininity or masculinity. Commenting on how well a transgender person conforms to conventional standards of femininity or masculinity is reductive and insulting.” I hope it does not break these guidelines to say that the cover image draws on the iconography of strong American women. Jessica Lange, to whom many have noticed a resemblance, has had a four-decade acting career. (Next spring, Lange will return to Broadway, starring alongside Gabriel Byrne in a revival of the Eugene O’Neill play A Long Day’s Journey Into Night.) Cindy Crawford, of whom Jenner’s Coke-can curls and athletic body are also reminiscent, has sustained a modelling career since the 1980s, and most recently starred as the take-no-prisoners Headmistress in the music video for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcIy9NiNbmo\">Taylor Swift’s Bad Blood</a>. Lena Dunham captured the spirit of the image immediately after its release, when she tweeted: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lenadunham/status/605429578799153152\">“I just want Caitlyn Jenner to take me out</a> and teach me how to drive a stick shift in heels.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456987017__\n</div> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"05597db2ad76c16c17d153d44f3fd096e89cfd30\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433261844087/ef20c657-3032-44e9-b956-b0371a9465c8-300x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The cover of the July issue of Vanity Fair.\" width=\"300\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cover of the July issue of Vanity Fair.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annie Leibovitz/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-cover-style\">The stylist of the shoot, Jessica Diehl,</a> has described Jenner as “all-American in so many ways”. Diehl moodboarded images of Lauren Bacall, and <a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/28/cb/6e/28cb6e7ea941f22e89cf5362e10533ab.jpg\">Rene Russo in The Thomas Crown Affair</a> when the looks were being planned, “and just vintage photographs of old Hollywood stars. A couple of Jackie Kennedys are never wrong.” The state of semi-undress she explains as simple openness. “It was not meant to be risque in any way. It was really meant to show with all honesty and purity, ‘This is what is going on. Here I am.’” Although the ivory corset and Jenner’s demure pose are not a million miles away from <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/865144/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-cover/\">Kim and Kanye’s April 2014 American Vogue cover</a>, for which Kim Kardashian wore a strapless ivory silk Lanvin gown, Diehl sees her shoot as putting deliberate distance between Caitlyn-with-a-C and the K-word. “Coming from a very fashion-forward family, we sort of thought that the nicest thing to do was to focus on style over fashion.”</p> \n<p>But that is only half the story, because the Kardashians are at the heart of what happened on Monday. Caitlyn Jenner, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Caitlyn_Jenner/status/605407919820013568\">launched her Twitter account</a> to coincide with the cover reveal, set a new record by reaching 1 million followers in four hours and three minutes. At the time of writing, she was almost at 2 million, having tweeted just three times. President Obama – whose five-hour record Jenner broke to reach her first million Twitter followers – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/605487361011544065\">responded with public support</a>, telling Jenner “your story matters”. Celebrities from Maria Shriver to Ellen DeGeneres, Lady Gaga to Mia Farrow, flooded the internet with messages of congratulation and welcome. It is Jenner’s connection to the Kardashian family (she was married to matriarch Kris for 14 years until their divorce earlier this year) that has put a transgender woman on the cover of a glossy magazine. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/605430411074912256\">Kim Kardashian’s tweet in support of her former stepfather</a> – “How beautiful! Be happy, be proud, live life YOUR way!” has been retweeted 28,000 times.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6956875dc972c08deb763271ee6ee2796eb61c4c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433262026871/074127fd-836f-4547-a09a-0534de9c15ce-460x359.jpeg\" alt=\"Bruce Jenner with the Kardashian-Jenner clan.\" width=\"460\" height=\"359\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bruce Jenner in 1991, with his then wife Kris and the rest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maureen Donaldson/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Back in February, when discussion and speculation about Jenner’s transgender identity was gathering pace, the novelist Curtis Sittenfeld, author of American Wife, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/csittenfeld/status/563384501015826432\">tweeted this</a>: “What if it turns out all along Kim Kardashian’s butt has been a Trojan horse for greater compassion &amp; acceptance of transgender people?” It was a light-hearted comment, but Sittenfeld’s point is an intriguing one. The Kardashians are, arguably, the most famous family in the world. <a href=\"http://uk.eonline.com/shows/kardashians\">Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a> is now in its 10th series, with viewing figures still over 2 million. The pop-cultural power of this is without precedent. (Imagine what Dallas would have been if the Ewings had been real people, Instagramming their Southfork barbecues.) And yet, despite their money (Kris Jenner’s net worth is estimated at $125m), their fame, their connections in music and fashion (Kim is married to Kanye West; Kendall is best mates with Cara Delevingne), they have been summarily dismissed by the self-appointed keepers of pop-cultural fame as vacuous and irritating. And indeed, to date, Kardashian storylines have been trashily tabloid: sex tapes, 72-day marriages, diets and plastic surgery.</p> \n<p>But in a plot twist that even the Dallas screenwriters could not have dreamed up, the first family of the reality TV generation have, with the Jenner story, become catalysts for progressive social change. Brave and brilliant work for acceptance is being done by those passionate about equality, but the bald reality is that 140 characters by Kim Kardashian have more impact on cultural mores than any number of obscure activists preaching the same thing.</p> \n<p>Less than two years ago, Chelsea Manning, the morning after being sentenced to 35 years in prison, issued a statement requesting that the media <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/aug/22/bradley-manning-woman-chelsea-gender-reassignment\">use her new name and the feminine pronoun</a>. “Bradley Manning says he wants to live as a woman,” reported the Associated Press; almost every major US newspaper continued to use the male pronoun. The contrast with the media acceptance of Jenner could hardly be more marked. And while the reception given to Manning’s announcement reflected public ambivalence about the trial that preceded it, the acceptance of Jenner is also, surely, a direct result of the Kardashians’ fame. The Kardashians, in all their eccentricities – who can forget that Kim’s 14th birthday party was held at Neverland – have become part of the fabric of public life. Kim and her sisters have not only publicly celebrated Caitlyn’s Vanity Fair portfolio, but also talked openly about their support and understanding for their mother, Kris, as she tries to reconcile memories of her marriage with this new reality. A combination of fame and social media reach means that these complex and nuanced issues around a transgender woman and her family are being explored, in real time and on pop-cultural primetime.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/01/caitlyn-jenner-vanity-fair-cover-life-affirming\">Caitlyn Jenner: a life-affirming, provocative and downright fabulous Vanity Fair cover</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One person, naturally, foretold long ago that the Kardashians would one day be understood as a dynasty of great significance. Last year, when Kanye and Kim became the first mixed-race couple to appear on the cover of Vogue, West said the magazine cover was the first moment at which people “understood” his marriage, after “two years of people not understanding an interracial relationship”. The previous year, West said in a radio interview that “a lot of what the Kardashians do, I don’t think they get enough credit for. They prep America to accept interracial relationships.” Last year, Kim Kardashian wrote on her website that “I feel a responsibility as a mother, a public figure, a human being, to do what I can to make sure that not only my child, but all children, don’t have to grow up in a world where they are judged by the colour of their skin, or their gender, or their sexual orientation.”</p> \n<p>Like it or not, the Kardashians have done something positive, progressive and meaningful. The internet era of baring all can be a beautiful thing: prejudice can wither and fall, and acceptance and understanding blossom in its place. And I’m not just talking about Caitlyn Jenner.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-membership\"> \n <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-live-how-to-be-happy-and-transgender-16479241856\">Guardian Live: How to be happy and transgender</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Fashion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433261727250/900397b1-34ae-44a8-b2fc-d3ce84d4ff21-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Annie Leibovitz/AP","altText":"Caitlyn Jenner's cover image for Vanity Fair","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Annie Leibovitz/AP"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433265991098/8dad914e-d3c9-4f68-b885-4ea9d42c2b1b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"There’s something of Lauren Bacall in the image Annie Leibovitz and stylist Jessica Diehl came up with.
