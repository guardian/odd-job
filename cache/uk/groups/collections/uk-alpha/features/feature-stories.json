I started really enjoying it at school, and had fun solving problems at home. One of the most clearly recognisable events in my memory that I can quote as a “spark” of my interest in science was a book I read when I was 16, written by Albert Einstein and Leopold Infeld, The Evolution of Physics. I remember reading the last page, and then sitting there with the book in my hands and having this sort of epiphany. I suddenly knew my future was going to be in science.</p> \n<p><em>What’s your favourite piece of mathematics and why?</em></p> \n<p>The Navier-Stokes equations, because together with conservation of mass and energy they are the governing equations of fluid mechanics. They represent the ultimate ability of the modelling of a natural system through mathematics, and they don’t (yet) have a known closed analytical solution.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c07487892437fac2e46ece988bbc45f2b8676ea\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433864233753/17dfa106-70eb-4ffa-8d57-654b1e29e9d2-370x420.jpeg\" alt=\"boselli\" width=\"370\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Possibly the only model who can explain the trajectory of a baseball.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pani Paul/Models 1</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>When and why did you choose engineering over maths?</em></p> \n<p>I always loved maths for its purity, and physics for its beauty. But I soon realised how innovation in these fields now pushes into metaphysics and it has become something that will be discussed in philosophy books in the future, when all theories will have been confuted. I am very creative and too much “hands on” for this sort of endeavour, and I realised this very soon too. Engineering seemed like the perfect choice for me, since it allowed me to use the maths and physics I loved, to create things that “work in real life”.</p> \n<p>I love engineering, everything manmade that surrounds us required so much thought and knowledge, and studying engineering really made me see things around me in a different light. Also my way of tackling everyday problems and finding solutions has been affected.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456453838__\n</div> \n<p><em>What was the subject of your PhD?</em></p> \n<p>I specialise in computational fluid dynamics, and more specifically as applied to the design of turbo machinery. My PhD research consisted of the modelling of wet steam flow in large turbines, and the invention of new algorithms to automatically modify turbine blades during the simulation of the fluid flow.</p> \n<p><em>How do you make students interested in maths and science?</em></p> \n<p>It’s a relatively easy task, given that I was teaching in an engineering course, most people were already interested in science.

A system that had been largely centralised was devolved to municipalities, teacher training was changed, exams and grades changed, and a voucher system was introduced giving parents the power to choose which school to send their child to. Each child was funded by the state, and if the child chose to go do a different school, the money would follow.</p> \n<p>Since then, almost 800 publicly funded private schools – or free schools – have been set up across Sweden, many of them by companies who are allowed to make a profit. In England, the education secretary, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/forprofit-schools-have-no-place-in-britain-says-tory-education-secretary-nicky-morgan-10257148.html\">Nicky Morgan</a>, has ruled out allowing free schools to be run for profit. This is one of key concerns in the current education debate in Sweden. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/swedish_schools_confidence/giv-21277Eh4dD0jEEpCM/\" data-alt=\"Swedish schools graph\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/swedish_schools_confidence/giv-21277Eh4dD0jEEpCM/\">Swedish schools graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Critics on the left in Sweden blame the voucher system for declining results, saying it has opened the door for schools more interested in making a profit than providing education. Conservatives who support free choice say students have been given too much influence in the classroom, undermining the authority of teachers.</p> \n<p>Fridolin’s line is that it was not one single change that caused the problems, but a combination that helped create a “fragmentary school system” which lacked steering and sowed the seeds for growing inequality.<br /></p> \n<p>“The school system is not a market where everyone has the same possibilities and the same information. It becomes that some parents, the educated parents with strong resources, use the possibility to choose schools.”</p> \n<p>His government’s aim, he says, is to make sure that public money spent in schools stays in schools. But it will not be easy. “It’s a genie-in-the-bottle situation. How do we change a system that has gone on so long in allowing quite big profit in schools?”</p> \n<p>Fridolin has a fight on his hands. On the opposing side is Barbara Bergstr&ouml;m, founder and chair of Internationella Engelska Skolan (IES), one of the largest providers of free schools in Sweden. IES currently educates 20,000 pupils in 30 schools across Sweden. Its success is such that a further 94,000 children are on its waiting lists, some as young as three weeks have their names down for a place.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7dfc45b9c22b9d3b0f48389ed3d9cc06e4939275\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433936966217/48944cd1-6422-42ca-86b1-710189d95c9a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Barbara Bergstr&ouml;m\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbara Bergstr&ouml;m, founder and chair of Internationella Engelska Skolan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arni Torfason/Demotix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We meet in the polished corridors of the first IES school to open, in Enskede, a suburb of Stockholm. It’s almost the end of term and many of the children are going to visit museums around the city. The school is orderly, the pupils courteous – the regime is stricter than in many of Sweden’s state schools – and results are strong, exceeding those of neighbouring municipal schools.</p> \n<p>“This is more organised than my last school,” says one 12-year-old girl. “It was all relaxing on the table there.”</p> \n<p>“In my last school they were really messy,” says her friend. “They didn’t really listen to the teachers. Here it’s more respectful.”</p> \n<p>When Gove visited this school he liked what he saw, and when Bergstr&ouml;m met him in London later he asked her: “How many schools are you going to open in the UK? A hundred, 200?”</p> \n<p>In fact IES has opened just one, IES Breckland, in Brandon, Suffolk, which was placed in special measures by Ofsted but is now making “reasonable progress”. Bergstr&ouml;m, a former science teacher from Buffalo, New York, says there will be no more schools in England for the time being.</p> \n<p>She has had meetings with Fridolin. “There’s an awful lot of rhetoric about for-profit companies. If we were not for profit we would not be where were we are today. There’s no way we would be able to do what we are doing in our schools without the security of a solid financial base.”</p> \n<p>Ulla Hamilton, chief executive of the Swedish Association for Independent Schools, agrees. “The market is working,” she says. The theory is that competition forces flagging schools to up their game. </p> \n<p>She says the decline in Sweden’s schools has nothing to do with the introduction of free choice or the emergence of independent schools. Hamilton quotes research by the IFAU, the Swedish Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy, which suggests that results had started to drop even before the changes. “The free schools are not the cause,” she says.</p> \n<p>But as the postmortem continues into what has gone wrong in Sweden’s education system, the free school movement is faltering. Because of the uncertainty about the future, fewer companies are coming forward to open new schools, banks are afraid to provide loans, and the numbers being approved to set up schools is going down. Meanwhile, waiting lists for places in many of Sweden’s independent schools are going up.</p> \n<p>Like Bergstr&ouml;m, Hamilton is in favour of profit. “You need to be able to make a margin otherwise people will not be interested in setting up,” she says. She adds that the payback for shareholders is tiny compared with public preconceptions.</p> \n<p>There are no profits at Frejaskolan, a state school in Gnesta, just south of Stockholm. There’s a happy, informal atmosphere (uniforms are unheard of in Sweden, in any school) but in the last two years a small number of parents have chosen to take their children out and put them in an independent school 25 miles away.</p> \n<p>“The parents know about the school,” says one of the teachers. “It stands up quite well. There’s good marketing. When they go, we lose the money we get from the state. I’m a parent myself and I’m a little bit worried. </p> \n<p>“My youngest is 10 years old. Will she have teachers who are really qualified? We don’t really know how it will be.”</p> \n<p>The Guardian asked Andreas Schleicher, the OECD’s director for education and skills, what lessons the UK might learn from the Swedish experience. He said: “When establishing school autonomy and choice, the Swedish system did not strengthen oversight and intervention functions (which were traditionally weak in Sweden). So the system had no means to learn from successful schools and scale their success, and it had no means to detect and address educational underperformance.</p> \n<p>“I think the UK needs to watch out for that as well, unless it is willing and able to upscale Ofsted by dimensions. Successful school systems are more than a collection of independent schools.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433943031056/2e61ef3e-b976-4b8f-b334-5e662f9132c6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Arni Torfason/Demotix","altText":"Students at the Swedish free school.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Arni Torfason/Demotix"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433936474512/d0d12650-6288-451b-bde2-f70790f11ae6-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Gustav Fridolin (front left) with his prime minister, Stefan Lofven, and cabinet colleagues in October 2014.

They can represent the last hope for people claiming to have been wrongfully convicted.</p> \n<p>It is exciting to know you could end up changing a client’s life for the better, says Thornton-Reid. “But we have to be realistic – we’re up against many hurdles.”</p> \n<p>Professor Julie Price, director of the university’s innocence project and head of its pro bono unit, says they are not “cheerleaders for applicants”, which they have been called in the past. “If we’ve got strong enough evidence to prove someone’s guilt, then we’ve done our job.”</p> \n<p>Price is grateful that Cardiff – unlike many other universities – recognises the project’s value and allocates it a small budget each year.<br /></p> \n<h2>Gary’s case</h2> \n<p>For Thornton-Reid and the four others on her team, it all started with a letter in November 2013 from Gary (not his real name), a convicted murderer who wanted their help.</p> \n<p>He had served 14 years in prison and was released on tariff in early 2013, which means he will always be subject to <a href=\"http://www.offendersfamilieshelpline.org/index.php/licence-conditions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">licence conditions</a>. But he wants his conviction quashed in the Court of Appeal.<br /></p> \n<p>The victim, Andy (not his real name), was brutally killed after leaving home to pick up his wife from bingo at 9pm on Sunday 11 October 1998.</p> \n<p>His body was found in the street: his throat had been cut and he had sustained several blows to the head. He died from brain damage. The weapon was never recovered. Gary was arrested the next day, and charged with the murder three days later.</p> \n<p>Gary had been having an affair with Andy’s wife Sally (not her real name), which was used against them both at the trial in October 1999. Based on phone records, among other evidence, the prosecution argued that they had planned the attack together. Gary’s defence was that he had gone to bed early that night.</p> \n<p>But a bloodstain was found on the inside of Gary’s car window that matched Andy’s DNA profile. There wasn’t enough of it to be a conclusive match, but it was nevertheless a crucial piece of evidence against him at the trial.<br /></p> \n<p>Gary and Sally were both sentenced to life in prison. He remains baffled by the blood evidence and thinks it must be a result of police malpractice: a mix-up or corruption in the forensic science process or the handling of exhibits.</p> \n<p>For Gary to be able to present his case as one of police malpractice to the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov.uk/about/criminal-cases-review-commission\" rel=\"nofollow\">Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC)</a>, which reviews possible miscarriages of justice, he would need evidence. But the CCRC has re-tested the blood once already, and police malpractice is one of the hardest things to demonstrate with evidence, according to Professor Price. It would require full disclosure of all documents related to the case, which is extremely difficult to achieve.<br /></p> \n<p>“Without a major overhaul in the way appeals are dealt with, wrongful convictions are going to remain uncorrected, with people spending years in prison with little hope of their cases even being considered,” Price says.<br /></p> \n<p>She adds: “As well as being massively underfunded, the CCRC has to second guess how the Court of Appeal would deal with a case, which severely restricts what it can do by way of review.”</p> \n<p>Despite these challenges, Cardiff law students are eager to get involved in the project each year. Chris Au, 20, a final-year student who has been involved for nearly two years, says he has realised that “the criminal justice system isn’t a perfect world of justice”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There’s just a feeling that something’s not right about this case</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Along with Price, much of the casework and day-to-day running of the project is done by Dr Dennis Eady, who is employed specifically for this purpose. Eady has a PhD in miscarriages of justice and over 20 years experience in campaigning.</p> \n<p>“There’s just a feeling that something’s not right about this case,” says Eady, who criticises the CCRC for not investigating all the cases they are given as thoroughly as they <a href=\"http://www.ccrc.gov.uk/about-us/what-we-do/\" rel=\"nofollow\">claim to do </a>.</p> \n<h2>The student team </h2> \n<p>Cardiff’s innocence project is currently working on seven active cases, with around five law students assigned to each. After a term’s worth of training from Eady, the students assigned to Gary’s case began working on it in January 2014.<br /></p> \n<p>They meet weekly for about an hour and assign tasks to complete before the following meeting. They spend up to 10 hours a week on the project, though Price and Eady insist they stop doing so around exams.</p> \n<p>Students are able to consult high calibre experts, as they would do if they were practising lawyers. On the day I attend one of their meetings, they receive feedback – in the form of a 32-page report explained over four hours – from <a href=\"http://www.forensic-access.co.uk/forensic-scientist-nigel-hodge-forensic-biologist.asp#\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nigel Hodge</a>, a forensic scientist who has worked as an expert witness in similar criminal cases.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I’ve developed skills in recognising links between facts, and ​​when things support or contradict each other</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“I’ve become much more efficient at looking through large volumes of material and finding relevant information quickly, while ensuring I’m being thorough and picking up on small details,” says Eleanor Rae, 21, a final-year law student working on Gary’s case.<br /></p> \n<p>“I’ve also developed my skills in recognising links between facts, and when things support or contradict each other,” Rae adds. </p> \n<p>Jessica Etheridge, 21, another final-year law student, says: “It has given me a greater insight into the legal work which goes into a criminal case.”</p> \n<p>And Chris Au, who wants to become a commercial lawyer eventually, says: “You learn to keep things private and be careful when handling certain information.”</p> \n<p>Alice Williams, 20, is a final-year law student and the team secretary, taking the minutes and organising paperwork. She believes that having worked on a real case could be an advantage in the competitive field of legal work because it is “something different that many law undergraduates will not have experienced”. </p> \n<p>Thornton-Reid managed to mention her involvement in the innocence project during a training contract interview. “I think it helped because it demonstrated passion and dedication to the law,” she says.</p> \n<h2>Tough challenges</h2> \n<p>Cardiff’s innocence project hit the headlines last December for its role in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2014/dec/09/dwaine-george-murder-conviction-overturned-cardiff-university-innocence-project\">overturning the murder conviction of Dwaine George</a>, who had served 12 years in prison. Cardiff students helped to provide evidence that meant the conviction was “no longer safe”. George’s was the first case to be overturned with the help of an innocence project in nine years.<br /></p> \n<p>The success of the case triggered a rise in the number of cases referred to them to two or three a week, with Eady spending hours each week writing responses. Cardiff submits by far <a href=\"http://thejusticegap.com/2014/09/innocence-work-uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the highest number of cases</a> to the CCRC of any university innocence project.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-fc263ed9-a192-4d0f-8ac9-0174a140e068\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434012792188/151d181b-fa33-434e-a0ed-b31742b5bf6d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cardiff law school\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outside the law school at Cardiff University.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite this success, the future for UK university innocence projects looks uncertain. “It takes a long time to get a case to the stage where a CCRC application is feasible,” says Price, and it can take years for it to progress through the system. She started working on the Dwaine George case with students in 2006, and it was not overturned until 2014.</p> \n<p>Price adds: “This means that students don’t see the outcome of their work, which makes criminal appeals work less attractive – to students and to universities – than pro bono schemes that concentrate on one-off advice.”</p> \n<p>There is also a severe lack of funding from universities for academic staff to be able to devote sufficient time to the work. “Student inexperience – despite bags of enthusiasm – means that academic supervisors have to really get to grips with a case and provide close guidance,” says Price. </p> \n<p>University innocence projects also have no rights to access exhibits or evidence that might assist with a review. “We are at the mercy of the police and Crown Prosecution Service in this regard,” says Price.</p> \n<p>The “innocence project” name is trademarked by <a href=\"http://www.innocenceproject.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Innocence Project</a> in New York. University projects have been forced to drop the name, says Price, because of tough <a href=\"http://innocencenetwork.org/membership/\" rel=\"nofollow\">membership criteria</a>. These include a staff member who spends 20 hours each week on the work – <a href=\"http://thejusticegap.com/2014/09/innocence-work-uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cardiff would be the only university to qualify</a> under this criterion.<br /></p> \n<h2>Gary’s prospects</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We really do seem to have reached a dead end</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>As for Gary, the blood evidence against him makes the chance of quashing his conviction seem slim, and he is understandably demoralised. While the students remain concerned about the integrity of the evidence, this is the first murder case a Cardiff team has fully reviewed without finding a basis for making a CCRC application.</p> \n<p>“Our client may be innocent, and the students have tried very hard on this case and are still working on it now,” says Eady, “but we really do seem to have reached a dead end.”</p> \n<p>The students can at least take comfort from the strength of their team. “We’re able to handle the disappointments together and decide the best way to move on with the case,” says Etheridge.</p> \n<p>Rae says she will always be curious about the outcome of the case. “It isn’t like an essay or an exam that you can complete and feel relief. It’s the one piece of work that I will never finish.

Was my coffee too hot? Nope – I’d just been smirked at for ordering an “ex-presso”. My only comfort was that I am far from alone. Last month, the US version of the Cambridge Dictionary <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/patricksmith/parmesan-vs-pennsylvania\">was ridiculed for posting an audio link suggesting Parmesan should be pronounced “pen-sal-vane-ear” – yep, Pennsylvania</a>. The internet is awash with blogposts on culinary mispronunciations. For example, the food site Epicurious.com tried to offer a handy list of the <a href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/archive/blogs/editor/2014/06/30-commonly-mispronounced-food-words.html\">30 most commonly mispronounced words</a> last year, only for the comments to be filled with people claiming several were wrong.

Even those who work in the food industry stumble over some terms. River Cottage chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall reassures me. “I say ‘ex-presso’,” he says. “I get most of these words wrong. I don’t mind,” he tells me, stoutly. “When quinoa first cropped up 10 years ago, I assumed it was ‘kwin-oa’. Other people can call it ‘keen-wa’ – good luck to them – but I won’t be joining in.” There is one example that makes him furious. “There is a guy I know in the food business who likes the finer things in life,” he tells me. “He calls truffles ‘troofles’. In France, a truffle is a ‘truffe’, but that doesn’t mean in English you pronounce them ‘troofles’. I blame myself that I have never confronted him – but I don’t trust myself. He might try to defend it and I would lose it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c3d6772f0710177831deca8782db63cac6db46d8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433938917886/8bd7c8be-7525-493b-88ed-ff9db02090b6-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A knees-up over gnocchi.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A knees-up over gnocchi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/31/giorgio-locatelli-family-values\">Italian chef Giorgio Locatelli</a>, on the other hand, says mistakes are likely to leave him chuckling. “People say ‘gee-nocchi’ instead of ‘nyocchi’ and, in Italian, that means ‘knees’. That’s fantastic.” But he does have a pet hate – when people say ‘bruschetta’ with a soft ‘shh’ (which I think a fairly easy mistake to make).“That is the one that kills me,” he complains, as I make a mental note never to do this again. “‘Sch’ in Italian is pronounced ‘sk’, so it should be ‘broo-sket-ta’,” he continues. “If I was with a friend, I would correct them, because I would always want people to correct my English.”</p> \n<p>The problem is, even if your pronunciation is perfect, that doesn’t mean you will escape being chastised, as <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/marina-oloughlin\">Guardian restaurant critic Marina O’Loughlin</a> points out. “An actual conversation with a waiter I had recently went like this: Me: ‘I’ll have the broosketta.’ Waiter: ‘One brooshetta, then.’ Me: ‘Yes, the broosketta’. Waiter, kindly, pityingly: ‘Brooshetta it is.’”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/felicity-cloake\">Food writer Felicity Cloake</a> has suffered similarly. “It’s not often that I’m lucky enough to be offered Mo&euml;t &amp; Chandon,” she says. “But since learning that the correct way to pronounce it is with a hard ‘t’ (mo-wett), I tend to avoid saying the name at all, because people often gently repeat it back to me as ‘mo-way’, as if I’m some unsophisticated hick who needs saving from myself.” It’s a middle-class dilemma that has her stumped, she says. “Where do you go from there – copy them to spare their blushes, or carry on regardless?”</p> \n<p>Guardian columnist <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/zoewilliams\">Zoe Williams</a>, who writes restaurant reviews, has the opposite problem. “I remember when I realised ‘scallop’ was pronounced ‘scollop’ – it gave me a real anxiety. When you know one thing is wrong and one is right, you will never get them the right way round. Then I hated myself for caring, because it’s obviously just a posh thing.”</p> \n<p>But she says there is something about the way the English approach foreign languages that escalates the awkwardness. “It’s that unique English pretence of not being pretentious: people who pronounce ‘<a href=\"http://www.lafromagerie.co.uk/ami-du-chambertin/\">Ami du Chambertin</a>’ in perfect French accents are considered despicable, and people who pronounce it wrong are even worse, so you just say ‘that cheese’.” The whole thing is so exhausting that she suggests – only half-jokingly – that we should just return to ordering things by numbers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff6fde6e7a381f36699af0ebef50265c6edbb8a0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433939026738/ece25337-fa87-4407-896d-cca2a4b4a6ca-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake suffers the middle-class dilemma of ‘mo-wett’ v ‘mo-way’\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake suffers the middle-class dilemma of ‘mo-wett’ v ‘mo-way’.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Luckily, when you are the one who runs the restaurant, you can make sure the menu only has easy-to-say words on it – which is an approach championed by <a href=\"https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/contacts_and_people/fergus/\">Fergus Henderson, the founder of St John restaurant</a>. He is happy to confess that there are words he stumbles on. “‘Physalis’ I struggle with – I can barely remember the name, let alone pronounce it,” he tells me. “Mind you, it’s one of those ingredients that turns up on plates where it’s not needed, so it can be safely ignored.” So, what should you do if you are faced with an unpronounceable word? Henderson insists it’s best to “just steam in”, but that, if you think you could really offend someone with your pronunciation, there are ways around it.</p> \n<p>“I find that the best course of action is to mumble. If you go to China, for instance, and there is an egg-fried rice that looks like it is called ‘fuck you’, just mumble.”</p> \n<p>And if this sounds like an unlikely situation, it’s one that <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jayrayner\">food writer Jay Rayner</a> can relate to. “In a restaurant on holiday, in Normandy, I ordered tripe in the local ‘Caen’ style, using my best terrible French,” he says.</p> \n<p>“The waitress sniggered. A French friend leaned across the table and said: ‘You just asked for your tripe to be cooked in the style of a chronic masturbator.’</p> \n<p>“I’m still not quite sure what I mispronounced.”</p> \n<h2>Menu unmentionables<br /></h2> \n<p><strong>Chipotle</strong><br /></p> \n<p>When the Mexican fast-food chain came to the UK, it helped the British out with an advertising campaign teaching the correct pronunciation of its name, derived from the Nahuatl for a smoked and dried jalape&ntilde;o chili pepper. Which you say as “chee-poat-lay”.</p> \n<p><strong>Pho</strong><br />There’s still much debate over the correct pronunciation of this fragrant noodle dish, which originated in Hanoi. Some say the recipe came about under French colonial rule, therefore the name should be pronounced with a long “o”, but the consensus is “fuh”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"213105fcaa588f4710d19b179f06de9ade06ca4d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433940240455/16654580-97e7-4040-8839-c02e6a4310ee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pho, a fragrant noodle dish, which originated in Hanoi.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pho, a fragrant noodle dish, which originated in Hanoi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Edamame</strong><br />When these immature soya beans crossed over from east-Asian cuisine to stud salads in your local M&amp;S, it led to a spate of mispronunciations. “Ed-a-mah-meh” is correct.</p> \n<p><strong>Sriracha</strong><br />The hottest sauce to hit your table in the past few years, this fruity number now graces supermarket aisles and burger chains alike, but people are still saying it wrong. “See-ratch-a”’ is what you want.

Some fiction and memoir reached us in translation, including the work of Dubravka Ugrešić, Slavenka Drakulić and Semezdin Mehmedinović, but not enough. Now a&nbsp;generation of novelists has appeared: the last children of Yugoslavia, still close yet removed enough from the heat of collective trauma to create fresh narratives. Joining the stunning fictions of Olja Savičević, Selvedin Avdić and T&eacute;a Obreht comes a debut novel by the young American-Croatian Sara Nović. I read it in one night.</p> \n<p>“The war in Zagreb began over a&nbsp;pack of cigarettes,” the 10-year-old narrator tells us. In the first of the novel’s four parts, tomboy Ana describes what made her world precious (parents and baby sister, her best friend Luka), and how that world collapsed in just a few months. Disintegration begins with a cancelled holiday because of road blockades; then the newsagent’s dark question about cigarettes, “Serbian or Croatian?”; the missing kid at school; the first refugees from out of town, and the appalling whispered details (one man’s wife was taken by a paramilitary with a necklace of human ears). Nović follows the lurch into total nightmare all the way to the event that terminates the first section, and Ana’s childhood. This is tough territory for any novelist, and it takes guts to go there. This key scene is written with chilling restraint: in the unspeakable moment, that crisp voice is devastating.</p> \n<p>The young perspective is the novel’s principal charm, but the tone is disrupted with too many overstretched exchanges anxious to tell us things we already know. This may be a problem of balancing the emotional pitch between the solemn adult and the fresh child-narrator. But when it works, it’s terrific: “As a side effect of modern warfare, we had the peculiar privilege of watching the destruction of our country on television.” In a&nbsp;childish war game, “Those who died&nbsp;with their limbs bent in unnatural angles and could hold their positions the longest were the winners.” At her best Nović is a poet: “Summer gave way to fall in the abrupt, unbeautiful way Zagreb always changed its seasons”; and later, at university in the&nbsp;US, Ana’s sympathetic professor “seemed to know I was not at home in the world”. I longed for more of these perceptive asides, a sensitivity to language that is particularly striking if you read Nović’s fascinating reflections on <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/23/what-its-like-to-be-a-deaf-novelist\" title=\"\">what it’s like to be a deaf author</a>.</p> \n<p>In the next section of the book, “Somnambulist”, Ana is suddenly 20,&nbsp;living in the United States with adoptive parents and a false persona that begins to crack. In many ways the rest of the novel is a variation on the traditional emigrant narrative of fragmented selves, but with the added baggage of trauma. Ana’s discussions with her professor about WG Sebald reference this explicitly, though the novel doesn’t need the literary sign-posting. The American scenes are tart with tragicomedy, and Ana’s drive for psychic resolution is compelling. There are memorable set pieces involving an&nbsp;intellectual college boyfriend, criminally well-meaning UN workers, the pitfalls of language (“I&nbsp;didn’t know what soccer was, but was pleasantly surprised to find out it was football”) and the impossibility “to contain Gardenville and Croatia in the same thought”. Nović sustains the non-linear structure, and while some of the American territory is a little familiar (reminiscent of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2000/apr/16/fiction.reviews\" title=\"\">Aleksandar Hemon’s <em>The Question of Bruno</em></a>, which is no bad thing), that’s part of Ana’s sorrowful insight – once you lose what you love, the rest of the world feels a bit empty. But there is more for her to discover on&nbsp;her return to Croatia, including old friends and new facts about Chetniks and Ustaše in&nbsp;the Serbo-Croatian conflict. The attempt to extract meaning from the conflict doesn’t go&nbsp;further than this, but perhaps it doesn’t&nbsp;need to – this is Ana’s story, and she is a&nbsp;satisfyingly complex character of such resilience and heart that I couldn’t sleep until I&nbsp;had followed her to the end.</p> \n<p>Nović excels at distilling visual poetry from action scenes, and there is one section in the middle that steals the show, when the shellshocked young Ana drifts into a twilight community and becomes an accidental combatant. “Suspended between living and dead”, Ana has become mute, except for the mantra: “Forward grip, gas chamber, cleaning rod, bolt, frame, magazine, function check.” Nović has breathed fire and ice into these pages. Immersing herself in the darkest materials, she has given us the real stuff dystopian fantasies are made of.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> To order <em>Girl at War</em> for &pound;11.99 (RRP &pound;14.99) go to <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/285593/s/girl-at-war/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Both dark (a LOT of people get eaten), and very, very funny, these are stories in which you sense that even the happily-ever-after endings are going to turn out to be exciting. They also contain the immortal lines:</p> \n<p>“The small girl smiles.

Not Very Little Red Riding hood, who insists on calling him “Foxie” and invites him back to her grandma’s house for a “cuppa tea”. What’s <em>really</em> scaring her is being away from her mummy for the night. A gorgeous take on the original, which perfectly captures the voice and fears of young toddlers and contains a delightful twist at the end.</p> \n<p><strong>5. <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/princess-and-the-peas.html\">The Princess and the Peas</a> by Caryl Hart and Sarah Warburton</strong></p> \n<p>When Lily-Rose May refuses to eat her peas and lets the world know about it VERY loudly, her dad decides that enough is enough. Declaring her to be suffering from a horrible case of princess-itus, he sends her packing to the royal palace to see if having to live the life of a <em>real</em> princess might cure her. A lovely rhyming story that pays humorous homage to the original Princess and the Pea tale.</p> \n<p><strong>6. <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/shhh.html\">Shhh!</a> by Sally Grindley and Peter Utton</strong></p> \n<p>So brilliantly interactive, it’s easy to forget that this book has been around for years.

Perfect for reading aloud.</p> \n<p><strong>7. <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/jim-and-the-beanstalk.html\">Jim and the Beanstalk</a> by Raymond Briggs</strong></p> \n<p>Once upon a beanstalk was a boy, but in Briggs’ sequel to the original it’s not Jack climbing up to the giant’s castle, but Jim. Finding the giant to be old and rather lonely, Jim helps him to feel his old self again. And then, inevitably, the giant’s appetite for fried boys returns…There’s no fee fi fo fumming in this version, but the giant is still wonderfully grumpy. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/childrens-books-site/gallery/2012/jan/27/how-to-draw-wolves-nadia-shireen\">How to draw... wolves </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>8. <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/good-little-wolf.html\">Good Little Wolf</a> by Nadia Shireeen</strong></p> \n<p>Rolf is a wolf with a problem.

Most nights a well known park near the City Theatre and the university of Tehran becomes a vibrant cruising ground for gay men. They come to trawl the park, to look, to show off, exchanging furtive glances in the dark, occasionally meeting for a few minutes in the public facilities or heading to some third location for more comprehensive interaction.</p> \n<p>Gay couples recline in remote corners, arms around each other, stealing kisses. Sometimes I don’t even see them until I’m alerted by their giggles.

Sometimes a car stops, a conversation ensues through a rolled-down window, someone gets in, and off they will go to perform acts punishable by violent flogging.</p> \n<p>Police do patrol the park, going about in packs of three and four, but they seem to show little interest in disrupting proceedings.</p> \n<p>“The police can’t do anything,” said one man I met in the park. He was wearing women’s shoes, heavy make-up, with a jewelled barrette in his hair and a small black leather purse in the crook of his elbow. “You need three people over the age of eighteen to go to court and swear on the Qur’an that they actually saw you having sex.” As he spoke he had his arm around his male friend’s waist.</p> \n<p>“It’s not the police I’m worried about,” said another. “It’s the reaction of the people that’s unpredictable, they’re so homophobic.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2014/mar/14/iran-youth-property-job-market\">Why Iran's youth don't fly the nest</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It’s not the police or the mullahs who are the biggest obstacles to having a successful homosexual relationship in Iran. It’s the utter lack of opportunities for any kind of intimate contact with your significant other. This is a combination of two factors: the first is that most unmarried Iranian men seem to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2014/mar/14/iran-youth-property-job-market\">live with their families</a>, the second is that public spaces are no-go zones for anything above hand-holding. Every relationship I’ve pursued has run into this problem.</p> \n<p>There was M, a 26-year-old branding and advertising consultant who lived with his parents and sister. We used to meet at the movie theatre and make out in the back row, but it was usually too crowded to attempt anything more serious.</p> \n<p>There was P, a 30-year-old waiter who lived with his grandmother. We would get a hotel room sometimes, but he always insisted on going in separately and besides it got to be way too expensive.</p> \n<p>And then there was A, my boyfriend. I met him at a party at a villa in Lahejan, near the Caspian Sea. We were both pretty sloshed on arak cocktails. He was wearing a ‘93 Bulls Michael Jordan T-shirt and green camouflage pants. His hair was dyed red and he had a scar across the whole right side of his head, which I later found out was from a piece of shrapnel when a motorcycle engine exploded.</p> \n<p>From the moment I saw him, I knew in the marrow of my spine. There was just no question about it. The infinite possibilities of the universe collapsed in that moment into a singular inescapable fact: we were going to have sex. I wasn’t sure when or where exactly, but I knew it would happen. I was so certain that I didn’t even feel the need to pursue it. This was a done deal.</p> \n<p>We made heavy eyes at each other the across the room. He came over and we had a forgettable conversation laden with pregnant pauses, lingering eye contact, and lots of incidental touching. When we were finally able to get into a room by ourselves, we didn’t even need to say anything, we just started making out.</p> \n<p>That lasted about a minute. Then we heard the doorknob turning and A ripped himself away from me and pretended to be looking at a pile of papers on the desk as one of our friends walked in. I was left standing not sure what gear to be in. I didn’t know it then but that initial encounter was emblematic of our relationship.</p> \n<p>When we walk in public, he refuses to let me hold his hand or even walk too close to him. Kissing or other public displays of affection are off limits. Occasionally when we spend a long weekend in one of our friends’ houses in Oshun or Lavasan, we manage to abscond to a bedroom with a locked door and yet he is still preoccupied by the notion that “someone might see us”.</p> \n<p>I can’t count how many time I’ve been forced to bail mid-make out and pretend to be sleeping because he has heard footsteps down the hall. Sometimes he’ll do ridiculous things like sit at the opposite end of a long dinner table just for appearances. When he does that, I wink at him from across the table just to watch him get flustered.</p> \n<p>“I’m a bit paranoid, I don’t know why, I know it’s not a big deal,” he tells me. “But I just can’t help it.” A has never even considered telling his father, a working-class house painter and devout Muslim, about his sexual orientation. “It’s not the same here, people don’t understand.”</p> \n<p>Even among our friends - who take absolutely no issue with homosexuality and who have expressed their support - he bristles when I try to be affectionate. When we walk through the Gay park he takes a step away from me. “We can’t touch here,” he says. “This is the gay part of town, everyone will know.”</p> \n<p>Despite these issues, I’ve decided to pursue the relationship, and in every other respect it’s been great. When I met A, being just a stupid <em>khareji</em> (foreigner) I’d mostly been exposed to overpriced caf&eacute;s in Tajrish and the posh high rises of Niavaran.</p> \n<p>A has shown me another side of Tehran. He took me to the south, to the old parts, to Gomrok, Berynak and Doolab. He showed me around his neighbourhood of Darveseh Dolat, down narrow winding alleys, past buildings that haven’t changed in a generation. We went to the local Sufi khanegah (‘institute’), tucked away in dark side street, to see their ecstatic religious dancing.</p> \n<p>He showed me how to light candles in the sagh-e khane, little alcoves built into walls around the city that are usually covered by metal bars and may feature an image of an Imam or famous martyr. I rode around Haft-e Tir and Enghelab on the back of his motor scooter. He took me to the avant-garde studios of young artists where we smoked hash and engaged in meandering discussions of Bruce Nauman and abstract expressionism.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/may/07/prayer-food-sex-and-water-parks-in-irans-holy-city-of-mashhad\">Prayer, food, sex and water parks in Iran's holy city of Mashhad</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We have talked about all the trips we plan on taking, to Mashhad, and Esfahan, and Bandar Abbas, about how we are going to buy a motorcycle and ride it to India together. None of which we have actually done. But still it is magical. Everything is great, but we have kept running into one big problem: intimacy. The whole first month we were dating, we spent most days together but we managed to have sex only once.</p> \n<p>No matter how well things are going in our relationship, there’s always an 800lb gorilla in the room. We say we love each other regularly, we call each other azizam (my darling) - when no one is listening of course - and all I want to do is grab him and kiss him when we greet each other but we have to pretend we’re just friends because he has a debilitating fear of stigma, because he’s grown up in a society that systematically delegitimises our sexual orientation.</p> \n<p>The constant code switching is dizzying. One minute we’re in the shower together, the next minute we’re sitting on opposite ends of an empty couch. I grew up in Los Angeles, and have been living in New York, so there’s simply no way for me to empathise with the years of destructive internalisation that he must have experienced growing up gay in the Islamic republic. I try to sympathise, but at times it’s just too frustrating.</p> \n<p>“Things are definitely getting better,” said Sina, a gay 32-year-old Tehrani, “but we never touch and kiss in public.”</p> \n<p>I’ve met a lot of nice gay men in my time in Tehran. I’ve loved at least one of them. And yet I have not been able to find one who has ever introduced a boyfriend to his parents. It’s striking how universal it is. Men in their 30s who are successful, well-adjusted, and live alone: they still would never consider telling their parents about their sexual orientation.</p> \n<p>This is the strange grey area that gay men in Iran find themselves in. The government appears to be loosening its grip, it’s becoming easier for LGBT people to move in Iranian society without fear of arrest and prosecution, but a deeply engrained shame lingers, stunting the development of a truly ‘out’ LGBT culture.</p> \n<p>“We all want to be more open in public,” A said to me once, “but it’s just not the proper place or the proper time.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/6/1433592886438/1855c71b-0238-49ca-82d4-df7b86dd6e66-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Enric Marti/AP","altText":"Iranians look at Andy Wharhol's portraits of rock star Mick Jagger during an exhibition of Pop Art at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tehran, Iran.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Enric Marti/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-11T04:00:00Z","lastModified":"2015-06-11T04:00:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":8,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Iran","Gay and lesbian travel","Middle East and North Africa","World news","Travel","Mahmoud Ahmadinejad","Hassan Rouhani"],"tags":[{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran"},{"id":"travel/gay-and-lesbian-travel","webTitle":"Gay and lesbian travel"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"travel/travel","webTitle":"Travel"},{"id":"world/mahmoud-ahmadinejad","webTitle":"Mahmoud Ahmadinejad"},{"id":"world/hassan-rouhani","webTitle":"Hassan Rouhani"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"Tehran Bureau","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/series/tehran-bureau"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/11/iran-gay-coming-out-intimate-spaces","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49en5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/11/iran-gay-coming-out-intimate-spaces","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/11/iran-gay-coming-out-intimate-spaces"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/6/1433592886438/1855c71b-0238-49ca-82d4-df7b86dd6e66-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Iranians look at Andy Wharhol’s portraits of rock star Mick Jagger during an exhibition of Pop Art at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Tehran, Iran.
