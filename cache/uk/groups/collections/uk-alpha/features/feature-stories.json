The review ended with a proclamation that I have since gleefully memorised: “Celebrate, fiction lovers: The gods of southern gothic storytelling have inducted a junior member.”</p> \n<p>As a guy from Louisiana, as deep as the American south gets, this was mighty stuff for my ego. Still, I felt uncomfortable with that phrase “southern gothic”: had I written that kind of novel? The truth is, I hadn’t set out to. I had just tried to tell a story in the best way I knew how. And yet there I was, supposedly, at a cocktail party with some of the writers I most admired: <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/williamfaulkner\">William Faulkner</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/flannery-o-connor\">Flannery O’Connor</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/harper-lee\">Harper Lee</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2010/may/20/barry-hannah-obituary\">Barry Hannah</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/jan/07/google-doodle-zora-neale-hurston\">Zora Neale Hurston</a>. I didn’t know what to make of it. And, now that my novel is being published in the UK, and with the literary world abuzz about Lee’s forthcoming <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/02/to-kill-a-mockingbird-sequel-harper-collins-most-pre-ordered-book\"><em>Go Set a Watchman</em></a>, I also have to wonder: why is southern gothic literature so popular across the globe?</p> \n<p>Here’s my idea: the southern gothic is like a trusty bicycle. (Note: this is not simply because southerners talk too slowly for a car metaphor to work. It is instead a kinship in the way the two things are assembled and ornamented. Stay with me.)</p> \n<p>First, the handlebars. What steers the southern gothic is authenticity. Look at the places the aforementioned “gods” of the genre are from. Mississippi. Georgia. Alabama. Florida. These are writers who spend their imaginative energy on the “postage stamp” of soil beneath their feet; writers who know, in other words, of what they speak. What makes this crucial to the southern gothic is similar to what makes a brother able to poke fun at his sister while beating up anyone else who dares make fun of her. It’s a family thing; an intimacy that readers from anywhere can relate to. Show me a southern gothic novel written by someone who’s not from the south and the odds are that I’ll show you a bad novel. To put it more smartly, there is a difference between writing from the culture and writing about or, at its worst, above it. The southern gothic is, always, from the culture.</p> \n<p>Second, the basket. The basket on this bike is full of vivid characters. Scholars are quick to call them “grotesques”, as they are often deformed or bigoted or violent but, in the hands of a southern writer, they are written with empathy and truth. Tom Robinson, for example, the black man accused of raping a white woman in Lee’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/mar/16/robert-mccrum-100-best-novels-harper-lee-to-kill-a-mockingbird\"><em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em></a>, has a lame left hand. Mrs Dubose, the old lady who lives near the Finches in the novel, is a mean-spirited racist. For lesser writers, these are throwaway details used to make fun of the south. For Lee, though, Robinson got his hand stuck in a cotton gin when he was 12 years old; Mrs Dubose is a dying morphine addict struggling through the pain of getting clean before she meets God. This is not grotesque. This is hard work and a hard life, and these characters merely bear the physical scars of what many of us carry internally. Why do readers relate to this? Perhaps O’Connor nailed it best when she said: “I use the grotesque the way I do because people are deaf and dumb and need help to see and hear.” The southern gothic, without exception, makes its characters loud and clear.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8d9450126f7553f02b825180db09d037998ef25\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435685253501/3c75f05f-4176-417a-ba56-ac33929de27a-460x338.jpeg\" alt=\"Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch and Brock Jones as Tom Robinson in the 1962 film adaptation of &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt;.\" width=\"460\" height=\"338\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch and Brock Jones as Tom Robinson in the 1962 film adaptation of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Third, the streamers. The bright streamers affixed to the handlebars of this bike are made of language. Southern writers are uniquely bonded by an oral tradition of front porch storytelling and find an outsized joy in constructing vibrant sentences (see Hannah’s work for the most acrobatic example of this). After all, we feel, if you can’t entertain your bourbon-drinking relatives, how can you expect to entertain a sober stranger? This is also apparent in the dialogue of southern gothic writers, who endow their characters with speech that is somehow wise without being didactic, as when the Misfit in O’Connor’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2012/sep/06/brief-survey-short-story-flanner-oconnor\">“A Good Man Is Hard to Find”</a> describes the suddenly repentant grandmother he just killed by saying: “She would have been a good woman if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life.” This is a perfect sentence, partly because of its grammatical flaw, and these colourful phrases brighten the dark themes of southern gothic novels to make for surprisingly joyful reading.</p> \n<p>Fourth, the front wheel. The front wheel is the landscape. As it is the first part of an approaching bike that one sees, it is also the first thing a reader encounters when they enter these novels: beards of Spanish moss, dusty gravel roads, stubble-grass in the cotton fields. The natural world is alive and well in southern fiction and deemed gothic by its pervasive influence on the characters and their actions. And it’s true: the heat of the American south is indeed oppressive, and everything with a mouth, as they say down here, can bite. Yet it is ultimately the writer’s reverence for the natural world that sets these novels apart. Even the very forthright Scout, the narrator of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, turns into a veritable poet when she describes her hometown, using alliteration in ways she rarely does elsewhere by saying, “grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square … Ladies bathed before noon … and … were like soft teacakes with frosting of sweat and sweet talcum.” It’s a song these southern writers sing to the landscape and it is made pretty for all readers by their admiration of it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/booksblog/2015/jun/30/to-kill-a-mockingbird-go-set-a-watchman-reading-group-harper-lee\">Looking back at To Kill a Mockingbird, and forward to Go Set a Watchman</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Next, the back wheel. The wheel that propels this bike is violence. Nearly all southern gothic novels revolve around it. For some it is rape, others murder, and for many it is the violent nature of God as seen by flooded rivers and hurricanes (see Faulkner’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/as-i-lay-dying-2.html\"><em>As I Lay Dying</em></a> and Hurston’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/their-eyes-were-watching-god.html\"><em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em></a>, respectively). What this means to the genre as a whole is that all of its novels have inherently high stakes, which readers appreciate. These are not quiet and domestic dramas, although they may be set in quiet towns. IPnstead, people’s lives are on the line in the same way that the readers’ lives are from the moment they open their eyes each morning to the moment they close them.</p> \n<p>Finally, the frame and chain. What holds this bike together and enables it to go is the tortured history of the American south. There is no way around it. From slavery and prejudice through the civil war and Jim Crow, the American south has a past full of inexcusable ugliness. However, this is not the whole story, nor is it what makes this literature endure. Instead, it is the type of hero this past has created that keeps southern literature relevant and popular, and this hero is the underdog. Although it has been said that every person is the hero of their own life story, it is more accurate to say that every person is the underdog of their own life story. And though the civil war is long gone, the American south still suffers from its past in almost every conceivable way, whether it be poverty rates or failing education systems.</p> \n<p>Yet those of us living there today did not personally create these problems. So, when we struggle to do the right thing, it feels as if we are doing so against incredible odds. This, I believe, is what readers from all parts of the world most identify with. We are all underdogs in the trial of our lives in the same fascinating and multiple ways that nearly every character in the courtroom of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird </em>was an underdog: Tom Robinson, Atticus Finch, Scout Finch, and even the poverty-stricken Mayella and Bob Ewell. They all thought they were doing the right thing, and they all thought nearly everyone else was against them. As Atticus Finch says in one of the most iconic lines of all southern literature: “Simply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason for us not to try to win.” That is the definition of an underdog mentality, and a linchpin of great literature.</p> \n<p>So, ultimately, the southern gothic is not held together by how different it is from its readers around the world, but instead by how similar, how respectful, and, in reference to this bicycle we’ve created, how moving.</p> \n<p>But what about the seat, you wonder? The pedals? Well, they are built for you. Hop on.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> MO Walsh’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/307979/s/my-sunshine-away/\"><em>My Sunshine Away</em></a> is published by Viking.</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435684966859/e15e371c-5446-42ac-995d-3136c4286af7-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jamie Stengle/AP","altText":"Spanish moss.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jamie Stengle/AP"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435685252596/3c75f05f-4176-417a-ba56-ac33929de27a-2060x1512.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1512,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch and Brock Jones as Tom Robinson in the 1962 film adaptation of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>.

Turn right and in a few hundred yards, on a corner, is an unprepossessing three-storey house. Press the middle bell and be prepared to wait. The occupant is old: 96. A slow footfall, and&nbsp;there he stands, still erect and tall: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/mar/17/lawrence-ferlinghetti-publish-travel-journals-beat\" title=\"\">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</a>, publisher to the Beats, poet laureate to his home town.</p> \n<p>He directs me upstairs to the kitchen of his second floor apartment, past a scrappy unframed poster of Vladimir Mayakovsky taped roughly to the wall. “It’s a real Italian building,” he says. “The kitchen is the entire width of the house.” Ferlinghetti has lived here, on his own, for more than 30 years. I’m here to talk to him about a confluence of significant events: the 60th anniversary of the company he founded, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2013/may/25/san-francisco-city-lights-bookshop-beats\" title=\"\">City Lights</a>, publishers of a celebrated poetry list that includes <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/allen-ginsberg\" title=\"\">Allen Ginsberg</a>’s “Howl” and an extensive range of titles in radical politics and offbeat fiction; the appearance later this year of a collection of his correspondence with Ginsberg, and a compilation of his own travel writings; and another anniversary, that of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2005/jun/13/photography-poetry\" title=\"\">International Poetry Incarnation</a>, held in the Albert Hall in London 50 years ago this summer. There, followed by Beat poets Ginsberg and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/2001/jan/20/guardianobituaries.books1\" title=\"\">Gregory Corso</a>, he read to an audience of 7,000&nbsp;at an event billed as Britain’s first&nbsp;“happening”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2005/jun/11/sanfrancisco.unitedstates.culturaltrips\">Walking the Beat</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We begin with the Albert Hall event. I point out that, on the evidence of Peter Whitehead’s darkly atmospheric film of the proceedings, <em>Wholly Communion</em>, the crowd seemed pretty stoned that night. The readings were interrupted at one point by a young man mesmerically chanting the word “love” at the top of his voice. “It wasn’t just the audience,” Ferlinghetti chuckles, “most of the poets were on something, either just grass, more likely LSD … But I was totally straight. I was probably the only straight man on stage.”</p> \n<p>He appears to relish his reputation as the abstemious one. “Somebody had to mind the shop,” he tells me, enjoying the literalism (City Lights is also a world-famous bookstore). Everything is relative, however: compared to Ginsberg, who rarely encountered a drug he didn’t want more of, or <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/jackkerouac\" title=\"\">Jack Kerouac</a>, who was notorious for drinking heavily with his mother in the house they shared, Ferlinghetti seems a paragon of restraint. But in his travel writing from Andalucia, where he lived in the spring before the Albert Hall gig, he is regularly on the lookout for “kif” and, on one occasion, recounts being so drunk that he tumbled into a patch of tomatoes in the garden, where he lay unconscious until his wife found him.</p> \n<p>If Ferlinghetti’s sobriety was only relative, it extended to the use of swear words. Though the poem with which he opened at the Albert Hall was titled “To Fuck Is to Love Again”, he is quick to point out that it’s “the only poem of mine which had a four-letter word in it.&nbsp;Generally, dirty words divert the attention from what you’re trying to get across.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWdYrd_UH9E\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWdYrd_UH9E?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>I suggest that the performances of the American poets that night – himself, Ginsberg and Corso – looked more self-assured than those of their British counterparts, among them <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/culture/christopher-logue\" title=\"\">Christopher Logue</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/adrian-mitchell\" title=\"\">Adrian Mitchell</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2009/may/01/obituary-tom-mcgrath-poet\" title=\"\">Tom McGrath</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/michael-horovitz\" title=\"\">Michael Horovitz</a>. “The thing about the British poets was that though they looked like Beats, when they opened their mouths, out came these beautiful Oxford accents. It sort of destroyed the image.” So were the Beats in America more working class? “Gregory certainly was, he had a strong New York accent. Allen was from Jewish intellectuals in Newark who were old communists and identified with the workers’ movement.”</p> \n<p>Given those family politics it seems an irony that Ginsberg arrived in London having been expelled from communist-run Czechoslovakia. The authorities there had taken possession of a notebook that, according to its owner, included “descriptions of sex orgies and ecstasies in intimate detail”. Ferlinghetti smiles and removes his glasses to dab eyes now afflicted with glaucoma: “Well, Allen made the most of being kicked out of Prague. He was leaving anyway. Besides being a genius poet, he was a master publicist and showman.”</p> \n<p>Anyway, the communists, the official ones at least, had little truck with the Beats. “The Russian poet <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2010/jun/03/andrei-voznesensky-obituary\" title=\"\">Andrei Voznesensky</a> was at the Albert Hall but the Soviet embassy wouldn’t let him read. They didn’t want him to associate with dirty beatniks. He was on the front row but the audience didn’t even know he was there.”</p> \n<p>Voznesensky was a recent friend. “The following year we appeared together in San Francisco. I set up a big a reading for him, just as we’d done with Yevtushenko.” The event is described in Ferlinghetti’s travel journals. It took place at <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2014/apr/11/top-10-live-music-venues-san-francisco\" title=\"\">the Fillmore</a>, the cavernous music venue run by Bill Graham. The plan was to follow the poetry with a live band but Voznesensky objected: “When he first got a look at the hand bill he called me up … ‘Lawrence, what is Jefferson Airplane?’ [After] I told him it was a rock group … he said ‘Lawrence, just you and me. No Airplane.’” Persuaded later to change his mind, Ferlinghetti records, the Russian watched the band from the balcony, sitting with the man running the light show. “He did dig it, after all.”</p> \n<p>Ferlinghetti included Voznesensky in City Lights’ anthology of Eastern European poets <em>Red Cats</em> (title courtesy of Ginsberg) and the conversation turns to his role as a publisher. I suggest that his correspondence with Ginsberg traces a relationship drifting gradually from the informality of friends to something much more businesslike, as the two men established their respective careers. Ferlinghetti demurs. “It’s true we had no contracts, including for ‘Howl’. But Allen never really included me in his inner circle. I wasn’t one of his in-group. I was always his publisher.”</p> \n<p>Ferlinghetti became aware of the power of Ginsberg’s most famous poem when, alongside a boisterous Kerouac, he heard <em>“</em>Howl<em>”</em> read for the first time at the Six Gallery in North Beach during October 1955. The next day he sent a telegram to Ginsberg, who was living nearby at the time: I GREET YOU AT THE BEGINNING OF A GREAT CAREER. STOP. WHEN DO I GET MANUSCRIPT OF HOWL? The poem was soon on the presses at Villiers Publications in Britain, contracted by Ferlinghetti because their production was superior to anything available in the US: “The first printings were handset in old-fashioned type and thread sewn. John Sankey, who owned the press, had a very expensive sports car, a Jaguar. He drove me up to his factory an hour north of London at enormously high speed.”</p> \n<p>The books were shipped to America through San Francisco. On arrival, the customs announced they would be seized for obscenity. They were eventually let through, but not without repercussions: “In the end it was the juvenile department of the police who charged us. I was in Big Sur at the time, and Allen was in Morocco. But our bookstore manager was dragged off to jail.”</p> \n<p>The subsequent trial lasted months. Ginsberg, writing from Tangier where, between hanging out with <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/artanddesign/bacon\" title=\"\">Francis Bacon</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/1999/nov/19/news.obituaries\" title=\"\">Paul Bowles</a>, he was assisting <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/williamburroughs\" title=\"\">William Burroughs</a> with the editing of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/booksblog/2009/apr/16/naked-lunch-william-burroughs\" title=\"\"><em>Naked Lunch</em></a>, was evidently concerned about its outcome. Characteristically, though, he struck a defiant note: “I&nbsp;guess this is more serious than the customs seizure … I’m really sorry I’m not there ... I never thought I’d want to&nbsp;read <em>“</em>Howl<em>”</em> again but it would be a pleasure under these circumstances. It might give it a reality as ‘social protest’ I always feared was lacking without armed bands of outraged Gestapo.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59b0a68c8927e606d5b76213dc0de9f7b1a764b6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435853181237/24830776-6a1f-48e0-8769-a6111677084f-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"City Lights Booksellers, North Beach, San Francisco.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">City Lights, North Beach, San Francisco.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wendy Connett/Wendy Connett/Robert Harding World Imagery/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ferlinghetti remained sanguine and, like any good publisher, saw opportunity alongside the risk. “I wasn’t worried. I was young and foolish. I figured I’d get a lot of reading done in jail and they wouldn’t keep me in there for ever. And, anyway, it really put the book on the map.” He had sent the poem to the American Civil Liberties Union prior to publishing it “to see if they would defend us if we were busted. And they did – successfully as it turned out.” The not-guilty verdict heralded a new freedom in American letters. “After that the floodgates were opened.

The letters chronicle an increasingly confident young poet, never backward at coming forward, placing ever greater demands on his publisher, not least the repeated insistence that a variety of acquaintances be added to the City Lights list. “It seemed like half the people Allen recommended were current or ex-boyfriends. Some of them would never have gotten published if it hadn’t been for him.” In&nbsp;fact, Ferlinghetti remained coolly impervious when Ginsberg’s entreaties didn’t accord with his own interests and tastes. In declining to take on <em>Naked Lunch</em> he wrote to Ginsberg and Burroughs, then living together in Paris: “Anyone that published it as is would be indulging in pure and sure premeditated legal lunacy.” According to Paul Yamazaki, who has been the buyer for City Lights bookstore for more than four decades, this is just part of the story. “Lawrence didn’t care much for Burroughs’s writing until <em>Soft&nbsp;Machine</em> came out a couple of years&nbsp;later.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"51fd3ce3d448310f6462419cfddc2f28f97c48ba\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435853657775/05ecb6c1-4f20-46c7-9302-d2bf2e0a1c30-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Lawrence Ferlinghetti in November 2014.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lawrence Ferlinghetti in November 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Felver/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As the publisher at City Lights, dealing with pushy and sometimes outrageously obstreperous writers went with the territory. Another of his poets, Corso, once broke into the bookshop and emptied the till. Ferlinghetti relates the events of that night: “The people in the Vesuvio bar next door saw him do it. We had a policy at City Lights never to call the police. We even had a sign up that said: ‘We will not call the police for book thieves. But they may be publicly shamed.’ Our bookstore manager once literally took down a guy’s pants to retrieve some stolen books.” But, in Corso’s case, it was the&nbsp;bar that summoned the cops, who arrived and dusted the till for fingerprints. “When we heard about it we went round to Gregory’s house. It was three in the morning. We told him the police had his number and he better get out of town. He left immediately for Italy. Didn’t return for two years.” Did Ferlinghetti ever retrieve the stolen money? “Well, we just took it out of his royalties. It seemed like the civilised thing to do.”</p> \n<p>I’ve been advised prior to the interview that Ferlinghetti is essentially a private person, something that can easily be mistaken for aloofness. This characteristic is simultaneously underscored and belied by the direct way he&nbsp;brings our conversation to a close. “You seem to have quite a lot now,” he says, gesturing to my tape recorder, “and I want to watch the Giants game.”</p> \n<p>Before leaving I ask if he is working on anything. He says he is collaborating with an Italian journalist who lives locally on the translation of a&nbsp;book by the poet <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2002/mar/18/artsfeatures2\" title=\"\">Carmelo Bene</a>. “We&nbsp;hope to have it finished within a year or two.” And does he go into City Lights these days? “Not really. Elaine [Katzenberger] is running things there. She’s an excellent editor – tough, and sometimes very funny. And it’s harder for me to get about now. I was just invited to a poetry reading in Norway but had to turn it down. Such a shame,” he adds ruefully, “they were going to pay business class. Do you know how rare it&nbsp;is for a poet to get business class?”</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> I Greet You at the Beginning of a Great Career: The Selected Correspondence of Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsberg, 1955-1997</em> will be published by City Lights later this month. <em>Writing Across the Landscape: Travel Journals 1960-2013 </em>by Lawrence Ferlinghetti will be published by Liveright in September.</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435852104581/Ferlinghetti-interviews-G-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lawrence Ferlinghetti interviews Allen Ginsberg outside the Albert Hall before the the International Poetry Incarnation in 1965.

But do the continent’s leaders dare outrage the west?","byline":"Patience Akumu","body":"<p>Millions of Africans are enamoured with all things American. In high school, to show their loyalty and maintain a connection to the great American men and women of God, some of my classmates would send money to American preachers all the way from Uganda. When these teenagers prayed, they did not say God. They said Gawd – like Americans. The worldlier of us wore crop tops and fancied we looked like Ashanti. At school parties we danced to American music, favouring as partners the boys who wore headscarves that reminded us of Ja Rule.</p> \n<p>Africa’s apparent obliviousness to the US marriage equality decision is an exception to this tradition of devoted adoration. Not that anyone expected Africa to leap for joy. South Africa is the only African country where gay marriage is legal. Most of the countries either criminalise homosexuals or, at best, pretend they do not exist.</p> \n<p>And now African leaders are pretending the US decision on gay marriage did not happen. The historic judgment caused most of Europe and America to break into colourful celebration. But in Africa even the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/30/mozambique-lgbt-activists-anti-gay-law-scrapped\" title=\"\">decriminalisation of homosexuality in Mozambique</a>, a few days after the US Supreme Court decision, did not inspire much conversation on homosexuality. Apart from Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe, who reportedly reacted to the US judgment with a <a href=\"http://tribune.com.pk/story/914299/zimbabwe-president-proposes-to-obama-mocks-same-sex-marriage/\" title=\"\">mock marriage proposal</a> to American president Barack Obama, African leaders have remained silent.</p> \n<p>Yet Africans – African presidents in particular – are cordial people; they value their relationship with the west. They know they cannot do without the billions in aid and trade. The money is necessary to keep loyalists happy within shaky regimes. Niceties to western partners, like congratulatory messages on independence, after an election or a successful security expedition, are part and parcel of the deal.</p> \n<p>The truth is that America did not exactly open up the gates to conversation. After the initial stern warnings and threats about the consequences of violating gay rights came the silent realisation that this is an issue it must tread carefully on. Perhaps heeding Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni’s advice that Africans do not appreciate public displays of affection even for heterosexuals, the US embassy in Kampala did not make any extravagant announcements to celebrate the judgment. Diplomats and government officials met, even dined, and everything but the elephant in the room – gay marriage rights – was up for discussion.</p> \n<p>This did not, however, stop the ordinary Ugandan from poking, probing and accusing. One, Munanura Tmk, asked: “Who tells you that US is the father and definition of democracy and human rights? Enjoy the right to homosexuality since you have unanimously allowed it in the US but also allow Africa to practise its freedom.”</p> \n<p>To the Ugandans who went into fasting and attended overnight prayers following the US judgment, the fear that the great US is officially rolling out its pro-homosexuality agenda is gripping. They are America and their tentacles have no bounds. The calls to God to cause fire to strike America and the fervent quotations from the Book of Revelation are really the whimpering of the defeated.</p> \n<p>To them, the US decision is deja vu – a searing reminder of last year’s Ugandan constitutional court <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/aug/01/uganda-anti-gay-law-null-and-void\" title=\"\">annulment of the anti-homosexuality act</a>. Conservatives in the east African nation had hoped the law that punished some homosexual acts with life imprisonment would deal with gay people once and for all. Now, with homosexuals, albeit in the most modest ways, looking more and more victorious, these conservatives are looking for a way to salvage their pride by suggesting the re-tabling of the anti-gay law. The prediction is that, just as Uganda’s anti-gay law inspired similar legislation all over Africa, the US gay marriage decision will cause African presidents to do something equally outstanding. If only to reassure their citizens that they are still in control and there will not be a spillover of these liberal “deviances” from the west into Africa.</p> \n<p>In Uganda the situation is particularly precarious, with the presidential elections coming up next year. Ugandans, 96% of whom think homosexuality is unacceptable, will not vote for candidates whose stand on homosexuality they do not know.</p> \n<p>Museveni, who has ruled the country for nearly three decades, is expected to seek another term. He and the security forces that are unabashedly partisan towards NRM, the ruling party, will do anything to crack down on dissent. They have arrested and shot at opposition supporters, declared a war on social media critics, and a law to control NGO activity is under way. If push comes to shove, re-enacting an anti-gay law to swing the scales in Museveni’s favour is not an unimaginable option.</p> \n<p>The only snag is that, while the west seems content to punish other kinds of human rights violations with a warning or a report, they take real action when it comes to gay rights. Museveni has warned MPs to go slow on the gay issue for the sake of maintaining trade relations with the west.</p> \n<p>Yet the diplomatic games on gay rights can only go on for so long. With more countries legalising gay marriage, there are practical issues to address. ow will gay couples from Europe or America be treated? The simple answer would be that they will not come to Uganda for whatever reason. This kind of exclusion is unrealistic and bad for Uganda, and Africa.</p> \n<p>As the wave of gay marriages ripples through Europe and America, it is inevitable that some of the splashes will hit Africa, and African leaders know this. They also know there is too much to lose by hanging on to homophobia. They may bicker about it with the west for a while, and gay marriage may still have a century or two until it is embraced in Africa. But the cool splashes from the great America are the beginning of the end of the animated embers of officially sanctioned homophobia on the continent. Africa’s gay people have to believe this. It is the most comforting option in the unpredictable sea of the politics of homosexuality in Africa.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436011508428/Rainbow-shelter-at-Uganda-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rainbow shelter at Uganda’s gay pride demonstration in Entebbe last year.   Photograph: Sipa/Rex Shutterstock","credit":"Sipa/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Rainbow shelter at Uganda’s gay pride demonstration in Entebbe last year.  ","cleanCaption":"Rainbow shelter at Uganda’s gay pride demonstration in Entebbe last year.   Photograph: Sipa/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-04T14:02:28Z","lastModified":"2015-07-04T23:10:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":404,"contributors":[{"name":"Patience Akumu","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patience-akumu"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["LGBT rights","Africa","Same-sex marriage (US)","Yoweri Museveni","Uganda","Zimbabwe","Mozambique","South Africa","Gay marriage","World news","Society","Human rights"],"tags":[{"id":"world/lgbt-rights","webTitle":"LGBT rights"},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa"},{"id":"us-news/same-sex-marriage-us","webTitle":"Same-sex marriage (US)"},{"id":"world/yoweri-museveni","webTitle":"Yoweri Museveni"},{"id":"world/uganda","webTitle":"Uganda"},{"id":"world/zimbabwe","webTitle":"Zimbabwe"},{"id":"world/mozambique","webTitle":"Mozambique"},{"id":"world/southafrica","webTitle":"South Africa"},{"id":"society/gay-marriage","webTitle":"Gay marriage"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"law/human-rights","webTitle":"Human rights"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Patience Akumu","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/patience-akumu"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/04/africans-love-america-cant-accept-gay-marriage","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ach5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/04/africans-love-america-cant-accept-gay-marriage","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/04/africans-love-america-cant-accept-gay-marriage"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436011508428/Rainbow-shelter-at-Uganda-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rainbow shelter at Uganda’s gay pride demonstration in Entebbe last year.   Photograph: Sipa/Rex Shutterstock","credit":"Sipa/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Rainbow shelter at Uganda’s gay pride demonstration in Entebbe last year.  ","cleanCaption":"Rainbow shelter at Uganda’s gay pride demonstration in Entebbe last year.   Photograph: Sipa/Rex Shutterstock"}},"importance":5,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436011508428/Rainbow-shelter-at-Uganda-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rainbow shelter at Uganda’s gay pride demonstration in Entebbe last year.   Photograph: Sipa/Rex Shutterstock","credit":"Sipa/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Rainbow shelter at Uganda’s gay pride demonstration in Entebbe last year.  ","cleanCaption":"Rainbow shelter at Uganda’s gay pride demonstration in Entebbe last year.   Photograph: Sipa/Rex Shutterstock"}}]},{"title":"AS Byatt / The artist who helps me write","rawTitle":"The artist who helps me write","item":{"type":"article","id":"artanddesign/2015/jul/04/as-byatt-patrick-heron-the-artist-who-helps-me-write","title":"AS Byatt: the artist who helps me write","trailText":"They may be ghostly, dizzying and ‘the opposite of stories’, but the novelist needs Patrick Heron’s abstract works to shape her fiction.

Here she explains why she is so haunted by his work</p>","byline":"AS Byatt","body":"<p><sup>“</sup>Every great painter,” Patrick Heron wrote “has succeeded in projecting a new and wholly distinct species of pictorial space.” He was a great writer about art, vision and painting, and said he had had to give up writing criticism in case he became classified as a writer who painted as opposed to a painter who wrote. He was wise about the relationship between abstract forms and representation in all kinds of painting. In his essay on “Pierre Bonnard and Abstraction” he wrote a wonderful bravura passage on the varying underlying abstract shapes of every great painter. Vel&aacute;zquez painted eggs and fish, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/artanddesign/pablo-picasso\">Picasso</a> flat triangles, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/artanddesign/elgreco\">El Greco</a> solid diamonds, Rubens “endless spheres” and Bonnard “a large-scale fishnet” pulling the surface of the canvas into loosely connected squares and lozenges. I think that one of Heron’s own underlying shapes is a kind of attempt to square the circle – a hook that has a square angle, a triangular point and a curved hole inside the angle. There was a time when Heron was belligerently abstract, needing to paint purely abstract forms. He was, he said, startled when Herbert Read found a source for this resolute abstraction in Heron’s own surroundings – in the forms of the lichens on the stones in his Cornwall garden. He came to see that many of his hooks and piers resembled the Cornish coastline and harbours. He painted the abstract forms underlying his world.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"71f09dc9ddd701fcc2d5385bebbda5dfaeb46d71\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435856448146/f6a4ea59-9bc2-415f-8716-7ecb2edf8375-460x381.jpeg\" alt=\"The Red Studio by Matisse\" width=\"460\" height=\"381\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Red Studio by Matisse</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>Very Soft Yellows and Formal Reds, April 1968</em> in the Mercer Art Gallery, Harrogate, is purely abstract. At the bottom of the frame is a blocked and very solid blue, containing a golden space like a hemisphere with an adjacent rectangle. Most of the rest of the painting is a nuanced red with ghosts of squares and a shadowy Heron form of knobs on stalks. There is a balancing golden almost-crescent form at the top of the painting where you might expect a sun or a moon. But the staggering thing is the finely delineated green curtain or fringe that impinges on the blue and the gold, dark against the blue, vegetable greens against the gold. The green is a fringe or a frond. The whole discrete structure at the bottom left, somehow closed off from the complicated reds of the rest of the canvas, is a harbour, with a harbour wall – and maybe the uniform poster blue around it is an icon of the sea. I have seen other paintings with this green fringe, so unexpected against the clear simple delineated colours, but very few. I began to ask myself, is the green paint fronds of seaweed, or is it the dash of the water itself breaking against the harbour? The answer is that it is paint and colour and one can read it – not as one will – but in as many ways as are possible.</p> \n<p>So what do we make of the rest of the image? It is unusually tentative for Heron – deliberately tentative. There is a vertical oblong where the gold is overlaid with a pale brown muddy colour, linking and not linking the harbour to the gold splash at the top. A strange jaunty bright green form is trying to worm its way from the right edge into the painting or – this is how I read it – it may be trying to escape. “Jaunty”, “trying” and “escape” are my words, not the painting’s. Heron was very interested in the edges of paintings – he liked, so to speak, to run over them, to emphasise their edginess by contradicting it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"baee53a63108ab69d2f71f46472dba50267b551d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435850366252/b0e56766-a1cb-4378-bb33-14b3f0a2810d-308x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Neuron Drawings by Santiago Ram&oacute;n y Cajal (1874)\" width=\"308\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neuron Drawings by Santiago Ram&oacute;n y Cajal (1874)</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I love Heron’s paintings because they are the opposite of stories. Writing moves on the whole from beginning to end, however much experimental writers may try to break this temporal lock. Words follow one another and there is an end. Painting is space, and writing is time, and Heron’s abstraction is at one end of that spectrum. You can close a book. There is no reason ever to stop looking at a painting. The Mercer Gallery kindly arranged for me to sit alone with this Heron for as long as I wanted to – it was on a chair and I stared and stared – and it kept changing in my gaze. When I left it, I kept coming back for a last look. I was trying to save the forms in my brain. I don’t think (I may be wrong) that Heron thought much in terms of the brain, as opposed to the mind or the eye. He writes about charcoal, pigment, brushes, edges.</p> \n<p>Whereas I have come to think of my writing as a moving screen of images which I use to see what is unbalanced, what needs elaborating, what is overdone. I need to know something about the whole form of a novel – changing as I work, and I have four images with which I generally work to do this thinking. The first is Matisse’s <em>Red Studio</em>, a strong red space inhabited by the ghosts of furniture and paintings. This was Heron’s favourite painting, and it has been mine as long as I have known it – not because of him, but because of my passion for Matisse. Next there are the completely amazing (and beautiful) images of brain cells made in the 1890s by Santiago Ram&oacute;n y Cajal, showing the axons and dendrites, their knots and thrust. And the third and fourth are by Heron – I think with different images at different times, ghostly inside my head.

The paintings were large and many were red. They knocked you out. Already dizzy, I found myself wandering through a host of dancing ghosts of colours – after-images, green for the reds, yellow for the blues, blue for the yellows. Heron’s paintings already show, with their juxtapositions of colours which change the colours around them, that no colour is stable. The colours that floated free in the gallery space were an intensification of that experience.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Writing About Art: Literary Connections in the Harrogate Fine Art Collection</em> by Lara Goodband and John Wedgwood Clarke is published by the Mercer Art Gallery. <a href=\"http://www.harrogate.gov.uk\">harrogate.gov.uk</a></p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2015/7/2/1435856071870/Patrick-Heron-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Very Soft Yellows and Formal Reds, April 1968, by Patrick Heron.

He accumulated odds and ends from the real world – a bird’s egg, a marble, a foreign stamp, a thimble – and assembled them into enigmatic dreams. The little boxes for which he’s famous, when filled with arrangements of tiny fragments and fronted with glass, convey an intense but mysterious sense of meaning – somewhere between reliquaries and riddles.</p> \n<p>Poetical theatres, he called them, and so they sometimes are. <em>Palace</em>, which opens this first <a href=\"http://www.artfund.org/what-to-see/exhibitions/2015/07/04/joseph-cornell-wanderlust-exhibition\">British show</a> in more than 30 years, is a silvery stage set, created simply by inserting a mirror behind an antique illustration of a palace and cutting out the windows so that the spectral brilliance gleams through. Brushwood rises like an enchanted forest in the midnight shadows behind and everything seems on the brink of disappearing, like the phantom land in a fairytale.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2002/jun/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview17\">Remembering Joseph Cornell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So exquisite and simple, it heralds the childlike appeal of everything that follows. Cornell’s first dealer – for all the tales of his untrained naivety and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2002/jun/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview17\">reclusive life </a>in New York, Cornell was extremely well connected in the art world – described his works as toys for adults. Many of them work like slot machines or games, with moving parts and quaint rules that can’t easily be followed, such as the bewildering <a href=\"http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=5647\"><em>Object/Tower of Babel and Children of Israel</em></a>, in which one is supposed to get the children of Israel – represented by red beads – past the little cork tower presumably without knocking it over.</p> \n<p>If the game seems simple enough, the object is not. Covered with antique maps and tiny drawings, references to Baedeker and the museums of Berlin, it amounts to a souvenir of places that Cornell would never see. There is an air of nostalgia and yearning to his art; a love of what he called “the light of other days”, from ancient Egypt to his own lost childhood.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6919d4d9b5c3505794c4ec4b26680432c26c6edd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435853887637/a4443706-cf30-4fa2-8e86-f708d089663b-304x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Cornell's Habitat Group for a Shooting Gallery, 1943.\" width=\"304\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cornell’s Habitat Group for a Shooting Gallery, 1943.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph and Robert Cornell Memorial Foundation/VAGA, NY/DACS, London 2015</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The past Cornell conjured was arcane even in his day. He was fascinated by the 19th-century soprano <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/University_Musical_Encyclopedia/Vocal_Music_and_Musicians:_The_Vocal_Art;_Great_Vocalists;_Famous_Songs/Henriette_Sontag\">Henriette Sontag</a> and by mad king <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2006/may/21/worldcup2006travelguide.germany.observerescapesection\">Ludwig of Bavaria</a>, archiving his life <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/66268449@N08/12433271853\">in a neat little suitcase</a>. He loved stars of both varieties. There are boxes devoted to Galileo, to the movements of planets and celestial light; and there are shrines to his heroines, who included the Christian Scientist Mary Baker Eddy, the Austrian dancer <a href=\"http://chagalov.tumblr.com/post/19241133978/tilly-losch-1928-by-e-o-hoppe-see-more\">Tilly Losch</a> and, in the 1950s, Audrey Hepburn (who sent the box he made for her straight back).</p> \n<p>Cornell’s contemporaries hailed him as America’s first home-grown surrealist and this show contains several gifts for Max Ernst, as well as rather too many Ernst-inspired collages. This is the least interesting aspect of his art. What he did with the boxes was to combine painting, collage and sculpture into miniature alternative worlds. You peer through the glass into these alien places, and what you see may be both captivating and incomprehensible.</p> \n<p>The Royal Academy show is a concise survey of his work, with <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/joseph-cornell\">more than 80 works</a> theatrically spotlit in the subfusc gloom of the Sackler Galleries, emphasising the outlandish aspects of Cornell’s personality and art. They were made in the basement of the undistinguished house he shared with his widowed mother and disabled brother in Flushing, New York. And though much has been made of the biographical elements of his art – Cornell practically lived on sugar: sweet wrappers glitter inside glass bottles on his pseudo-pharmacy shelves – what they mainly convey are his solitary passions.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.penccil.com/gallery.php?p=375206503402\">Observatory sequence</a>, with their midnight blue skies, clouds fashioned out of bleached wood and planetary movements represented by bangles and curtain hooks strung on tiny railings, are like 3D diagrams made by a child. The multitude of tiny pigeonholes, each filled with a white ball positioned at a different but equally unfathomable angle, is like a puzzle that only a savant could solve.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d315d0b3d84b27a3f2646bd54b9954778314f68f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435853199750/a2d2ef1a-9b7c-4b7b-a34b-80943ce93add-384x420.jpeg\" alt=\"'A bewitching vision': Cornell's Untitled (Tilly Losch), 1935-38.\" width=\"384\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A bewitching vision’: Cornell’s Untitled (Tilly Losch), 1935-38.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph and Robert Cornell Memorial Foundation/VAGA, NY/DACS, London 2015</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And what is the latent emotion in the “portrait” of <a href=\"http://chagalov.tumblr.com/post/19241133978/tilly-losch-1928-by-e-o-hoppe-see-more\">Tilly Losch</a>? A young girl in a crinoline rises high above snow-covered mountains, borne up on fragile strings, her dress the basket of an invisible hot-air balloon. It is a most bewitching vision of weightless balletic grace yet there is something sinister in the red bead that dangles from her hands. It feels like Cornell’s own private emblem.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2015/jun/30/joseph-cornell-wanderlust-review-royal-academy-of-arts\">Joseph Cornell: Wanderlust review – like being lost in a wondrous Victorian attic</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Medici children lost in time, encased behind sepia-tinted glass; the facades of exotic hotels where Cornell never stayed; the book wrapped in blue velvet and sealed, its contents never to be revealed: there is both secrecy and nostalgia in these containments. The boxes preserve a memory, an act of worship or the ghost of a hope. Look at the dressing room for Watteau’s lonely pierrot Gilles, done out in uplifting harlequin paper.</p> \n<p>Most poignant is the <a href=\"http://www.wikiart.org/en/joseph-cornell/toward-the-blue-peninsula-1952\">memorial box</a> for <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/emilydickinson\">Emily Dickinson</a>, <em>Toward the Blue Peninsula</em>, inspired by the Amherst bedroom where she wrote her poetry.

An analogy might be drawn between these two isolated artists, and the fragile scale of the work they made, but Cornell would have shied away from any comparison with such a singular genius. His work is not just modest in size, it is also humble.</p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435852622614/cornell-palace-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Joseph Cornell, Palace, 1943: 'like the phantom land in a fairytale'.

Iain worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office so we lived, worked and adventured together for seven years in Delhi and Geneva. In October 2013, Iain was diagnosed with a brain tumour, and on 7 December 2014, he died in our bed at home. On that morning, my husband, our hoped for family and my future roadmap of work and travel for the next 40 years, all vanished in one shuddering breath. We were both 33.</p> \n<p>Six months along this single-track pathway, I’m repeatedly aware I have to rebuild and reshape my life – a life I can’t remember distinct from Iain. If your partner dies, a lot of admin also comes your way. And, these days, people die a digital death alongside their physical one, which creates a whole new world of admin that didn’t pass the radar of grieving widows 50 years ago. Those 20th-century widows would have had a box of love letters and a few hard copy photos; I have Facebook messages, professional videos on YouTube, personal videos on my iPhone, email histories, recorded Skype chats, WhatsApp conversations, text messages and digital photos – photos galore. And all this from a marriage with someone who never really liked spending time online. He set out his stall at 18 announcing that he wouldn’t be getting a mobile phone because they “seem pretty annoying, I doubt they’ll catch on”.</p> \n<p>I’ve found at least one blog that tries to make sense of it all. <a href=\"http://www.thedigitalbeyond.com\" title=\"\">The Digital Beyond</a>, which offers a “go-to source for archival, cultural, legal and technical insights, to help you predict and plan for the future of your online content”. Along with “scatter tubes” – tubes with a perforated lid for transporting and scattering ashes – and bespoke jewellery made from ashes, it’s another blossoming industry I never knew existed.</p> \n<p>The blog lists 54 online companies that deal specifically with aspects of dying or, more commonly, the legacy of memories online. I’m slightly spooked by the number of websites that help you send posthumous messages to your friends and relatives. <a href=\"http://tolovedones.com\" title=\"\">ToLovedOnes</a>, for example, will send letters after your death, calculating the dates they are posted “with 95% accuracy from public records”. Which just leaves me worrying about the 5% of people who receive the letters when their relative is still alive.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://knotify.me/\" title=\"\">Knotify.me</a>, meanwhile, is a free app that answers the question you never knew you had; “What happens to all my online accounts if I get amnesia, Alzheimer’s or if I leave this world?” It helps you set future notifications for your family or yourself, so “nothing of your digital life will be wasted”. <a href=\"http://www.rememberedvoices.com\" title=\"\">Remembered Voices</a> lets you record your voice and play it back to people after you’ve died, <a href=\"http://www.cirruslegacy.com\" title=\"\">Cirrus Legacy</a> stores digital assets in a single place online, so your executor can access them easily. That would have been helpful, in fact. Terry Pratchett was in the know – his recent death was announced in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terryandrob\" title=\"\">a series of tweets from his own account</a>.</p> \n<p>Just as we’re playing catch up with technology, the technology developers themselves are in the same position. Dying, understandably, didn’t feature highly in Facebook’s early risk registers. Which might be why it was in trouble recently for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32193923\" title=\"\">locking a grieving mother out of her teenage daughter’s Facebook account</a>, despite having her daughter’s permission to use it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I hadn’t anticipated the outpouring of love from around the world. There were messages from Japan, Pakistan, Chile …</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>When someone dies, Facebook tends to “memorialise” their account – freeze them so they can be viewed, but providing no access to past messages. I read that and panicked: I didn’t want that to happen, so grabbed my laptop and logged in urgently as Iain. Once in though, I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do – it didn’t feel right reading personal messages to and from other people. They weren’t for me. If he’d left a box of letters, would I have read those? People store important letters, but online messages are kept just because we don’t press delete. Should I read his emails? I didn’t. But I read and reread our text message conversations, which lifted me up so high it felt like we were actually chatting. Then when I got to the end and there were no more, it was a bad, long fall from there. So I decided memorialising was OK.</p> \n<p>Facebook also offended a fair number of bereaved people with its Year in Review clips, in which photographs that attracted the most comments were automatically selected to reappear on your timeline under the words “Here’s what your year looked like”. The problem was that for some, these were pictures of dead loved ones. And, however comforting photos and associated memories can be, out of the blue and at the wrong moment on your computer screen they can cause havoc if you are grieving.</p> \n<p>The bereaved: an oversensitive minority population, you may think, but the numbers involved are bigger than you may realise. Based on Facebook’s growth rate, and the age breakdown of its users over time, probably 10 to 20 million people who created Facebook profiles have since died. Even if Facebook closed registration tomorrow, the number of deaths per year will continue to grow for decades, as the 2000-2020 school generations grow old. And the peak? <a href=\"http://www.webpagefx.com/blog/internet/happens-online-presence-die-infographic/\" title=\"\">Nasa physicist turned full-time cartoonist Randall Munroe </a>estimates that if Facebook falls out of favour with young generations, as many social media sites do, the point at which there will be more users who have died than are living is around 2060. And if Facebook continues to thrive, that’s more like 2130.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"446d2d3ace6429d1c51d5f64623022c365f95944\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435683664595/a89fcfc8-bc81-4bb2-9d8f-6c76c959b4e4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Caroline and Iain in 1999, when they were still at school.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline and Iain in 1999, when they were still at school.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the hours and immediate few days after Iain died, I turned to the memorial website built overnight by a kind colleague to celebrate my man’s life. A bewildered and floundering group of Iain’s closest friends and family immersed ourselves in a world of photos and memories and words and purpose. Three days later, all within half an hour, the website went live, an email to the worldwide Foreign and Commonwealth Office workforce went out and I put a “global announcement” on Facebook. “Informing friends of the deceased”, 21st-century style. I changed my profile to black, shut my laptop and left the house; the internet did its thing – with speed, breadth and a rush of wildfire.</p> \n<p>I hadn’t anticipated the outpouring of love from around the world. Within minutes there were messages from Japan, Pakistan, Chile … the inhabitants of our interconnected world, suddenly spinning inwards to be connected by shock and grief, then spinning out again to their own physical pockets around the world.</p> \n<p>Today, one of the things I cherish most is an eight-second video of Iain telling me he loves me. There’s something about seeing him as if in real life and hearing his voice, that is just quite incredible. The only downside is that it’s far too short. And it’s all I’m going to get now. I wish I had more videos – they are by far the hardest thing to look at right now, but I sense that one day they will be some of the most precious things I have.</p> \n<p>Otherwise a huge comfort and unity online has come from a network for younger people whose partners have died – <a href=\"https://www.widowedandyoung.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Way (Widowed and Young)</a>. In the past month, I’ve got to know some of the 1,500 people in that group by seeing their biggest fears, their “smallest” achievements, their practical worries and their rallying strength posted online in a closed group. A sub-set of our society, normal people living normal lives that suddenly know tragedy and are thrust together in their confusion and loneliness and upset.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I've discovered that when you cry lying on your back, your tears slide into your ears, which fill up and feel strange</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I don’t use the rest of Facebook so much now – I posted a positive few things early on and hadn’t expected so many instantaneous likes and messages saying I was “amazing”. It was too surreal to be told that when you’re barely able to hold a conversation in real life, and it made me feel strange. I’m certainly not going to start covering Facebook with the reality of the new world I have found myself living in since Iain’s death – people don’t go there to see the truth if it’s not pretty.</p> \n<p>So, after I put my phone aside each evening and disconnect myself from my online communities, the moment just after my head hits the pillow is when the reality of my sadness becomes so stark. The moment I go from being exhausted to somehow feeling wide awake, when I feel so, so solo. I look over at Iain’s side of the bed and just his picture grins back at me. I poke my toe over the cold sheet and I wonder how it can be that he was right there, and now he’s not. I think about friends in their homes, with their favourite people breathing quietly beside them. I think of people listening out for babies in other rooms. For their children stirring. I want to say, “Imagine none of those people are in your house now, imagine that silence. And imagine it’s for always.” That’s how alone it feels.</p> \n<p>As I lie there I wonder, have I fallen off the end of the world? I’ve discovered that when you cry while you’re lying on your back, your tears slide into your ears, which fill up and feel strange. I shake my head. And at some point I fall asleep. And then I wake up too early and feel the same.</p> \n<p>As I take the commuter train, I look at everyone on their smartphones. I imagine there are others also scrolling through pictures of their families, just as I am with photos of Iain. I see a message from a lady, a new friend, whose husband also died of a brain tumour a few days before Iain – we’ve never met but have shared such a similarly traumatic story that we’re linked to each other now. As I go to reply, I’m aware that we’d never have connected if this had been 1915, not 2015.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/\" title=\"\"><em>thebraintumourcharity.org</em></a></p> \n<p><em>Caroline Twigg has written a book to help bereaved children.

People should watch it. They should sit their freakin’ kids down and say, think about this technology. Think about people who worked on this for 25&nbsp;years to bring this knowledge… It’s a long way to go to the outer edge, the very edge of the solar system.”</p> \n<p>The headquarters of the <a href=\"http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/\" title=\"\">New Horizons mission is the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory</a>, in Laurel, Maryland. A mural outside the New Horizons mission control room reads “The Year of Pluto.”</p> \n<p>Even at the speed of light, a one-way message to or from New Horizons requires a 4.5-hour trip. When sending a message, APL technicians have to aim where the spacecraft will be 4.5 hours in the future, the way a clay-pigeon shooter aims in front of the target.</p> \n<p>Many people at APL have been with New Horizons since the launch in 2006. “We know this spacecraft very well. It’s our baby,” said <a href=\"http://www.jhuapl.edu/employment/meet/bowman.asp\" title=\"\">Alice Bowman</a>, the mission operations manager. “It went through its toddler stage where it was a little ornery.”</p> \n<p>The spacecraft’s main computer rebooted itself occasionally. Her team has had to upload corrective software. Even with advanced technology, she said, “There’s always risks involved when you’re sending 1s and 0s across billions of miles of space.”</p> \n<p>Stern keeps on display in his office the August 1970 issue of National Geographic describing a future “grand tour” of the planets by robotic spacecraft. An article foretold a visit to Pluto in 1986. Nasa’s two Voyager spacecraft carried out the grand tour, flying past Jupiter and Saturn, with Voyager 2 going all the way to Uranus and Neptune, but the best route for studying Saturn and its huge moon Titan didn’t permit Voyager 2 to visit Pluto, Stern said.</p> \n<p>Moreover, Nasa didn’t realise, when it put together the Voyager programme, that there are thousands of icy objects beyond Neptune’s orbit – a region dubbed the Kuiper Belt. The two Voyager spacecraft turned off their cameras once they reached that region of supposedly empty space, said <a href=\"http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/profile.cfm?Code=GreenJ\" title=\"\">Nasa director of planetary science Jim Green</a>.</p> \n<p>“We believe there are tens of thousands of Kuiper Belt objects,” Green said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4f60242dab8603cf76051ca9ba1784d5d672df2c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673640701/400e5aea-f07e-4759-91db-131fd32c5254-460x259.jpeg\" alt=\"Solar System\" width=\"460\" height=\"259\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A stylized view of the solar system.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mopic/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The scientists behind New Horizons say the mission will help us understand the origin and evolution of the solar system.</p> \n<p>Already, the little spaceship’s long-range camera has detected intriguing patterns on the surface of Pluto that scientists cannot easily explain. The tiny world may have mountains and valleys, possibly frozen methane lakes or even a liquid water ocean far beneath the frozen surface. Or maybe Pluto has no topography at all and is just a smooth ball covered in a deep layer of nitrogen slush.</p> \n<p>Stern said he began pushing for a Pluto mission in 1988. Nasa considered numerous proposals before deciding, in 2001, to go with the New Horizons mission, which called for a relatively inexpensive, no-frills spacecraft using off-the-shelf technology.</p> \n<p>The probe rode into space one afternoon in 2006 on an Atlas V rocket, reaching record-breaking velocity. Before the day was out, it had flown past the orbit of the moon.</p> \n<p>A gravity boost from Jupiter shortened the Pluto trip by three years. “You had to hit a little keyhole in space near Jupiter,” said project scientist Hal Weaver.</p> \n<p>New Horizons will come within 12,550km of Pluto’s surface at its closest approach. Because of the way the instruments and the antennae are configured, New Horizons cannot observe Pluto and simultaneously transmit data to Earth. Normally, it does one or the other. But the flyby is so fast, and such a precious opportunity, that the spacecraft will focus entirely on Pluto during the 14&nbsp;July encounter, at the cost of leaving the scientists and engineers back home in suspense.</p> \n<p>Scientists and prominent officials will have a countdown to the flyby, and they will celebrate at 11.49am GMT, but they won’t know for a while whether the spacecraft survived the encounter. They’ll get a simple batch of data – a health report about 11 hours later. A very bad scenario would involve red alarms going off.</p> \n<p>“The worst case is we don’t hear at all,” Stern said.</p> \n<p>His team came up with 249 contingencies,or problems, ranging from power brownouts on the spacecraft to a catastrophic fire at mission control. The biggest concern has been debris around Pluto.</p> \n<p>Pluto has five moons, the largest of which, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/1999/jan/27/timradford\" title=\"\">Charon</a>, is half Pluto’s size. The four smaller moons of Pluto don’t have much of a gravitational field. When a rock from space strikes one of these moons, debris hurtles into orbit around Pluto and Charon.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/1999/jan/27/timradford\">There may be life on Pluto's moon, say Nasa scientists</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“There could be boulder-sized particles strewn all over the place,” Green said.</p> \n<p>The scientists think New Horizons will probably sail through the Pluto system without any nasty collisions. Probably. “My biggest worry is something we haven’t thought of,” Stern said.</p> \n<p>In the early 20th century, there were only eight known planets, but <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/the-h-word/2012/aug/06/mapping-mars-history\" title=\"\">astronomer Percival Lowell</a> believed there must be a ninth, “Planet X,” which had perturbed the orbit of Neptune. Lowell died before he could find it, and astronomers today question his calculations.</p> \n<p>In 1930, Clyde Tombaugh, an astronomer working at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, stumbled on an object beyond the orbit of Neptune that was moving with respect to the background stars. Tombaugh’s object became known as Pluto, for the Roman god of the underworld, with a nod, in the first two letters, to Percival Lowell.</p> \n<p>Its status as a planet became controversial a decade ago after astronomers discovered that the solar system’s outer regions are crowded with icy worlds. Amid a raging debate, the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2006/aug/24/starsgalaxiesandplanets.spaceexploration1\" title=\"\">International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto</a> as a “dwarf planet.”</p> \n<p>Nasa’s Jim Green is dismissive of the controversy: “That’s nomenclature. To me, that’s unimportant. What’s important is that this is a body well worth going to. It represents a brand-new frontier.”</p> \n<p>Does Alan Stern think Pluto is still a legitimate, no-qualifiers “planet”? “Of course I do!” he said. “It has all the attributes of a planet. Screw the astronomers! Would you go to a podiatrist for brain surgery? They don’t know what they’re talking about!”</p> \n<p><em>This article appeared in </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\"><em>the Guardian Weekly</em></a><em>, which incorporates articles from the Washington Post</em></p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435135419965/New-Horizons-spacecraft-o-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"New Horizons spacecraft over dwarf planet Pluto and its moon Charon.
