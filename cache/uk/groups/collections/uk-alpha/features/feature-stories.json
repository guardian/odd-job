The programme, written and presented in “swinging” 1960s London, was thrilling and dynamic, and it made a star of Macnee and his sidekicks Honor Blackman (as Cathy Gale) and Diana Rigg (as Emma Peel).</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/gallery/2015/jun/26/patrick-macnee-life-in-pictures\">Patrick Macnee's life – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In 1960, the series Police Surgeon, produced by ABC with Ian Hendry as its star, had come to an end. The writer <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/12/brian-clemens\">Brian Clemens</a> was asked to devise a show on similar lines, but more light-hearted, and came up with The Avengers, in which Hendry would be a doctor, David Keel, being helped in his search for revenge on the drug-dealer killers of his lover by a shady and enigmatic man, John Steed, from some mysterious intelligence service.</p> \n<p>The show was immediately popular, with Hendry and Macnee investigating assassinations, lethal radioactivity, missing scientists and political extremists. Macnee was told to develop the character of Steed in any way he fancied. “They were very sweet people and they just gave me the name,” he recalled. “They said: ‘Have you read the James Bond books? Go away and make up a character.’”</p> \n<p>When Hendry left the show after the first series, the emphasis shifted towards the flamboyant Steed. From the time the series took root in 1961 until 1969 when it was wound up, and by which time a third female sidekick, Tara King (played by Linda Thorson) had joined him, Macnee as Steed was the constant factor.</p> \n<p>He reprised the role in 1976 when Clemens launched The New Avengers, which partnered Macnee with Gareth Hunt (as Mike Gambit) and Joanna Lumley (as Purdey), and ran for two series. Macnee claimed that Steed was based on his own ironic approach to life. During the second world war, many of his friends had been killed, he said, and he had acquired a “wry detachment” which he liked to think he had infused into The Avengers.</p> \n<p>Macnee was born in London, the son of Daniel, a racehorse trainer at Lambourn, Berkshire, and his wife, Dorothea (nee Hastings), a niece of the Earl of Huntingdon. Macnee claimed that his family life had been chaotic and was dominated by a “tight group of women”. He was sent to boarding school – Summerfields, Oxford – at the age of five and then to Eton, where he recalled being whipped. While at Eton, he opened a betting book, helped by the racing tips passed on to him by his father. He also raced his own greyhound at the dog track in nearby Slough.</p> \n<p>Macnee later said that he felt that first school and then the armed forces (in 1942 he went into the Royal Navy and commanded a motor torpedo boat) stifled his emotions. It was to escape this psychological straitjacket that his thoughts turned to the stage. He won a place at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, London, and became a leading man at Windsor Rep.</p> \n<p>Unimpressed by the overall prospects in post-war Britain, he went off to Canada, where there were opportunities for young actors on TV. He sent much of his earnings back to his wife, the actor Barbara Douglas, whom he had married in 1942. He also took parts in many US TV shows and stage productions. In 1949 he appeared in a TV version of Macbeth and in 1953 was in Othello. In 1951 he played the young Jacob Marley in the film of Scrooge (A Christmas Carol in the US). He was working in London in a rare production role, on the documentary series Winston Churchill: The Valiant Years, when he was offered the part in The Avengers.</p> \n<p>He appeared in more than 150 stage plays from his 20s to his 70s, including the Broadway production of Sleuth in the early 1970s and the leading role in Killing Jessica in the West End of London in 1986-87. He played both Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson several times. A memorable big-screen part was as Sir Denis Eton-Hogg in This Is Spinal Tap (1984). He was also in The Howling (1981) and the Bond film A View to a Kill (1985).</p> \n<p>The cult status of The Avengers continued to grow, and in 1990 a recording of Kinky Boots made by Macnee and Blackman and first released by Decca in February 1964, which at the time had failed to reach the charts, made the UK top 10. In 1998 a film version of The Avengers, starring Ralph Fiennes as Steed and Uma Thurman as Emma Peel, featured Macnee as the voice of Invisible Jones. The following year he appeared with his former New Avengers co-star Lumley in a TV adaptation of Rosamunde Pilcher’s Nancherrow (1999).</p> \n<p>Macnee’s first marriage ended in divorce, as did his second, to the actor Kate Woodville. His third wife, Baba Sekely, died in 2007. He is survived by the two children of his first marriage, Rupert and Jenny.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Daniel Patrick Macnee, actor, born 6 February 1922; died 25 June 2015</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/mar/03/dennis-barker\">Dennis Barker</a> died earlier this year</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435261765199/patrick-macnee-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Patrick Macnee as Steed in The Avengers, 1968.

In a 1997 interview he recalled being told by producers that he would have to use a gun on the show.</p> \n<p>“I said, ‘No, I don’t. I’ve been in World War II for five years and I’ve seen most of my friends blown to bits and I’m not going to carry a gun.’ They said: ‘What are you going to carry?’ I thought frantically and said: ‘An umbrella.’”</p> \n<p>As well as Macnee and Diana Rigg, The Avengers – and its 1970s reboot The New Avengers – also made stars of Honor Blackman, Joanna Lumley, Linda Thorson, Gareth Hunt and Ian Hendry.</p> \n<p>The show was noted for a progressive approach to feminism, with the female stars being more than a match for Steed. <br /></p> \n<p>Macnee said the show paved the way for women to play leading action roles on television. “It just seemed that a woman would make the ideal foil to my John Steed. And so she did,” he told The Lady magazine last year.<br /></p> \n<p>“The wonderful thing was it made women feel they didn’t just belong in an apron in front of a stove cooking for the kids. It made them delight in the awareness that they could get out there and do it all, fight men, take on villains, all the kinds of stuff we showed in The Avengers.”</p> \n<p>When asked which of his original co-stars – Blackman as Cathy Gale, Rigg as Emma Peel, or Thorson as Tara King – were most appealing, Macnee replied: “The very first thing you learn if you’re a gentleman is that you never compare one woman to another. That’s the way of all death. You get a big pointed high heel in your groin and you’ll never walk again!”</p> \n<p>Macnee was born in London in 1922 and attended Eton College and the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art before serving in the Royal Navy during the second world war.</p> \n<p>After the war he won minor stage and film roles but went to Canada and the United States in search of work, only returning to Britain to make The Avengers. He was almost 40 when it first aired.</p> \n<p>Macnee received 2.5% of the show’s profits and the show is still broadcast around the world. It was also released as a DVD box set in 2011 to celebrate its 50th anniversary. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ed0ff73b3d5ac62927ebf45e9bd38c21bed4404a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435260520590/9593b879-8746-4a6a-bdf2-3119e12bfe49-460x426.jpeg\" alt=\"Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee pictured in a scene from The Avengers.\" width=\"460\" height=\"426\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee pictured in a scene from The Avengers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He explained its ongoing popularity thus: “It’s a very simple reason: It’s extremely good. I feel very justified and delighted in seeing after all these years that the show works.”<br /></p> \n<p>Fans are less inclined to remember a poorly received film adaptation in 1998 that starred Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman. </p> \n<p>Macnee also made memorable appearances in This is Spinal Tap and The Howling.<br /></p> \n<p>He had three wives, with his first marriage being to Barbara Douglas at the age of 19. The couple had two children, Rupert and Jenny.</p> \n<p>He left for Canada in search of work when the children were aged just five and three. “I will always feel bad about that,” he said in one interview. <br /></p> \n<p>However, Macnee made up for that failing later in life, his son once said. “I was a teenager when he became a TV star in England,” recalled Rupert, a documentary filmmaker. “He was one of those dads you didn’t feel ashamed to introduce to your friends. He was very cool.”</p> \n<p>Macnee married actress Kate Woodville in 1965, but they divorced four years later. His final marriage was in 1988 to Baba Majos de Nagyzsenye, who died in 2007.</p> \n<p>The actor spent the past four decades living in Palm Springs and Rancho Mirage in Coachella Valley, California. </p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/c03dbd1ded2a68745bc211c2d15b47de965a9216/131_335_3126_1875/3126.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1875,"width":3126,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"TVT/SCOPEFEATURES.COM","altText":"Patrick Macnee with his second Avengers co-star, Diana Rigg.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: TVT/SCOPEFEATURES.COM"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435260521618/9593b879-8746-4a6a-bdf2-3119e12bfe49-2060x1906.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1906,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee pictured in a scene from The Avengers.

They are old, but still healthy, still work – maybe at the local dairy plant.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72cf6ca4cb7d1b110255bfc9605117e2df34f51a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435248683961/260a4ff5-a9bc-4ffe-800c-7ab396c4da24-460x460.jpeg\" alt=\"Chuvashia\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chuvashia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Albina Shaymuratova/The Calvert Journal/Russia Research project</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c719d1f06a79d27ef6dedc1e0ee0611c198bc8a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435248806584/a55732a7-c9a7-4638-aa8b-6663fb389d37-460x369.jpeg\" alt=\"Ioshkar-Ola, Mari El.\" width=\"460\" height=\"369\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ioshkar-Ola, Mari El.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Sher/The Calvert Journal/Russia Research project</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dmitry Khankin, a partner at Triumph Gallery, says that by allowing artists to approach the subject of social customs and folklore, the nuances that might otherwise be overlooked by anthropologists or other professionals can come to the fore: “As strange as it sounds, artists with a strong social conscience are able to measure processes that scientists sometimes aren’t able to see.”</p> \n<p>The Ministry of Culture in Moscow has so far supported two exhibitions, but hasn’t given a grant for the whole projects.

Paris’s inner ring road runs around the French capital, following the city’s administrative boundaries almost perfectly and connecting the city proper and its <em>banlieues</em>, or suburbs.</p> \n<p>Since its inauguration in 1973, the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique</em> – measuring 40 to 60 metres wide and composed of up to six lanes – has been a concrete belt around Paris, making all too real what should have remained an invisible administrative boundary. This has reinforced the insurmountable contrast between Paris and the city’s adjacent municipalities, adding a physical dimension to political borders and separating the <em>Parisiens</em> from the rest of France.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/artanddesign/richard-rogers\">Architect Richard Rogers</a>, who <a href=\"http://www.rsh-p.com/projects/grand-paris/#\">designed a strategic plan for the city</a>, said: “I don’t know of any other city where the heart is as detached from its limbs.” A number of <a href=\"http://www.apur.org/note/evolution-voies-rapides-autoroutes-urbaines-grand-paris-etude-trame-viaire-coeur-agglomeration?nocache=1\">studies</a> published this year by <a href=\"http://www.apur.org/sites/default/files/documents/voies_rapides_autoroutes_urbaines_trame_viaire.pdf\">Atelier Parisien d’Urbanisme</a>, the public agency in charge of urban studies, qualifiy almost the whole <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique</em> as a “challenge for urban integration”.</p> \n<p>As a result, on the first day of 2016, the M&eacute;tropole du Grand Paris will come to life. The MGP aims to deliver a “more integrated development” to Paris and its suburbs, by creating a new metropolitan governance. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Paris’s boundaries ​​are defined by its fortifications – displaying a rather medieval approach to city planning</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The City of Paris and its 2.3 million inhabitants will be merged with its <em>petite couronne</em> (“small crown”, or inner suburbs), adding about 4.6 million residents and an extra 128 local authorities to form a new metropolitan institution: the Grand Paris.</p> \n<p>Where New York, Berlin and London have successfully created metropolitan governments, can Paris overcome its inner boundary, and convince inhabitants of Paris proper and the suburbs that they are all <em>Parisiens</em>? And to achieve this, should it sacrifice the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique, </em>the city’s most prominent physical and symbolic boundary?</p> \n<p>The roots of the division between Paris and its suburbs run much deeper than the building of the road in the 1970s. To understand the significance, we need to go back to the fall of Napoleon. In March 1814, the Battle of Paris saw the defeat of the Napoleonic troops and Prussian forces storming the capital city.</p> \n<p>Consequently, King Louis-Philippe and French prime minister Adolphe Thiers decided to transform Paris into a fortress and protect the city from any further intrusion, ordering construction of city fortifications in the 1840s. Completed in 1844, the message was clear: Paris’s boundaries were to be defined by its fortifications – displaying a rather medieval approach to city planning.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2ba325c542c89c93164acfbe3991179e44c0c08b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435142826762/a26bb22c-0eae-4734-b63d-70b9814783ee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Informal settlements mushroomed within the fortifications’ no-building zone.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Informal settlements mushroomed within the fortifications’ no-building zone.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: gallicalabs.bnf.fr</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Consisting of a thick wall, 10 metres high and protected by a wide ditch, the ramparts were also granted a 250-metre wide non-building zone.

To put this into perspective, Berlin destroyed its last fortifications in 1740; London in 1760.</p> \n<p>In Paris, the defunct fortifications were replaced at the beginning of the 1930s by a grand scheme of social housing. Yet the Zone remained untouched, full of <em tabindex=\"-1\">zonards</em> (still a deprecating term for someone from a deprived area who loiters suspiciously) and their insalubrious housing.</p> \n<p>While the idea of an orbital road around Paris emerged in the 1920s, it was only in 1956 that the construction of the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em tabindex=\"-1\">riph</em><em tabindex=\"-1\">&eacute;</em><em tabindex=\"-1\">rique</em> started. It addressed the increase in inner-city car use, and similar schemes were designed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2014/jul/08/congestion-roads-hell-urban-motorways\" draggable=\"true\">in cities around the world</a>.

All along the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique, </em>the entrances to Paris are still named <em>portes</em>, as they are located where the fortifications’ gates used to stand. Walking from Porte Dor&eacute;e to Porte de la Chapelle, I encounter various types of transition between Paris and its <em>banlieues</em>. In some places, the transition is smooth and painless: the tunnel of the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique</em> allows Parisians to easily access the Bois de Vincennes – one of Paris’s “green lungs”, which sits outside the boundary but is under Paris’s jurisdiction. Where Paris connects with the well-off cities of Saint-Mand&eacute; and Vincennes, several effortless transitions are in place, allowing residents to move easily from one area to another, as resident Doroth&eacute;e confirms.</p> \n<p>In 1932, Doroth&eacute;e’s in-laws moved into a housing block built in the place of the fortifications; she moved into the flat herself in 1969, as the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique</em> was being completed. Living on the edge of the 12th arrondissement, she is within walking distance of Saint-Mand&eacute; and Vincennes. “In other spots, such as Porte de Montreuil, it’s really different – there is a real break between Paris and [those suburbs]. But here, we are well connected. There’s a real continuity.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"adaa436eea8d8a3e2ead44cae0640d0b189f6b92\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435072979227/bb148eaa-b8a6-4fde-ae7f-dbb40e0ff9cc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The compact and humble houses evoke rural France\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The compact and humble houses evoke rural France</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Porte de Montreuil, a few kilometres up the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique,</em> offers a starker contrast between Paris and the adjacent environs of Montreuil and Bagnolet. The roundabout, which connects the area with the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique</em> by means of four access roads, is empty of almost any pedestrian or bicycle – and, although the Rue d’Avron on the Paris side and the Rue de Paris on Montreuil’s side are very busy thoroughfares, they do not connect. <br /></p> \n<p>B&eacute;n&eacute;dicte, a Montreuil resident, describes the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique </em>as a “ditch between Montreuil and Paris”. While the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique</em> running below the roundabout leaves a wide void between the two areas, how it is built – its height, architectural style and condition – on each side of the road reveals another level of divide.</p> \n<p>In Montreuil and Bagnolet, alongside glossy new office buildings sits the traditional suburban housing stock: 19th-century houses that are one or two storeys high. With its compact and humble houses, sometimes left in ruins, the streetscape evokes rural France, not the core of the wealthiest region in Europe. An unlikely vision when you consider that Paris is among the biggest property markets in the world.</p> \n<p>Here you might be only 60 metres away from the capital, but you are not in Paris any more. Cross the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique </em>and the <a href=\"http://www.meilleursagents.com/prix-immobilier/ile-de-france/\">value of properties drops by half</a>, from €6,300 per sq metre in the 20th arrondissement to €3,800 per sq metre in Bagnolet. Yet it has good transport connections, with line 3 of the M&eacute;tro stopping here, plenty of buses to Paris, and docking stations for both Autolib’ and V&eacute;lib’: the self-service car- and bicycle-sharing systems launched by the City of Paris. </p> \n<p>As I continue my orbital journey along the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique</em>, the divide between Paris and its <em>banlieues</em> changes many times. A few hundred metres further, I have to face the Bagnolet Interchange – Paris’s very own spaghetti junction. A few kilometres later sits the Porte des Lilas: here the road has recently been covered, creating a whole new district and a new way to move between Paris and the adjacent town. A couple of kilometres later, arriving at Porte de la Chapelle, the contrast is even more pronounced. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85994052e318dc596849964db6bb08aac09db38c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435074621438/dc1537e1-e3d8-4ed3-8366-edb0a6afa5ba-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Parc de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge was recently resdesigned, but the divide remains.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Parc de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge was recently resdesigned, but the divide remains.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justinien Tribillon</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But there is not only negative feeling for the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique</em>. Carla, a resident of the 19th arrondissement of Paris who works in the nearby town of Colombes, and her colleague Aude, who lives in Saint-Ouen right outside the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique</em>, explain that “not all the points of passage on the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique</em> are the same. For instance, at the Porte Montmartre there are always people, even in the middle of the night. It is always full.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I am very aware of the Paris-banlieue divide, probably because I grew up here: that’s a very Parisian attitude</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite></cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>While some parts of the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique</em> remain a hostile environment for pedestrians, it seems the residents close to the road have found ways to cope with the concrete beast. Sophie, who lives on the edge of Paris’s 18th arrondissement, says “the break between Paris and the <em>banlieue</em> is visible. It’s physical. For instance, the cycle path between Paris and Saint-Ouen stops at the Porte Montmatre, where the <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique</em> starts.” Yet, Anis, from the 17th arrondissement, says: “The <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique</em>, it’s like a rampart, like a wall – but more or less invisible.” B&eacute;n&eacute;dicte from Montreuil adds: “The <em>p</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>riph</em><em>&eacute;</em><em>rique</em> is both a connector and the separation between Paris and its suburbs.”</p> \n<p>Talking with the residents, I realise there is much more to this than just an urban design issue. While the road and its 1.1m daily cars does not help, the reconnection between the city’s heart and its limbs might require more subtle intervention. Perhaps the last wall that will bring down the “invisible rampart” is in fact a psychological one.</p> \n<p>Marko, from Clichy, and B&eacute;n&eacute;dicte believe the <em>banlieue</em> is a myth. B&eacute;n&eacute;dicte, who moved to Montreuil in the 1990s after a lifetime in central Paris, adds that Montreuil was a “compromise”: “My husband [who did not grow up in Paris] had no prejudice about the suburbs.

As he prepares to headline Glastonbury, one writer considers how West became the divisive figure he is</p>","byline":"Ben Westhoff","body":"<p>Hating Kanye West has long been an international pastime. At the Big Chill festival at Eastnor Castle in 2011 he complained that people looked at him “like I’m Hitler”. Footage of him walking with his wife, Kim Kardashian – head down to avoid paparazzi, and then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4C3ijlWcHM\">smashing his head into a street sign</a> – has more than 4m YouTube views. (“I hope the sign is OK,” wrote one commenter, a mild expression of the same disgust for West that prompted petitions in protest at him headlining Glastonbury this year.) </p> \n<p>With Groundhog Day-like timing, West stuck his foot in his mouth earlier this year, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/feb/09/kanye-west-beck-grammy-win-disrespectful-to-inspiration-beyonce\">decrying Beck’s album of the year Grammy award</a>. As was the case with when he <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2009/sep/15/kanye-west-taylor-swift-vma\">protested against Taylor Swift’s win in 2009</a>, he again insisted Beyonc&eacute; was more deserving. Ironically, soon after this year’s Grammys, Swift and Kanye had dinner together at Manhattan restaurant the Spotted Pig, which just happened to be playing Beck’s winning album, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/feb/20/beck-morning-phase-review\">Morning Phase</a>. “I was like, this is kinda good,” Kanye admitted sheepishly in a radio interview, adding that he hadn’t previously heard the work.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2013/jun/17/kanye-west-yeezus-review\">Kanye West: Yeezus – review</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Understanding why Kanye is Kanye first requires understanding what worldwide popularity does to people. To paraphrase an expression, fame crazies, absolute fame crazies absolutely. This is the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/michaeljackson\">Michael Jackson</a> paradigm. When you’re rich and on top of the world, you start peeing on people, or molesting them, or killing them, or killing yourself. </p> \n<p>But what’s truly crazy is that Kanye hasn’t done any of those things. In fact, on the eve of his appearance at Glastonbury, he’s arguably the most critically beloved pop artist of the 21st century so far. From the release of his debut, The College Dropout,<em> </em>in 2004 (which Rolling Stone<em> </em>called one of the 10 best albums of the decade, in any genre) to his most recent work, Yeezus (which <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/musicblog/2013/dec/20/best-albums-2013-kanye-west-number-1\">the Guardian and many others called the best album of 2013</a>), practically no one has been as beloved, by critics and fans alike, for so long. </p> \n<p>So how has he simultaneously become a laughing stock? “The media takes the shit and blows it all out of proportion,” says Fetty Wap, the quickly emerging New Jersey rapper whom West has championed and performed with. He adds that West’s multitude of talents tend to be overlooked because of his antics. But West learned the rules of engagement a long time ago, and nonetheless continues to play the lamb to our slaughter. As a result, he occupies a bizarre place in the zeitgeist – absolutely beloved and absolutely reviled, simultaneously, sometimes by the same people. My wife, for example, adores much of his music but despises him as a person.</p> \n<p>How did this come to pass? It all started at the very beginning of his career. That is, in his pink polo shirt days. </p> \n<h2>A world that is more than fair</h2> \n<p>West’s father was a Black Panther. His mother was arrested at an Oklahoma City lunch counter when she was six, as West explains on his song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgtZHXEmvFQ\">Never Let Me Down</a>, from The College Dropout. “We grew up very aware of racism in this country,” Donda West told VH1, adding: “The political activity was all about making sure that whatever was not just became just.”<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>He believes himself to be the best, and won’t rest until everyone agrees.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>West, too, wants to create a world that is more fair. But his quest for social justice has long dueled with a virulent solipsism. At his worst, he’s concerned only that the world be fair to him. He believes himself to be the best, and won’t rest until everyone agrees. </p> \n<p>That drive has taken him far. As a teenager, he barricaded himself in his room for weeks at a time to work on songs and rhymes. When he found out that producer No ID – the reigning champion Chicago beatmaker in the mid-90s – was the child of his mother’s friend, he began pestering him at all hours, even camping out in his driveway until he came home. “He wouldn’t ever take no [for an answer],” No ID told VH1. West dropped out of college to move to Newark, New Jersey, to be closer to New York’s music industry, and even after blowing up as a producer on Jay Z’s landmark 2001 album The Blueprint,<em> </em>remained unsatisfied. He wanted to be known as a rapper. But owing to his somewhat clunky delivery, and his penchant for unorthodox material (the label brass saw his early single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g\">Jesus Walks</a> as too controversial for radio) he received constant rejection. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ecca7c297de88969931496ee3930bba8f31691f3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435092114001/f5d56222-2aff-4161-b56d-2a9c820234ae-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Collaborators … Jay Z and Kanye West.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Collaborators … Jay Z and Kanye West.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Startraks Photo/Rex Features</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another artist might have toned things down. But West not only needs to be cherished, he needs to be cherished on his own terms. Hence his trademark pink polo shirt and then later, on his Watch the Throne<em> </em>tour with Jay Z, his skirt (er, kilt). Just like his songs pushed barriers, so did his fashion, and his politics too. In 2005 he was one of the first famous rappers to speak out against homophobia, which had long run rampant in hip-hop but is now starting to fade. That’s largely owing to his influence; his close partner Jay Z, of all people, came out in favor of gay marriage in 2012.</p> \n<p>When it’s not drowned out by his self-aggrandising, Kanye can actually be humble. The College Dropout<em> </em>is a grand, politically conscious mission statement that mixes politics, spirituality and existentialism. He champions the sinners (himself included) and the unfortunates who weren’t “supposed to make it past 25”. His characters work menial jobs, dream big dreams, suffer setbacks and find inspiration in the Lord. The College Dropout<em> </em>is a populist work, and that album and its follow-up, Late Registration,<em> </em>remain to many the ideal of what Kanye should<em> </em>be. Sure, he rapped controversial things – “I know the government administers Aids” – but he was voicing fears held by many. “George Bush doesn’t care about black people” may have angered conservative viewers of the Katrina benefit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMEn_KgxqSg\">A Concert for Hurricane Relief</a><em> </em>in 2005, but his admirers believed him to be speaking from the heart, using his platform to attack those without one.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Sure, he rapped controversial things​ – “I know the government administers Aids” – but he was voicing fears held by many</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But the self-focused, self-regarding Kanye always lurked in the background. He stormed out after losing the best new artist award to country singer Gretchen Wilson at the 2004 American Music awards, complaining that he<em> </em>was the best new artist. In hindsight, he was right, but he was convinced of it even before his debut was released. As he told the New York Times<em> </em>of his appearance on the 2003 hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LXZHRI2w7k\">Slow Jamz, with Twista and Jamie Foxx</a>: “I knew when I wrote the line ‘light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson’ I was going to be a big star. At the time, they used to have the Virgin music [stores], and I would go there and just go up the escalator and say to myself, ‘I’m soaking in these last moments of anonymity.’”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkwQbuAGLj4\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YkwQbuAGLj4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Kanye West – Touch the Sky\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>By the middle of the last decade, he was indeed selling millions of records globally. Unfortunately, the powers that be weren’t recognising his genius swiftly enough. In 2006, upset about not winning best video at the MTV Europe Music awards in Copenhagen, he commandeered the stage to announce that his Touch the Sky should have been victorious because it “cost a million dollars. I had Pamela Anderson. I was jumping across canyons and shit. If I don’t win, the award show loses credibility.” Once again, he hadn’t actually seen the winning video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0TvnWRSyr4\">Justice vs Simian’s We Are Your Friends</a>. </p> \n<p>His personality was eclipsing his art, a trend that continued on his 2007 work Graduation. It’s a brilliant album, which anticipated electronic music’s infiltration of hip-hop and contained nearly top-to-bottom hits, including the best-selling single of his career, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g\">Stronger</a>, which sampled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/daft-punk/\">Daft Punk</a>. But that song also contained cringeworthy lines like: “How the hell could you front on me? / There’s a thousand yous, there’s only one of me.” The album is best remembered for its opening-week sales showdown with <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/50cent\">50 Cent</a>, then hip-hop’s biggest star. Kanye cockily believed himself capable of dethroning Fiddy – and he promptly did, forever banishing the Queens gangsta rapper to the realm of bodega drinks and self-help books. </p> \n<p>The death of his mother in 2007 brought West back to Earth, along with his breakup with fiancee Alexis Phifer, whom his mother reportedly hoped he’d marry. These events inspired his 2008 album <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2008/nov/21/kanye-west-808s-heartbreak\">808s &amp; Heartbreak</a>, which was a departure from his previous efforts but again sold gangbusters nonetheless. Largely sung – with extensive use of Auto-Tune – rather than rapped, the work is considered something of an aberration in his career. But it rewards repeated listens, and features West opening up and soberly contemplating his existence like never before. It represents a period of sincere self-reflection in West’s life. Tragedy often brings out the best in artists, and West sought to improve himself as a person and a performer. Shockingly, after being upstaged by <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/lil-wayne\">Lil Wayne</a> at the 2008 New Jersey Summer Jam concert, he promised the audience that he would go back to the drawing board and try harder next time.</p> \n<p>Apparently he was satisfied with the results, because by 2009 he had once again placed himself at the centre of the universe. At the MTV Video Music awards that year, at Radio City Music Hall in New York, he interrupted Taylor Swift to announce that her best female video award winner <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuNIsY6JdUw\">You Belong With Me</a> was, in fact, inferior to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m1EFMoRFvY\">Beyonc&eacute;’s Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)</a>. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/beyonce\">Beyonc&eacute;</a> was horrified, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/taylor-swift\">Swift</a> reportedly started bawling, and the internet began castigating and memeing Kanye relentlessly. Never mind if he had a point; after all, Single Ladies was kind of good. All the viewers at home saw was an egotistical man disrupting the biggest moment of a 19-year-old girl’s life.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Swiftgate utterly shamed Kanye. He apologised, and quickly sought to win back the public’s love</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Swiftgate utterly shamed Kanye. He apologised, and quickly sought to win back the public’s love the best way he knew how: by crafting an amazing album. In 2010 he released the crowdpleasing work <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/musicblog/2010/dec/16/kanye-west-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy\">My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</a>, which received perfect ratings from Pitchfork and many other outlets. It wasn’t entirely a mea culpa; on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ona42jz8w0k\">Monster</a> he declared: “My presence is a present, kiss my ass.” But the album’s centrepiece, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm5iA4Zupek\">Runaway</a>, saw him finally beginning to understand why so many detested him. “Let’s have a toast for the douchebags / Let’s have a toast for the assholes … Baby, I got a plan / Run away as fast as you can.” It was an extraordinary song and an extraordinary album. Admitting culpability is not something one often gets in hip-hop, let alone from its self-declared alpha and omega. </p> \n<h2>I Am a God</h2> \n<p>You know what happens next: West fell off the wagon once again. He was no longer just the “best living or dead, hands down” (as he called himself on Monster) or a king (2011’s Watch the Throne) but now a living, breathing, divine entity. On his 2012 collaborative album <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2012/sep/20/kanye-west-cruel-summer-review\">Cruel Summer</a>,<em> </em>he spit a “new God flow” and deified himself entirely on 2013’s Yeezus. The man who put his faith above his personal ambition on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYF7H_fpc-g\">Jesus Walks</a> now declared <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5p5z5CIxiA\">I Am a God</a>, a song most famous for the line: “Hurry up with my damn croissants.” He wrote the track after suffering a mild rebuke from fashion designer <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/fashion/hedi-slimane\">Hedi Slimane</a>, who told him he could only attend one of his Paris fashion shows if he didn’t attend the others. (As for Kanye’s own foray into haute couture, he initially stumbled, but footwear designs like his Yeezy Boost boots have sold out quickly.)<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge33hrlN2Uc\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ge33hrlN2Uc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Yeezus was experimental and dissonant, and folks attending its corresponding tour were subjected to long, rambling diatribes making his case as a cultural giant of epic proportions, akin to <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/technology/stevejobs\">Steve Jobs</a> or <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/walt-disney-company\">Walt Disney</a>. “Nobody can tell me where I can and can’t go,” Kanye said to W magazine. “Man, I’m the No 1 living and breathing rock star. I am <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/30/axl-rose-critical-of-indonesia-after-public-appeal-fails-to-stop-executions\">Axl Rose</a>; I am <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/doors\">Jim Morrison</a>; I am <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/jimi-hendrix\">Jimi Hendrix</a>.” </p> \n<p>Such boasts ran the gamut from preposterous to plausible, but even when Kanye is correct in proclaiming his greatness, nobody wants to hear him<em> </em>say it. Even the birth of his daughter and his marriage to <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian\">Kim Kardashian</a> have done little to improve his reputation. That’s likely due to his humourlessness. Though Kim is widely perceived as a beautiful airhead, he defends her as a brilliant business mind and entertainer who deserves a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It’s great when a man sticks up for his wife, but one gets the feeling that such comments are really about Kanye himself. While playing him on Saturday Night Live, Jay Pharoah parodied him best: “I turned this woman into an artiste. A philosopher. A intergalactic icon of creativity.”</p> \n<p>Responded Kim’s character: “I’m also blonde now!” </p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/fscottfitzgerald\">F Scott Fitzgerald</a> said there are no second acts in American lives, but that’s not always true. When Kanye rushed the stage again at the Grammys this year – but then turned back, despite Beck’s invitation – Twitter momentarily erupted with a groundswell of support for #yeezy. He was laughing at himself! He’s learned his lesson! But no. In a post-awards interview he again declared himself the true arbiter of greatness, demanding Beck forfeit his album of the year statue to Beyonc&eacute;. Again, the public was disgusted and, again, Kanye is now scrambling to get himself back into our favour.</p> \n<p>And that is fantastic news.</p> \n<p>Expectations are through the roof for new album Swish, which doesn’t yet have a release date. It was originally titled So Help Me God. </p> \n<p>After Yeezus’s abrasiveness, it will be more melodic, and has already borne fruit by way of a number of tracks released in the first months of the year. They have included collaborations with the king of melody himself, Paul McCartney. Recorded in a coastal Mexican house with no back wall, Only One is a sweet, stripped-down ode to his daughter sung from the perspective of his mother, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng1d_7DiEG8\">All Day</a> is revved up and anthemic. Taylor Swift dances vampily in its live video, shot at this year’s Brit awards. Both are nearly perfect Kanye songs. They’re immediately memorable but sound like nothing else on the radio. He also debuted the powerful <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QknWOgo-OA\">Wolves</a> on Saturday Night Live’s<em> </em>40th anniversary broadcast, while another strong Kanye/McCartney collaboration, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt0g4dWxEBo\">FourFiveSeconds</a>, with Rihanna, will appear on her next work. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WibQR0tQ0P8\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WibQR0tQ0P8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Kanye West – Only One\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“This album’s just embracing the music, embracing joy and being of service to the people,” Kanye told New York station Power 105.1 in February. “I just hope people like it and enjoy it.” Among the already converted is Los Angeles hip-hop singer Ty Dolla Sign, who contributed to the Mexico sessions and left positively inspired. “I learned to always do me, no matter what anyone says,” he reported. Certainly, West is an expert on this. That said, it’s clear that following his own vision – without regard to trends or naysayers – is Kanye’s great strength, and something few have the courage to see through. </p> \n<p>Despite rumours that Kanye has cold feet following Kendrick Lamar’s politicised smash hit <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/mar/22/kendrick-lamar-to-pimp-butterfly-review-fearless-in-scope\">To Pimp a Butterfly</a>, Swish<em> </em>is as close to a sure thing as one gets in music. (For one thing, Apple is reportedly interested in debuting it on its new streaming music service.) Yet one can also pretty much guarantee that Kanye will declare its (likely positive) reviews as insufficiently rapturous. And thus will continue the world’s bizarre cycle of Kanye West co-dependency. The more scorn we heap upon him, the harder he will try to please us. One gets the feeling that neither party would have it any other way. </p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434708090471/1c912231-6c94-4b10-afa3-8828f5a3ed7f-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Kanye West","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435092115288/f5d56222-2aff-4161-b56d-2a9c820234ae-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Collaborators … Jay Z and Kanye West.

Since her role in the ban of the town’s most valuable export, she’s become a universally vilified figure. </p> \n<p>For more than two decades, Maua enjoyed booming business propelled by the growth and sale of khat, known locally as miraa, a popular herb whose leaves and stems are chewed for the mild high they offer.</p> \n<p>But last year the UK, home to one of khat’s biggest markets, declared the stimulant a class C drug and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-27991393\">banned all imports</a>, prompting Maua’s rapid descent into economic purgatory.</p> \n<p>Since the early 1990s, Britain has imported between 2,500 to 2,800 tonnes a year, according to the Home Affairs committee. Although in its initial findings the committee could not find a compelling health or social reason to ban khat, May’s argument – that continuing to allow trade in the UK would spawn off an illegal export corridor to other European countries where it is banned – won out in what became<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/mar/31/no-case-ban-khat-organised-crime\"> a controversial cultural debate</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Now that people are no longer making money from miraa, they do not have money to buy food</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Miriti Ngozi</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Now, a year after the legislation was signed, residents in Maua have been hit hard by a shrinking local economy that has left many facing poverty.</p> \n<h2>Losses</h2> \n<p>Edward Muruu is one of the earliest pioneers of the khat export trade. A retired headmaster at a local primary school, he says he has experienced unprecedented losses since the ban came into effect. </p> \n<p>“I used to ferry miraa (khat) from Maua to Nairobi four times a week using 27 Toyota Hilux trucks, where it was repackaged for export. I used to make around &pound;2,100 a month. Now I am lucky if I bring in &pound;250 per month,” he says.</p> \n<p>With the European market gone, the only place left for Muruu to sell his stimulant is Somalia, where consumers now dictate how much they pay – and it’s not much.</p> \n<p>“The other issue with the Somali market is that the only people who can transport miraa to Mogadishu are Kenyan Somalis, meaning that the rest of us drivers have been put out of work,” says a former worker of Muruu’s, who only identified himself as Kanda.</p> \n<p>According to Kanda, if non-Somali drivers attempt the trip they are attacked along the journey. For a town of its size and location, Maua has a disproportionately large number of residents of Somali heritage, most of whom are involved in the khat trade as middlemen. They are also big consumers themselves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9d27969a6dc79ad6a6d065d8cb2cd464a2870a6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435247370237/cc6b0cbf-8345-4884-8903-61b85e30589d-460x347.jpeg\" alt=\"Khat trader in Meru – some 300 kilometres north of Nairobi – deliver the herb on a motorbike.\" width=\"460\" height=\"347\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khat trader in Meru – some 300 kilometres north of Nairobi – deliver the herb on a motorbike.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Maina/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>‘Miraa was the heartbeat of this town’</h2> \n<p>The effects of the London ban have reached everybody in the khat micro-economy, from the big name traders like Muraa to the small fish who depend on the trade for their survival.</p> \n<p>Although Muraa has made investments that have cushioned him against the blows of a deeply depleted income, those at the lower end of the food chain have not been so lucky.</p> \n<p>Miriti Ngozi, chairman of the Miraa Traders Association, says that many farmers and traders are no longer able to pay school fees or even buy enough food for their families.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The miraa trade was the heartbeat of this town; it drove everything else</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Lawrence Kobia</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“You have to understand that in this region, subsistence farming has long been overshadowed by the more prestigious miraa farming. Now that people are no longer making money from miraa, they do not have money to buy food and many families are sleeping hungry,” he says.</p> \n<p>Yet many remain reluctant to uproot their khat crops and plant maize instead, holding on to the hope that their fortunes might one day return.</p> \n<p>Pius Mbiti, a trader in his early 30s, is a qualified vet but says that he makes most of his income from picking and selling the stimulant.</p> \n<p>“On a good day I used to make up to &pound;12 which, when supplemented with earnings from my vet practice, was enough to take care of my family. But since the ban I am lucky if I make even &pound;2 pounds,” he says.</p> \n<p>He cannot rely on animal medicine any more either because farmers no longer have the money to pay for his services.</p> \n<p>This narrative is familiar across the town, with the common refrain being that shutting down miraa imports to London is killing businesses indirectly linked to the herb.</p> \n<p>“The miraa trade was the heartbeat of this town; it drove everything else. With revenue from miraa so drastically low, people no longer have the money to buy things,” says Lawrence Kobia, who owns a bookshop. He says that his sales have plummeted by more than 40% since last year.</p> \n<h2>Seizures</h2> \n<p>In its submissions to parliament, the Home Office committee warned that banning khat would result in the formation of a black market – as seen in the United States and other European countries including Norway and Holland.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/jun/26/ban-khat-uk-war-on-drugs-class-c\">This ban on khat is another idiotic salvo in the UK's disastrous war on drugs | Ian Birrell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Although initially khat sold for between &pound;3 and &pound;4 a kilogram in Britain, the committee reported that if it was banned the price could increase to &pound;318, similar to its price in the US. </p> \n<p>Their predictions turned out to be true: there has been a proliferation of the stimulant in London since the ban.

It’s not Homer Simpson’s catch phrase. It’s not welfare payment by a government.<br /></p> \n<p>Dholes are actually wild canids, efficient predators and communal pack hunters. These rust-coloured carnivores roam the jungles and montane forests of Central and East Asia filling the humid air with whistles, howls and screeches that chill the heart of any sambar deer or wild boar. There have even been reports of dhole packs hounding – and, maybe even, killing – tigers. </p> \n<p>The dhole’s prowess has not kept them off the endangered list, however. According to an as yet unpublished update to the IUCN Red List, there are only 949 to 2,215 breeding dholes left in the wild – that’s less than the world’s breeding tigers. Yet, dholes have been almost wholly ignored by conservationists, researchers and the global public. They are a forgotten predator. </p> \n<p>“Compared to a tiger, a dhole is not very ‘sexy,’” said Kate Jenks, a conservation biologist with the <a href=\"http://mnzoo.org/\">Minnesota Zoo</a> who has spent nine years trapping, collaring and studying dholes in Thailand. “They tend to get overlooked by scientists and conservationists that are more interested in tigers and leopards that live in the same area.” <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f2f3c0f27d1e90f511324a2af689c90de686013\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434741121357/eb89f1f3-9575-4345-b915-27c19de899a6-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"A dhole at the Minnesota Zoo.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dhole at the Minnesota Zoo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tara Harris/Minnesota Zoo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jan Kamler said he was “shocked” to discover that dholes were being ignored “for reasons that still aren’t completely clear.” </p> \n<p>This realisation that dholes had essentially been thrown under the bus by conservationists led Kamler, who is with the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at the University of Oxford, to focus on the species. </p> \n<p>“I made a commitment to do whatever I could to help conserve dholes, and educate the public and conservation community about the plight of this species,” he said. Kamler has since studied the species in three countries. <br /></p> \n<p>For Jenks, though, it was “the challenge” that drew her to this “little-known and poorly-studied” predator. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I consider dholes the most extreme canid given their unique morphological and behavioural traits.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Jan Kamler</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Although little-known, dholes have a plethora of names: the Asiatic wild dog, the red wolf and the whistling dog among them, along with some 40 or so indigenous names. However, the origins of the name ‘dhole’ remain obscure. The canid’s scientific name is <em>Cuon alpinus</em>, and they are the only species in the Cuon genus. In other words, if we lose the dhole we lose an entire evolutionary genus. </p> \n<p>Jenks said that dholes, which are naturally found in low numbers, have suffered heavily from local perceptions as problem predators and “livestock killers.” And, like all other Asian forest species, they are facing massive habitat loss due to rampant deforestation. </p> \n<p>She added that “historically, dholes have had a poor reputation (referred to as ‘pests of the jungles’) and fall into the stereotypical category of ‘the big bad wolf.’”</p> \n<p><strong>The ‘badass’ dhole</strong></p> \n<p>Although extremely adept hunters, dholes are no means a ‘big bad wolf’. At least not in the ‘big’ sense: these canids are surprisingly small. At just 12-18 kilograms, dholes are 30 to 50% the size of your average wolf, making them smaller than many medium-sized dogs. But despite their diminutive stature, Greg McCann, described dholes as “dogs that kill better than cats.” </p> \n<p>McCann, who is the field coordinator for a new NGO called <a href=\"http://habitatid.org/\">Habitat ID</a>, said dholes were “natural born killers” in their ability both to tackle large (and often dangerous) prey like sambar deer, boar and young or injured gaurs – wild bovines that can weigh 50 times more than a dhole. But dholes are also not too proud to hunt smaller game, like monkeys and mouse deer, or to scavenge. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6b8f5a311cc39dc2fa9350e07d173e644e97da4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434744011804/79fece37-1e8f-4f28-8660-25e709a8260f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dhole on camera trap in remote region of Virachey National Park in Cambodia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dhole on camera trap in remote region of Virachey National Park in Cambodia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HabitatID</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I consider dholes the most extreme canid given their unique morphological and behavioural traits, such as including specialised teeth for hypercarnivory ,” said Jan Kamler. Hypercarnivory refers to any animal whose diet is made up of at least 70% meat, so most humans don’t count. </p> \n<p>Kamler added that dhole’s “adaptations for large litters and pack sizes” also made the predator stand out. </p> \n<p>Indeed, one of the keys to the dholes’ hunting ability is its pack size and flexibility. Pack sizes differ depending on the ecosystem and prey availability; they typically include around five-10 members, but sometimes grow as large as 15. However, in the past researchers have reported packs as big as 40 and there are rumours of packs even reaching 100. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>[The sambar] had been disemboweled and trailed its intestines behind it for the distance of twenty feet.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Kenneth Anderson</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Dhole hunting parties are known to employ a variety of tactics to bring down their prey, including splitting into small scouting groups. When successful, dholes don’t suffocate prey with a bite to the throat like a tiger or leopard, but bring their prey down and begin eating. </p> \n<p>“While a few [dholes] chase the animal, others break away in a flanking movement, to run ahead of their quarry and ambush it as it dashes past them,” writes British adventurer and hunter, Kenneth Anderson, in a colourful description of dholes hunting a sambar deer in India from his 1959 book, <em>Nine Man-Eaters and One Rogue</em>. “They emit a series of yelps in a very high pitch, resembling the whistling cry of a bird rather than a dog. The quarry is brought to earth after being attacked by these flankers, which bite out its eyes, disembowel it, hamstring or emasculate it, in their efforts to bring it down. I once saw a sambar pursued by wild-dogs, dash into a pool of water to try to protect itself. It had been disemboweled and trailed its intestines behind it for the distance of 20 feet. Sambar are extraordinarily hardy, and sometimes are literally eaten alive by these dogs, before being killed.”</p> \n<p>It’s no surprise then that McCann called dholes “badass.” </p> \n<p>There is a gentle, communal side to dholes as well, with researchers describing the species as more egalitarian than wolves. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xHGJuKPU2Q\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2xHGJuKPU2Q?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Dhole pack attempts to kill Sambar deer.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Dholes are known to have high levels of amicable behaviour within packs, even among adults, which includes playing and face licking... The alpha pair are dominant but not excessively aggressive towards the beta pack members,” said Kamler, who also noted that unlike wolves, dholes allow pups to eat before any of the other pack members. <br /></p> \n<p>Jenks added that “many questions remain about their social life” and that she’s not convinced that “only one dominant pair breeds” as with wolves.</p> \n<p>“There is not a lot known about dhole packs because they are difficult to find and observe. They are so uniformly marked that there is usually no way to tell apart individuals and it can even be difficult to distinguish between sexes.”</p> \n<p>However, she did say that “dholes seem to be playful and not have such antagonistic encounters between pack members as you might see in wolves.”</p> \n<p>Finally, dholes are also remarkable in that they thrive – and tackle big prey – in regions inhabited by much larger predators. During the Pleistocene, dholes were found across Europe and North America, surviving in a land of sabre-toothed cats and giant bear dogs. </p> \n<p>Today, the species roams regions inhabited by tigers, snow leopard, bears, wolves and leopards. Competition for prey and space can bring dholes into encounters with these other apex carnivores. Observers have captured <a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/dhole/cuon-alpinus/video-11b.html\">videos of dholes</a> harassing and holding their own against tigers. Adventurer Kenneth Anderson, in his same book, describes a conflict between dholes and a tiger, in which the wild canids seemingly win. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80b13ee677a17a3dc4ac617ef514d1509f53ba95\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434741835161/13f6e8c1-cea4-48b8-82aa-9c4e1517b24d-460x320.jpeg\" alt=\"An 1807 painting entitled A Tiger Hunted by Wild Dogs that depicts dholes chasing a tiger.

The other just managed to leap out of danger. The tigress then followed up her momentary advantage by bounding away, to be immediately followed by the five remaining dogs. They were just out of sight when the main pack streamed by, in which I counted twenty-three dogs.”</p> \n<p>The next day, Anderson said his “scouts” found the result of the battle: “They returned about noon, bringing a few fragments of tiger-skin, to report that the dogs had finally cornered their exhausted quarry about five miles away and had literally torn the tigress to pieces.”</p> \n<p>One has to take Anderson on faith as there are no verified stories of dholes actually killing a tiger and such tales may be more legened than reality. According to Jenks, the much more common outcome is likely death by tiger.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d45a6d36adc6e09965f92bd64e8d9e1a8202b46b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434742707976/4a4850f5-2c23-4a2b-9a6f-2a2786a55c53-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dhole on camera trap in Laos. \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dhole on camera trap in Laos.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wildlife Conservation Society-Lao PDR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Scientists believe that the species can coexist because they choose different species and/or different size prey.

The rainforests of Southeast Asia have seen unprecedented destruction over the past fifty years for palm oil, paper, rubber, timber, mining and other commodities. Where forests haven’t been destroyed, they have been fragmented by booming human populations, roads and ever-expanding development projects. </p> \n<p>In 2011, Conservation International <a href=\"http://news.mongabay.com/2011/0202-hance_toptenforests.html \">listed</a> the forests of Indo-Burma (basically continental Southeast Asia) as the world most threatened forest hotspots on the planet. The forests of Indonesia, Borneo, and the Malayan peninsula came it at number three. But recently Indonesia beat Brazil as the world’s <a href=\"http://news.mongabay.com/2014/0629-indonesia-highest-deforestation-rate.html\">biggest forest destroyer</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8816b462e2e4201adc36fb93d93e7e90a4864ed\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434744298445/6a4af1a1-1078-4bf0-a204-35617090fc95-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\" A forest activist inspects land clearing and drainage of peat natural forest located on the concession of PT RAPP (Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper), a subsidiary of APRIL group which is being developed for a pulp and paper plantation in Sumatra, Indonesia. \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A forest activist inspects land clearing and drainage of peat natural forest located on the concession of PT RAPP (Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper), a subsidiary of APRIL group which is being developed for a pulp and paper plantation in Sumatra, Indonesia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ulet Ifansasti/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The vast loss and fragmentation of these forests has proven a disaster for regional biodiversity, pushing everything from rhinos, wild cats, orangutans and elephants closer to extinction as well as hundreds of thousands of lesser-known species. But dholes may have been especially hard hit, since according to Kamler, they “have the largest land requirements of any Asian species.”</p> \n<p>In addition to forest loss, dholes have suffered from a decline in their prey. Kamler said this is “likely the main factor” behind the dhole’s decline in many place. <br /></p> \n<p>“Because dholes are hypercarnivores that need relatively high prey numbers to raise litters and sustain large pack sizes,” he explained. </p> \n<p>Overhunting and snaring has decimated many prey species across southern Asia. In fact, the region is known for so-called empty forests syndome. Here, forests are largely emptied of any large-to-medium-sized mammal or bird, wiped out by hunting both for food and the Traditional Chinese Medicine industry. </p> \n<p>Even where forests still stand and prey remains abundant, dholes face human persecution. Dholes are not dangerous to people, but are killed for the threat they pose to livestock.<br /></p> \n<p>Ambika Khatiwada, who works on human-dholes conflict in his native Nepal with the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), said that “retaliatory killing...is a primary factor limiting dhole conservation.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1ddc916417e3f5da3bf6ee2c6c69fc3b21970f0b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434744621902/883ed4a8-2923-493c-8e74-452bac1cc4a1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dhole on camera trap in Nepal.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dhole on camera trap in Nepal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ambika Khatiwada</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“If dholes kill livestock, herders [poison] the carcasses,” he noted. <br /></p> \n<p>Such practices can wipe out an entire pack in one go. Poisoning carcasses – a common practice in many countries – can also kill other carnivores and vital scavengers like vultures. </p> \n<p>Add to the list disease outbreaks from stray dogs, and it’s no surprise that dholes continue to vanish from the region, even in well-protected parks.</p> \n<p>“Recent population analysis by the IUCN’s Dhole Working Group has revealed that the area of occupancy of this species has significantly declined close to 50% since the last assessment in 2008,” said Jenks. </p> \n<p>A final threat to dholes is simply a lack of information and attention. Population counts are currently broad estimates, natural history and behavioural knowledge is lacking, and conservation efforts focusing on the species are rarer than the animal itself. </p> \n<p><strong>Tracking dholes is not for the feint of heart</strong><br /></p> \n<p>Finding out more about dholes, though, is pushing the few scientists working on them to the edge of conservation technologies and personal endurance. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>During five years in graduate school, Jenks only succeeded in catching and collaring a single dhole.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite></cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“They’re extremely difficult to study,” conceded Kamler. “Outside of India, dholes remain primarily in pockets of remote areas in Southeast Asia and China. In these areas, they tend to occur in low densities in thick forests that cover mountainous or rugged terrain.”</p> \n<p>This is where Kate Jenks work comes in. Her efforts, supported both by the Minnesota Zoo (which has dholes on display) and the <a href=\"https://nationalzoo.si.edu/scbi/\">Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI)</a>, involves GPS collaring of wild dholes in Thailand to better understand territorial requirements for packs. The collars are linked to satellites, giving scientists an exact location of each collared dhole in Salak Pra Wildlife Sanctuary.</p> \n<p>“Understanding their space use will help us estimate how many packs may live in protected areas. Our current focus is on tracking movement patterns of dhole packs to assess their likelihood of contact with domestic dogs and human threats,” said Jenks.</p> \n<p>But the job is more difficult than it sounds. Collaring any wild carnivore is problematic but dholes may be among the trickiest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bd4f3038ae58b3d789fc8de584910a5e05e1e04\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434743311272/dd365d50-243f-41d2-8045-60562c357726-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kate Jenks listening for signals from a GPS-collar on a dhole in Salak Pra Wildlife Sanctuary in Thailand.

During five years in graduate school, Jenks only succeeded in catching and collaring a single dhole. To date, she has collared three in total.</p> \n<p>“We set traps in the forest, baited with chunks of pork, and do a lot of waiting. Each of the traps is linked to a transmitter. When any of the traps are moved, the transmitter beeps faster. We listen for this sound every hour. Sometimes this means piling into the truck or hiking to check traps non-stop day and night. In Thailand, with curious elephants in the forest, we get a lot of false alarms when the elephants throw the traps around and trample a site.”</p> \n<p>Still even with the rigours of the field work – the waiting, the false alarms, the frustrations – Jenks said the “most challenging and time-consuming part comes way before we get to the forest.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e2d895497b4f2934ca5d2514e381fd514a3ccee7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434743381022/38f6f96c-2db4-4ee5-8469-e6e1306d7fb0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jenks and Nucharin Songsasen taking body measurements of an anesthetized dhole.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jenks and Nucharin Songsasen taking body measurements of an anesthetized dhole.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Minnesota Zoo/SCBI</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“To get permission [to collar the dholes] we needed a permit to work in Thailand, a permit to conduct research in a wildlife sanctuary, and a permit to work with live animals.

Almost unheard of a couple decades ago, camera trapping has taken the conservation world <a href=\"http://news.mongabay.com/2012/0214-hance_cameratraprevolution.html\">by storm</a> allowing researchers to take both photos and video of rare and elusive species.</p> \n<p>Greg McCann’s NGO, <a href=\"http://habitatid.org/\">Habitat ID</a>, uses camera trapping to survey wildlife in protected areas that have been abandoned or neglected by governments and conservation alike. The group’s <a href=\"http://news.mongabay.com/2012/0503-hance_mccann_interview.html\">first project</a> is in Virachey National Park in Cambodia, which NGOs and the World Bank largely abandoned in 2008. Yet, HabitatID’s camera trapping – including in some of the park’s remotest areas – has taken stunning images of rare and cryptic species. One of the biggest surprises from Habitat ID’s camera trapping so far is not that they photographed dholes, but that they photographed <em>so many</em> dholes. </p> \n<p>“They have shown up on the majority of our 21 camera traps in Virachey...and in one camera a pack of 10 shows up,” said McCann who added tantalisingly that Virachey could be an overlooked “global stronghold for [dholes].” <br /></p> \n<p>The animals have even been seen in person. One of McCann collaborator’s “saw a pack of then of them traversing the Yak Yeuk Grasslands in the middle of the afternoon.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08a22dd9f1b30e8637c5863f9931d954d7318a97\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434743029426/3cde4f50-f3e7-466d-8c1a-5465ab887b12-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Large pack of dholes in Virachey National Park.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Large pack of dholes in Virachey National Park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HabitatID</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“A photo can tell us a lot about an elusive dhole,” said Jenks. “The time stamp tells us when the individual was active, the background in the photo tells us about their habitat, and we can gather basic health observations.

Do they look unkempt, injured, with ribs showing that could indicate disease?” </p> \n<p><strong>Can we save Asia’s whistling dog?</strong><br /></p> \n<p>There are very few conservation programmes focusing specifically on dholes, but one of them is Ambika Khatiwada’s in the Kangchenjunga Conservation Area (KCA). in Nepal.

And Khatwada hopes the success of the program will bring in the long-term funding needed to keep it going. </p> \n<p>But dholes are not always seen as a pest. Using Bhutan as an example, Kamler explained that sometimes dhole and local needs align. <br /></p> \n<p>“Dholes had been nearly extirpated from [Bhutan] in the 1980s due to poisoning campaigns by local people in retaliation for livestock predation. Afterwards, wild pig numbers exploded in Bhutan and caused significant crop damage throughout the country. Dholes began re-colonizing the country in the 1990s, and subsequently wild pig numbers and associated crop damages began to decrease. Consequently, many local people in Bhutan now have a favourable view of dholes, despite occasional livestock predation.”</p> \n<p>As one of the region’s top predators, dholes have a potent ecological influence all the way down the food chain. While this has been largely unstudied in regards to dholes, research on other top predators – like wolves – has shown how these animals actually create more biodiverse and productive ecosystems by keeping prey species in check and in hiding.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0dbc5afd0f53e4ad237814f6af4bb2fd5212f6f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434744718276/a3c59d6d-49b7-45eb-bd56-c2ba80ca266e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"This collared dhole in Thailand could tell us much about the species. \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This collared dhole in Thailand could tell us much about the species.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Minnesota Zoo/SCBI</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>To save dholes across their range, Kamler said different strategies will be required in each range county, but some actions should be applied everywhere.

Livestock grazing in protected areas should also be “reduced or eliminated” and more educational programmes are needed to point out the importance of dholes. </p> \n<p>Finally, given their large territorial requirements, Kamler said, “protected areas need to be enlarged and better connected to help maintain metapopulations in the long-term.” </p> \n<p> But before anything like this can happen, the public will actually have to take note of dholes and care whether or not they survive. </p> \n<p>“Even among trained forestry officers and university professors there is poor understanding of dholes’ importance,” said Jenks who added in both internal and external funding in the region “remains consistently focused on tigers.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0deb76ad19dcfc9ac9d5fd1f8a832df21cee836f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434742472026/be3acd25-4d7f-4255-bcff-e1ae5419c724-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A captive dhole at the Taronga Zoo.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A captive dhole at the Taronga Zoo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bobby Jo Clow</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There’s no guarantee that a single wild tiger will be left on planet Earth at the end of this century. But if wild tigers go, it’s almost certain the overlooked dholes will vanish first. This dilemma goes to the heart of the bigger question: how many species – big or small – will we let go of in total? How many – like the dhole – could vanish without even a fight? To survive, dholes will need good science, public attention, political will and way more funding. To survive, the species – and so many others – needs more champions. Yes, even animal badasses need fighters in their corner. <br /></p> \n<p>So, any takers? <br /></p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434740832311/709f7552-fdb1-4af6-9fe5-6c2fddc07be9-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tara Harris/Minnesota Zoo","altText":"The dhole.

Her family reported her missing, and five weeks later, on 8 August, Fontaine was picked up by police in a vehicle that had been pulled over for drunk driving. </p> \n<p>Despite the missing persons report, the officers let Tina go, and later the same day she was found passed out in a downtown alleyway. Paramedics took her to hospital, where she was handed over to a social worker to be taken into foster care, but she ran away. </p> \n<p>Nine days later, Tina’s body, wrapped in a plastic bag, was dragged from the Red river. “We couldn’t even open the casket because of what her murderers did to her,” said her great aunt, Thelma Favel. Nearly a year after her death, Tina’s family are beginning to lose hope that her killers will ever be caught.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile her cousins fear that they could suffer the same fate as Tina: the four girls live in the North End, an area of Winnipeg rife with violence and sexual harassment. “We feel even less safe since her death. We miss her so much”, says Kattie Lee.</p> \n<p>Tina is just one victim in an decades-long epidemic of violence that has claimed the lives of thousands of indigenous women. Ever since the 1970s – when aboriginals were encouraged to migrate to the cities – women of all ages have been shipped back to their families in coffins, said Derek Nepinak, the Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC). “I lost an aunt in Winnipeg in 1978,” he said. “This is not a new phenomenon by any means.”</p> \n<p>But Canadians are finally starting to pay attention.</p> \n<p>In its first attempt to gauge the scale of the problem, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) last year retrieved data from 300 police authorities across the country. The study concluded between 1980 and 2012, at least 1,017 First Nations women were murdered, while a further 108 went missing in suspicious circumstances. </p> \n<p>Last week, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/19/canada-aboriginal-women-murder-homicide-police\">the RCMP released an updated report</a>, which concluded First Nations women are four times more likely to go missing or be murdered than other Canadian women. While aboriginal women represent just 4.3% of Canada’s female population, they represent 16% of female murder victims and 11% of missing persons cases involving women, the report said.</p> \n<p>The update also said in the 12 months since the first report, 11 more indigenous women had gone missing.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<h2>‘It isn’t really high on our radar’</h2> \n<p>When the findings were first published, thousands gathered for candlelight vigils in cities across Canada, and chiefs and activists renewed their calls for a national inquiry into the country’s indigenous femicide. </p> \n<p>But those calls have repeatedly been rebuffed by the Conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper, who has argued the problem is mainly one of domestic violence and criminality on indigenous reserves. </p> \n<p>Asked about the possibility of a national inquiry by the CBC state television in December, Harper replied: “<a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/full-text-of-peter-mansbridge-s-interview-with-stephen-harper-1.2876934\">It isn’t really high on our radar, to be honest.</a>” </p> \n<p>First Nations leaders acknowledge that violence is a problem on the reserves – which are beset with poverty, drug abuse and unemployment. But only 40% of the country’s indigenous people actually live on reserves, and activists and analysts say the abuse and murder visited on Canada’s indigenous women reflects a broader history of marginalization and abuse.</p> \n<p>That view is shared by the United Nations, which has repeatedly called for a national inquiry into violence against First Nations women, similar to the investigation launched into the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2003/nov/02/mexico\">murder of hundreds of women in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez in Mexico</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The victimisation of native women is partly the legacy of colonial heritage</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Authors Niklas Bruun and Barbara Bailey</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The UN’s Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (Cedaw) <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15656&amp;LangID=E\">concluded last year</a> that the Harper government’s refusal to investigate the violence was “a grave violation” of indigenous women’s rights. </p> \n<p>“The victimisation of native women is partly the legacy of colonial heritage where gender-based violence is linked to the lack of realization of their economic, social, political and cultural rights,” said the authors of the report, Niklas Bruun and Barbara Bailey in an email.<br /></p> \n<p>Nahanni Fontaine, a special adviser to the Manitoban government on aboriginal women’s issues, argues that the violence is a form of collateral damage wrought by centuries of prejudice. “From the first moments of contact with European explorers, indigenous women were scorned and stereotyped as promiscuous because they owned their sexuality and were treated as equals by their male counterparts,” she said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/06/canada-dark-of-history-residential-schools\">Canada confronts its dark history of abuse in residential schools</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Such contempt for indigenous women was reinforced by brutal attempts to force First Nations to assimilate into mainstream Canadian society. Earlier this month the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission described such policies as a form of “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/02/canada-indigenous-schools-cultural-genocide-report\">cultural genocide</a>” in a report on the state-sponsored, church-run Indian Residential School system. </p> \n<p>Between 1876 and 1996, 150,000 aboriginal children were taken from their families and interned in boarding schools specially designed in the words of the system’s founder Sir John A MacDonald, to “take the Indian out of the child”.</p> \n<p>One of those children was Sue Caribou, who in 1972 was separated from her family at the age of seven, and taken to a Catholic school where for the next five years she was physically and sexually abused by missionaries who forbade her from speaking Cree, her native language.</p> \n<p>The violence has never stopped: by the time Caribou left the school in 1979, both her parents had been murdered. Now aged 50 years old, Caribou has lost three female relatives to murder. The last was her beloved niece Tanya Nepinak, who disappeared in 2011 on her way to get pizza in Winnipeg. She was 31 years old.</p> \n<p>“When is this going to end? It’s getting worse,” Caribou said.</p> \n<p>Tanya’s body was never found, but police believe she was killed by a man called Shawn Lamb, who in 2012 admitted murdering two other indigenous women, Carolyn Sinclair, 25, and Lorna Blacksmith, 18.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6caf03b54988810927a66961d03b47795b90360b\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6caf03b54988810927a66961d03b47795b90360b/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"First Nations  day of action to call attention to missing and murdered indigenous and aboriginal women.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> First Nations bands form a blockade at the main rail line between Toronto and Ottawa near Marysville, Ontario, last year as part of a day of action to call attention to missing and murdered indigenous and aboriginal women. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred Thornhill/Reuters/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Indigenous groups argue that institutional racism contributes to a culture of impunity for perpetrators of crimes against aboriginal women.</p> \n<h2>Justice for the missing or murdered</h2> \n<p>Canada’s worst serial killer also targeted First Nations women: pig farmer Robert Pickton tortured and killed at least 33 aboriginals before he was arrested in British Columbia in 2002. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Soon after his arrest, Amnesty International concluded that perpetrators of violent crimes tend to target them because the “police in Canada have often failed to provide Indigenous women with an adequate standard of protection”.</p> \n<p>Police’s failings proved fatal for Jennifer McPherson, 41, an Ojibway woman who went missing in British Columbia in May 2013. Her remains were found one week later scattered around the island where she was an off-season caretaker of a fishing resort. McPherson’s husband Traigo Andretti, later admitted to choking the 41-year-old and burning her body.</p> \n<p>Andretti confessed to murder, but investigators soon discovered evidence linking him to the disappearance of another indigenous woman seven years earlier. </p> \n<p>Myrna Letandre had been dating Andretti when she went missing from her home in Winnipeg in October 2006. Her sister, Lorna Letandre, begged Winnipeg detectives to search Andretti’s house, but he was released after being interrogated just once and was never charged. He married McPherson a couple of months later. Last year, Letandre’s remains were found buried in the house – seven years after her sister first raised the alarm.</p> \n<p>“If the Winnipeg police had properly investigated Myrna Letandre’s case, my sister would still be alive today,” said Kim McPherson, Jennifer’s sister, her voice still cracking with grief.</p> \n<p>Last year, Winnipeg police announced that it was making investigations of missing and murdered aboriginal women a “strategic priority”; it has also established a special task force of 18 officers to solve 28 outstanding cases of murdered or missing women in the province. The force has also worked on improving relations with the community in the city’s poorest neighbourhoods – all of which are predominantly indigenous. </p> \n<p>But better policing alone is not the answer, warned Winnipeg’s police chief, Devon Clunis. The Jamaica-born commissioner said that Canada still needed to embark on a difficult national conversation on discrimination against First Nations. </p> \n<p>“It’s not just simply a police issue. It’s not an indigenous community issue. It is an issue for every single person who calls himself a Winnipegger, a Manitoban, a Canadian,” he said.<br /></p> \n<p>Such a reckoning seems all the more urgent in Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba, which was named as “<a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/welcome-to-winnipeg-where-canadas-racism-problem-is-at-its-worst/\">Canada’s most racist city</a>” by the national news magazine MacLean’s. </p> \n<p>The city is home to the country’s largest urban indigenous population, but that population is relegated to relatively impoverished neighbourhoods, which are plagued by underemployment, drug abuse, substandard housing and violent crime. </p> \n<h2>A dysfunctional foster care system</h2> \n<p>Activists say that the city’s social services – which should be protecting vulnerable indigenous children – are instead exposing them to further risk by plunging them into a dysfunctional foster care system.</p> \n<p>Indigenous children make up 87% of the children in foster care in Manitoba, even though they only account for 34% of the province’s population under 18. This means that at any given time, nearly 10,000 native children are under the care of the provincial Child and Family Services department (CFS).</p> \n<p>“We see a direct correlation between girls who are taken into foster care at a young age and women who go missing,” says Grand Chief Nepinak of the AMC. “We have to stop traumatising our children.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Carolyn Sinclair was separated from their alcoholic mother when she was only two. She and her sister Amanda were placed in a foster home where Carolyn was sexually abused, and by the time they were teenagers, both girls were using hard drugs. </p> \n<p>Amanda, now 35, managed to turn her life around and now has a steady job as a construction worker. Carolyn Sinclair never found a way out of her chaotic lifestyle: she was murdered and dumped near a garbage bin in Winnipeg at the age of 25. </p> \n<p>In turn, Carolyn’s two small children have now been taken into foster care, and Amanda has been refused rights to see them. “We don’t even know if they are still alive,” she said.</p> \n<p>For more than a decade, a chronic shortage of foster placements meant that children taken into care were often simply left in hotels in downtown Winnipeg. Tina Fontaine disappeared after running away from a Best Western hotel where she had been given a temporary placement. </p> \n<p>In April, a 15-year-old girl in emergency care was violently assaulted and left for dead in the same hotel. Four weeks later, the minister responsible for the CFS, Kerri Irvin-Ross, was promoted to become deputy prime minister of Manitoba.</p> \n<p>Indigenous activists such as Sue Caribou see a grim parallel between the casual neglect of the current foster care and the systematic abuse of the residential schools. </p> \n<p>“Kids are shuffled around in abusive homes. It’s starting all over again,” she said.</p> \n<p>Tina Fontaine’s great aunt Thelma Favel said she hoped that coverage of her niece’s murder would help focus attention on the violence – and perhaps even save a few lives. </p> \n<p>Speaking through her tears, she said: “My priest has told me that like Jesus died for our sins, Tina died so that other girls could be saved.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/73e7e4b57d382c5e5fb8467ba7421d1977b22222/0_105_3456_2074/3456.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2074,"width":3456,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Mali Ilse Paquin for the Guardian","altText":"Canada murder victim Tina Fontaine family","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Mali Ilse Paquin for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/6caf03b54988810927a66961d03b47795b90360b/0_0_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" First Nations bands form a blockade at the main rail line between Toronto and Ottawa near Marysville, Ontario, last year as part of a day of action to call attention to missing and murdered indigenous and aboriginal women.
