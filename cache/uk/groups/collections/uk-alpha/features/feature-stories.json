What scares Taylor Wilson? Asking a girl for her number ...<br /></p>","byline":"Rory Carroll","body":"<p>Taylor Wilson has a Geiger counter watch on his wrist, a sleek, sporty-looking thing that sounds an alert in response to radiation. As we enter his parents’ garage and approach his precious jumble of electrical equipment, it emits an ominous beep. Wilson is in full flow, explaining the old-fashioned control panel in the corner, and ignores it. “This is one of the original atom smashers,” he says with pride. “It would accelerate particles up to, um, 2.5m volts – so kind of up there, for early nuclear physics work.” He pats the knobs.</p> \n<p>It was in this garage that, at the age of 14, <a href=\"http://www.sciradioactive.com/\">Wilson</a> built a working nuclear fusion reactor, bringing the temperature of its plasma core to 580mC – 40 times as hot as the core of the sun. This skinny kid from Arkansas, the son of a Coca-Cola bottler and a yoga instructor, experimented for years, painstakingly acquiring materials, instruments and expertise until he was able to join the elite club of scientists who have created a miniature sun on Earth.</p> \n<p>Not long after, Wilson won $50,000 at a science fair, for a device that can detect nuclear materials in cargo containers – a counter-terrorism innovation he later showed to a wowed Barack Obama at a White House-sponsored science fair.</p> \n<p>Wilson’s two TED talks (<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/taylor_wilson_yup_i_built_a_nuclear_fusion_reactor?language=en\">Yup, I Built A Nuclear Fusion Reactor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/taylor_wilson_my_radical_plan_for_small_nuclear_fission_reactors\">My Radical Plan For Small Nuclear Fission Reactors</a>) have been viewed almost 4m times. A Hollywood biopic is planned, based on an imminent biography. Meanwhile, corporations have wooed him and the government has offered to buy some of his inventions. Former US under-secretary for energy, Kristina Johnson, told his biographer, Tom Clynes: “I would say someone like him comes along maybe once in a generation. He’s not just smart – he’s cool and articulate. I think he may be the most amazing kid I’ve ever met.”</p> \n<p>Seven years on from fusing the atom, the gangly teen with a mop of blond hair is now a gangly 21-year-old with a mop of blond hair, who shuttles between his garage-cum-lab in the family’s home in Reno, Nevada, and other more conventional labs. In addition to figuring out how to intercept dirty bombs, he looks at ways of improving cancer treatment and lowering energy prices – while plotting a hi-tech business empire around the patents.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Nuclear can be used for good or bad. There’s no putting the genie back in the bottle</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>As we tour his parents’ garage, Wilson shows me what appears to be a collection of nuggets. His watch sounds another alert, but he continues lovingly to detail his inventory. “The first thing I got for my fusion project was a mass spectrometer from an ex-astronaut in Houston, Texas,” he explains. This was a treasure he obtained simply by writing a letter asking for it. He ambles over to a large steel safe, with a yellow and black nuclear hazard sticker on the front. He spins the handle, opens the door and extracts a vial with pale powder in it.</p> \n<p>“That’s some yellowcake I made – the famous stuff that Saddam Hussein was supposedly buying from Niger. This is basically the starting point for nuclear, whether it’s a weapons programme or civilian energy production.” He gives the vial a shake. A vision of dodgy dossiers, atomic intrigue and mushroom clouds swims before me, a reverie broken by fresh beeping. “That’ll be the allanite. It’s a rare earth mineral,” Wilson explains. He picks up a dark, knobbly little rock streaked with silver. “It has thorium, a potential nuclear fuel.”</p> \n<p>I think now may be a good moment to exit the garage, but the tour is not over. “One of the things people are surprised by is how ubiquitous radiation and radioactivity is,” Wilson says, giving me a reassuring look. “I’m very cautious. I’m actually a bit of a hypochondriac. It’s all about relative risk.”</p> \n<p>He paces over to a plump steel tube, elevated to chest level – an object that resembles an industrial vacuum cleaner, and gleams in the gloom. This is the jewel in Wilson’s crown, the reactor he built at 14, and he gives it a tender caress. “This is safer than many things,” he says, gesturing to his Aladdin’s cave of atomic accessories. “For instance, horse riding. People fear radioactivity because it is very mysterious. You want to have respect for it, but not be paralysed by fear.”</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>The Wilson family home is a handsome, hacienda-style house tucked into foothills outside Reno. Unusually for the high desert at this time of year, grey clouds with bellies of rain rumble overhead. Wilson, by contrast, is all sunny smiles. He is still the slightly ethereal figure you see in the TED talks (I have to stop myself from offering him a sandwich), but the handshake is firm, the eye contact good and the energy enviable – even though Wilson has just flown back from a weekend visiting friends in Los Angeles. “I had an hour’s sleep last night. Three hours the night before that,” he says, with a hint of pride.</p> \n<p>He does not drink or smoke, is a natty dresser (in suede jacket, skinny tie, jeans and Converse-style trainers) and he is a talker. From the moment we meet until we part hours later, he talks and talks, great billows of words about the origin of his gift and the responsibility it brings; about trying to be normal when he knows he’s special; about Fukushima, nuclear power and climate change; about fame and ego, and seeing his entire life chronicled in a book for all the world to see when he’s barely an adult and still wrestling with how to ask a girl out on a date.</p> \n<p>The future feels urgent and mysterious. “My life has been this series of events that I didn’t see coming. It’s both exciting and daunting to know you’re going to be constantly trying to one-up yourself,” he says. “People can have their opinions about what I should do next, but my biggest pressure is internal. I hate resting on laurels. If I burn out, I burn out – but I don’t see that happening. I’ve more ideas than I have time to execute.”</p> \n<p>Wilson credits his parents with huge influence, but wavers on the nature versus nurture debate: was he born brilliant or educated into it? “I don’t have an answer. I go back and forth.” The pace of technological change makes predicting his future a fool’s errand, he says. “It’s amazing – <em>amazing</em> – what I can do today that I couldn’t have done if I was born 10 years earlier.” And his ambitions are sky-high: he mentions, among many other plans, bringing electricity and state-of-the-art healthcare to the developing world.</p> \n<p>These laudable (and sometimes contradictory) goals have stumped governments, corporations and aid agencies, but for Wilson they are no wishlist. “I want to play major league baseball,” he says. “I want to make a difference.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"240a25dd0bb056a013d1a4fc1fb4e1f13de824f3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434538671559/13e8798a-f896-40e6-820e-01d5c96d5620-460x359.jpeg\" alt=\"taylor wilson, teen science genius\" width=\"460\" height=\"359\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘\u0007It’s daunting to know you’re going to be constantly trying to one-up yourself.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Kingham for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Coming from any other 21-year-old this might be filed under hubris, but Wilson is different – as determined as he is smart. “When I said I wanted to build a nuclear fusion reactor in the garage, I think most parents would say no. But my personality is persistent and persuasive.” He shrugs. “It’s important to distinguish IQ from what you do with it.”</p> \n<p>The first child born to Kenneth and Tiffany Wilson in May 1994, in Texarkana, Arkansas, there was little reason to anticipate Taylor’s scientific vocation. The American south is better known for its poultry and cotton farming than applied physics. Tiffany ran a yoga studio; Kenneth, a red-meat-loving former college athlete, ran a cola bottling business. How they ended up with a little Einstein remains a mystery. “Neither of us knows a dang thing about science,” Kenneth confesses.</p> \n<p>The initial trigger was curiosity. Aged four, Wilson abandoned toy dump trucks to play with real traffic cones and barricades. He stood in front of the house directing traffic, wearing a reflective orange vest, yellow boots and a hard hat.</p> \n<p>For his fifth birthday, he demanded a crane – a real one. So Kenneth called a friend who owned a construction company and on the day of the party a six-tonne crane duly arrived, the operator letting Wilson sit in his lap and work the controls.</p> \n<p>The crane set a pattern. Tiffany and Kenneth, ignoring friends who muttered about spoiling, resolved to encourage and facilitate the passions of Taylor and his brother Joey, three years younger.</p> \n<p>At the age of nine, Taylor announced he would become an astronaut. He set aside books about fantasy and magic to swot up on space exploration. He wrote to astronauts, requesting pictures and autographs, and began building and launching little rockets. At school he gave ebullient talks about space exploration. “Everyone loved watching him, and when he was in the room, he just took control,” Dee Miller, the school’s former head, told his biographer.</p> \n<p>As Wilson’s rockets became more elaborate, he detoured into propulsion and making his own fuels. He pinned posters of the periodic table on his wall and pestered his dad for spare parts from the bottling factory. Rockets led to fireworks and (mostly) controlled explosions; sugar was mixed with potassium nitrate to make thunderous bangs that sent mushroom clouds over the yard. The neighbours either freaked out, or came to watch.</p> \n<p>For his 10th birthday his grandmother bought him <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/life/opinion/story/0,12981,1261144,00.html\">The Radioactive Boy Scout</a>, a book about a teenager in Michigan called David Hahn, who tried to build a nuclear breeder reactor in a back-yard shed in 1994. His experiment ended badly: arrest, disgrace and cleanup workers in hazmat suits. Naturally, Wilson saw the story as a challenge rather than a cautionary tale. His grandmother lived to regret the gift.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>All teens can be narcissistic, and when people say you’re Einstein, your identity can get wrapped up in being a whiz-kid</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Unlike Hahn, who worked in the shadows to evade a parental ban, Taylor was able to work openly – and under supervision. After becoming obsessed with atoms, the universe’s building blocks, he bought a Geiger counter and started collecting radioactive objects – antique vacuum tubes, figurines, clocks and gadgets from fairs, stores and online – plus a radiation-shielding container made of thick lead. He pushed his parents’ trust and patience to the limit. His biographer recounts an occasion when Tiffany poked her head into the garage and saw her son, in his canary yellow nuclear technician’s coveralls, watching a pool of liquid spreading across the concrete floor.</p> \n<p>“Tay, it’s time for supper.”</p> \n<p>“I think I’m going to have to clean this up first.”</p> \n<p>“That’s not the stuff you said would kill us if it broke open, is it?”</p> \n<p>“I don’t think so. Not instantly.”</p> \n<p>Wilson was safety conscious, but his explanations about time doses, distance intensities and inverse-square laws baffled his parents. They took advice from university physicists who, after quizzing the teen, concluded he knew what he was doing.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Back in the garage in Reno, the adult Taylor Wilson concludes his tour and we wander into the house where his Geiger watch, I gratefully note, stops beeping. The family moved here when he was 14 so he and Joey, a maths prodigy, could attend <a href=\"http://www.davidsonacademy.unr.edu/\">Davidson Academy</a>, a non-fee-paying school for the brightest of the bright, located on the University of Nevada, Reno campus.</p> \n<p>Under the guidance of two mentors in the physics department, Ronald Phaneuf and Bill Brinsmead, Wilson moved his research to the university lab and there pursued his goal of nuclear fusion, charming and cajoling hospitals and other institutions to lend or donate spare parts to supplement the lab’s equipment. He needed to achieve extremely high temperatures and to manage safely the hot gases produced as part of the process. It would involve tens of thousands of electron volts and deadly x-rays: using a fusor was considered too technically challenging even for most doctoral candidates. But in March 2009, using an inertial electrostatic confinement device, Wilson did it. The atoms inside collided and fused, throwing off energy at 1.2m neutrons per second.</p> \n<p>The reactor now sits in his garage, but Wilson has on occasion embellished the tale by implying the fusion happened there. Wilson says that even at the moment of triumph, he was mulling his next steps. “I was instantly thinking: what are the applications? What can I do with this?”</p> \n<p>Several years later, he received $100,000 from the libertarian-tinged <a href=\"http://www.thielfellowship.org/about/about-the-fellowship/\">Thiel Fellowship</a>, which funds bright young things for two years – on condition they spurn college during that time and focus on their own projects. His fellowship has now ended but Wilson still has no plans to go to college, preferring instead to work on inventions and to travel, giving talks and visiting friends.</p> \n<p>He has proposed building small, self-contained underground nuclear fission reactors that use decommissioned nuclear weapons to fuel power. Another project is to help hospitals irradiate materials for medical isotopes – vital tools that help diagnose cancer but are often too costly for hospitals, especially those in poor countries. Wilson’s innovation holds the promise of dramatically slashing the cost, an initiative he developed in tribute to his grandmother, who died of the disease when he was 11. And then there is the radiation detector designed to intercept terrorist dirty bombs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f3ce16fc95aeb08bc572f5a77ec8deff0ee0230\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434644195382/1705a019-a1fc-4623-ab32-a02a8c927bf5-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"teen science genius taylor wilson\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilson giving a TED talk.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Duncan Davidson/TED</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Wilson’s achievements are impressive in someone so young, says <a href=\"http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/steve.cowley\">Steve Cowley</a>, CEO of the UK Atomic Energy Authority and professor of physics at Imperial College London. “What he has achieved is not in itself ground-breaking, but his drive and ingenuity are remarkable. He clearly has a bright future.”</p> \n<p>It’s a future that will include nuclear power – something that, despite the “troubling” disaster at Japan’s <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/fukushima\">Fukushima</a> reactor in 2011, Wilson says remains vital when it comes to combating climate change. “Nuclear can be used for good or bad. There’s no putting the genie back in the bottle. My goal is to help prevent the bad and enhance the good.” (Just as well, because he also thinks “there’s something beautiful in a mushroom cloud”.)</p> \n<p>We head out for a coffee, Wilson driving us in his parents’ Land Rover. The sun has re-emerged and glints off the city in the valley below. To the east, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/technology/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a>, the 43-year-old buccaneering entrepreneur behind Tesla and SpaceX, is building a $5bn factory to make <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/vital-signs/2015/jun/10/tesla-batteries-environment-lithium-elon-musk-powerwall\">lithium-ion batteries</a> for electric cars and home energy storage.</p> \n<p>Wilson riffs enthusiastically about electric cars, so I ask if he would work for Musk, whom he has met. He almost groans and shakes his head, then picks his words carefully. “I look up to Elon. That’s hard for me to say. Maybe we both just have big personalities. I have similar ambitions, to do what Elon is doing.” Translation: no matter that Musk is the real-life inspiration for <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/robertdowneyjr\">Robert Downey Jr</a>’s <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/iron-man\">Iron Man</a>, Wilson plans to build his own business empire and do things his way.</p> \n<p>The cafe has pizza, cookies and cakes, but Wilson demurs. “I’m good on calories for today.” Coffee? He shakes his head. “I tend to avoid caffeine. I don’t really need it. You may have noticed.”</p> \n<p>The cashier, a middle-aged woman, clearly recognises him. So, too, do some diners, their eyes following Wilson as we take a table. He got this at the weekend in LA, he says: people know him either from the TED talks, or a much-shared interview he did with CNN in 2012 (<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/11/tech/taylor-post-for-blocks/index.html\">Meet Taylor Wilson, Nuclear Prodigy</a>). How does it feel? “I never got into science for the public persona. All that fame stuff, I take it in my stride. I don’t mind it.” Does he like it? A pause. “I don’t dislike it.”</p> \n<p>Wilson’s parents have moved back to Arkansas to concentrate on Joey – who, in the shadow of his atomic sibling, was becoming increasingly introverted – leaving him to live alone in the former family home. His strength of character and focus have at times worried and alienated those closest to him. “All teens can be narcissistic, and when you have people telling you every day you’re Einstein, your identity can get wrapped up in being a whiz-kid,” says Clynes, his biographer, speaking from Ann Arbor, Michigan. “Taylor went through some very dark times. I’m not sure if he knew it, but everyone around him did.”</p> \n<p>The book includes some stinging observations from relatives and colleagues, including this from his mentor, Phaneuf: “He’s gotten addicted to the spotlight.” Clynes himself, <a href=\"http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-02/boy-who-played-fusion\">whose original Popular Science article amped up the spotlight</a>, confesses to fearing he “helped to create a monster”.</p> \n<p>That fear has ebbed and Wilson is now on good terms with loved ones and colleagues, Clynes says. In the transition to adulthood, he matured and discovered some grace and humility – not least in accepting the biography, warts and all. “Reading it hit him hard,” Clynes says. “He was finding out for the first time: wow, I was a jerk. But he got through it and supports the conclusions. How many people would have the maturity to read such things about themselves and consider them accurate?”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2027d439c4a5b953fe65e9c116af5602282c6f3b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434539426815/98e5e774-f44d-48f7-9c69-f7a76b00587a-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"teen science genius taylor wilson\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘\u0007I’m not very happy when I’m not doing anything. Maybe that’s a sign of neuroses.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Kingham for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What does Wilson make of the accusations of arrogance and narcissism? He squirms before giving a geeky but apparently sincere reply. “It’s something I’m cognisant of. It’s maturity. The experiential gap between 16 and 21 is incredible.” He is not good at foreign languages or sport, he says, failings that give him humility. As does clumsiness in romance. “What makes me nervous? Asking a girl for her number.” He is currently single, he says, without elaborating.</p> \n<p>Close friends help keep the ego in check, he adds. “I have my normal friends and go to normal parties. I’m very self-conscious.” Self-conscious because he knows he is not typical of his peers. He abhors downtime, for instance. “I’m not very happy when I’m not doing anything.” He mulls the thought. “Maybe that’s a sign of neuroses.”</p> \n<p>There are perks to being the smartest person in the room. But if you’re processing thoughts others may not grasp, do you conceal them and go with the flow – or let rip? For Wilson, this triggers a battle between his newfound humility and his innate ebullience. An unequal contest. “Often when meeting new people, I make an effort to not talk about science and not say who I am,” he says. Wilson sighs and smiles. He’s a man now, but he will always be the boy who built a nuclear reactor in his parents’ garage.

How soon, indeed, before the Earth’s biological treasures are trashed, in what will be the sixth great mass extinction event? This is what Gerardo Caballos of the National Autonomous University of Mexico and his colleagues have assessed, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jun/19/humans-creating-sixth-great-extinction-of-animal-species-say-scientists\" title=\"\">in a paper that came out on Friday</a>.</p> \n<p>These are extraordinarily difficult questions. There are many millions of species, many elusive and rare, and inhabiting remote and dangerous places. There are too few skilled biologists in the field to keep track of them all. Demonstrating beyond reasonable doubt that any single species is extinct is arduous and painstaking (think how long it took to show – to most people, at least – that Loch Ness probably does not harbour a large monster).</p> \n<p>And it’s not just a case of making a head-count of modern extinctions. This needs to be compared with a long-term “baseline” rate of extinctions in our planet’s long geological history. This can only be extracted via the equally painstaking and difficult work of excavating and identifying millions of fossils from the almost endless rock strata. Not surprisingly, different studies made so far on different fossils have yielded different baseline rates.</p> \n<p>Caballos and colleagues have thought through these difficulties, and come up with probably the most robust estimate yet of how severe the modern crisis is.</p> \n<p>They have been deliberately conservative – they’re well aware of the dangers of crying wolf on a topic of such importance, and where passions run so high. For a start, they limit themselves to the best-studied group of organisms, the vertebrates. Then, they take a high estimate of background extinctions to compare with, to make the modern figures as undramatic as possible. And then, they either consider only those animals known to be extinct (the “highly conservative” scenario), or they add in those extinctions in the wild that are likely to have happened, but are not yet verified.</p> \n<p>Even with this caution, the figures are still shocking. Rather than the nine extinctions among vertebrates that would be expected to have occurred in normal geological circumstances since 1900, their conservative estimate adds in another 468 extinctions, spread among mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish. Examples of lost species would include the <a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/12/061214-dolphin-extinct_2.html\" title=\"\">Yangtze dolphin</a> and the <a href=\"http://news.sciencemag.org/paleontology/2010/03/global-warming-didnt-kill-golden-toad\" title=\"\">Costa Rica golden toad</a>. Depending on the group, extinction rates are 10 times to more than 100 times higher than normal. A sixth mass extinction, therefore, is beginning. They estimate that it would grow to rival the last great catastrophe of the past, when the dinosaurs and much else died out 65m years ago, in as little as three human lifetimes.</p> \n<p>Once more, this is a conservative estimate. It simply considers the kill mechanisms operating today, of habitat loss, predation, pollution and so on. The Caballos projection does not try to factor in, for instance, the effects of global warming, or of ocean acidification. Once these kick in in earnest, they will sweep many species out of their habitability zones, and ratchet up the extinction rate still further.</p> \n<p>In terms of scale, we are now living through one of those brief, rare episodes in Earth history when the biological framework of life is dismantled. It is in every sense a tragedy – but, in itself, it might be viewed as just one more episode of biological destruction in our planet’s history. The Earth has been here before – and will be here again, before its life is completely extinguished a billion or so years into the future.</p> \n<p>This particular perturbation to the biosphere, though, has some very special features. Indeed, there has been nothing remotely like it in our planet’s history. By coincidence, one of the authors of the Caballos study, Anthony Barnosky of the University of California at Berkeley, was involved in another study published the same week, a study that sought to put its finger on exactly what is so different – and so weird, in planetary terms, not to put too fine a point on it – about what is happening to the biosphere right now.</p> \n<p>This second study, led by Mark Williams, a palaeontologist at the University of Leicester, identified some quite extraordinary novelties at the heart of current events. First, past extinctions have been driven by what are now becoming very familiar horsemen of a planetary apocalypse: massive volcanic outbursts to choke the atmosphere and poison the seas; the mayhem caused by major asteroid impact; and the wrenching effects of rapid climate change. None of these has really figured in the current biological crisis – not even climate change, which is still only in its early stages.</p> \n<p>Instead, the extinctions are being driven by the effects of just one single species, <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Such a mass extinction has not occurred before (with the possible exception, 2.5bn years ago, when a type of microbe evolved photosynthesis to spew out oxygen, a gas that would have been highly toxic to the other microbes living then, and these would have been pushed to the fringes of life on Earth – where they still remain). Even more extraordinarily, this single species is land-living, but has managed to become the top predator in the oceans too, causing populations of whales and fish to collapse.</p> \n<p>In all, our single species now commandeers somewhere between 25% and 40% of primary productivity on Earth. It is a productivity, that over large areas of land, is “hyper-fertilised” by the extraction of millions of tons of nitrogen from the air, in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Haber_process\" title=\"\">Haber-Bosch process</a>, and by digging comparable amounts of phosphate from the ground.</p> \n<p>These super-fed crops are fed, highly efficiently, to farm animals, that we eat in turn. The scale of this operation is a large reason for the scale of the ongoing mass extinction of other organisms.</p> \n<p>The scientist Vaclav Smil, of the University of Manitoba, has calculated that simply measured by mass, humans now make up a third of land vertebrates, and the animals that we keep to eat – cows, pigs, sheep and so on – make up most of the other two thirds. All the wild animals – elephants, giraffes, tigers and so on – are now less than 5% by mass. It’s a measure of how they have been pushed to the fringes by humans.</p> \n<p>Humans change things in other ways – they now direct the evolution of the animals that are useful to them, by breeding and by genetic engineering: again, it’s a planetary novelty. The energy our species obtains from photosynthesis is not enough, and so we mine stored photosynthetic energy from the ground, as hydrocarbons, in enormous amounts, and use that to power our machines.</p> \n<p>These machines – cars, planes, computers and much else – have, together with their human software, been termed the technosphere by the geologist Peter Haff of Duke University. He views it as an emergent system with its own internal dynamics (and which humans currently drive but don’t really control) – in effect an offshoot of the biosphere. Whatever it is, it is evolving at lightning speed by comparison with biological evolution.</p> \n<p>The changes to the Earth’s biology do, therefore, include a rapidly developing mass extinction event, as charted by Gerardo Caballos and his colleagues.</p> \n<p>But this may be seen as part of a much more thoroughgoing transformation. Fundamental new patterns are emerging that may be compared, say, with the change, half a billion years ago, when a biosphere consisting only of microbes gave way to one dominated by multicellular animals.</p> \n<p>Could this new planetary pattern develop – perhaps well enough to help prevent a mass extinction? Currently, the technosphere is more a parasite than a partner of the biosphere – it is terrible at recycling, for instance.</p> \n<p>But some aspects might help alleviate the worst effects of global warming. For instance, humans have caused the greatest trans-migration of species in history. Some of these invasive species may be well adapted to new higher temperatures. And better use of energy and materials can reduce pressure on remaining natural ecosystems.</p> \n<p>Averting a mass extinction is still possible – but we don’t have much time.</p> \n<p><em>The author is professor of palaeobiology at Leicester University</em></p> \n<h2>NOT THE FIRST TIME</h2> \n<h2><strong>Previous mass extinctions</strong><br /></h2> \n<p><strong>Geological history includes many periods when species have died in large numbers.

The question has become painfully politicised. Critics of colonialism and racism tend to play down the specialness of the ancient Greeks. Those who maintain that there was something identifiably different and even superior about the Greeks, on the other hand, are often die-hard conservatives who have a vested interest in proving the superiority of “western” ideals. I fit into neither camp. I am certainly opposed to colonialism and racism, and have investigated reactionary abuses of the classical tradition in colonial India and by apologists of slavery all the way through to the American Civil War. But my constant engagement with the ancient Greeks and their culture has made me more, rather than less, convinced that they asked a series of crucial questions that are difficult to identify in combination within any of the other cultures of the ancient Mediterranean or Near Eastern antiquity. This is why, as I will go on to argue, I believe in classics for the people – that ideas from the ancient Greeks should be taught to everybody, not just the privileged few.</p> \n<p>The foundations of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2013/jul/11/ancient-greece-cultural-hybridisation-theory\">Greek culture</a> were laid long before the arrival of Christianity, between 800 and 300BC. Greek-speakers lived in hundreds of different villages, towns and cities, from Spain to Libya and the Nile Delta, from the freezing river Don in the northeastern corner of the Black Sea to Trebizond. They were culturally elastic, and often freely intermarried with other peoples; they had no sense of ethnic inequality that was biologically determined, since the concepts of distinct world “races” had not been invented. They tolerated and even welcomed imported foreign gods. And what united them was never geopolitics. With the arguable exception of the short-lived Macedonian empire in the later 4th century BC, there never was a recognisable, independent, state run by Greek-speakers, centred in and including what we now know as Greece, until after the Greek war of independence in the early 19th century.</p> \n<p>What bound the Greeks together was an enquiring cast of mind underpinned by a wonderful shared set of stories and poems and a restlessness that made them more likely to sail away and found a new city-state than tolerate starvation or oppression in a mainland metropolis. The diasporic, seafaring Greeks, while they invented new communities from scratch and were stimulated by interacting with other ethnic groups, made a rapid series of intellectual discoveries that raised the Mediterranean world to a new level of civilisation. This process of self-education was much admired by the Greeks and Romans of the centuries that followed. When the texts and artworks of classical Greece were rediscovered in the European Renaissance, they changed the world for a second time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9c03c0f62d69da4c5fc3095baa9be5a1c9b68f8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434645347749/0e4cd41f-4d42-407c-93f7-2f848d64e820-460x444.jpeg\" alt=\"The Education of Achilles by &shy;Chiron fresco from Herculaneum\" width=\"460\" height=\"444\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Education of Achilles by &shy;Chiron fresco from Herculaneum. Photograph: Leemage/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet over the last two decades the notion that the Greeks were exceptional has been questioned. It has been emphasised that they were just one of many ethnic and linguistic groups centred in the eastern end of the ancient Mediterranean world. Long before the Greeks appeared in the historical record, several complicated civilisations had existed – the Mesopotamians and Egyptians, the Hattians and Hittites. Other peoples provided the Greeks with crucial technological advances; they learned the phonetic alphabet from the Phoenicians, and how to mint coins from the Lydians. They may have learned how to compose elaborate cult hymns from the mysterious Luwians of Syria and central Anatolia. During the period in which the Greeks invented rational philosophy and science, after 600BC, their horizons were dramatically opened up by the expansion of the Persian empire.</p> \n<p>In the late 19th and 20th centuries, our understanding of the other cultures of the Ancient Near East advanced rapidly. We know far more about the minds of the Greeks’ predecessors and neighbours than we did before the landmark discovery of the <em>Epic of Gilgamesh</em> on clay tablets in the Tigris valley in 1853. There has been a stream of newly published texts in the languages of the successive peoples who dominated the fertile plains of Mesopotamia (Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, Assyrians). The words of Hittites on the tablets found at Hattuša in central Turkey and the phrases inscribed on clay tablets at Ugarit in northern Syria have been deciphered. New texts as well as fresh interpretations of writings by the ancient Egyptians continue to appear, requiring, for example, a reassessment of the importance of the Nubians to North African history. Many of these thrilling advances have revealed how much the Greeks shared with, and absorbed from, their predecessors and neighbours. Painstaking comparative studies have been published which reveal the Greek “miracle” to have been one constituent of a continuous process of intercultural exchange.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8239f0f861c6d0f8bf41bd3cdd8d77680397d95\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434645426145/8b31809e-f42d-49db-a1bc-f4b224658737-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Erechtheion, an ancient greek temple in the north side of the Acropolis of Athens in Greece.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erechtheion, an ancient greek temple in Athens.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It has become a new orthodoxy that the Greeks were very similar to their Ancient Near Eastern neighbours, in Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Levant, Persia and Asia Minor. Some scholars have gone so far as to ask whether the Greeks came up with anything new at all, or whether they merely acted as a conduit through which the combined wisdom of all the civilisations of the eastern Mediterranean was disseminated across the territories conquered by Alexander the Great, before arriving at Rome and posterity. Others have seen sinister racist motives at work and accused classicists of creating in their own image the Oldest Dead White European Males; some have claimed, with some justification, that northern Europeans have systematically distorted and concealed the evidence showing how much the ancient Greeks owed to Semitic and African peoples rather than to Indo-European, “Aryan” traditions.</p> \n<p>Taken singly, most Greek achievements can be paralleled in the culture of at least one of their neighbours. The Babylonians knew about Pythagoras’s theorem centuries before Pythagoras was born. The tribes of the Caucasus had brought mining and metallurgy to unprecedented levels. The Hittites had made advances in chariot technology, but they were also highly literate. They recorded the polished and emotive orations delivered on formal occasions in their royal court, and their carefully argued legal speeches. One Hittite king foreshadows Greek historiography when he chronicles in detail his frustration at the incompetence of some of his military officers during the siege of a Hurrian city. The Phoenicians were just as great seafarers as any Greeks. The Egyptians developed medicine based on empirical experience rather than religious dogma and told <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/homer\"><em>Odyssey</em></a>-like stories about sailors who went missing and returned after adventures overseas. Pithy fables similar to those of Aesop were composed in an archaic Aramaic dialect of Syria and housed in Jewish temples. Architectural design concepts and technical know-how came from the Persians to the Greek world via the many Ionian Greek workmen who helped build Persepolis, Susa and Pasargadae, named Yauna in Persian texts. Nevertheless, none of these peoples produced anything equivalent to Athenian democracy, comic theatre, philosophical logic or Aristotle’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/nicomachean-ethics-7.html\"><em>Nicomachean Ethics</em></a>.</p> \n<p>❦</p> \n<p>I do not deny that the Greeks acted as a conduit for other ancient peoples’ achievements. But to function successfully as a conduit, channel or intermediary is in itself to perform an exceptional role. It requires a range of talents and resources. Taking over someone else’s technical knowledge requires an opportunistic ability to identify a serendipitous find or encounter, excellent communicative skills and the imagination to see how a technique, story or object could be adapted to a different linguistic and cultural milieu. In this sense, the Romans fruitfully took over substantial achievements of their civilisation from the Greeks, as did the Renaissance Humanists. Of course the Greeks were not by nature or in potential superior to any other human beings, either physically or intellectually. Indeed, they themselves often commented on how difficult it was to distinguish Greek from non-Greek, let alone free person from slave, if all the trappings of culture, clothing and adornment were removed. But that does not mean they were not the right people, in the right place, at the right time, to take up the human baton of intellectual progress for several hundred years.</p> \n<p>And that period of intellectual ferment produced ideas that have subsequently informed the most significant moments in western political history. Thomas Jefferson, framing the Declaration of Independence, took the idea of the pursuit of happiness from Aristotle. Toussaint Louverture read Plutarch’s account of Spartacus before leading the first successful slave rebellion in Haiti in 1791. Thomas Paine argued that issues such as the relationship of religion to the state should be discussed with reference to historical examples from antiquity onwards. Chartist leaders were inspired by the Athenian democratic revolution. Women suffragists recited at their meetings the resounding speech that the tragedian Euripides gives his heroine Medea on the economic, political and sexual oppression of the entire female sex.</p> \n<p>The Greeks, more even than the Romans, show us how to question received opinion and authority. The earliest myths reveal mankind actively disputing the terms on which the Olympian gods want to rule them, and the philanthropic god Prometheus rebelling against Zeus in order to steal fire – a divine prerogative – and give it to mortal men. Sophocles’ Antigone refuses to accept her tyrannical uncle’s arbitrary edict, draws crucial distinctions between moral decency and contingent legislation, and buries her brother anyway. Aristophanes, in his democratic comedies, subjected politicians who wielded power to satire of eye-watering savagery. Socrates dedicated his life to proving the difference between the truth and received opinion, the unexamined life being, in his view, not worth living. No wonder Hobbes thought that reading Greek and Roman authors should be banned by any self-respecting tyrant, in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/belief/2009/apr/03/religion-philosophy-hobbes-midgley\"><em>Leviathan</em></a> arguing that they foment revolution under the slogan of liberty, instilling in people a habit “of favouring uproars, lawlessly controlling the actions of their sovereigns, and then controlling those controllers”.</p> \n<p>❦</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4496e026daf847ba840d70bb2dc789cfef7916e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434645545766/00f81469-fbf0-4d6d-9f55-a2fbeb0cb043-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cambridge University students on graduation day.

The ancient Greek inventors of democracy vigorously debated this issue, having painful historical experience of it – recorded by Thucydides – and theoretical solutions – discussed by Aristotle. Yet in Britain today, few secondary school students are ever given the opportunity to investigate the dazzling thought-world of the Greeks. This is despite the existence for half a century of excellent GCSE and A-level courses in classical civilisation, which have been a success wherever introduced, and can be taught cost-effectively across the state-school sector. The failure to include classical civilisation among the subjects taught in every secondary school deprives us and our future citizens of access to educational treasures which can not only enthral, but fulfil what Jefferson argued in <em>Notes on the State of Virginia</em> (1782) was the main goal of education in a democracy: to enable us to defend our liberty. History, he proposed, is the subject that equips citizens for this. To stay free also requires comparison of constitutions, utopian thinking, fearlessness about innovation, critical, lateral and relativist thinking, advanced epistemological skills in source criticism and the ability to argue cogently. All these skills can be learned from their succinct, entertaining, original formulations and applications in the works of the Greeks.</p> \n<p>The situation is aggravated by the role that training in the ancient languages, as opposed to ancient ideas, plays in dividing social and economic classes. One of the many ways in which the schism between rich and poor in Britain is reflected educationally is in access to Greek and Latin grammar. In 2013 (the last year for which figures are available), 3,580 state-sector candidates took A-levels in classical civilisation or ancient history. Greek A-level was taken by 260 candidates; 223 of these were at independent schools, which only 7% of our children attend; Latin was taken by 1305 candidates, a depressing 940 of whom were at independent schools. High grades in the ancient languages – easily enough won by solicitous coaching – provide near-guaranteed access to our most elite universities. For those without Greek and Latin A-levels there are indeed Oxbridge opportunities: a four-year classics course at Cambridge, and at Oxford the fast-track “Course II” as well as two smaller courses (ancient and modern history, ancient history and archaeology) focussing on history and material culture rather than literature and philosophy. The chances of admission for these are in line with other courses such as English and history. But it is easier to get into Oxbridge to read the long-established classics courses, requiring an ancient language A-level, than any other subject: between 2012 and 2014, for the traditional classics “Course I” at Oxford, 51 students were accepted from the state sector and 233 from fee-paying schools. There is nothing like such a high percentage of privately educated students on any other course; there is no similarly high chance of admission – at around 45%. Classics applicants have a comparable chance of getting into Cambridge, at 45%; Cambridge has only a slightly better ratio of state-sector students.</p> \n<p>To me, as a Greek scholar, educated in the 1970s and 80s entirely at the taxpayer’s expense at a direct grant school and at Oxford, this is profoundly embarrassing. Instead of Greek ideas expanding the minds of all young citizens, Greek denotes money and provides a queue-jumping ticket to privilege.</p> \n<p>❦</p> \n<p>How can we eradicate the apartheid system in British classics? First, we need to support classical civilisation qualifications, campaign for their introduction in every school and recognise their excellence as intellectual preparation for adult life and university. Specifically, classical civilisation needs to be recognised in the English baccalaureate and given the same governmental support as Latin.</p> \n<p>Second, we need to expand the tiny number of teachers trained to teach classical civilisation via classics-dedicated PGCE courses, and also, crucially, encourage qualified teachers of other subjects in schools – English, history, modern languages, religious studies – to add classical civilisation to their repertoire. Take Christ the King Sixth Form College in south London. A committed philosophy teacher there, Eddie Barnett, was inspired by the enthusiastic response elicited by the (small) Plato element on the A-level philosophy syllabus; he has recently secured an agreement that classical civilisation will be rolled out at all three campuses of the college. Classical civilisation qualifications are embraced by most universities already, and this is the first year in which it has been possible for Open University students to graduate with single honours in classical studies, even if they have had no contact with the Greeks and Romans previously. But Oxford and Cambridge, with their fame and brand, now need to lead by example and offer challenging classics courses that do not fetishise grammar and consequently repel state-sector students who have been excited by reading classics in English. This means engaging with literary texts fearlessly in translation plus increasing the importance of critical thinking and lowering that of language acquisition. Undergraduate degrees are supposed to produce competent citizens. Traditional classics courses are not making the most of those ancient authors on their curriculum who enhance civic as opposed to syntactical competence.</p> \n<p>❦</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d45bdf389cdd9c41f8d130be1419d257997f46c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434648709938/9d9ec6f2-bbab-470d-8ddb-199efa830cb9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The film adaptation of Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy, who was denied the opportunity to read classics at university.

Photograph: Allstar/BBC</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There is, however, an obstacle to such citizen-friendly proposals for the future of classics – the contempt directed from some upper echelons of the classics community against GCSEs and A-levels in classical civilisation. Some classics scholars and alumni happily maintain the exclusive private-school/Oxbridge monopoly on the Greeks. Almost all the energy currently expended by some classics-friendly charities on supporting a classical presence in the state system is directed towards Latin. I have, of course, no objection to Latin teaching, but focusing on it exclusively entails three dangers. First, plenty of talented young people with a great deal to offer society don’t particularly enjoy grammar and are put off the ancient world forever by being offered a diet that is too heavy on language, when they might be thrilled by other aspects of antiquity. Second, omitting the broader, more conceptually stretching study of the ancient world, and especially of Greek thought, implicitly suggests that Latin has a prior claim on our citizens’ attentions. Third, placing the emphasis on training in Latin grammar encourages classical Luddites (who would rather destroy the modern study of the ancient world than see any overhaul of pedagogical tradition) publicly to disparage classical civilisation’s in-depth study of ancient society.</p> \n<p>One prominent Oxford-trained journalist, Harry Mount, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/11482881/The-Greek-Tragedy-in-our-classrooms.html\">in an article lamenting the decline of Greek in schools</a>, recently described classical civilisation qualifications as “intellectual baby food” with which students are spoon-fed, and as “classics lite”. This was to insult the entire community of state-sector classicists and anyone who ever reads an ancient author in translation. He and his associates have forgotten Gilbert Murray’s injunction that it is the Greeks, not Greek, who are the true object of the humanist curriculum. They have forgotten Milton, who wrote in his treatise <em>Of Education</em> that language study “is but the instrument convaying to us things usefull to be known”. If a linguist has “not studied the solid things in them as well as the words and lexicons, he were nothing so much to be esteem’d a learned man, as any yeoman or tradesman competently wise in his mother dialect only”. Jefferson said exactly the opposite to Mount: he proposed that impressionable minds of the ablest younger children, including the poor ones he wanted to be funded by the state, could be kept safely occupied with rote learning of the minutiae of ancient languages, until they acquired sufficient intellectual robustness in mid-adolescence to cope with truly rigorous education in argumentation. That is, he saw language learning as the intellectual baby food.</p> \n<p>❦</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5573ba849f78aad85469773554110e11d027656d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434645635115/8aade6ec-ee06-434c-8fa2-157eb19a6a71-460x372.jpeg\" alt=\"A section of the east frieze of the Parthenon showing Poseidon, Apollo and Artemis.\" width=\"460\" height=\"372\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A section of the east frieze of the Parthenon showing Poseidon, Apollo and Artemis. Photograph: Gianni Dagli Orti/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The instrumentality of ancient languages in social exclusion has an inglorious history which we surely do not want to perpetuate. In 1748, the Earl of Chesterfield wrote to his son: “Classical knowledge, that is, Greek and Latin, is absolutely necessary for everybody … the word illiterate, in its common acceptance, means a man who is ignorant of these two languages.” Classical knowledge is here limited to linguistic knowledge, education to men, and literacy to reading competence in Greek and Latin. Greek was also handy when white people wanted to deride the intellectual abilities of black ones. In 1833-4, American pro-slavery thinkers were on the defensive. The senator for South Carolina, John C Calhoun, declared at a Washington dinner party that only when he could “find a Negro who knew the Greek syntax” could he be brought to “believe that the Negro was a human being and should be treated as a man”. This snipe motivated a free black errand boy, Alexander Crummell, to head for Cambridge University in England. There he indeed learned Greek as part of his studies, financed by abolitionist campaigners, in theology at Queens’ College (1851–3).</p> \n<p>The best-known example is the hero of Thomas Hardy’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=Jude+the+Obscure&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc\"><em>Jude the Obscure</em></a>. Jude Fawley, a poor stonemason living in a Victorian village, is desperate to study Latin and Greek at university. He gazes on the spires and domes of the University of Christminster – they “gleamed” like topaz. The lustrous topaz shares its golden colour with the stone used to build Oxbridge colleges, but is one of the hardest minerals in nature. Jude’s fragile psyche and health inevitably collapse when he discovers just how unbreakable are the social barriers that exclude him from elite culture. Hardy was writing from personal experience: as the son of a stonemason himself, and apprenticed to an architect’s firm, he had been denied a public school and university education; like Fawley, he had struggled to learn enough Greek to read the <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=Iliad+&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc\"><em>Iliad</em></a> as a teenager. Unlike Jude, Hardy rose through the social ranks to become a prosperous member of the literary establishment. But he never resolved his internal conflict between admiration for Greek and Latin authors and resentment of the supercilious attitude of some members of the upper classes who had been formally trained in them.</p> \n<p>There is in fact a splendid history of the ancient authors being read by Britons far beyond the privileged elite, a history that has been ignored by those rich enough to be able to give their children the opportunity to learn ancient languages. Pope’s early 18th-century translations of the <em>Iliad</em> and <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/odyssey-37.html\"><em>Odyssey</em></a> brought Homer to a far larger audience, including women, than ever had access to an elite education. Take Esther Easton, a Jedburgh gardener’s wife, visited by the poet <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/robertburns\">Robert Burns</a> in 1787. He recorded that “she can repeat by heart almost everything she has ever read, particularly Pope’s ‘Homer’ from end to end” and “is a woman of very extraordinary abilities”. Pope’s Homer also captured the childhood imagination of Hugh Miller, another Scot, a stonemason and a distinguished autodidact, who grew up to become a world-famous geologist. He saw the <em>Iliad</em> as incomparable, and wrote in <em>My Schools and Schoolmasters</em> (1854) that he had learned early “that no other writer could cast a javelin with half the force of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/homer\">Homer</a>. The missiles went whizzing athwart his pages; and I could see the momentary gleam of the steel, ere it buried itself deep in brass and bull-hide.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b51d3790c9cd731b281e49f8748c0ea53f2554fb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434645715527/1137bd0b-52c3-45e4-8462-a4ce086997e4-332x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Lucanian red-figure volute krater (415-400BC).\" width=\"332\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucanian red-figure volute krater (415-400BC).</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There is an alternative history of classical scholarship – the history of many individuals, brave, stubborn, naive, or all three – who, in the face of every kind of obstruction did succeed in “entering Minerva’s temple”, as the working-class imagination often framed the project of autodidacticism. The most prodigious of British autodidacts was Joseph Wright, a Victorian workhouse boy who became professor of comparative philology at Oxford. Illiterate at the age of 15, he discovered his aptitude for languages at a Wesleyan night school, funded a PhD in Greek at Heidelberg by teaching incessantly, and, before appointment to his chair, lectured for the Association for the Higher Education of Women.</p> \n<p>The Reverend John Relly Beard was a crucial force behind the movement for popular education in Lancashire and never wavered in his zeal for universal education to the highest level. He wrote accessible works on classical and biblical subjects, <em>Latin Made Easy</em> and <em>Cassell’s Lessons in Greek … Intended Especially for Those Who Are Desirous of Learning Greek Without the Assistance of a Master</em>. In this teach-yourself manual he is explicit about the readership he assumes: “The wants of what may roughly be termed the uneducated, will be carefully borne in mind by me, while I prepare these lessons … My purpose is to simplify the study of Greek so as to throw open to all who are earnest the great work of self-culture.”Organised working-class libraries reveal a fascinating alternative canon of books relating to the ancient word, from the first workers’ libraries in Europe established in the 1750s at Leadhills and Wanlockhead in Dumfries and Galloway to the foundation of the Workers’ Educational Association. By the end of the 19th century, these libraries’ holdings were often influenced by “Lubbock’s List”, the 100 books in 1887 deemed “best worth reading” by John Lubbock, principal of the Working-Men’s College in London from 1883 to 1899. Lubbock, who became the first Baron Avebury, was himself from a privileged banking family, and educated at Eton. Although he did not attend university, he was a polymath, specialising in archaeology and biological sciences. The proportion of classical authors in his list is remarkable: Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Aristotle’s <em>Ethics</em> and <em>Politics</em>, Plutarch’s <em>Lives</em>, Homer, Hesiod, Virgil, Aeschylus’s Prometheus and Oresteia, Sophocles’ Oedipus, Euripides’ <em>Medea</em>, Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy and many more. In addition, two famous works on ancient history – Gibbon’s <em>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em> and Grote’s <em>History of Greece</em> – make it on to the list, along with the most popular novel set in antiquity, Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s <em>The</em> <em>Last Days of Pompeii</em>. More than a quarter of all the books are by classical authors, and more than a third addressed to classical antiquity.</p> \n<p>The 109 libraries of the South Wales coalfield are a wonder of labour history, and the books really were taken out. At Ebbw Vale, each reader borrowed an average of 52 volumes a year. The “Condensed Accessions Book” of Bargoed Colliery Library details its holdings by 1921-2. Texts in Latin and Greek are absent: until 1918 almost all miners had left school on their 13th birthday. But the “alternative classical curriculum” of the miner was wide-ranging. He read translations and biographies such as JB Forbes’s <em>Socrates</em> (1905). He learned about the Greeks from HB Cotterill’s <em>Ancient Greece</em> (1913), the Egyptians from George Rawlinson’s Herodotean<em> History of Ancient Egypt</em> (1880), and mythology from several books by Andrew Lang.</p> \n<p>This inspiring past of people’s Greek can help us to look forward. It is theoretically in our power as British citizens to create the curriculum we want. In my personal utopia, the ancient Greek language would be universally available free of charge to everyone who wants to learn it, at whatever age – as would, for that matter, Latin, classical civilisation, ancient history, philosophy, Anglo-Saxon, Basque, Coptic, Syriac and Hittite. But classical civilisation qualifications are the admirable, economically viable and attainable solution that has evolved organically in our state sector. Classicists who do not actively promote them will justifiably be perceived as elitist dinosaurs.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Edith Hall gave the Gaisford Lecture at the University of Oxford.

What a piece of work is man, how infinite in faculty, in apprehension how like a god, but the minute he tweets us what he thinks in 140 characters the god goes out of him …</p> \n<p>We have lost sight of the necessity of “play”. Diversion, not in the sense of being distracted from what matters, but in the sense of being distracted from what doesn’t – the false seriousness of belief systems, conviction, ideology, thinking what it’s right to think.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Matisse’s strips of paper prove that our materials don’t determine in advance the worth of what we&nbsp;make</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Only to the degree that men and women create something surprising to themselves are they surprising to us. The rest is imposture. Convictions, nostrums, the censorious baggage of the doctrinaire – it is from such profanities against art that we need to be&nbsp;diverted.</p> \n<p>Once, to the consternation of reviewers, I published a novel in which the protagonist asserts that every man secretly longs to see the woman he loves in the arms of another man; not because this leaves him free to bugger off into the arms of another woman, but because of the vexed pleasure there is in jealousy. And also because uxoriousness, in some men, evinces itself in the impulse to share. The theme is well known to art. Only think of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2011/jun/23/william-etty-artist-revival-york\" title=\"\">William Etty</a>’s voluptuous painting pithily entitled <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/etty-candaules-king-of-lydia-shews-his-wife-by-stealth-to-gyges-one-of-his-ministers-as-n00358\" title=\"\"><em>Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed</em></a>. An act of husbandly magnanimity on King Candaules’s part for which the queen, once she discovers it, has him killed. From this we can deduce that she was neither a painter nor a writer.</p> \n<p>Responses to my take on the Candaules story were, as we say in the&nbsp;business, mixed. Some reviewers relished it, some did not. A novelist can expect no more. But those who didn’t relish it had strange reasons. The premise made them uncomfortable. If they didn’t find my hero perverted, they found him preposterous. Myself, I found him both, and thus a good subject for a&nbsp;novel. One or two, showing an unfamiliarity with the wilder shores of&nbsp;eroticism – though not that wild for anyone acquainted with the European novel – reported taking straw polls among their friends to ascertain how many wanted to see their wives without their clothes on in the arms of other men. Whatever the reliability of the sample, none among those polled owned up to any such ambition, or succeeded in imagining its appeal to others. Indeed – ignorant of Othello and Leopold Bloom, to name but two – they doubted such men existed.</p> \n<p>We now know about polls. If there are more shy Tories than polls ever make allowances for, we might guess there are also more shy cuckolds. But it isn’t the honesty of their responses that concerns me, but the fact of their being appealed to in the first place. Everything is allowable in literature, but what is not allowable in criticism is objection on the grounds of probability. Can a man really metamorphose into a cockroach? Whoever thinks that life, crude life, can verify so fine a thing as fiction – as&nbsp;though what is true is something that can be decided on before art makes it so&nbsp;– disqualifies himself as a critic.</p> \n<p>Behind the probability demurral lurk, of course, the promptings of propriety. That which the censorious say they find unlikely, they usually turn out to be objecting to morally. When Rabelais identified a certain breed of men as “agelasts”, he didn’t mean only those who cannot bear the extravagance of laughter; he also meant those who hate inordinacy in all its forms – the killjoys who go in terror of the irresponsible play and profligacy of art.</p> \n<p>“Play,” the poet <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/tedhughes\" title=\"\">Ted Hughes</a> said, “maybe that’s what all literature is, or should be.” He was not, by all accounts, a frolicsome fellow. So by “play” we might guess he intended something other than lightness of spirits.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"05ea5e5663aae31a2da5b22bbb18bf6e3f8dd305\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434647806674/9589cfec-df06-4276-a990-ec8ef106771f-298x420.jpeg\" alt=\"'Play,' the poet Ted Hughes said, 'maybe that’s what all literature is, or should be.'\" width=\"298\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Play,’ the poet Ted Hughes said, ‘maybe that’s what all literature is, or should be.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And so do I. Play, as I think of it, is the means whereby we loose ourselves from the mainland of the familiar and acceptable. The means, too, whereby we lose ourselves in the act of creation, and find what we had no idea we were looking for, and maybe sometimes wish we had not found at all.</p> \n<p>I’m not thinking specifically of such revolutionary funsters as <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/artanddesign/duchamp\" title=\"\">Duchamp</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/laurencesterne\" title=\"\">Laurence Sterne</a>. You don’t have to&nbsp;be a joker to play, in the way I mean – and anyway, the tragedian can usually be relied on to tell more stinging jokes than the comedian. Remember Hamlet, hopping dementedly from grave to grave, before coming upon the skull of Yorick, once the king’s jester. “Get thee to my lady’s chamber,” he orders Yorick, and tell her no matter how thickly she paints her face, she too will end up just a pile of whitened bones – “Make her laugh at that.” The challenging question asked of Yorick and all who entertain is&nbsp;this: where is the virtue in any of your joking if it doesn’t invigorate in the face of death? If invigoration against the odds is the justification of a joke, how much more so is it the justification of art? Against the penury of existence – its brevity and its disappointments – art releases the illusion of plenitude.</p> \n<p>Think of the aged and bed-ridden Matisse cutting out strips of coloured paper, much as a child might, and investing them with a more than mortal vitality … Those strips of paper resonate because they prove that our materials don’t determine in advance the worth of what we make. In art, where we play in order to discover, there is no “in advance”; no intentionality that will survive creation; no thou-shalt-nots advanced in the name of religious or social rectitude; no theme so important that it will of itself confer importance on a work, or so apparently trivial that it won’t; nothing – in the language of social media – to like or not like and press a button to show which; nothing, in online-speak, to agree or disagree with and tick a box – for you can no more disagree with a painting than you can a flower. No certainty other than the certainty that we can’t be certain of&nbsp;anything.</p> \n<p>No traveller ever sets out with so little idea of where he is going or how he is going to get there than an artist does. And no traveller ever gets to a&nbsp;more wonderful place. Not everyone is fortunate enough to earn their living playing. But what draws people to art and artists is a desire to enjoy the propinquity of play. For it is the very freedom of the imagination. And what else were we born to do, but imagine freely?</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> This is an edited version of a speech delivered by&nbsp;Howard Jacobson at the Royal Academy.</p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2015/6/18/1434647638032/Henri-Matisse-in-his-stud-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Henri Matisse in his studio.\r Photograph: Lydia Delectorskaya/Succession Henri Matisse","credit":"Lydia Delectorskaya/Succession Henri Matisse","altText":"Henri Matisse in his studio","cleanCaption":"Henri Matisse in his studio.\r Photograph: Lydia Delectorskaya/Succession Henri Matisse"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434647808187/9589cfec-df06-4276-a990-ec8ef106771f-725x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":725,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"‘Play,’ the poet Ted Hughes said, ‘maybe that’s what all literature is, or should be.’ Photograph: HO/AP","credit":"HO/AP","altText":"'Play,' the poet Ted Hughes said, 'maybe that’s what all literature is, or should be.'","cleanCaption":"‘Play,’ the poet Ted Hughes said, ‘maybe that’s what all literature is, or should be.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: HO/AP"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-20T11:00:03Z","lastModified":"2015-06-20T11:00:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":25,"contributors":[{"name":"Howard Jacobson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/howardjacobson"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Art","Art and design","Culture","Social media"],"tags":[{"id":"artanddesign/art","webTitle":"Art"},{"id":"artanddesign/artanddesign","webTitle":"Art and design"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"media/social-media","webTitle":"Social media"}],"section":{"id":"artanddesign"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Howard Jacobson","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/howardjacobson"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"artanddesign"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2015/jun/20/howard-jacobson-artistic-creation-frees-us-from-right-thinking","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4av6e","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/artanddesign/2015/jun/20/howard-jacobson-artistic-creation-frees-us-from-right-thinking","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/20/howard-jacobson-artistic-creation-frees-us-from-right-thinking"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2015/6/18/1434647638032/Henri-Matisse-in-his-stud-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Henri Matisse in his studio.\r Photograph: Lydia Delectorskaya/Succession Henri Matisse","credit":"Lydia Delectorskaya/Succession Henri Matisse","altText":"Henri Matisse in his studio","cleanCaption":"Henri Matisse in his studio.\r Photograph: Lydia Delectorskaya/Succession Henri Matisse"}},"importance":4,"kicker":{"title":"Howard Jacobson"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2015/6/18/1434647638032/Henri-Matisse-in-his-stud-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Henri Matisse in his studio.\r Photograph: Lydia Delectorskaya/Succession Henri Matisse","credit":"Lydia Delectorskaya/Succession Henri Matisse","altText":"Henri Matisse in his studio","cleanCaption":"Henri Matisse in his studio.\r Photograph: Lydia Delectorskaya/Succession Henri Matisse"}}]},{"title":"John Vidal / Did Britain's dirty air make me dangerously ill?","rawTitle":"Did Britain's dirty air make me dangerously ill?","item":{"type":"article","id":"global/2015/jun/20/britain-london-pollution-air-quality-health","title":"All choked up: did Britain's dirty air make me dangerously ill?","trailText":"This year, environment correspondent John Vidal had heart bypass surgery – a wake-up call that prompted him to investigate the state of the air we breathe.

With 29,000 UK deaths a year attributed to pollution, is it time we cleaned up our act? </p>","byline":"John Vidal","body":"<p>Three months ago, a surgeon at Liverpool Heart and Chest hospital took a saw, ripped through my sternum, levered open my ribcage, cut into the aorta of my still-beating heart and stitched in a vein from my leg. The long, brutal operation was a great success. But it knocked me out and left me unable to walk more than a few paces.</p> \n<p>As I recovered, I got to asking how had I got into this mess. I had always, I thought, kept pretty fit: I could happily walk all day in the hills, chop wood, play cricket and dig deep. I ate good food and loved exercise. So what else was there in my lifestyle that could have led to heart disease, Britain’s biggest killer?</p> \n<p>The doctors routinely blamed my smoking for 20 years, though I had started late and given up more than 11 years ago. But there was also the fact that I had grown up, and then worked, in some of the most heavily polluted places in the world: Birmingham, Sunderland, Dhaka, Accra, Lagos, Jakarta, London and Paris, to name a few. Was it those lungfuls of foul air in Bangladesh, or in Birmingham in the 1960s? Was it covering smogs and pollution in Russia for the Guardian? Could heart disease be the price of living in a modern city?</p> \n<p>Appreciation that city life is not just fast, but possibly dangerous, dawned slowly. When young, I could easily ignore the stinging eyes, acrid smell and need to spit after walking or cycling for a few minutes in a busy street. The suspicion that air could be a killer only started seriously with the wheezing I experienced long after I had quit smoking, when climbing a mountain became harder and the pauses for breath longer. I was shocked, in 2009, to be diagnosed with angina. But I was knocked out when last year I was told I needed a heart bypass. That happened only to people who were really ill, didn’t it?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I worked in some of the most polluted places in the world. Could heart disease be the price of living in a modern city?</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“See it as a precaution. Statistically, you’ll live longer,” said my cardiologist. “If you don’t have it, you can expect a heart attack any time.”</p> \n<p>In the worrisome months following the diagnosis and before the operation, I delved into the scientific literature. The links between air pollution and heart disease, only a generation ago uncertain, were now robust. Paper after paper showed how long-term exposure to air pollutants was now linked to high blood pressure, strokes and heart conditions like mine.</p> \n<p>But how much of my heart disease was self-inflicted and how much imposed? As people increasingly gave up cigarettes and heavy industry migrated to China and the east, were Europeans becoming more exposed to other sorts of air pollution? Were the streets of London or Paris more dangerous now than in the past?</p> \n<p>I asked <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/archives/greenweek2013/dr-fintan-hurley.html\">Fintan Hurley</a>, science director at the <a href=\"http://www.iom-world.org\">Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) in Edinburgh</a>. “I think of air pollution as one risk factor among many that increases the risk of earlier death,” he says. “Everybody is exposed. And largely it’s involuntary. Active cigarette smoking has at least the appearance of being a choice. A person may have some choices about how much air pollution they experience, but basically, it’s a risk factor imposed by society as a whole to which an individual contributes.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca9a673e25400e8ec4cd046b8bd44dadf10c8a31\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434547743863/4fb78d75-4df9-4ec4-9c81-007d93f0830a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"dirty air cyclist\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cyclist in London.

Some researchers believe the mortality rate could actually be up to twice as high. So how have we reached this point? And why isn’t more being done?</p> \n<p>I started to look for answers in the place where modern air pollution could be said to have really got going: Coatbridge, 10 miles east of Glasgow. In Victorian times, this was Britain’s – maybe the world’s – most polluted town. Its 300 coalmines, 50 steel blast furnaces and innumerable factory chimneys pumped out hundreds of tonnes of soot, sulphur and noxious vapours every day.</p> \n<p>Today, the heavy industry has long gone and the once-dark Coatbridge air is cleaner than in most other British towns. Indeed, at 10.40 on a bright April morning, on the site of an old iron smelter in what is now <a href=\"http://www.northlanarkshire.gov.uk/summerlee\">the Summerlee museum of Scottish industrial life</a>, a monitor borrowed from the IOM barely registered Britain’s two main air pollutants - the toxic gas called nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and the tiny particles of soot, or dust, called PM2.5s.</p> \n<p>Kerry Garvie, whose father was a miner in nearby Bedlay colliery, recalls how her mother struggled to keep anything clean, how her Uncle John had breathing problems and how her clothes always got black. For Garvie’s relatives, air pollution was a fact of life, and life was often short. “It is what they lived with and what they knew,” she says.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>'Cigarette smoking has at least the appearance of choice. Air pollution is a risk factor imposed by society as a whole'</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Fintan Hurley, Institute of Occupational Medicine</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But do we know better now? Ten miles west of Coatbridge, Glasgow city centre was that day, as usual, snarled with traffic. Wherever I walked with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Emiliajaneagain\">Emelia Hanna</a>, <a href=\"http://www.foe-scotland.org.uk\">Friends of the Earth Scotland</a>’s air pollution campaigner, the monitor read five or more times higher than in Coatbridge. The fine particles peaked in the taxi rank outside Queen Street railway station; the nitrogen dioxide count soared way over the European legal limit near main roads. Glasgow has tighter pollution laws than England and Wales, but is far and away Scotland’s most toxic town. “No wonder,” Hanna says. “It is ringed by motorways, served by hundreds of old diesel buses, its lines of cabs keep their engines running all day.”</p> \n<p>According to government figures, air pollution is responsible for more than 300 deaths a year in Glasgow. “Most people here know someone affected by asthma, heart disease or lung problems,” Hanna says. “It affects children and people on lower incomes worst.”</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Neighbouring Coatbridge and Glasgow show how air pollution in Britain has changed in just a few generations. The coal and wood smoke that belched from Britain’s factories and hearths may have vastly reduced, but it has been replaced by a toxic soup of nitrogen oxide gases and minute particles of unburned carbon and chemicals, produced by vehicles and fossil fuel-burning central-heating systems. Instead of pollution being concentrated in old industrial centres such as Sunderland, Widnes or Newport, the fumes are now worst in congested cities such as London, Birmingham, Leeds and Sheffield.</p> \n<p>The difference between now and 100 years ago, says Kelly, who is director of the <a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/research/divisions/aes/research/ERG/index.aspx\">environmental research group at King’s College, London</a>, is that today’s air pollutants are largely invisible and odourless, and are obvious only when dust is occasionally swept up from the Sahara or when traffic and industrial fumes get trapped on sunny days and a dull orange-grey smog develops. “These acute events result in thousands of extra hospital admissions and breathing complaints, but they are relatively rare,” he says. “They come on top of the chronic air pollution that all British cities experience every day from heavy traffic. Some pollutants may indeed have disappeared since the infamous smogs of the 1950s, but people have an increasing level of other complaints, such as asthma attacks, cardiovascular and breathing problems.”</p> \n<p>Kelly’s office, housed on the upper floors of a drab 1960s building in south London, is the world’s largest centre of public research into the medical effects of air pollution. He and other scientists working here advise not just the UK government but the World Health Organisation and the most polluted countries in the world, such as China and India. Kelly and his colleagues now see air pollution spreading as populations and cities burgeon and, above all, as the car becomes ubiquitous. In 1950, there were around 4m cars in Britain and 35m in the world. Now, we have 28m and there are more than 750m worldwide, along with 200m vans and lorries.</p> \n<p>Could I really pin my own heart disease on the air I have breathed, as well as the smoke I have voluntarily inhaled? Certainly, says <a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/research/divisions/aes/about/people/Mudway/index.aspx\">Ian Mudway</a>, Kelly’s colleague and a lecturer in respiratory toxicology, whose research shows that children’s health is greatly affected by air pollution from a very early age.</p> \n<p>I first met Mudway at a residents’ meeting in the London borough of Tower Hamlets. He had been researching the lung capacity of children living near busy east London streets, and was telling his audience how the health of their communities would inevitably deteriorate if a new Thames road bridge or major tunnel was allowed to bring thousands of extra cars a day into the East End. “We have high-density housing here, slap-bang next to major roads,” he told the audience. “People still don’t see air pollution as a big issue. They understand that you die from alcohol or obesity, but air pollution doesn’t have that risk factor in people’s imagination. Yet it’s a killer.”</p> \n<p>The more researchers like Mudway have looked at people’s long-term exposure to air pollution, the worse the picture gets. The cautious <a href=\"http://www.iarc.fr\">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a> suspected that PM2.5s were carcinogenic to humans back in 1988, but only in 2013 could it definitely say they were a cause of lung cancer. The most recent World Health Organisation data suggests there were 233,000 deaths from lung cancer caused by air pollution around the world in 2011. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.healthdata.org/gbd\">a study from the University of Washington</a> in the US cites 3.4m deaths from outdoor air pollution in 2010 – 400,000 more than in 1990.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>For everyone who dies, there are many more hospitalised or who have impaired health</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Ian Mudway, lecturer in respiratory toxicology</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Adding the effects of indoor pollution, mostly from cooking fires in the developing world, brings the global death toll to 7m a year, according to the World Health Organisation. In short, air pollution is now officially the world’s biggest environmental cause of premature death – second only to smoking and the equivalent of alcohol and obesity combined in the UK and, in 2013, causing more deaths worldwide than Aids and malaria.</p> \n<p>But where are the victims? No postmortem states air pollution to be a primary cause of death, and few people take a day off work because of it. Yet we now know that PM2.5s, which get deep into the lungs and bloodstream from exhaust fumes, can greatly worsen respiratory and heart conditions such as my own, trigger heart attacks and lead to brain damage, cancers, even nerve, liver and kidney diseases. “For everyone who dies, there are many more hospitalised or who have impaired health,” Mudway says. “Prolonged exposure to elevated [particulate pollution levels] is associated with significant life-shortening and poor respiratory health. Acute episodes can precipitate death.”</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Mal Chadwick is a young, fit cyclist, but when he arrived in London from York five years ago, he found himself wheezing. He cycles around 40 miles a week in the city, and his doctor has diagnosed asthma, almost certainly aggravated by air pollution. “The air quality of the two cities is noticeably different,” Chadwick says. “When you bike in London, you get it full in the face.”</p> \n<p>He uses an inhaler three or four times a week, but the pollution is worse in autumn and spring, when the temperatures can go quickly from cold to warm, and when the traffic is heavy. “I used to take the main roads,” he says. “Now I only go on the back routes.”</p> \n<p>Charlotte Dalton, 18, lives close to Junction 1 on the M3 in west London and suffers from bronchitis, also caused or aggravated by air pollution. “I have lived on Staines Road West for 16 years,” she tells me. “Whenever the windows are opened, car fumes fill the house. When I suffer, it hurts to cough and it’s painful to talk. I’ve had to take a week off school to recover at times.”</p> \n<p>“I’m relying heavily on meds today,” a colleague tells me. “People on the tube were giving me that wary, angry look they give constant coughers – I felt as if I should be wearing a sign that says, ‘It’s not contagious, it’s asthma.’ ”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bce2e96d9466ec6c1eb4070281ead4107613ccd8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434548500147/ac60ae63-004d-4105-ab1f-7ec5ea971810-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"air quality buses\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buses on Oxford Street, in London, which has been dubbed the world’s most polluted street. ‘Bollocks,’was Boris Johnson’s response.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Kase/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Diesel is the real villain,” says Simon Birkett, a former City banker who gave up his job to set up <a href=\"http://cleanair.london\">an air action group</a> in 2007. Petrol fumes may be bad for health, but diesel engines pump out nearly 65% more particulate pollution and nearly 20 times as much nitrogen oxide gases as petrol cars over their lifetimes. Moreover, their particulates are often smaller and more likely to get into the bloodstream.</p> \n<p>“What is extraordinary,” Birkett says, “is that, even though the European commission, national governments and the car industry know how dangerous diesel is, together they incentivised it and deliberately engineered a massive switch away from petrol – without any public debate.” History, he says, may show that the rise in heart disease and other illnesses now linked to air pollution has coincided with the increase in awareness of another environmental problem: <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/climate-change\">climate change</a>. And that a botched attempt to address the one has exacerbated the other.</p> \n<p>In the 1990s, climate change was rising fast up the international agenda and, following the 1997 signing of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/kyoto-protocol\">the Kyoto protocol</a>, rich countries were legally obliged to reduce emissions by an average of 8% over 15 years. But while Japan, China and the US chose to back research into low-emission hybrid, petrol and electric vehicles, Europe prioritised a mass public switch to diesel, announcing that it not only gave 15-20% better mileage to the gallon, but emitted around 13-17% less carbon dioxide, the main climate-changing gas. The motor industry, governments and the green lobby reasoned that it would be one of the cheapest and easiest ways to tackle climate change.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Was my health, and that of millions of others, cynically traded off against the urgency to control climate emissions?</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>By any measure, the transformation of the European car fleet from almost entirely petrol to predominantly diesel was rapid and remarkable. Britain, along with Germany, France and Italy, offered subsidies and sweeteners to persuade car makers and the public to buy diesel. Key to the change was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACEA_agreement\">the 1998 Acea voluntary agreement</a> between the European commission and all European car makers, backed strongly by then EU transport commissioner <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/neil-kinnock\">Neil Kinnock</a> and UK environment secretary <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/johnprescott\">John Prescott</a>. This committed all car makers selling in Europe to reduce their average CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for new passenger cars by 25% over 10 years. It was practically an order to switch to diesel.</p> \n<p>At the demand of industry, Britain and other countries kept the diesel price below that of petrol, and penalised petrol vehicles with higher road tax bands. Emission standards for MOTs were linked to CO<sub>2</sub>, and the car and oil industries were set new targets for diesel adoption.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00aeb24cc94c1cc2c0d9ff1768a5e9c2e4b9ffc6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434640130057/58fe096f-8797-4edc-a96c-ecd398f9442d-460x351.jpeg\" alt=\"air pollution death graphic\" width=\"460\" height=\"351\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deaths attributed to long-term exposure to air pollution in 2012. Source: Public Health England 2014</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The results were dramatic. From being a quirky consumer choice, diesel went mainstream in the world’s biggest car market. Its share in the UK rose from less than 10% in 1995 to over 50% in 2012. Most taxis and buses are now diesel. With more than 1m new diesels now sold a year, and 9m on its roads, Britain has one of the largest diesel car fleets in the world.</p> \n<p>The picture is similar across Europe: more than 55% of all new European car registrations are now diesel, and the region has around 100m diesels, compared with just a few million in the US, China and Japan. The diesel fuel market has grown so fast that the EU now imports much of its diesel and exports petrol to the US. Britain is expected to have to triple its imports over the next 10 years.</p> \n<p>So was my health and that of millions of others cynically traded off against the urgency to control climate emissions? Those working in the UK government in the 1990s recall how climate change trumped any objections from scientists, or from the few people who understood the health implications of a major switch to diesel.</p> \n<p>One who did understand was <a href=\"http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/d.fisk\">David Fisk</a>, chief scientist and policy director in the departments of both the environment and transport in the 1990s. He recalls that there was “concern” in government when it was proposed that diesel be backed over petrol. “The motor manufacturers made a d&eacute;marche to the department of the environment, showing that a major switch to diesels would lead to a substantial drop in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Air quality division saw straight away that there was a problem,” he says. “It was hard to see how anyone could construct a trade-off algorithm that made much sense. The solution was to create the national system of air quality standards.”</p> \n<p>Former Greenpeace chief <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stindale\">Stephen Tindale</a>, who was working on air pollution at the same time, in the department of the environment, remembers a battle between environment and air pollution divisions, but no public debate about health. “British politicians have always been poor on air quality,” Tindale says. “It was just not on the political agenda in late 1990s. In 1997, Labour’s policy was for a 20% cut in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 2020. Tony Blair wasn’t obsessed with climate at that point, but he saw the political and soundbite advantage. The department of health was dozy, with <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/frank-dobson\">Frank Dobson</a> and then <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/davidblunkett\">David Blunkett</a> in charge.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07c256a3389a1c79f2c92f8dbf8070f0716798bf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434550182661/fb2d3c65-ff73-4b97-bb91-1010bbb1df60-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"skyline smog\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mother and toddler in Greenwich Park, with the City of London in the distance.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A very senior civil servant, now retired, who worked in the department and has asked not to be named, said that cost-benefit studies of a switch to diesel were done, but climate change was “the new kid on the block” and long-term projections of comparative technologies were not perfect. “I recall all the discussions had the health issue as a significant factor,” he says. “We did not sleepwalk into this. To be totally reductionist, you are talking about killing people today rather than saving lives tomorrow. Occasionally, we had to say we were living in a different political world and everyone had to swallow hard.”</p> \n<p>Former environment minister <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/barry-gardiner\">Barry Gardiner</a> has admitted fault, <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/the-great-car-con-channel-4-dispatches\">telling Channel 4’s Dispatches TV programme last year</a> that it was the “wrong decision” to incentivise the purchase of diesel vehicles. But <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/michaelmeacher\">Michael Meacher</a>, environment minister at the time, says he cannot recall ever being consulted on the proposed switch to diesel by his civil servants: “If it had been a question of a trade-off between carbon emissions and health, much as I would have wanted to reduce climate emissions, the medical effects would have trumped it. I would have been keen to see a major reduction in [carbon] emissions, but I would not have wanted that to be at the price of lives.”</p> \n<p>Frank Kelly now thinks that thousands of people – many with conditions like mine – may be dying prematurely in Britain each year because of the decision to cut carbon emissions at the expense of air pollution, without exploring alternatives. Even worse, it now emerges that Britain and Europe may have only marginally reduced their carbon emissions from transport by switching to diesel, and possibly did not reduce global warming levels at all. Over the last few years, scientists have found that the fine particles emitted by diesel engines play a far bigger role in global warming than many previously thought. The smallest particles, known as “black carbon”, trap heat in the atmosphere and are now thought by some to be second only to carbon dioxide as a driver of global warming.</p> \n<p>Back in London, I went to Oxford Street, last year cited by King’s College air researcher David Carslaw to be the most polluted street in the world, a “diesel corridor” used by thousands of buses a day. According to Carslaw, it had some of the highest concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> gas measured in any street in the world. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/boris\">London mayor Boris Johnson</a> was offended by this suggestion, responding furiously that it was “bollocks”, but no one, Carslaw says, has disproved it. Since then, Johnson has promised the world’s first ultra-low emission zone from 2020, and has launched a campaign to warn parents to choose less polluting routes to take their children to school.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>A toddler was given a carbon monitor: most of the pollution she breathed in came in two hours, going to and from nursery</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Outside Selfridges, I met Marie Bristow from Bexley, who had taken a day off work to go shopping. It was a hot day, she’d come up by bus and train and London’s air was officially “good quality”. “I only come when I have to,” she says. “No one likes the air here. It’s the buses, isn’t it? I go back in the evening and it takes me hours to recover. My sister worked here for years and wheezed all the time.”</p> \n<p>The NO<sub>2</sub> may be bad on Oxford Street, but it’s the fine particles in diesel fumes that concern researchers most. Carslaw’s colleague Ben Barratt last year gave portable carbon monitors and GPS watches to seven south London residents, including a pensioner, a cycle courier, an office worker, an ambulance driver, a school pupil and a toddler. He then measured the greatly varying amounts of pollution the volunteers breathed in as they went about their days. Over a 24-hour period, the ambulance driver was exposed to the highest levels, because the traffic exhaust was entering the cab of his vehicle; the cyclist was exposed to half that, and the lowest levels were inside the office worker’s building. Most of the pollution that a toddler breathed occurred in just two hours on the journey to and from her nursery in a pushchair; and the school pupil was exposed to more pollution when travelling on the bus than when walking home along quieter streets. Other studies show that walking and cycling in back streets is better than car travel.</p> \n<p>According to Barratt, “This suggests that the exposure to pollution may actually be higher for someone driving a car around busy roads than doing so on a bike. This is a simple message that we can tell people, so we can considerably reduce levels of exposure.”</p> \n<p>Crucially, his study showed that particulate pollution varied minute by minute, vehicle by vehicle and street by street. “The way to understand air pollution is to see it as cumulative over a person’s life,” he says. “We know it affects birth weight. A baby born with low birth weight has an increased risk of disease in later life. If he or she goes to a school in a polluted place, their lungs will not develop, which further increases the chances of developing cardiovascular or other diseases later. By the end, the likelihood of air pollution finishing you off is higher.”</p> \n<p>Barratt says the chance of dying from smoking cigarettes is about 10 times higher than from air pollution in the UK, “but on a population scale, the risk is just the same”. Those of us walking and cycling along busy streets are “passive smokers of vehicle exhausts”. He recommends real-time pollution apps developed at King’s, so people can get <a href=\"http://www.londonair.org.uk/LondonAir/MobileApps/\">up-to-date information</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/business/environmental-health/environmental-protection/air-quality/Pages/New-CityAir-App.aspx\">plan routes</a> across cities. At the moment these only cover London, but they will soon be extended to other cities.</p> \n<p>The government, ordered this year by the supreme court to draw up a new UK air-quality plan, has accepted that air pollution costs the economy up to &pound;18bn a year, or a seventh of all NHS spending; but has told Europe that it will not meet legal NO<sub>2</sub> limits in London, Birmingham and Leeds for 16 years, and in cities such as Liverpool, Sheffield, Manchester and Glasgow for 10.</p> \n<p>“Cracking our air pollution problem is a huge challenge,” says Kelly. “Traffic must be reduced, and we must ensure a cleaner and greener element to what remains on the road. This can be achieved through a number of strategies: an expansion of low emission zones, investment in clean and affordable public transport, a lowering of speed limits, a move back from diesel to petrol, or at least a ban on all diesel vehicles not fitted with a particulate filter.”</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Now the idea of breathing London’s air seems horrible, and the gusting winds of the Welsh hills taste gloriously clean</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>So was my heart disease caused by cigarettes, or those lungfuls of dirty air in London, Birmingham and Lagos? It’s impossible to say. Best not to look for one simple answer, concludes Hurley. “Personally, I don’t spend much time wondering whether air pollution initiates the heart disease that later causes earlier death, or whether it accelerates disease initiated by other factors. For me, the main point is that it does increase the risk.”</p> \n<p>Three months after my operation, the idea of breathing London’s air seems horrible, and the gusting winds of the high Welsh hills taste gloriously, absurdly clean. I was lucky to have been given another chance by the extraordinary skills of the surgeons and cardiologists. But the hospital wards full of wheezing people with lungs and hearts permanently damaged by lives spent near busy roads tell another story.</p>","section":"Global","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434641609350/9b24028c-3d62-4e29-b835-d47d80e90c05-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Geoff Pugh/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Pollution london","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Geoff Pugh/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434547745205/2b9c6e25-3267-46d3-8de9-d9145c8c8b4a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A cyclist in London.

We think you have to go and queue up with a tray.” She is funny in a&nbsp;way that is also physical – as when she&nbsp;is being indiscreet and covers my tape recorder with her hands.

After <em>Love, Nina</em>, she went back and “unwrote it”, taking out “all the poetic stuff”.</p> \n<p>The novel’s title derives from the efforts of nine-year-old Lizzie Vogel and her sister to find their mother a new husband from a rather unpromising selection, which includes the local Liberal candidate, a skittish vicar and a&nbsp;roguish plumber. Stibbe’s ear for humorously bathetic dialogue and eye for the anarchically silly detail – a horse climbing the stairs, a child dressed up as a 50 pence piece to commemorate decimalisation – did not disguise the novel’s darker side: a woman alone, perilously close to going under, virtually ostracised from a small community that she has no means to escape.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa111c7ef7374f0f1e761a3706992f7b82ba6e32\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434644769333/a1eaa0bc-bf3f-43dc-a320-db2e871da4cf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mary-Kay Wilmers of the London Review of Books in her Bloomsbury office, in 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary-Kay Wilmers of the London Review of Books in her Bloomsbury office, in 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The book is funny, but also extremely disturbing, encouraging its readers to get on side with the girls’ matchmaking exploits while also confronting them with the issue of whether the children are even being fed properly. Was she aware of the effect it would have? “I didn’t fully realise that until afterwards. A few people have said to me: ‘I was breathless with worry for you.’” In fact, she insists, in real life there was much lightness amid the precariousness and anxiety, much of it courtesy of her mother: “In spite of all the misery and sadness, she was fun and funny, like depressed people can be and are. She was a person. She surrounded us with books; not everyone can say that. She laughed at the ridiculousness of life. She laughed at stuff. And that was great.”</p> \n<p>Her anger, refracted through a comic prism in the book but less mediated in&nbsp;person, is directed more squarely towards the villagers her family encountered, those whose behaviour determined that “the abiding memory of my childhood is being unwelcome wherever we went”. The thrust of the book, she explains, “is my mum sinking into loneliness and depression, thinking she’s making a great new start after her divorce, and moving from the city to the countryside and nobody wanting to&nbsp;give her a chance. And the very people who might have helped saying, ‘Actually, you’re not going to make it, because you’re a divorced woman, and women shouldn’t be in charge, and they shouldn’t mow the lawn, if they do, they’ll cut their toes off.’ And even teachers saying things like, ‘I would have thought your mother would have worked at marriage.’ And me thinking, ‘Well, actually, you saying that is the worst thing that’s happened to me for about three weeks. Living at home with my mum on her own is great, she’s great, but you, you and you being complete cunts about it is not great.’”</p> \n<p>Did she feel that the children had to cover up for their mother, to present a brave face to the outside world?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/nov/02/love-nina-despatches-family-life-stibbe-review\">Love, Nina: Despatches from Family Life by Nina Stibbe – review</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“We weren’t as conscientious as that,” she answers, smiling. “I’d love to say we were. My sister learned this phrase ‘wards of court’, and at that point we thought we’d better be a bit hush-hush and keep her hidden, and not let anyone in the house to see the mess, that kind of thing. But I think we were fairly eccentric, and we weren’t as careful as we might have been. I remember saying to friends, ‘Oh, it’s great being in a divorced family, because you don’t have to go to bed ’til midnight.’ Of course that would go home, and the parents would be like, ‘I knew it.’ So rather than helping my mum, I was often exacerbating it by trying to make being divorced all normal and happy and lovely, because I felt such a freak.”</p> \n<p>Once, when Stibbe mentioned looking forward to her own children – now both teenagers – getting old enough for her to enjoy a lie-in, her mother confided that she could never stay in bed once awake; guilt over her maternal shortcomings would soon crowd in. “Since <em>Man at the Helm</em> she can. I think it’s that it’s set down on paper, it’s out there, and people’s response has been not, ‘You evil woman.’ On the whole, it’s been, ‘Yeah, you had a really tough gig, and you came out of it great, and all your kids love you.’ My siblings have had the same response.” The book is dedicated to her “unobtrusively brilliant” stepfather, who confirmed that she should go ahead with the book when Stibbe worried that her mum was agreeing just because she thought she ought to. Her father, a keen but unpublished writer, has also been supportive: “He would love to have done what I’ve done.” When I ask what his books are like, she replies, “Some of them have been wonderful. But he didn’t have Alan Bennett on his side.”</p> \n<p>Ah: Alan Bennett, one of the big stars of <em>Love, Nina</em>, with his caustic asides on the youthful nanny’s culinary experiments and his unexpected way with domestic appliances. When the book finally came out, after something of a&nbsp;battle to gain Wilmers’ agreement (“When I first mentioned the letters to her, she said, ‘No way. Forget it. What are you thinking?’ She made me feel awful. I was crushed”), Bennett’s reaction was slightly underwhelming. What does she think about that now? “Well, I feel disappointed that he didn’t love it … he said that it made him look like ‘a dismal Jimmy’”. She does wish, she says, that “I’d had Bennett being a bit funnier. But you see, Bennett, to me, was a middle-aged man, and Vic wasn’t interested in Bennett. I was definitely selling my life to Vic. I was saying, ‘I’m having a great time, it’s wonderful, and it’s very reassuring because there’s this great bloke here who fixes the washing machine.’ If I’d have said, ‘Oh, he’s writing this ground-breaking television stuff,’ she’d have been like, ‘So?’ So I didn’t. And I wasn’t interested either.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"516cccd5ca70deae7d54d70e1864abb870a58950\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434645022007/79cb0818-82b4-4440-913e-8ae408bffdaa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Handy man … Alan Bennett.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Handy man … Alan Bennett.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Callum Bennetts/Rex Features</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I ask her whether she thinks there was an element of her encroaching on his territory, chronicling the comic absurdity of everyday life? “Well, I don’t know. But it’s not the first time I’ve used him to scramble up,” she says, referring to the time she dropped his name in an interview to get her first job in academic publishing, in which she worked for many years. “Put it this way. Would that book have been published without Alan? No. It wouldn’t.”</p> \n<p><em>Love, Nina</em>’s beginnings came when <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/andrewohagan\" title=\"\">Andrew O’Hagan</a> asked everyone in Wilmers’ life – from <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/hilary-mantel\" title=\"\">Hilary Mantel</a> to her hairdresser – to write something about her to celebrate her 70th birthday. Stibbe said yes, then thought: “I can’t write anything nice because she’ll hate it; I can’t try to be clever, because that’s just not me.” A flash of memory led her to ask her sister if she still had “that box of letters”. She remembers rereading what became the very first letter of the book – “Me saying ‘she plucks her eyebrows and says fuck and cunt. And they have semi-skimmed milk’.”</p> \n<p>Wilmers’ objections eventually overcome (“And she’s so brilliant in it, isn’t she?”), Stibbe spent a couple of weeks typing up the disorganised, undated letters. At Wilmers’ house, she met publisher Mary Mount, who was writing a short book about Sam, Wilmers’ son with Stephen Frears. Mount, who told me she sees Stibbe as “very much part of the great English comic tradition – part of the canon that includes <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/evelynwaugh\" title=\"\">Evelyn Waugh</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/nancy-mitford\" title=\"\">Nancy Mitford</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/sue-townsend\" title=\"\">Sue Townsend</a>”, signed her up.</p> \n<p>I ask Stibbe straight: did she change the letters? Did she make them funnier? She tried, she says, at that precise point. “But it was too late. Mary said, ‘We can’t publish it if we can’t stand behind it as authentic.’ And I said, ‘But I look such a bitch.’ I thought I looked so judgmental and grumpy and unbooky, hating <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/culture/shakespeare\" title=\"\">Shakespeare</a> and all that. Hating <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/thomashardy\" title=\"\">Thomas Hardy</a>. And she said, ‘No, it’ll be fine, everyone will love it.’ Anyway, when the proofs came, I did put some changes in.” What sort of things? “I had myself saying slightly nicer things like, ‘Dear Vic, I really love the boys. They’re so wonderful.’” You were Pollyanna-ising? “Yes!” she cries. “Well, wouldn’t you?”</p> \n<p>Mount caught her out and excised the changes. She was right; it was the ring of truth that would make <em>Love, Nina</em> such a hit. Now, Penguin have signed up two more books, with Stibbe reprising the adventures of Lizzie Vogel. Meanwhile, <em>Love, Nina</em> will appear on BBC1 next summer, in five 30-minute episodes that are Hornby’s first TV project.</p> \n<p>Way back, when Stibbe was working in publishing, and later, when she and her partner Mark (AKA Nunney, from <em>Love, Nina</em>), had moved from Crouch End to <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/travel/cornwall\" title=\"\">Cornwall</a>, she wrote all the time: “I thought everybody did – I know that sounds corny, and a bit pseudy, but I&nbsp;thought everybody did. Don’t they?” There were bits and pieces, vignettes, more of <em>Man at the Helm</em>. “I used to send my stuff to Faber, and I’d get really nice letters back. One even said, ‘We’d really like to see more of this, we really like it.’ And I went, ‘Oh, I don’t know, no.’ I just thought, ‘I’m not up to it. It’s not my thing.’ And I still slightly feel that. It’s interesting: I was thinking, ‘I’ve snuck through. I’ve definitely snuck through.’ It’s almost like going skiing, when you’re in Europe and you see everyone just ski up to the gate and push through, and you think, ‘That’s a&nbsp;bit rude,’ but then you get used to it and do it.”</p> \n<p>It’s time for Stibbe to go to the party. As we get up from our silver service tea, she says, “I don’t sound serious enough. I sound too flippant.” She looks at my tape recorder and recoils in&nbsp;mock-horror. “Is it still on? Jesus! That’s off the record!”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Man at the Helm</em> is out in paperback.

He was surveying the ruins of <a href=\"http://www.ancient-origins.net/angamuco\" title=\"\">Angamuco</a> in west-central Mexico the traditional way, with a line of grad students and assistants walking carefully while looking at the ground for bits of ceramics, the remains of an old foundation or even a tomb.</p> \n<p>He had expected to find a settlement, but instead he happened upon a major city of the <a href=\"http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/michoacan.html\" title=\"\">Purepecha empire</a>, rivals of the Aztecs in the centuries immediately preceding the Spanish conquest of Mexico in 1519.</p> \n<p>The site covered 13 sq km; traditional surveying would have taken years, so he turned to a technology that uses pulses of light to penetrate the forest and ground cover to reveal what lay beneath. “In two seasons we had surveyed only two square kilometres,” Fisher said. But with this new technology – lidar – “we mapped the entire city in 45 minutes.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cae88314c0406a15d09128ac03c60ebf4838bd6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434468922993/358e7aae-4409-4724-9ab3-54dc09a5b849-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Caracol, a major Mayan city more than 1,000 years ago\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US national mapping center used lidar in Belize to survey Caracol, a major Mayan city more than 1,000 years ago.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caracol Archaeological Project, University of Central Florida</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Today, lidar – short for light detection and ranging – is a key archaeology tool that can detect not only buildings but also the remains of roads, agricultural terraces, aqueducts, caves, fences and even boundaries between ancient neighbourhoods.</p> \n<p>Using hardware based on the ground or on an aeroplane, Lidar can produce images in three dimensions. In the future, drones will probably do most of the surveys. Besides Mexico, lidar has been used to penetrate forest canopy in many countries – among them Belize, Honduras, Guatemala and Cambodia – where the vegetation had been too dense or too troublesome to allow for traditional methods.</p> \n<p>“We’ve extended our [lidar] coverage by nearly 2,000 square kilometres,” archaeologist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/archaeoangkor\" title=\"\">Damian Evans</a> of the French School of Asian Studies said. He is based in the ancient Cambodian city of Angkor, where he is working as project supervisor. “Even our first rough results are showing us things that people have never seen before.”</p> \n<p>Lidar came into use in the 1960s, shortly after the laser was invented. It works like radar, calculating distance by measuring the time it takes for a reflected signal to return. But while radar uses radio waves for its signal, lidar uses a pulse of light.</p> \n<p>What makes lidar a better choice for many applications, including archaeology, is that the wavelength is about half a micron – tiny relative to radar wavelengths, which are measured in centimetres or decimetres. For details of a relatively small spot on the ground, lidar provides a precision that radar cannot match.</p> \n<p>But not at first. To make lidar effective in areas with heavy forest canopy or even low-lying vegetation, engineers needed to increase the pulse rate. The first devices produced about 2,000 pulses, or shots, per second, useless in the jungle because the vast majority of shots bounce off leaves and never reach the ground. Today’s archaeological surveys are routinely carried out at pulse rates up to 600,000 shots per second.</p> \n<p>The second feature that defines modern lidar surveys is “stops per shot”. Each shot is scattered by leaves and other vegetation as it travels towards the ground. Modern lidar can count up to four of these “stops” – obstacles – for each pulse. The fourth stop, if there is one, is the ground.</p> \n<p>The initial picture a lidar engineer sees is called the “point cloud”, a misty compendium of every pulse and every stop that the machinery has recorded at multiple elevations. Software can help a technician filter out everything but the last stop. The pattern that emerges is the topography below the trees – the ground plan of an archaeological site. And because of variations in the height of objects on the ground, engineers can show the contours, effectively creating maps in three dimensions.</p> \n<p>Lidar has myriad applications. Police use it in traffic speed guns; meteorologists use it to examine layers of the atmosphere and to search for concentrations of air pollution; Nasa uses it in docking devices at the International Space Station; the US military uses it to provide quick and detailed terrain mapping for troops.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12e4386e6cc053dfaf23803e8059a4af642cb1a9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434469093687/589b505b-34e4-4159-a74f-b5ca9163a77d-460x313.jpeg\" alt=\"color representation of the center of the ancient city of Caracol\" width=\"460\" height=\"313\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lidar technology helped produce this colour topical representation of the ancient city of Caracol.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caracol Archaeological Project, University of Central Florida</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>European archaeologists in the 1970s were among the first to use lidar to tease ancient landscapes from different types of terrain.</p> \n<p>“They were mapping old castles and looking at fields,” said scientist William E. Carter, who specialises in the mapping of specific places on Earth at the <a href=\"http://ncalm.cive.uh.edu\" title=\"\">National Science Foundation’s National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping</a>. “But it was temperate-zone work, almost all farmland.” Nobody using early lidar instruments had been successful at penetrating dense rain forest. “When all you had were 5,000 shots per second, you could spend your life flying over the trees and get nothing.”</p> \n<p>Carter first used lidar in the 1980s, working for the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Geodetic Survey before moving to the University of Florida, which in 2003 became a joint founder of the US National Mapping Center, along with the University of California at Berkeley and the National Science Foundation. In 2010 the centre moved to its current location at the University of Houston.</p> \n<p>The centre undertook its first major rainforest assignment in 2009, when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szIE7ZDk5Ng\" title=\"\">University of Central Florida archaeologists Diane and Arlen Chase</a> asked it to survey Caracol, a major Maya city more than 1,000 years ago. By this point, the centre’s aeroplane-mounted lidar was able to pulse 125,000 times per second.</p> \n<p>Given Caracol’s dense vegetation, harsh topography and lack of access, “we were tired of doing foot survey”, Diane Chase said. “We wanted the full extent of the site.” On foot, structures in the jungle were hard to map, she said, and agricultural terraces were “almost impossible”. Lidar produced the details of a site that covered 200 sq km – an area slightly larger than Washington DC – with agricultural terraces everywhere. “We could study the distribution of reservoirs, housing, roads, markets – all the parts of the city – things we had never seen before.”</p> \n<p>Fisher, at Angamuco, and Evans, at Angkor, both heard about the stunning results at Caracol, and both have been surveying with lidar ever since. Evans mounts his hardware in a helicopter for “operational flexibility” because he is expanding his survey north of Angkor in an environment “where we’re 100 miles [160km] from the nearest airport”. The research team sends a pickup truck with fuel for the helicopter to a clearing and “the chopper just touches down”.</p> \n<p>In Mexico, Fisher is partnering with a nearby French research team in an expanded survey of the Purepecha area. The region is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malpa%C3%ADs_(landform)\" title=\"\"><em>malpais</em></a> – “bad country” with thick soil and a lot of rocks – unsuitable for tractors and other modern equipment but good for ancient farmers who had no farm animals and had to sculpt and shape the terrain by hand, he said. “It was a really rich environment,” Fisher said. “They had big garden spaces, reservoirs and terraces. Lidar lets you see it all.”</p> \n<p>Each job presents its own challenges. In Cambodia, surveyors frequently have to go carefully through the lidar data, or point cloud, to&nbsp;spot traces of ancient ruins and infrastructure that lie below relatively modern roads, buildings and agricultural fields. In Mexico, the terrain is relatively uncluttered, but the forest cover varies in height, and structures are small and mostly made of the same volcanic stone that underlies the entire&nbsp;area.</p> \n<p>“This is the first time we’ve worked in this environment,” said National Mapping Center engineer Juan Fernandez Diaz. “In areas like Belize, Guatemala and Honduras, the tall, denser trees make it easier to pull features from underneath the canopy. When you’re trying to pull small features, the return can get mixed up with shorter vegetation.”</p> \n<p>And of course, with ancient ruins, the appetite always grows with the feeding. “The more we do, the more we find,” Fernandez Diaz said. “People always ask, ‘If you lidar something, will you know everything?’ The answer is always ‘no.’”</p> \n<p><strong> </strong></p> \n<p><em>This article appeared in </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\"><em>Guardian Weekly,</em></a><em> which incorporates material from the Washington Post</em></p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434468726036/Dense-Belize-jungle-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"From the ground, structures in the dense Belize jungle were hard to map, but airborne lidar devices revealed details of a site that covered 77 square miles with agricultural terraces everywhere.
