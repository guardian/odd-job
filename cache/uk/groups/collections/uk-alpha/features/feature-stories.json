I brought with me a notebook, pen and camera and walked the streets from the station down to the sea, found a spot that felt right and took a great many photographs of quite staggering dullness. In retrospect, the expedition was probably little more than an exercise in procrastination. As with so many first novels, the central character was not unlike my teenage self, the house and town not dissimilar to where I had grown up, and the day might just as usefully have been spent looking at old photographs, or even writing. Still, it felt important to make the journey, find the address and trace the character’s route from that house to the pier so that I could place pins in a map and know “here’s the house, the takeaway, the pub, it all happened right here”, even if it hadn’t really happened at all. Little of that research found its way on to the page directly. Reading the novel now, through the gaps in my fingers, there is nothing you could call descriptive prose and the fictional address I attributed to the house, 16 Archer Street, sounds horribly made up. But if the expedition was a little foolish and pretentious, it still felt important to go, because wasn’t this what proper writers were meant to do?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/sep/27/david-nicholls-books-interview-one-day-us-fiction\">David Nicholls: 'I didn't want to write a dodgy disappointment'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Cut to 12 years later and I’m writing my fourth novel, <em>Us</em>, in which the narrator, Douglas Petersen, is hurtling towards Bologna airport in order to catch a flight to Madrid, where he hopes to be reunited with his estranged son. I have never visited Bologna but a few clicks of the computer mouse bring me a thousand images of the railway station, inside and out. The online website has already told me the train’s arrival time on the day of the fictional events, and a few more clicks will bring up a map of the fastest taxi route to the airport. Zooming in on the station, I can take the hand of the little unisex figure in the right-hand corner, drop it in the ticket hall and, in view mode, click through the doors and find a taxi. These images were captured on an overcast day, but it’s not beyond my imagination to picture August heat as I click through the route, looking left and right, along a nondescript urban ring road to the small airport, which is close to the city and looks like almost every other small airport I have ever seen.</p> \n<p>In the finished novel, this journey will take up four sentences. My virtual mapping of the route will have almost no discernible impact on the prose that I’ve already sketched out – as adjectives go, “nondescript” doesn’t paint much of a picture – and, once again, what I justify as research might just as easily be dismissed as the writer’s tendency to arse around. It’s certainly less costly and time-consuming than visiting Bologna, but it still feels a little like cheating. What if I’ve missed something? Isn’t being there part of the job?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"47d15e1199d9246c3a0a1db63c6ec03708cd6650\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432301287967/f3261d61-97ab-4181-a7b5-9d1e618d9ef8-460x243.jpeg\" alt=\"quote\" width=\"460\" height=\"243\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Not for all writers, no. Kafka never saw Amerika, Bellow wrote <em>Henderson the Rain King</em> before visiting Africa and EL James stumbled on no red rooms in Seattle, exploring on the internet instead. Stef Penney’s fine Canadian-set novel <em>The Tenderness of Wolves</em> was researched in the reading room of the British Library, a fact that was much reported at the time, as if not visiting was somehow dishonest. That novel is set in the 1860s, and for writers of historical, fantastical or futuristic fiction, physical distance is just part of the challenge; a train ticket, a notepad and camera won’t help you much if you’re trying to conjure up Wolf Hall, Westeros or the Republic of Gilead.</p> \n<p>Besides, precision is not always the desired aim. Muriel Spark’s Edinburgh, Peckham and Kensington are specific and detailed right down to the bus routes, yet one of her most brilliant and unsettling books, <em>The Driver’s Seat</em>, follows her central character from the “north” on a holiday to a kind of generalised “southern” every-city. There’s a Metropole hotel, a post office, public squares, a museum with “ancient pavements”, but the setting really might be Athens or Rome, Palermo or Barcelona. Simultaneously vivid and vague, the effect is disorientating and absolutely appropriate for that queasy and unsettling story.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c400cc15c4c78d2fe0b00896b0e4c0f3bc5900a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432225924186/09ce2c37-8d22-427a-bed5-4138d76cddb5-460x380.jpeg\" alt=\"Carey Mulligan in Far From the Madding Crowd.\" width=\"460\" height=\"380\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Hardy’s Wessex also lies outside of time’ … Carey Mulligan in <em>Far from the Madding Crowd</em>.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The success of such imagined, unvisitable worlds might argue against the necessity of first-hand experience. After all, the reader has an imagination, too, and merely to write the word “Bologna” or “Southend” or “42nd Street” will call up an image from the innumerable mental picture postcards we carry with us. Even on the page, the streets and squares of Shakespeare’s Verona feel distinct from his Venice or Vienna, despite the minimal description. If the reader can supply the characters with a face and voice then surely they’re capable of painting in the background?</p> \n<p>Yet even when the reader’s imagination can be relied on, there’s still the author’s anxiety about getting it horribly wrong and, like Shakespeare, marooning the characters on Bohemia’s non-existent coast. Take the (apocryphal?) author who mistook the map’s ring-road for some mighty river and sent his characters walking there. Besides, research is not just a matter of fact-checking. A novelist’s deep immersion in a place is often part of the appeal, the sense that not only were they there, but things happened to them, and it’s impossible to read about Mavis Gallant’s Paris, Isherwood’s Berlin or any number of locations in Conrad and Greene and not feel as if that environment has been both observed and experienced at first hand; fiction as first-class travel-writing, with the author as our man in Havana.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3d2deadcb4832bff8d411fbdfca76b965c9e5a3d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432305349031/919e9281-7ffc-46c1-b948-e89972e9c374-460x230.jpeg\" alt=\"quote 4\" width=\"460\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, other writers create familiar worlds that are precisely conveyed, mappable almost, while remaining overtly fictitious; Middlemarch, Cranford, Barchester and on through Tilling, Hardborough and Ambridge. It’s an approach that works better for self-contained provincial communities than city life. A renamed shadow-London, Moscow or Rome might run the risk of seeming absurd – what would you call it? What are its landmarks, its history? How could you begin to make it up? Consequently when those provincial characters leave their fictionalised homes to travel, the real-world locations seem to materialise around them. In <em>Great Expectations</em>, Dickens’s London locations are characteristically precise and significant, so that Jaggers lives on the south side of Gerrard Street, Wemmick’s castle is in Walworth and Estella resides on Richmond Green, but further from the capital the specifics disappear and we enter the “marsh country”; vividly conveyed, geographically obscure, it’s enough to know that Satis House is “uptown”. A little digging places the model for that famous churchyard in real-life Cooling, Kent, but once outside London there are many fewer pins in the real-world map.</p> \n<p>Perhaps no author has played these geographical games with more enthusiasm than Thomas Hardy, not just creating a fictional town but reimagining an entire region as a stage-set in which to play out his dramas, the region expanding with the number and scope of the stories. He describes Wessex “a partly real, partly dream country ... which people can go to, take a house in and write to the papers from”, but that “dream” element is essential in fiction that is sometimes a recreation of the realities of rural life – its farming practices, rituals, superstitions and dialect – sometimes fanciful, romanticised and melodramatic. In contrast to Dickens, Hardy’s landscapes start to blur as we approach London. Try to imagine Bathsheba or Tess or Jude on Regent Street; they become harder to envision, like stage actors disappearing into the darkness of the wings. Why go to London anyway? “There was quite enough human nature in Wessex for one man’s literary purpose.” Adding to this sense of self-containment, Hardy’s Wessex also lies outside of time; a novel like <em>Far from the Madding Crowd</em> is stripped of current events and topical references; even the dates on the gravestone are missing.</p> \n<p>Hardy was amused and flattered by readers’ attempts to find real-life addresses in a highly fictionalised world – “I do not contradict these keen hunters of the real” – and cheerfully open about his inspiration, approving the publication of <em>A Handbook to the Wessex Country of Thomas Hardy</em> by his friend Hermann Lea. If Hardy was ever obliged to make adjustments to the reality, he was quick to own up, confessing in his introduction to <em>Madding Crowd</em> that “Everdene farm has taken a witch’s ride of a mile or more from its actual location.” Later editions of the Wessex novels even came embellished with a map, because what could be more authoritative and informative than a map? Like family trees at the start of a novel, maps contribute to that sense of a carefully constructed alternative reality and – even better than a map of Middle Earth or the Seven Kingdoms – the Wessex map allows the reader to overlay the ghost- and real-worlds, so that the Hardy enthusiast can spend a wonderful holiday re-enacting Tess Durbeyfield’s treks, though in more appropriate footwear and with less tragic consequences. It’s an enjoyable conceit, a game between author and reader; feel free to imagine the streets and landmarks of Dorchester, Winchester and Salisbury, but let’s agree to call them something else. Of course there are approximations and variations, and the map is not suitable for use by pedants; it would be too much to rename Stonehenge, but if Wintoncester is Winchester, why is Southampton, further west, still Southampton, Bristol still Bristol, Bath Bath? Because, Hardy answers, those large towns lie outside the outline of the traditional kingdom. They are offstage, and while a character might visit Bristol, Bath or London, the reader can’t follow them. It almost seems as if the characters have a fictionalising effect on the settings, so that if Tess were to meet her end in Southampton rather than Wincanton, that city would acquire a new name, too.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5a66e9fb5874c0cdd7886da4593ca0431dc951f0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432231167486/fdeb09b4-d042-45de-9e71-0172b43752bc-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"‘The most obvious inadequacy of this approach is that if the author doesn’t leave their desk, then nothing happens to the author’ … David Nicholls.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The most obvious inadequacy of this approach is that if the author doesn’t leave their desk, then nothing happens to the author’ … David Nicholls.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hal Shinnie</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of the unintended consequences of these overlapping worlds is tourism. After following in Tess’s footsteps, why not track Mrs Dalloway around Bloomsbury or Leopold Bloom around Dublin on Bloomsday? The phenomenon is particularly apparent outside the most famous postal address in fiction, 221B Baker Street, an address that did not exist in Conan Doyle’s time. Perhaps he was wary of inconveniencing the residents, anticipating the thousands of tourists who now queue to enter the Sherlock Holmes Museum, seemingly indifferent to the fact that the current holder of the fictional address actually stands at No 239. An even stranger example of our desire to mark fictional events on a map can be found in a dark, cramped courtyard in Verona, where hundreds of tourists congregate beneath Juliet’s balcony. Who cares that it was attached to the building in the 1930s, that the house never belonged to a Capulet family, that Shakespeare probably never came here and that the play’s text doesn’t even mention a balcony? It’s now part of the itinerary for those who would like to think “it happened right here, or somewhere like it”, to recite the lines and write something sentimental on the wall in the space provided. In <em>Us</em>, Douglas Petersen stumbles on this spot by accident on a sweltering August afternoon and rails against the ridiculous artifice of it all, unaware that he doesn’t really exist either.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>While there’s clearly no agreed method for an author to acquire a sense of place, I’ve always wanted to know a location at first hand, and have always been able not only to place a pin in the map but also to specify a date and time, so that the flat on Rankeillor Street in Edinburgh where Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew wake on 15 July 1988 is the same sublet flat that I shared with 15 other students during that summer’s fringe festival. This is not to say that the events are autobiographical – that’s rarely the case – but experience provides a sort of sense-memory, an authenticity that hopefully finds its way on to the page, because if the background is tangible and real, then hopefully events in the foreground will seem more plausible, too. Mapping and timing the journeys also seems important, and while writing <em>One Day</em> I stomped from Rankeillor Street up Arthur’s Seat then down to the New Town and on to the point on Hanover Street where the final conversation takes place. I can’t claim that the re‑enactment had a huge effect on the text; the only detail I remember lifting from life was the cock-and-balls graffiti that someone had scrawled in green Sharpie on the trig point on Arthur’s Seat. Did they bring the pen with them with this in mind? I wondered, and had Emma wonder this, too.</p> \n<p><em>Us</em> is a kind of road movie by rail, a disastrous grand tour of Europe during which Douglas tries to save his marriage and salvage his relationship with his son. Douglas is an obsessive planner and it seemed appropriate that the novel should also function as an itinerary, so that it might be perfectly possible to retrace the final holiday of the Petersen family, see the same paintings, catch the same trains, sit on the same benches but without suffering the same emotional breakdown. The settings were to include cities I knew quite well – Paris, Venice – others, like Bologna, that I didn’t know at all and a few that I’d visited just once, many years before. It seemed safe to assume that Siena hadn’t changed a great deal since 1992, but nevertheless a certain amount of time was spent Googling my way around Europe in the name of research and at times this was very helpful indeed. There’s a set-piece in which the novel’s hero tries to see all of Florence in the 45-minute gap between trains, and it was reassuring to stand a virtual Douglas outside Santa Maria Novella station then set him running, clicking through the streets at something approaching his manic pace, looking up and down to answer certain questions along the way. How much of the Duomo can you see from the corner of Via dei Rondenelli? Can you glimpse the Ponte Vecchio from Piazza della Signoria? As a way of experiencing Florence this was, of course, entirely inadequate, a fish-eyed lens view with no sounds or smells or interaction, but it provided confirmation, and in the same way I was able to find the precise spot where Douglas proposes marriage to Connie, see the view from the Accademia bridge, sit on a particular bench outside the Prado and know that I wasn’t too far off, that it was still as I remembered.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f24ddc6d1d208b8de5d6db3580a11180e3aeadbb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432226665095/796cfdde-8364-4f00-aabf-d4d88b257770-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess in One Day\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess in <em>One Day</em>, with Edinburgh in the background.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The most obvious inadequacy of such an approach is that if the author doesn’t leave their desk, then nothing happens to the author. Some writers have fun with this mingling of personal and fictional experience, and I enjoyed both Ben Lerner’s <em>Leaving the Atocha Station</em> and Geoff Dyer’s <em>Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi</em>, books where a blurring of author and narrator invites the reader to think, my God, did this stuff really happen? Even when the work is unequivocally fictional, the author wants to bring something home from the journey, a useful souvenir. Visiting a book fair in Moscow I found myself sharing a table in the hotel’s breakfast room with some noisy and self-confident armament manufacturers and this encounter, heavily fictionalised, found its way into <em>Us</em>, as did the smallest hotel room in Venice, a heavy, salty meal in Munich and the sleepless night that followed, an awkward encounter with the bikers outside a bar in Amsterdam. There’s that familiar feeling: this is an awful experience, maybe I can use it.</p> \n<p>For other episodes in the novel, clicking was clearly not going to be enough and so between first and second drafts I made a number of frantic journeys to fill in some gaps, experiencing Douglas’s exhaustion on a long hike around the Louvre, taking the train from Paris to Amsterdam and from Munich across the Alps to stand beneath that ridiculous balcony in Verona, and while these journeys undoubtedly improved the sketched-out versions, I hope I’ve avoided another potential pitfall of “being there”, the tendency to cram all the research on to the page. “He found his seat on the train, 47C, the fabric of which was of a vibrant cobalt blue striped with chlorophyllic green, soft to the touch but statically charged and still carrying a trace of the previous occupant’s floral eau de cologne. He opened his newspaper and noted how the page’s proportions differed from the familiar ...” Every detail declares authenticity but it’s the literary equivalent of looking at someone’s holiday snaps. The best writers of place, I think, are those that select a few choice details or a single image, and for me the model for this kind of economy must be Penelope Fitzgerald, equally good on places that she knew at first hand and foreign, historical settings; the household washday that instantly establishes 18th-century Germany in <em>The Blue Flower</em> or the laundry frozen hard enough to knock out a tooth in <em>The Bookshop</em>’s windblown Suffolk town – place and time established with a single stroke.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eae28c783c472e644d2afb1a9b5a7b286eeb8c94\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432301523585/47e7943e-8b50-4d5c-b2db-9c575deb4a17-460x230.jpeg\" alt=\"quote 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"230\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Geographical details in a fictional world allow the reader to fix a spot and believe “it happened here”. Many writers fight this kind of literalism, obscuring detail or creating unvisitable worlds, while others create an inbetween world, a place the reader can recognise without knowing the co-ordinates. My own inclination is to continue to go there if I can, to find points on the map and take those dull, dull photographs, because the research is often as much about reassuring the author as convincing the reader. Like a director scouting for film locations, the author can look around, take it in and stage the scene. The fictional can be grounded, just so long as everything is right.</p> \n<p>In 1921, James Joyce wrote to his aunt Josephine Murray in Dublin and asked her to do some research on his behalf. “Is it possible for an ordinary person to climb over the railings of No 7 Eccles Street, either from the path or the steps, lower himself from the lowest part of the railings till his feet are within two or three feet of the ground and drop unhurt? I saw it done myself but by a man of rather athletic build. I require this information in detail in order to determine the wording of a paragraph.” We now live in an age where possession of a stranger’s postcode allows us to peer into their windows, and a quick search on the internet reveals that No 7 Eccles Street, Leopold and Molly’s house, has long gone, and all that remains, the old front door, is now on display at the James Joyce Centre. Were Joyce writing now, he could have jogged his memory without leaving Paris, but it’s reassuring to note that even someone as steeped in a city as Joyce still felt the need to take a look – still needed confirmation that he had got things absolutely right.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> David Nicholls’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/oct/01/us-david-nicholls-review-fiction\"><em>Us</em></a> is out in paperback from Hodder.</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432225457195/Illo-for-Review-23-May-20-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illo for Review 23 May 2015 Illustration: michael kirkham at heartagency.com","credit":"michael kirkham at heartagency.com","altText":"Illo for Review 23 May 2015","cleanCaption":"Illo for Review 23 May 2015 Illustration: michael kirkham at heartagency.com"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432301288281/9480a710-6b99-458a-82af-169135b0ae86-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":300,"width":569,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guim","altText":"quote"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432225925190/09ce2c37-8d22-427a-bed5-4138d76cddb5-2060x1703.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1703,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Hardy’s Wessex also lies outside of time’ … Carey Mulligan in <em>Far from the Madding Crowd</em>.

There are still many bulk collection programmes out there that affect other things – such as financial records, such as travel records – that are even more intrusive. What it says is that bad laws are not forever and if we work together, we can change them.”</p> \n<p>Speaking ahead of a Senate vote on surveillance, which may come as early as Friday, he said it did not seem tenable to him that senators would vote to allow the NSA to retain its existing powers. He argued that the Senate had two choices. </p> \n<p>“They can either lose their authority entirely or they can accept at least some reforms.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456859327__\n</div> \n<p>Almost two years on from the first of his disclosures about surveillance, Snowden has defied critics in the intelligence agencies who predicted he would end up largely forgotten and miserable in exile in Russia. Instead, he has emerged as an icon for the privacy movement, able to communicate through the internet with campaigners in the US and elsewhere round the world. </p> \n<p>He has also established a life for himself in Russia, along with his girlfriend Lindsay Mills. He seemed relatively relaxed and in good humour, though with no expectation that his exile in Russia will end any time soon.</p> \n<p>Former deputy director of the CIA Michael Morell, in a newly published memoir, claimed the Snowden leaks had helped terrorists and contributed to the rise of Islamic State, and that Americans might die at the hands of terrorists because of Snowden. Snowden rejects the charge. </p> \n<p>“He said I played a role in the rise of Isis but he did not provide any evidence for that.” </p> \n<p>The whistleblower added that terrorists were not stupid and been aware long before his disclosures that their communications could be listened into.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You know my work is not finished. In fact, I would argue that it has only begun.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Responding to one of the commonest lines deployed by his critics, he said: “People who say they don’t care about privacy because they have got nothing to hide have not thought too deeply about these issues. What they are really saying is I do not care about this right. When you say I don’t care about the right to privacy because I have nothing to hide, that is no different than saying I don’t care about freedom of speech because I have nothing to say or freedom of the press because I have nothing to write.”</p> \n<p>He was concerned about what he saw as a trend in liberal advanced democracies such as the UK, France, Canada and Australia of a narrowing of rights in response to terrorism and described this as a tragedy. None of the mass surveillance programmes had been shown to have helped prevent any of the recent terrorist attacks.</p> \n<p>“We know in the Charlie Hebdo attack, in the attack in Canada, in the attack in Australia, all these individuals were known to government in advance of the attacks. It was not the fact that we were not watching people enough but the fact we were watching people so much we did not understand what we had.”</p> \n<p>He described comments made by the British prime minister, David Cameron, about proposed measures to clamp down on extremism as being “an extraordinary departure from the traditional operation of liberal societies”.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456856868__\n</div> \n<p>Two years on from outing himself as the whistleblower, how has his life changed? Different time zones means he works late into the night, in contact with supporters in the US and other countries. “I get a little bit less sleep. I have to get up a little bit earlier. But at the same time I feel very good about the sense of contribution that I feel, being able to help, being able to do something, being able to leave behind better things, being able to say you were a small part of something important is meaningful,” he said.</p> \n<p>“When I think about the future, I think about the fact that there is still so much to be done. You know my work is not finished. In fact, I would argue that it has only begun.”</p> \n<p>He appears uncomfortable with his status as an icon. While he was impressed with such things as the artists in New York who <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/apr/06/edward-snowden-statue-bust-brooklyn-park-covered\">erected a statue of him in a Brooklyn park</a>, he said: “It is also a little concerning because it should not be about me, it should not be about elevating any individual because it is about us. We should be thinking about how we enshrine our rights in a statue, not people.”</p> \n<p>In the months after he fled Hong Kong, discussions opened between his lawyers in the US and the Justice Department on a deal that might see him return to America to face trial but that has since gone dead. Do the federal court decisions and the House vote make his return more likely? “As much as I would like to go home, that is not really for me to say. This is fundamentally a public decision, a governmental decision, not a private one. No one gets to dictate the terms of what they do and the price they have to pay for that. But I do think it is fair to say that no one can claim any longer that these programmes were legal, that there were no abuses, or the court would not have made the decision that they did, which is that things have to change.”</p> \n<p>An option would be to make his way to western Europe but the likelihood is he would just be extradited to the US. “Well, I did apply for asylum in 21 countries around the world but unfortunately all of them either declined or did not respond, many of them in western Europe. “We do see moods changing. We do see governments appearing to reconsider their position. Unfortunately, it is quite a gap to bridge.” </p> \n<p>He was visited recently by a delegation of parliamentarians from Sweden, who expressed interest not only in surveillance issues but concern over his own personal situation. Enough to offer him asylum? “I don’t think they make the decision,” he said.</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/5/21/1432210717105/KP_237019_crop_620x372.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"Supporting images for Edward Snowden: 'When you monitor everyone, you understand nothing'","cleanCredit":"Photograph: guardian.co.uk"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-22T16:46:25Z","lastModified":"2015-05-22T18:04:29Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":567,"contributors":[{"name":"Alan Rusbridger","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/11/24/1416841217351/Alan-Rusbridger-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/alanrusbridger"},{"name":"Janine Gibson","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/28/1422445265936/Janine-Gibson-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/janinegibson"},{"name":"Ewen MacAskill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ewenmacaskill"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Edward Snowden","NSA","US news","Surveillance","US Congress","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/edward-snowden","webTitle":"Edward Snowden"},{"id":"us-news/nsa","webTitle":"NSA"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/surveillance","webTitle":"Surveillance"},{"id":"us-news/us-congress","webTitle":"US Congress"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"us-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-456859327","source":"guardian.co.uk","durationInSeconds":113,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/05/21/150521Snowden3_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/05/21/150521Snowden3.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/5/21/1432211358935/KP_237042_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Edward Snowden: 'My work is not finished' -

Which is why I was always complaining that the story had been different last night.”</p> \n<p>And that is why his father, Wilbert Awdry, wrote the stories down; and <a href=\"http://www.thomasandfriends.com/en-gb/\">Thomas the Tank Engine</a> was born.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7b8cc7d883ab81229ee01e75da4e18aaebd4380\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432126024771/c8fc3c5d-75f2-4ca7-be22-206e56161acc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomas the Tank Engine\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas the Tank Engine</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the early 1940s, paper – like everything else – was scarce. Sometime soon afterwards, Wilbert’s wife Margaret went out to buy books for the children and returned disappointed. “She said to Father, ‘Your stories are as good as anything in the bookshops and they need to publish more books for children.’” says Christopher’s sister Veronica, who is three years his junior.</p> \n<p>“Father’s books were only handwritten, but my mother sent them to a cousin who she thought was a literary agent, but turned out to be a radio producer, and he put Father in touch with the person who published the very first stories.”</p> \n<p>That was in 1945, so Thomas is celebrating a milestone birthday this year – his 70th. You can almost imagine what his response might have been all those decades ago if he’d been told he’d still be going strong – “I can’t do it! I can’t do it!” – just as Wilbert (whose unusual name was an amalgamation of the names of two uncles, William and Herbert) imagined the engine’s voice when he was himself a little boy living near a railway line in Wiltshire.</p> \n<p>The family home was near the <a href=\"http://www.ikbrunel.org.uk/box-tunnel\">Brunel-designed Box tunnel</a>, then the longest tunnel in England and a special engine was kept there to help push the freight trains up the hill. Wilbert would lie in bed at night, listening to the trains puffing up the incline, and imagine their personalities and hear them egging one another on. These were the memories he drew on decades later when Christopher was ill, and the colourful characters of industrious Edward, pompous Gordon and impish Thomas emerged.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/07/thomas-tank-engine-danger-fear\">How Thomas the Tank Engine helped my son - and me - through a dark time</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Talking to Christopher and Veronica, it’s clear that the stories of Thomas the Tank Engine, and all his railway friends, grew out of events in their family life. After the first stories were published, Christopher was sent to boarding school but Veronica and their younger sister Hilary, who died in 2013, were still at home, and Veronica remembers that their father would bring his latest stories down to the table for tea and read them to his daughters.</p> \n<p>“The stories were always written to be read out loud, so he would try them on us,” she says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTCEjQ1SpsQ\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tTCEjQ1SpsQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  An episode of Thomas the Tank Engine\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One day there was a story the girls believed was unfair: the tale of a race between two trains and they thought one engine had more hazards to deal with than the others. “Father drew us a map to prove that we were wrong,” says Veronica. That map led to the creation of the fictional Island of Sodor, somewhere between the British mainland and the Isle of Man, which provides the lively backdrop to the events of later volumes of the stories.</p> \n<p>There were two big passions that ran down the Awdry line: one was trains, and Wilbert’s father, Vere, whose heyday had been in the Victorian train age, was as fascinated by them as his son and grandson would be; the other was the Church of England. Vere was a clergyman and Wilbert followed him into the ministry; the parish, says Veronica, always came first in his life.</p> \n<p>“If there was a sermon to write he’d always do that before the stories,” she says. But days off were spent writing about Thomas, or at narrow-gauge railways or railway museums. It was on one such outing, in the cafe at the <a href=\"http://www.bluebell-railway.co.uk/\">Bluebell railway</a> in Sussex in 1979, that he got talking to a TV producer, Britt Allcroft, who told him she’d love to make a series out of the Thomas books.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c34a50bab080fb73f0d86fb49f45e8c1cd61c6f7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432050314744/ac721584-72ff-429f-b026-57a9a8ed4cdd-460x342.jpeg\" alt=\"Veronica, left, and Christopher with their father, the Rev W Awdry, mother Margaret and sister Hilary, 1965.\" width=\"460\" height=\"342\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Veronica, left, and Christopher with their father, the Rev W Awdry, mother Margaret and sister Hilary, 1965.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Sherratt/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Father said you’re welcome to try, but others have already tried and failed,” says Christopher. But Allcroft – who remortgaged her house to raise the funds to make the series – had a new technique that put the camera at eye level and made viewers feel much more part of the action. With Ringo Starr providing the narration (his successors in the job included Alec Baldwin and Pierce Brosnan), the programmes became one of the most enduring chapters of TV history, and raised Thomas and his creator to a new level of fame.</p> \n<p>The Awdrys were astonished by how it all took off. “Father was very surprised by it,” says Christopher, who worked for many years for the Inland Revenue, but who also toured the country giving talks about Thomas, and is himself an author of several books on railways. “But it gave him an income for his retirement, and meant my parents were able to buy their own home after a lifetime of living in vicarages.”</p> \n<p>They named their house Sodor after Thomas’s island and Wilbert spent his time dispensing advice to parents who saw him as a childrearing guru and wrote to ask him for guidance.</p> \n<p>Christopher and Veronica sometimes muse on what it was that made their father’s creations so successful: maybe, says Veronica, whose career was in teaching, it was the child-sized books; or that bright colours and numbers, with which small children could identify, featured so prominently on their pages. Or perhaps it was because, says Christopher, his father was always aware of the fact that parents were as much his readers as children, or his trait of never talking down to young people. “When we were little, and with our friends, he would always talk to us as people. He always made us feel as children that we were worth having a conversation with, and I think that came through in the books.” And there was too the fact that, as a curate, he spent several years running the Sunday school, so had contact with young children and understood what they wanted from a story.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2009/jan/31/sons-thomas-tank-engine\">Bibi van der Zee has had enough of Thomas the Tank Engine</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Wilbert died in 1997, in time to have seen two locomotives named after him (“he hated locomotives” says Christopher); the 70th anniversary is giving Thomas a fillip, but how much do the books have to say to children today? The stories, while full of appeal in one sense, are underpinned by a deeply orthodox Christianity – if the engines go off the tracks, they pay the price – and, though Awdry did add some female engines to the later stories, the original tales are full of interesting, exciting male engines and slightly boring female carriages who never make quite make it out of the sidings, imaginatively speaking.</p> \n<p>But Christopher and Veronica, who have spoken out against the updating of their father’s books to leave out, for example, mentions of Christmas, are not just being loyal to the brand when they say they believe a new generation of children will enjoy Thomas. “Children need rules and authority,” says Christopher. “They like the idea of a world in which there is order and certain behaviour is expected.”</p> \n<p>Autistic children in particular, he says, love his father’s stories. But the best proof of all is that Veronica’s grandson Henry, who is three, is utterly captivated by them. He has no idea yet, of course, that the Thomas he loves was created by his great-grandfather; but, says Veronica, he can’t be the only three-year-old who in 2015 is mesmerised by the stories.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span><em> The Thomas the Tank Engine Man: the life of Reverend W Awdry by Brian Sibley is published by Lion, &pound;18.99.

They were referring to a boy with Down’s syndrome, and associated behavioural difficulties, who had been in their daughter’s class for the six years of primary school. The boy was demonstrating behaviours that would see another child excluded. This included hitting, kicking, biting (students and staff), damaging property, swearing and disrupting lessons to the point that the classroom had to be evacuated several times a week – and their daughter was struggling to cope with the disorder.</p> \n<p>We are an inclusive school, and were committed to meeting his needs, determined not to fail him. Special educational needs (SEN) experts had been involved from the start and full-time, one-to-one support was in place. Educational psychologists suggested a child-centred programme of study; speech and language therapists delivered communication therapy; occupational therapists designed programmes of activities to be done three times a day, requiring designated space and costly equipment. We accommodated all of this and more in our one-form entry primary school where both space and cash are at a premium, driven by his parents’ unwavering insistence that mainstream school was the only place he could ever reach his full potential. Other children with similar needs had succeeded here – why not him?</p> \n<p>But in striving for inclusive education, we had unwittingly turned a blind eye to the elephant in the room. If inclusion requires a child to be excluded from the same experiences and boundaries as everyone else just to remain on the premises, then it’s not inclusion. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve been told to put the child first, but why only the child with SEN? What about the 29 other children whose education is hindered and – in some cases – personal safety jeopardised? I am responsible for those children too.</p> \n<p>I am for inclusion, but not at all costs. In this case, the cost was not only the child’s happiness and progress, but the happiness and progress of everyone else in the school. We lost two good members of staff after they had been reduced to tears on numerous occasions by feelings of utter helplessness. On bad days, senior leaders would take over, trying every trick in the book but managing little more than babysitting to give staff respite and minimise collateral damage.</p> \n<p>We had hoped that things would improve with more time and strategies. But as the child got bigger, more independent, physically stronger and emotionally aware, it was apparent we couldn’t offer the right help. We ran out of options.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, the boy is now in specialist provision and, with the right support, is doing much better. But it was too late for some of his classmates who transferred schools to ensure their own education could proceed more effectively.</p> \n<p>I recall the headteacher explaining that our school “believed in inclusion” and that we wanted our students to grow up understanding and tolerant of differences, prepared for the “real world”. But that’s not what was happening. In the real world, nobody would force someone with SEN to stay in an environment where they were coping so badly. The rest of the children in his class may well now have a negative view of people with Down’s syndrome, unfairly tainted by one experience.</p> \n<p>Most primary teachers receive very little training in how to teach SEN students and it is often left to teaching assistants, who are even less qualified, to provide the necessary support. I remember his parents saying: “You can’t just put any learning support assistant with him, he needs a specialist with expertise in his area of need.” I completely agreed, but such specialists aren’t common and those with the skills the child needed tend to work in special schools, not as support assistants in mainstream primaries.</p> \n<p>In year 2 we have a little girl with autism. She is doing well, but is prone to outbursts and sometimes lies down and refuses to move – it’s her way of coping. Her classmates have learned not to react to this and if she lies down they simply walk round her so lessons can continue. This is, in some ways, a positive thing: they accept her and don’t bat an eyelid when her behaviour is unusual. However, I can’t help but feel we’ve brought up a cohort of children who, when they see someone with special needs in distress, would assume they should just walk by without offering help.</p> \n<p>Inclusion in principle is the right sentiment but, at best, it can come at a high price and, at worst, it can be a complete injustice. Children are individuals so the solution needs to be individual. There are plenty of examples of children with SEN who are successfully integrated in mainstream schools to the benefit of themselves and their peers. But if we want children with SEN to have the same opportunities to succeed as others, we should not feel guilty about admitting they may need a different environment in which to do this. Furthermore, our responsibility is to all children equally, not just those with SEN. </p> \n<p>We need to be very careful that well-meaning ideals are not depriving children of their right to the specialist provision they need, nor indeed – if we are being truly inclusive – depriving others in the process. Inclusion, yes, but not at any cost.</p> \n<h2>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

This is where the land runs out and the great historic American progression westwards must perforce come to a halt. It’s the place where “the sun gives up and sinks into the black, black sea” (John Rechy, City of Night). Where history, geography and geology can no longer be outrun. This was deeply impressed into my mind soon after moving to the city in 1992. </p> \n<p>Within a month of my arrival, Los Angeles was in flames in the horrifying and bloody aftermath of the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/us-news/rodney-king\">Rodney King</a> verdict, and I stood on the roof of my six-storey apartment building in Koreatown that evening and watched the fires jump northwards towards me at the staggering rate of 20 blocks per hour. By midnight, if I imagined myself standing at the centre of a flat clock-face, I could turn 360 degrees on the spot and count one or more fires for every minute of the hour: north, south, east and west. Dante or HG Wells – even Roland Emmerich – couldn’t have staged it more impressively, more soberingly, if they’d tried.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/apr/30/warner-bros-rethinks-its-advertising-for-san-andreas-movie-after-nepal-quake\">Warner Bros rethinks its advertising for San Andreas movie after Nepal quake</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> It focused my mind and in the years that followed, Los Angeles was successively beset by mudslides, all-consuming Malibu brushfires and the Northridge earthquake of 1994. This was not altogether unexpected. I was familiar with <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/joan-didion\">Joan Didion</a>’s notion of LA as haunted by the ghosts of fire, uprising and an earth that assuredly does <em>not</em> stand still, because as hard as nature has tried to level Los Angeles, it tends to take a decade or two off here and there (small comfort: we’re well overdue for another huge earthquake). </p> \n<p>Hollywood screenwriters and film-makers, on the other hand, never rest and do not stint in their efforts to pound, pulverize, flatten, flood, burn, boil, bloody and batter the city they have chosen as their home, partly for laughs, but also partly out of that mysterious sense of civic self-loathing that grips anyone who lives or moves here.</p> \n<p> And this weekend it happens all over again, as Dwayne Johnson and his cohorts face the umpteenth ecological assault on the city in San Andreas. Earthquake and its less familiar little sister, tsunami, are unleashed upon Los Angeles and San Francisco and soon enough the landscape is in flames, skyscraper-sized waves are washing away bridges, shorelines, tall buildings, as ocean liners are rolled head over heels, and even The Rock is at a loss to face down nature in all its fury.</p> \n<p> None of this is exactly new. In 1936, Hollywood staged one of its earliest – and creakiest – onscreen apocalypses in San Francisco, a melodrama about the city-leveling 1906 earthquake. Perhaps a better starting point, however, would be George Pal and Byron Haskin’s effects-heavy adaptation of War of the Worlds. HG Wells had seemed fit to have the Martian invader lay waste to London and southern England. Then Orson Welles famously restaged the landings for radio in 1938, this time in rural New Jersey. The same story then moved westwards again in 1953, by which time Haskin and Pal had found their perfect municipal victim and staging ground: Los Angeles. And why? Because it was <em>there</em>, right outside the studio door.</p> \n<p> In the decades since, writers, film-makers and LA city planners have followed parallel paths of destruction, each laying waste to the city in the manner of a gigantic palimpsest: build, destroy, rebuild, redevelop, rewrite, destroy, rinse, repeat, rebuild, re-destroy. It doesn’t hurt that southern California has always drawn apocalyptically minded last-chancers from L Ron Hubbard to Charles Manson (there’s a seeker born every minute, as they say), and also harbored a goodly number of the great science-fiction pioneers of the genre’s Golden Age, who came to hymn the region’s postwar defense boom and its imaginative and speculative possibilities, and stayed to savor the dystopian underside of their adopted hometown. </p> \n<p>All of them, it seemed, slavered at the chance to put into practice all of the nightmarish end-times scenarios that lurked in the landscape and geology of the region, and in the uneasy minds of its citizens: quake, flood, volcano, the desert re-engulfing the city, the water running out, the seas crashing in.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb6446931844b2349ff27511dfa21d0f19ba1451\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432322363352/1a05088b-62e3-41bb-8c6c-2d461cf664eb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Slash'n'burn: Volcano\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Slash’n’burn: Volcano.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Kobal Collection</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> In novels from Rudy Wurlitzer’s Quake (which opens at the notorious rock’n’roll crash-pad the Tropicana Motel and ends with mass executions in a sports stadium) to Alastair Maclean’s Goodbye, California, and in movies from Earthquake to 2012, buildings have been toppled, the landscape atomized, and the citizenry driven to riot, murder and madness. Earthquake (from 1974, the year Nixon resigned) remains impressive to this day, not so much because of its clunky SenseSurround effects and all that falling styrofoam masonry, but because of the complete breakdown in social controls and civic order that ensues. All of it dimly reflected America’s post-Watergate, post-Vietnam loss of confidence in social and civic institutions from the government all the way down to the national guard, which, instead of protecting the citizens, starts raping and murdering them (the golden age of the 70s disaster movie is also the moment at which post-1945 America lost all confidence in itself).</p> \n<p> There is less of that sort of thing in more mindless (but no less delectable) destruction fests like 2012, but there is a discernible glee in the way the film-makers have unleashed their effects teams on the city outside their door. There’s considerable pleasure to be had in watching it (literally) all go down. I for one watched in absolute delight as John Cusack and his family flew a small plane through the collapsing skyscrapers of downtown LA, one of which contained the offices of a particularly loathsome (and infamous) corporate law firm I once worked for. </p> \n<p> Where earthquakes fail, other horrors succeed. In Volcano, the earthquake’s seismic bedfellow starts pushing molten lava from the centre of the earth in waves down Wilshire Boulevard. The source of said lava, the La Brea Tar Pits (one of LA’s more dubious tourist attractions: a primordial swamp that contains dinosaur bones and smells of eggy farts), also opens and closes Steve De Jarnatt’s pocket-apocalypse cult thriller Miracle Mile, set on the same stretch of Wilshire Boulevard on the night nuclear war commences. In Them! (1954), the enemy is a squadron of gigantic, nuclear-irradiated super-ants, which converge upon LA causing every kind of havoc until they are finally subdued at another threadbare city landmark, the concretized Los Angeles River.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"926cd973c5c664758ed1e22c565ead59dab6e7e6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432322673119/5c231163-9036-4c18-a1f9-c0fe0e677083-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Search and destroy: the often ill-fated Capitol Records Building\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Search and destroy: the often ill-fated Capitol Records building.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Landau/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> That’s another thing about LA and disaster movies. We are painfully short of emblematic and iconic civic monuments for film-makers to destroy. In every end-of-the-world movie with a global scope (think Independence Day or Mars Attacks!), the doomed cities of the world are denoted by whichever of their indelible tourist attractions is levelled: the Eiffel Tower, Big Ben, the White House, the Empire State building and so on. In Los Angeles, the edifices that get destroyed are always, without exception, the Capitol Records building, followed by the Hollywood sign – two emblems of the entertainment industry, two instances of the entertainment industry’s bottomless self-loathing. Battle: Los Angeles, its knock-off Skyline, Escape From LA, even Spielberg’s 1941 – all of them see fit to topple these icons, again and again and again.</p> \n<p> If nature can’t get the job done, or the alien invaders are repelled, then time and gravity will have their chance. In The Omega Man (1972), Charlton Heston’s last man on earth fights zombie vampires in the ruins of downtown Los Angeles. The real ruins, that is, as the movie was filmed in the final stages of the 20-year post-war redevelopment of the area, as old Bunker Hill was plowed under to make room for the small copse of skyscrapers that forms the new downtown. </p> \n<p>Then there’s Blade Runner, whose dystopia merely exaggerates the prevalent civic phantasms of 1982 Los Angeles – smog, overpopulation, overdevelopment, acid rain, traffic, immigrants – until they become a single nightmare. By this stage, California, once the escape-hatch of the American Dream, has itself succumbed to all the ailments of the declining Rust Belt cities back east to which it was once a sun-kissed alternative: instead of the “Come To Sunny California” ad campaigns of the old 19th-century railroad companies, we now look to “A New Life in the Off-World Colonies …”, which will be the next California.</p> \n<p> Goodbye, California, indeed.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432321556138/0395bcc6-41e7-4ce0-a486-eff240ea0bea-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Moviestore/REX Shutterstock/Moviestore/REX_Shutterstock","altText":"Carla Gugino and Dwayne Johnson smashing up LA in San Andreas","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Moviestore/REX Shutterstock/Moviestore/REX_Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432322364767/1a05088b-62e3-41bb-8c6c-2d461cf664eb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Slash’n’burn: Volcano.

This is our day. This is our opportunity to shine, and we will shine.”</p> \n<p>Bikers’ <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/US-Defenders-Legislative-Strike-Force-Waco/576123109199808?fref=nf\">lobbying priorities</a> have covered areas as varied as firearms rights, privacy protections and traffic laws.</p> \n<p>In 2013, following the massacre at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, more than 2,000 bikers gathered in Austin to lobby against gun restrictions, local television station Fox 7 News reported. Many expressed support for <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/texas-pol-outlaw-exec-gun-orders-86227.html\">a bill that would have made proposed federal gun restrictions unenforceable in Texas</a>.</p> \n<p>“They’re going to try to take our guns because some looney tune killed a bunch of people,” biker John Johnson told Fox News 7 at the time. “This country was founded where we all had guns, the right to bear arms.” At least two of the bikers arrested in Waco on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mike.lynch.5836\">appear to have been at that 2013 rally</a>, according to Facebook posts. </p> \n<p> Other advocacy, according to newsletters, has focused on privacy rights and motorcycle safety legislation. </p> \n<p>In 2011, one group called <a href=\"http://www.texasabate.com/\">Texas Abate Confederation Inc</a> lobbied against information collection by Texas’s so-called “fusion centers”, which act as information sharing centers for federal, state and local law enforcement. Texas’s fusion centers were recently found <a href=\"https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2015/may/05/feds-and-circuses/%27\">collecting data on peaceful animal rights protesters</a>.</p> \n<p>This year, bikers lobbied to make “splitting lanes” legal. Already widely practiced (and in <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/motorcycle-lane-splitting-could-move-beyond-california-1425678764\">some states legal and considered safe</a>), splitting lanes is when a motorcyclist rides between cars in traffic. Every few years, the Texas Confederation of Clubs and Independents (TCOC&amp;I) lobbies against laws that would <a href=\"http://txcocinews.org/legislative-day.html\">require riders to wear helmets</a>, said William Smith, a Dallas-based attorney who works with the TCOC&amp;I and who has represented bikers in the past.</p> \n<p>The meeting in Waco on 17 May was meant to be an afternoon to debrief members of the TCOC&amp;I after the National Coalition of Motorcyclists conference in Denver, Colorado.</p> \n<p>The lobbying activities point to a sense of legitimacy even among some of the largest “outlaw” gangs in the country, and are part of organized activities that members often point to in response to being described as criminals by law enforcement. </p> \n<p>Organized charity runs and toy drives are evidence of civic engagement, they say, even as <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/5/19/8625981/outlaw-motorcycle-gangs-biker\">law enforcement experts insist some motorcycle clubs veer into</a> criminality.</p> \n<p>Over the past several years, thousands of organized bikers have asked lawmakers for legislation.</p> \n<p>“We don’t tell people you need to vote Democrat or Republican,” Smith said. “We say: here are the individuals, this is how they compare with our beliefs, and whatever you do just go vote.”</p> \n<p>TCOC&amp;I holds an annual legislative ride. It fosters voter enrollment and encourages members who are convicted felons to vote. And while Smith describes the organization as a “grassroots” coalition, law enforcement remains dubious.</p> \n<p>Police now believe that more than 300 weapons, including chains, brass knuckles and firearms were found in the Twin Peaks restaurant. (As police have struggled to process evidence from the scene this number has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/may/20/waco-shootout-guns-twin-peaks-restaurant\">fluctuated between 100 and 1,000</a>.) Texas may deregulate <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/may/19/texas-gun-laws-waco-gang-shooting-open-carry\">“open carry” of handguns</a> as early as Friday, but Smith said members of the Texas Confederation of Clubs and Independents were divided about this proposal.</p> \n<p>Smith said he would “not belong to an organization that engages, sponsors or participates in anything illegal”, and he called the shooting the result of “a few bad apples”.<br /></p> \n<p>Steve Cook, an oft-cited expert on biker gangs and police officer in Kansas City, Missouri, described TCOC&amp;I as an oversight group that allows Los Bandidos to keep a watchful eye on smaller clubs.</p> \n<p>“It’s a control thing,” <a href=\"http://www.wacotrib.com/news/twin-peaks-biker-shooting/brutal-violence-at-twin-peaks-exposes-fault-lines-in-motorcycle/article_59737113-c304-5e9e-9509-71bb7800778f.html\">he told the Waco Tribune</a>. “Bandidos are pulling all the puppet strings. It’s basically a way of telling the other clubs, ‘This is how we’re going to do things.’ It’s a way to keep track of them and make sure no one is communicating with the Hells Angels.”</p> \n<p>While the legislative rallies clearly show the diversity in the motorcycling world, and the interconnected nature of the clubs, they also show that Bandidos have taken established paths to lobby lawmakers. </p> \n<p>At the 2015 rally in the capitol, men wearing Bandidos “colors” – vests emblazoned with symbolic patches – mixed with other motorcycling clubs and independent riders.</p> \n<p>Where the video can be found online indicates how interconnected these clubs are.
