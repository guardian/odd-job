Many regarded her as a celebrity. They mourned her and honoured her life through comments and poems, and attacked those who spoke ill of her. “You savages are the lowest of the low, circling her grave like a bunch of drooling hyenas,” wrote Nasser. “Get bent, you aren’t worth a fraction of what she was.”</p> \n<p>The passenger in the Porsche, Mohammad Hossein Rabbani-Shirazi, died a few hours after the accident. He had purchased the car just a few days earlier and had allowed Akbarzadeh to take him for a spin.</p> \n<p>But his identity added further drama because he was the grandson of Ayatollah Rabbani-Shirazi, once an aid to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, leader of the 1979 Revolution. </p> \n<p>Ayatollah Abdolrahim Rabbani-Shirazi took part in the revolution and then acted as the representative of Khomeini in three of Iran’s provinces and sat on the body tasked with writing a new constitution. He was also a member of the Guardian Council, the Islamic constitutional watchdog, until his death – ironically in a car crash – in 1982.</p> \n<p>This regime connection to the fatal accident in a Porsche, the symbol par excellence of <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/search/tehran\">Tehran’s rich kids</a>, further inflamed many social media users and may have prompted an intervention by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeini’s successor as Iran’s supreme leader. On 26 April, Khamenei strongly criticised young Tehranis flaunting luxury cars as a sign of “emotional insecurity” and accused them of being “intoxicated by pride in wealth”. He called on the police to produce “a plan for confronting all of the different aspects of insecurity facing society”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"therichkidsoftehran\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; \n  &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; \n   &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/2aww5zvNx-/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Rich Kids of Tehran ⭐️ (@therichkidsoftehran)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2015-05-08T10:48:40+00:00&quot;&gt;May 8, 2015 at 3:48am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt; \n&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Nor was Khamenei the first to speak in such terms. Whether he knew it or not, he was echoing the words of <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2010/02/the-political-evolution-of-mousavi.html\">someone he has kept under house arrest for four years</a> for supporting street protests after the disputed 2009 presidential election.</p> \n<p>“We’re opposed to this kind of unabashed affluence,” Mir Hossein Mousavi told voters in the poor southern Tehran neighbourhood of Naazy Abad in March 2009, in the first speech of his presidential campaign. “When the wealthy parade their luxury cars in front of the less fortunate, it constitutes an oppression of the working classes.”</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/09/luxury-cars-tehran-iran.html\">increasing sight of luxury vehicles</a> has brought the issue of inequality onto Iran’s streets. Just past the prominent overpass on grand Mir Damad Avenue, I run into Yaqoub. He’s 40-ish and dressed in a tattered shirt that seems tailor made for his face. Yaqoub’s appearance illustrates the Tehrani colloquialism of “carton-sleeper” because with the most basic lodgings in the capital beyond his means, he has to sleep in a cardboard box.</p> \n<p>“I swear to the eighth Imam [an 8<sup>th</sup>-century Shia leader whose shrine is in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/may/07/prayer-food-sex-and-water-parks-in-irans-holy-city-of-mashhad\">Mashhad</a>, Iran], I haven’t eaten for a whole day. I have no work and no money. When I panhandle, no one gives me anything. I’m not old enough for them to feel pity for me yet. People slap me around and tell me to go get a job.”</p> \n<p>If an empty belly weren’t enough, Yaqoub has nicotine craving to nurse. He fishes a packet of cheap Farvardeen cigarettes out of a pocket, strikes a match, and takes a drag.</p> \n<p>“I swear to God, it’s debilitating,” he says. “Well, I was only a kid then, but I well recall that during the revolution they spoke of the oppressed, ‘the revolution of the barefooted’. Look at me, and there are <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/03/irans-cities-a-sea-of-poverty.html\">thousands like me in this town, a million even</a>. How is it that we don’t have something to eat or a place to lay down our heads?</p> \n<p>“And then when you look up, all you see are magnificent towers along this street. May they live happy lives. I don’t begrudge them their wealth, but maybe a bit should flow down to us. I am illiterate, have no money, and no family. Where am I to turn?

Just last year, the unabashed display of wealth on an Instagram page called #richkidsoftehran rankled a lot of Iranians. Photos showed young people lounging around in opulent Tehran penthouses, or in deluxe villas in the wealthy neighbourhood of Lavassan or on the shores of the Caspian Sea. Other pictures showed them in the latest model Porches and Maseratis. Throughout they are dressed in well-known western brands, their eyes exuding carelessness and pleasure - everything the 1979 revolution was supposed to banish. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/feb/04/sp-americans-in-iran-eve-1979-revolution\">1978: one last fling in Iran before the revolution</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The pages met a vociferous reaction not just from young, left-leaning social activists, but from a vast swath of the online community who found the pictures abhorrent. Soheila, 23, is a graphic design student living in the affluent neighbourhood of Shahrak-e Gharb, in western Tehran. She has what look like authentic Gucci sunglasses poised on her highlighted hair as she sips coffee at a gently lit, fashionable cafe.</p> \n<p>“There is nothing wrong with being wealthy, but these nouveau riche kids show off in a despicable way,” she says. “Well, I’m doing okay myself, if not as well as these bastards. But still, when I attend a party, I don’t rush to post pictures from it on Facebook or Instagram. I’m a student and all of my friends are on my friend lists. Most of them have ordinary lives.</p> \n<p>“Showing off your wealth is in really bad taste because we don’t live in a wealthy country. It’s not like this is Kuwait or Switzerland, or, I don’t know, Monaco. How many poor people do we have? <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/gallery/2015/may/10/the-iranian-kidney-trade-in-pictures\">The walls of our city are plastered with ads of people selling kidneys</a>, and these sons of bitches are posting photos of themselves in their father’s swimming pool?” </p> \n<p>According to the latest statistics published by the chair of the Majles’s Social Commission, the index of economic disparity between the lowest and the highest earners has reached 15. In a speech on “the effects of social forces”, Taqi Azad-Barmaki, sociology professor at Tehran University, claimed: “Nowhere in the world does income inequality exist as it does here... In fact, Iran is about the most stratified society in the world.”</p> \n<p>In its latest UN Millennium Development Goals report, Iran ranked 68 out of 136 nations in terms of income inequality in 2013. But a member of the editorial board at Ebrar-e Eghtesadi (Daily Economic News) told Tehran Bureau: “Don’t forget that the 2014 UN Human Development report’s index was for 2012 and 2013, before the escalation of economic sanctions and soon after the dismantling of the social economic subsidies [the programme to phase out subsidies of everyday items including bread and energy]. The socioeconomic divergence of the last three years due to these two powerful events has been traumatic. We will see that only in subsequent UN reports.”</p> \n<p>A review of Iran’s central bank statistics finds that the divergence of annual income between the bottom and top 10% has surpassed 810m rials (&pound;18,466, $28,493). Wealthy families have 14 times more income than poor ones, while in larger cities the subsistence line has reached 12m rials (&pound;273.50, $422).</p> \n<p>Professor Hossein Raqfar, economics professor at Tehran’s Al-Zahra university, recently said that the real subsistence line in large cities is 25m rials (&pound;570, $879) per month. </p> \n<p>High inflation has been cited as one of the main causes. According to Iran’s Khabar Online news agency, commodity inflation is 40%, unemployment 25%, housing inflation 125%, and the devaluation of the national currency 113%. Furthermore, it suggests that the 370% increase in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/apr/26/iran-housing-market-tehran-apartment-search\">residential rents</a> over the past eight years is the main reason for the rise in Iran’s poverty index.</p> \n<p>Saeed, a cab driver who has a black shirt and an untrimmed white beard in the manner depicting a regime devotee, says: “I fought in the (Iran-Iraq) war for seven years, and was left with a piece of shrapnel in my shoulder, gastrointestinal ills from chemical weapons, and a heart attack as a result.”</p> \n<p>He pauses while reaching under his steering wheel to pull out a wrapped wad of pills.</p> \n<p>“I have to take these pills all day, under my tongue. A miserable being like me has to work from dawn to midnight and then they just pass all the wealth to a bunch of thieving capitalists. No one has ever asked me, ‘How is your life with so much illness and pain?’ This is my life and that of so many more. They duped us. The filthy bastards agitated for us to go and fight for Islam, for Iran. So, we offered our youth, our lives, for this?”</p> \n<p>Saeed drops a passenger off on Vozara Street and continues toward Vali Asr Square. “Forgive my foul mouth. I guess I have a full belly after all. I get passengers who go to Farmanieh, Zafaranieh, Upper Jordan, and Fereshteh [better-off areas in north Tehran] and man, you feel like you’re going into another world.</p> \n<p>“It’s as if those places are totally apart from the rest of our town. I can’t believe we are a mere 10km away, only ten minutes in light traffic. That’s heart wrenching. One is my world, a world of constant pressures, hot and frigid, with quarrelsome passengers, all for 500,000 rials a day (&pound;11, $17.50); and then there is their world.</p> \n<p>“I have been sentenced to witness all of this, every day. I have been sentenced with the memory of rising up in revolution, the memory of fighting in the war. By God, this is a grave injustice.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431557009132/16929379545_0462728fb8_o-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Frode Bjørshol/flickr","altText":"Many Iranians believe the income gap between rich and poor wider than ever."}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-15T04:00:06Z","lastModified":"2015-05-15T04:00:06Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":35,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Iran","Ayatollah Ali Khamenei","The Iranian revolution","Middle East and North Africa","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran"},{"id":"world/ayatollah-ali-khamenei","webTitle":"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei"},{"id":"world/iranian-revolution","webTitle":"The Iranian revolution"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"Tehran Bureau","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/series/tehran-bureau"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/may/15/irans-unequal-revolution-income-disparity","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/489dk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/iran-blog/2015/may/15/irans-unequal-revolution-income-disparity","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/may/15/irans-unequal-revolution-income-disparity"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431557009132/16929379545_0462728fb8_o-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Many Iranians believe the income gap between rich and poor wider than ever. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/froderamone/16929379545/\">Photograph: Frode Bjørshol/flickr</a>","credit":"Frode Bjørshol/flickr","altText":"Many Iranians believe the income gap between rich and poor wider than ever.","cleanCaption":"Many Iranians believe the income gap between rich and poor wider than ever. <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/froderamone/16929379545/\">Photograph: Frode Bjørshol/flickr</a>"}},"importance":7,"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Pop zines / Cut-and-paste crew escape the indie ghetto","rawTitle":"Cut-and-paste crew escape the indie ghetto","item":{"type":"article","id":"media/2015/may/14/how-fanzines-escaped-the-indie-ghetto-and-learned-to-love-taylor-swift","title":"How fanzines escaped the indie ghetto and learned to love Taylor Swift","trailText":"Fan obsession has come offline, and the photocopied, stapled end-products are as likely to be about One Direction or Kanye West","standFirst":"<p>Fan obsession has come offline, and the photocopied, stapled end-products are as likely to be about One Direction or Kanye West</p>","byline":"Laura Snapes","body":"<p>It could be a fanfic brunch date between Taylor Swift and Ellen Page or a quasi-academic essay on a collaboration between Ronnie Wood and One Direction.

Some of those writers have now migrated away from the internet to the old-fashioned zine, the counter-cultural organ that’s long been a constant in punk and queer scenes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c82f0a1d8c9e87940d4e944c7c47f7f079fe9def\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431625434621/edf177da-4109-4772-8cb9-215b93b5ff61-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"I Wear Heels Now fanzine.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I Wear Heels Now fanzine.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While pop zines did exist in the pre-internet era, those titles have have largely died out: all three Bananarama zines are dead, as is the International Kylie Network. After 26 years and 41 issues, the Pet Shop Boys’ fan magazine, <a href=\"http://www.petshopboys.net/html/literallys/literally-main.html\">Literally</a>, is the last old-schooler standing alongside.</p> \n<p>“It’s a very pop thing, a fanzine that’s just about one artist – not to make it for any other reason than that it expresses a deep interest and focus on one person,” says Chris Heath, the award-winning journalist who has written every issue of Literally. “While you could argue that it becomes more irrelevant in the internet era, I think it also becomes maybe of more worth, because one of the great things – and great problems – about the internet is that it’s boundless. And there’s something great in opposition to that about seven inches by five inches. It’s a pure, perfect little package of one particular part of pop culture.”</p> \n<p>The modern pop zine’s most popular subjects reflect the names that dominate mainstream media but they also reject mainstream narratives. “With the internet, it doesn’t really feel like you’re putting out anything that feels like a project,” says Tess Purchase, the 18-year-old editor of <a href=\"issuu.com/tgitdzine/docs/t_swift_zine.docx_7843f30a991b0f\">The Girl in the Dress: The Cultural Significance of Taylor Swift</a>, a brilliant 34-page study of Swift’s self-validation through song. “Zines come from genres that don’t have such a broad audience as pop, and it’s wanting to have that intimacy back in something that’s so large – and corporate, to an extent.”</p> \n<p>After calling for submissions through Tumblr, Purchase rejected several in-defence-of-Taylor pieces. “I didn’t want it to be: ‘This is why you should like her.’ I was writing for people who were already interested.” So The Girl in the Dress became a mixture of academic theory and critical deep-read delivered with giddy enthusiasm.</p> \n<p>“When people talk about pop it’s often done objectively – or pseudo-objectively – and people don’t relate to pop that way,” says Becca Coates, a 20-year-old student who collaborated with Purchase on a second zine, <a href=\"http://issuu.com/tgitdzine/docs/i_wear_heels_now/1\">I Wear Heels Now</a>, to document Swift’s transformation on her last album, 1989. “They relate to it in a personal way, and a zine gives people the opportunity to talk about that personal fan experience.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be1371957394fca92bc7e152b72015096daec4ef\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431611430080/4acde2a1-cb82-403d-8872-d0f9e4e5f5c8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A punk holding up a copy of Sniffin' Glue.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A punk holding up a copy of Sniffin’ Glue.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erica Echenberg/Redferns</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Veterans of the so-called punk wars may bristle at an underground format being dedicated to mainstream pop millionaires. “But in a way it makes more sense for there to be pop fanzines because pop appreciation is as much of a subculture now as things like punk were in the time of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2011/jun/14/mark-perry-fanzine-culture\">Sniffin’ Glue</a>,” says Popjustice editor Peter Robinson, who as a teenager put together zines on the KLF and <a href=\"http://www.peterrobinson.net/greatest-hits/ants-in-his-pantz-pj-and-duncan-fanzine/\">PJ &amp; Duncan (complete with giveaway Ant McPartlin eyebrow)</a>. “What used to be underground is now extremely mainstream and what used to be mainstream actually doesn’t have that many outlets.”</p> \n<p>That may sound odd, but pop genuinely doesn’t have many outlets for informed discussion, whatever the complaints in the comment threads whenever the Guardian writes about Swift or One Direction. British pop mags are aimed squarely at kids, while mainstream pop coverage trivialises or hand-wrings: it’s either Harry’s tragic heartbreak or Miley’s filthy video. Pop rarely gets to exist on its own terms, as something that fans obsess over. And online fandom can be an overwhelming place. “Being able to make something physical makes an individual’s experience of being a fan unique,” says Erin Fae, a 33-year-old New Yorker who recently published the 96-page <a href=\"erinfae.bigcartel.com/product/mess-of-a-dreamer-a-taylor-swift-fanzine-issue-no-1\">Mess of a Dreamer: A Taylor Swift Fanzine</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c24e29407d13bad6d2f32cc11232345a31edf631\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431624718428/7b7605fe-e114-40ae-b0af-39a41a1d665a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Taylor Swift.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor Swift.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Grace Ambrose has been editor of <a href=\" http://maximumrocknroll.com/\">Maximumrocknroll</a>, the staunchly DIY San Francisco punk zine active since 1982. “I’m not surprised at all that fans are taking it upon themselves to facilitate the discourse they want to see about the objects of their obsession,” she says. “Zine culture traffiks in the highly personal – the impulse to produce something that otherwise might not have a clear place in the media landscape, to say something that doesn’t fit neatly into journalistic expectations – and of course fandom fits into that.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You think we’re silly for enjoying pop music, or taking pop music seriously, so we’re gonna do an academic reading of it</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Martha Perotto-Wills</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“These zines are taking something seriously that’s thought of as such a non-serious, silly form of art – if it’s thought of as a form of art at all,” says 21-year-old Martha Perotto-Wills, a student who contributed an essay called Pretty Lies: Taylor Swift’s Blank Space Video, Subversive Femininity and Self-Construction to the I Wear Heels Now zine. “You think we’re silly for enjoying pop music, or taking pop music seriously, so we’re gonna do an academic reading of it, coming from a place of sincerely loving the music and having an emotional reaction to it and turning that into really clever, interesting analysis that doesn’t take the point of view that you have to be detached from the art to be able to critique it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd2354c4c30fdbbcfd0fd450c2ae622f24c3b689\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431625610848/cbf5ddc0-c07b-4402-a259-7e06fa468810-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"One Direction Fanfic.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One Direction Fanfic.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Away from the prescribed narratives around these acts, zines become a tool to explore massive acts’ radical potential, no matter how vanilla their public image, and offer an individualistic take on the world. “Pop music and zines is the general made specific – a perfect match,” says One Direction zinester Laura. Fellow artist Callie L is working on an essay that views <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mXDzlARKsE\">One Direction’s performance of Where Do Broken Hearts Go on The X Factor with Ronnie Wood</a> through the queer theory of the late American LGBT activist Vito Russo.</p> \n<p>“Zines have a history in subversive movements, so if you’re a non-binary young person who is looking to see themselves in pop culture, there’s a certain amount of queering that one has to do and look for in the culture,” says Shannon Watters, an editor at comics publisher Boom!

Now the IWM is quite rightly putting conscientious objectors on its fantastic and ambitious Lives of the First World War. Their inclusion is vital if we’re to get a real snapshot of society as a whole.”</p> \n<p>Millward tried to remain upbeat in his letters home. “Dont worry Lizzie, keep smiling for we are fighting the great fight for humanity. There are now 600 men there so there will be plenty of company for me. I don’t know when I shall see a town again, because as far as I understand it is in the centre of the greatest moor in England,” he wrote.<br /></p> \n<p>However, he soon found life at Dartmoor as bleak as its reputation. Within weeks he wrote: “A terrible place, indeed the worst prison I have been in ... terribly cold and bleak and foggy on the Dartmoor and wild ponies are very plentiful. Last night the wind howled around the prison and snow began to fall pretty heavily.”<br /></p> \n<p>As well as the letters, during and after the war Lizzie kept a scrapbook of postcards, cuttings, a Christmas souvenir drawing of the objectors in prison, photographs of cheerless Victorian interiors, and a watercolour by a friend in the prison showing the grim buildings under an icy moon.</p> \n<p>“May we look upon life as a thing sacred beyond all possible human conception and may I look into your eyes fearlessly and honestly even when silver streaks blossom in your hair,” her husband wrote. “Very few people can do this Lizzie, &amp; may we have God’s blessing &amp; a sufficient amount of moral courage.” As if to remind himself, “moral courage” is underlined twice.<br /></p> \n<p>He was released in 1918, became active in Labour politics in Bradford and died of pneumonia in 1926, aged just 33. He never saw his daughter Greta: Lizzie only discovered she was pregnant a few weeks after his death.</p> \n<p>Among the pieces she pasted into her scrapbook, probably in the 1930s, was a newspaper cutting about the prison: “Dartmoor will not be the same when the famous prison is there no longer … By a sort of poetic justice Dartmoor prisoners themselves will gradually demolish the grim buildings and no new jail will be built there.” More than 80 years later, although the prison authorities have announced that the site is to be sold, the grim buildings still stand.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431626782449/Conscientious-objectors-i-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Imperial War Museum","altText":"Conscientious objectors in Wakefield jail.

To her surprise, she was far from alone. “Every single woman said it seriously affected how she felt about her body.”</p> \n<p>So, last August, she set up <a href=\"http://www.mybodybackproject.com/\">My Body Back</a>, a project that supports women who have experienced sexual violence, focusing particularly on issues of body image and sexuality, helping them to reclaim their bodies as their own. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"314b107c9da1136a3054f7ca57a7824362970af7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431619083636/aed7b97d-5e51-42f8-a2b6-046c7b372bed-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pavan Amara, who set up the My Body Back project.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pavan Amara, who set up the My Body Back project.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Smith</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> </p> \n<p>Many said it had a huge impact on their sex life – several had vomited after sex because they were so tense, others had blacked out. Just like Amara, some described avoiding mirrors, and half said that, despite wanting to, they hadn’t felt able to attend screenings for cervical cancer or sexually transmitted infections. “They just couldn’t have somebody touch them. They were triggered badly by it, so they felt it was a choice between their mental health and their physical health.” One woman summed it up perfectly, Amara recalls: “She said that her rapist had taken away so much from her and now he was taking her health, too.”</p> \n<p>With simple, bold pragmatism, Amara took steps to tackle the problem. She began by talking to NHS doctors and nurses, Rape Crisis volunteers and staff at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shwomenstore\">Sh!</a>, the only female-focused sex shop in the UK. The NHS staff she spoke to were already aware of the problem: “They had patients who refused cervical screening or didn’t want to be touched – but there was nowhere to refer them to, so they were being lost in the system. Often there would be a disclosure from a woman, and the doctor or nurse wouldn’t have a solution to offer and wouldn’t see the woman again because she wouldn’t feel supported enough to come back.”</p> \n<p>Initially, Amara tackled the psychological side of the problem, setting up a monthly trans-inclusive workshop called <a href=\"http://www.mybodybackproject.com/events/cafev-march/\">Caf&eacute; V</a>, where women could come together in a safe space with trained volunteers to talk about their bodies, sex, and everything from masturbation to orgasm. At the most recent session, more than 40 women turned up. </p> \n<p>Next, she enlisted students at 20 universities in a scheme called <a href=\"http://www.mybodybackproject.com/this-weeks-notes-of-love-7/\">Notes of Love</a>, where participants write a message of solidarity or support on a Post-it note for a woman who has experienced sexual violence. The notes are then passed on to Rape Crisis and Havens centres. “We wanted to change the culture on university campuses, where you often hear about misogyny and ‘lad-ism’,” she explains. “The other weekend we were talking about this at Cambridge … and there were lots of men there, which I found really encouraging. We talked about sexual assault and, afterwards, there were loads of men writing these notes and I thought, things are changing.”</p> \n<p>Finally, Amara began working with staff at <a href=\"http://www.bartshealth.nhs.uk/\">Barts Health NHS Trust</a> and, this August in Whitechapel, east London, they will open the UK’s first cervical screening and STI clinic designed specifically for women who have experienced sexual violence. An introductory session with a sexual violence health adviser will be offered to discuss exactly how the appointment will run. The women can then dictate every detail, down to music or aromatherapy to help them relax, specific phrases they do or don’t want the healthcare practitioner to use, body positions they’d like to avoid – they can even decide whether they want to insert the speculum themselves. “It’s all about regaining control over what happens to your body,” says Amara.</p> \n<p>The STI clinic will encourage women who are put off seeking a test after experiencing sexual violence because they don’t want to be touched, or are worried about being pressured into reporting to the police. Those who want to remain anonymous will be provided with a self-testing kit, a private space and a video guide on how to carry out the test correctly. The results can be texted to a mobile phone.</p> \n<p>It is life-changing stuff. <a href=\"http://www.mybodybackproject.com/letters/\">One testimony on the project’s website</a> comes from a 39-year-old woman who has felt unable to have a smear test since she was raped 19 years ago: “I now have hope that perhaps one day I can come to your clinic and will manage to have one.” As Amara points out, her idea for the clinics is so simple that it’s extraordinary that they will be, to her knowledge, the first specialist services of their kind in the country. “It says a lot about how women are treated. Why has it taken this long?”</p> \n<p><em>For more information about My Body Back and the clinics, visit <a href=\"http://www.mybodybackproject.com/\">mybodybackproject.com</a></em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431618092256/53c3f789-d94e-498b-91a5-d802270eccc5-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Javier Larrea/Getty Images/age fotostock RM","altText":"Half the women Pavan Amara spoke to hadn't felt able to attend screenings for cervical cancer or sexually transmitted infections.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Javier Larrea/Getty Images/age fotostock RM"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431619084235/aed7b97d-5e51-42f8-a2b6-046c7b372bed-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Pavan Amara, who set up the My Body Back project.

diplomacy: what would the impact be if a 2017 referendum pushed UK towards the exit?</p>","byline":"Katie Allen, Philip Oltermann, Julian Borger and Arthur Neslen in Brussels","body":"<p>David Cameron’s electoral triumph has brought the prospect of a British withdrawal from the EU one step closer. The prime minister has vowed to reshape Britain’s ties with Europe before putting EU membership to a vote by 2017.</p> \n<p>But what would “Brexit” - a British exit from the 28-nation EU - look like? Eurosceptics argue that withdrawal would reverse immigration, save the taxpayer billions and free Britain from an economic burden. Europhiles counter that it would lead to deep economic uncertainty and cost thousands, possibly even millions, of jobs.</p> \n<p>Our writers have drawn on the best available expertise to assess what Brexit would mean for growth, jobs, trade, immigration and Britain’s position in the world.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/page-enhancers/nav/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/page-enhancers/nav/boot.js\" data-alt=\"Brexit\"> \n</figure> \n<h2>The broad economy<br /></h2> \n<p>There have been a few attempts to quantify what an exit from the EU would do to the size of the UK economy, despite the obvious pitfalls of trying to put a figure on a hypothetical situation that has a number of variables – such as what sort of trade deals are negotiated post Brexit (more of that below). Given the range of potential post-Brexit circumstances there is a broad range of estimates. Some argue the economy will suffer permanent losses on the back of weaker trade and investment. Others say freedom from the rules, as well as the costs, that come with EU membership would make Britain more prosperous.<br /></p> \n<p>Starting with the estimates that leaving would be a <strong>net loss to the UK economy</strong>, one analysis often cited is from researchers at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in 2004. They found an exit from the EU would permanently reduce UK GDP by 2.25%, mainly because of lower foreign direct investment. That estimate is now old and, as the thinktank’s current head, <a href=\"http://niesr.ac.uk/press/commentary-economic-implications-uk-leaving-european-union-11620#.VTbDKq3BzRY\">Jonathan Portes, has pointed out</a>, the world economy has changed considerably in the past decade.<br /></p> \n<p>Another analysis by economists at the <a href=\"http://cep.lse.ac.uk/_new/publications/series.asp?prog=CEPPA\">Centre for Economic Performance</a> (CEP), part of the London School of Economics, calculated the UK could suffer income falls of between 6.3% to 9.5% of GDP, similar to the loss resulting from the global financial crisis of 2008-09. That is under the researchers’ pessimistic scenario, in which the UK is not able to negotiate favourable trade terms. Under an optimistic scenario, in which the UK continues to have a free trade agreement (FTA) with the EU, losses would be 2.2% of GDP.</p> \n<p>Overall, the authors state: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Our current assessment is that leaving the EU would be likely to impose substantial costs on the UK economy and would be a very risky gamble.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Euro graphic\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1429784748737/EU_economy_trade.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There have also been attempts to collate various pieces of research on how much a Brexit would cost, and come up with an <strong>educated guess</strong> of what is at stake. This was the approach of business group the <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/global-future/\">CBI</a>, which has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2013/nov/03/britain-eu-business-lobby-group-cbi\">lobbied for the UK to stay within a reformed EU</a>. It said in November 2013 that by aggregating research already available it has came to a “conservative” estimate that the benefits of EU membership amount to 4-5% of GDP, or as much as &pound;78bn a year, making each household &pound;3,000 better off.</p> \n<p>In between those who see a net loss or a net gain from Brexit, are those keen to stress the <strong>economic consequences could go either way</strong>. The thinktank <a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/\">Open Europe</a> noted in March, for example, that an exit might boost UK GDP under certain circumstances. It said:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>On the one hand, UK GDP could be 2.2% lower in 2030 if Britain leaves the EU and fails to strike a deal with the EU or reverts into protectionism. In a best-case scenario, under which the UK manages to enter into liberal trade arrangements with the EU and the rest of the world, while pursuing large-scale deregulation at home, Britain could be better off by 1.6% of GDP in 2030.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>There is similarly a more nuanced analysis from <a href=\"https://www.capitaleconomics.com/staff/roger-bootle.html\">economist Roger Bootle</a> in his book, The Trouble with Europe (2014). His perspective is that the EU is not worth staying in without fundamental reform. But Bootle cautions against boiling the argument on either side down to numbers. His useful analysis on the UK money flowing to Brussels underlines that warning. </p> \n<p>In 2012, the UK economy made payments of &pound;16.4bn, just over 1% of GDP , to EU institutions, says Bootle. On the other hand, the UK government received a rebate on its contributions to the EU budget of &pound;3.1bn and &pound;0.9bn in other receipts. The private sector received &pound;2.9bn from EU institutions. So overall, the UK paid a net &pound;9.6bn into the EU, about 0.6% of nominal GDP. He concludes:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>These are not the sort of sums on which the fate of great nations depends – nor on which momentous decisions about EU membership should be made.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The pro-Europe thinktank, the <strong>Centre for European Reform</strong> (CER), says that although the UK is a net contributor to the EU, after Brexit the country would face pressure to replace EU regional funding and agricultural subsidies with domestic spending. There would also be a dent to the public finances if immigration is cut upon exit, given migrants are large net contributors to the Treasury and rejuvenate Britain’s ageing population, according to a <a href=\"http://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/smc_final_report_june2014.pdf\">report by a CER commission</a> last year.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/08/europe-new-existential-crisis-cameron-victory-brexit\">Europe faces a new existential crisis – Cameron’s victory has brought Brexit a step closer | Natalie Nougayr&egrave;de</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Finally, there are the voices noting the <strong>costs to the UK of EU regulations</strong>.</p> \n<p>Tim Congdon, economist and runner-up in Ukip’s 2010 leadership election, publishes an annual report for the party on what he sees as the costs of being in the EU. His latest edition again highlighted the “damage that excessive and misguided regulation is doing to British business, particularly to small- and medium-sized businesses” and concluded:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The UK is roughly 11.5% of GDP – about &pound;185bn a year – worse off because it is a member of the EU instead of being a fully independent sovereign nation.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>Jobs</h2> \n<p>The Liberal Democrat leader, <strong>Nick Clegg,</strong> has been quick in debates to reach for a jobs number when arguing for the UK to stay in the EU. He has in the past claimed that 3m jobs depend on British membership of the EU.</p> \n<p>As the Guardian has reported previously, in a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/reality-check/2014/mar/26/eu-leaders-debate-live-lbc-sky\">detailed reality check of Clegg and Nigel Farage’s radio debate</a> last year, the Lib Dems said the EU safeguards British jobs because it provides access to a market of 500 million consumers and because Britain’s membership attracts foreign firms keen to be part of that market. Then like now, those politicians supporting EU membership cite business bosses who say they may take their companies out of the UK in the event of a Brexit. </p> \n<p>Firms that have contemplated scaling back in the UK in the event of a Brexit include food maker <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/1200243/nestle-chair-warns-over-uk-exit-from-europe\">Nestl&eacute;</a>, car companies <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/02/25/hyundai-uk-european-union_n_4853938.html\">Hyundai</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/10572731/Ford-warns-it-would-reassess-UK-presence-if-country-left-EU.html\">Ford</a>, and US investment bank <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2013/dec/04/goldman-sachs-warns-london-exit-britain-eu\">Goldman Sachs</a>.</p> \n<p>Two sectors get particular mention: the <strong>car industry</strong> and <strong>financial services</strong>. </p> \n<p>On the first, the <a href=\"http://www.smmt.co.uk/2014/04/uk-automotive-industry-europe/\">Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders</a> (SMMT) has argued Europe is fundamental to the success of the UK automotive industry, a sector employing more than 700,000 people and accounting for 3% of GDP. A report for SMMT by consultants KPMG last year argued: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The attractiveness of the UK as a place to invest and do automotive business is clearly underpinned by the UK’s influential membership of the EU.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In the broader manufacturing sector, business leaders make the case for the boost to UK businesses, and therefore employment, from EU money that funds research and development here. The manufacturers’ organisation EEF<a href=\"http://www.eef.org.uk/resources-and-knowledge/research-and-intelligence/industry-reports/manufacturing-our-future-in-europe-fact-card\"> says the EU invests &pound;11bn a year on innovation programmes</a>, of which 15% is invested in the UK.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"773acfd1eb781e77ed40ca4fb3e704e8779a6056\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/27/1430132637096/e6aa9616-60ee-4cba-b92b-71e4ea51e9a0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Production line of the Nissan Qashqai \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nissan Qashqai production line at the Japanese motor manufacturer’s Sunderland plant.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In <strong>financial services</strong>, 250 foreign banks employ 160,000 people in the UK, according to lobby group TheCityUK 2014.<br /></p> \n<p>Its chairman, <strong>Gerry Grimstone</strong>, said alongside <a href=\"http://www.thecityuk.com/media/latest-news-from-thecityuk/leaving-eu-poses-very-significant-risks-to-uk-s-future-thecityuk-reports-provide-critical-analysis-of-the-economic-case-for-uk-s-eu-membership-and-legal-implications-of-alternatives/\">TheCityUK</a> reports into EU membership last year: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Our research clearly shows that leaving the EU would seriously damage economic growth and jobs in the UK. But the EU can and must be improved. It must not interfere in things which it does not need to do and it must make a better job of doing the things it has to do. We need to continue saying this loudly and clearly. London is Europe’s financial centre so there is a strong national interest in getting this right.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>But a large dose of caution is needed. First, even though company bosses have raised this as an issue, there are no guarantees they would leave in droves. Second, talking about a certain number of jobs being dependent on the EU is misleading. Implying millions of jobs would simply disappear is downright mischievous.<br /></p> \n<p>The free market thinktank, the <strong><a href=\"http://www.iea.org.uk/publications/research/the-eu-jobs-myth-0\">Institute of Economics Affairs</a></strong>, makes this point in its paper The EU Jobs Myth. Author Ryan Bourne comments:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Politicians who continue to claim that 3m jobs are linked to our EU membership should be publicly challenged over misuse of this assertion. Jobs are associated with trade, not membership of a political union, and there is little evidence to suggest that trade would substantially fall between British businesses and European consumers in the event the UK was outside the EU.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>He also notes the UK labour market is dynamic and so would adjust:<br /></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>It would adapt quickly to changed relationships with the EU. Prior to the financial crisis, the UK saw on average 4m jobs created and 3.7m jobs lost each year – showing how common substantial churn of jobs is at any given time. The annual creation and destruction of jobs is almost exactly the same scale as the estimated 3-4m jobs that are associated with exports to the EU.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p></p> \n<h2>Trade</h2> \n<p>This area is fraught with assumptions that are so broad as to have fuelled a chain of claims and counter-claims on what a Brexit would mean for the UK’s exports.</p> \n<p><strong>Nigel Farage</strong> makes the argument that by withdrawing from Europe, the UK frees itself from EU rules and regulations, and will make its way in the world as a strong, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/blog/2012/sep/21/ukip-conference-farage-speech-live-blog2?newsfeed=true\">independent trading nation</a>, looking to faster growing markets such as Brazil and India.</p> \n<p>Those most passionately opposed to a Brexit, meanwhile, say leaving the EU would shut the UK out of its most important market (the EU) and from other markets around the world that have trade agreements with the EU (but not with the UK in isolation).</p> \n<p>Again, the most likely outcome is somewhere in between these scenarios. Much depends on what a UK government could negotiate once outside the EU. </p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.britishchambers.org.uk/press-office/press-releases/bcc-firms-favour-staying-in-the-eu,-but-demand-reform.html\">latest survey</a> of about 3,500 businesses by the <strong>British Chambers of Commerce</strong> highlights this. More than half of businesses (57%) believe that remaining a member of the EU, with more powers brought back to Westminster, would be positive. However, 28% of firms also view withdrawal combined with a formal UK-EU free trade agreement as a positive scenario. But only half that proportion, 13%, view withdrawal without such an agreement as positive.

Goods exports to non-EU countries were &pound;144.9bn in 2014, down from &pound;152.2bn in 2013.</p> \n<p>The UK’s top six export trading partners are the US, Germany, Netherlands, France, Ireland and China, according to the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/uktrade/uk-trade/february-2015/ptl-table-9--change-in-3-monthly-trade-with-significant-partner-countries--december-2014-to-february-2015-compared-with-september-to-november-2014.xls\">latest figures [spreadsheet download]</a> on goods exports (for the three months to the end of February 2015).</p> \n<p>But considering only goods trade, on which figures are more readily available, overlooks the importance of services – the UK’s dominant sector. The UK’s trade in services, which covers areas such as IT and accountancy, ranks second behind the US in terms of its share of global exports, according to a <a href=\"http://www.ey.com/UK/en/Newsroom/News-releases/14-06-30---UK-set-to-return-to-form-as-global-leader-in-services-exports\">report from the forecasting group EY ITEM Club</a>.</p> \n<p>In The Trouble with Europe, <strong>Bootle</strong> tries to assess what this all means for the UK economy. Looking at goods and services exports as well as what the UK earns on overseas investments, the proportion of total receipts from abroad that come from the EU is just over 40%, Bootle says. Although this probably exaggerates the true importance of the EU in British trade, says the economist, given distortions to the figures from factors such as UK companies exporting to ports in the EU only to re-export beyond the region.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a4d2ab23e5490f65be1a5370279a27ac48ab99d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/27/1430132700939/acdfb569-4d5e-46de-828f-9e6f8c431497-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Shipping containers at Felixstowe Container Port, Suffolk.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shipping containers at Felixstowe container port, Suffolk.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On what would happen after a British exit from the EU, Bootle is quite upbeat. The UK is the rest of the EU’s largest single export market, he notes, something that increases the chance of the UK securing a free trade agreement with the EU. Failing to get such an agreement would not be disastrous, he adds.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>It would place the UK in the same position as the US is currently in, along with Indian, China and Japan, all of which manage to export to the EU relatively easily. </p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Export graphic\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1430227314461/EU_economy_TOP_exports.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Some argue that the UK would get a boost from re-focusing its exports on faster-growing, emerging economies outside the EU. This was the position taken by <strong>Iain Mansfield</strong>, the <a href=\"http://www.iea.org.uk/in-the-media/press-release/iain-mansfield-named-winner-of-%E2%82%AC100000-iea-brexit-prize\">winner of last year’s €100,000 IEA Brexit prize</a> (which asks entrants to submit a blueprint for Britain outside the EU). He said that after an exit, the UK should pursue free trade agreements with major trading nations, deepen its engagement with organisations such as the G8, G20 and OECD and in Europe, and secure open trade relations. Mansfield found fewer regulations, coupled with greater trade with emerging economies, could provide an overwhelmingly positive outlook for an independent Britain.</p> \n<p>He concluded:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Although the years immediately surrounding the exit are likely to feature some degree of market uncertainty, if the right measures are taken the UK can be confident of a healthy long-term economic outlook outside the EU.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>But the UK’s ability to negotiate favourable trade deals is not a given. The <strong>Centre for European Reform</strong> <a href=\"http://www.cer.org.uk/sites/default/files/smc_final_report_june2014.pdf\">warns trade costs would rise after a Brexit</a> and the UK would have less bargaining power for trade agreements than it does as part of a bigger entity, the EU.<br /></p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.bnegroup.org/images/uploads/publications/files/BNE_Brochure.pdf\">Business for New Europe [pdf]</a></strong>, a coalition of business leaders pushing for the UK to stay in a reformed EU, is similarly sceptical about post-Brexit bargaining clout. It says:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>There are a number of free trade agreements currently being negotiated by the EU, including with the US and Japan. The UK with 65 million consumers would not have anywhere near the negotiating power that the EU with its 500 million consumers would have.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The <strong>CBI</strong> foresees <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/campaigns/our-global-future/factsheets/factsheet-4-no-alternative-to-eu-membership-offers-better-balance-of-pros-and-cons/\">tricky negotiations</a> if the UK wants to keep its current trading conditions after an EU exit. </p> \n<p>The business group’s deputy director general,<strong> Katja Hall, </strong>says:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>While we could negotiate trade deals with the rest of the world, we’d have to agree deals with over 50 countries from scratch just to get back to where we are now, and to do so with the clout of a market of 60 million, not 500.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p><strong>Katie Allen</strong><br /></p> \n<h2>Immigration</h2> \n<p>Ukip’s 2015 manifesto claims leaving the EU would allow Britain to “take back control of our borders”. </p> \n<p>But would it? For a start, fewer people come to live and work in the UK from within the EU than from the rest of the world. 624,000 people immigrated to the UK in the year to September 2014, <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/february-2015/index.html\">up from 530,000 the year before</a>. The majority of them – 292,000, up by 49,000 – came from outside the EU and would already have been subject to complex visa restrictions. Some 251,000 people moved to Britain under the EU’s looser free movement rules, an increase of 43,000 over the previous 12 months.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Migration graphic\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1429786311974/EU_economy_immigration.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Until it is clear what kind of new arrangement with the EU will replace the current terms of memberships, it is hard to say how the latter group can be “controlled”. Many experts view it as likely that British access to the single market will come at the price of a free movement arrangement similar to the one that is in place now. Norway, which is not in the EU but is a member of the European Economic Area, serves as a warning to enthusiastic “outers”: as a recent study by <a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/intelligence/britain-and-the-eu/what-if-there-were-a-brexit/\">Open Europe</a> showed, in 2013 Norway was the destination of more than twice as many EU migrants per head as the UK.<br /></p> \n<p>Yet until such a replacement arrangement is put in place, migration in and out of the UK could theoretically be regulated purely by British national law. In such a scenario, moving to Britain would become considerably harder than it is now: EU citizens would face the same kind of long queues and border checks upon entering the UK as “third party” nationals.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcde5cd5cba5cef6171ae1845ea9d16d3920ad5c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/27/1430132787001/b6a9f56d-c09f-4556-91ac-c5298a5da928-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Border Force officers \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">UK Border Force officers check the passports of passengers arriving at Gatwick airport.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Border staff would need to establish whether new arrivals meet the requirements for entry, requiring proof of income, intention to return and lack of intention to work. Those planning to stay for longer would need to present proof of employment – posing as a major disincentive for those in industries with low job security, such as the arts. At universities, EU nationals would have to pay full tuition fees and would have no access to student loans.</p> \n<p>Britain draws up its own list of countries whose citizens need a visa to enter the country. In theory, it could make poor Bulgarians and Romanians fill in lots of forms before arrival, while allowing rich French and Germans to visit the UK relatively hassle-free. The problem with this, as <a href=\"http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/what-happens-to-british-expatriates-if.html\">Steven Peers</a>, a professor of EU law at the University of Essex, points out, is that the EU has its own joint visa list: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The general rule is that if a country like Britain were to cherrypick and discriminate against individual EU member states, the EU would at least threaten to retaliate. </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Potentially, Brits would end up having to apply for visas every time they travel across the Channel. Brits already living in other EU countries such as Spain may face integration rules, such as a requirement to speak the language of the host country, before gaining long-term residency status.</p> \n<p>Within Britain, the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic would by default become the obvious “back door” for entry into the UK from the EU, and some Irish commentators have said this would inevitably lead to the introduction of <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/brexit-would-see-return-of-physical-border-between-republic-and-north-1.2152951\">stricter passport checkpoints</a> and customs controls on one of the most politically sensitive dividing lines in the country.</p> \n<p><strong>Philip Oltermann</strong></p> \n<h2>Status in Europe</h2> \n<p>A consensus holds that a Brexit would diminish the status of the UK and EU alike, by varying degrees. </p> \n<p>If the dominant mood in Brussels remains “one of extreme irritation with Cameron, almost bordering on contempt”, as Roger Liddle argued in <a href=\"http://www.policy-network.net/publications/4812/The-Risk-of-Brexit-Britain-and-Europe-in-2015\">The Risk of Brexit</a> – as seems inevitable – few favours will be offered.</p> \n<p>A relatively rich offshore supplicant knocking on the doors of the single market would be ripe for caricature along the penny-pinching, antisocial and racist lines that Eurosceptic sentiment inspires.</p> \n<p>Jacques Delors and Pascal Lamy <a href=\"http://civitas.org.uk/newblog/2015/01/delors-and-eu-veterans-float-reform-concessions/\">may twinkle at the thought of an Efta-style free trade agreement with Albion</a>, but the terms would probably be prescriptive. In that case, a need for new scapegoats in the UK could further erode its reputation, <a href=\"https://ip-journal.dgap.org/en/ip-journal/topics/britain-outside-europe-brussels-view\">Fabian Zuleeg, head of the European Policy Centre</a>, believes.</p> \n<p>A more optimistic scenario sees the UK overtaking Germany as the most populous country in Europe by the 2040s, and channeling transatlantic influence as one of the EU’s biggest trading and political partners. But even <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2014/06/24/a-brexit-would-have-important-implications-at-the-european-and-international-levels/\">Tim Oliver of the Center for Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins University, who advances this vision</a>, says the UK would be a junior partner, dependent on the caprices of European institutions, trying to negotiate bilateral free trade deals from a position of weakness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f70707f58e8f742bf4d25df97e04e3d05959397d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/27/1430132921585/2535b982-546f-48dd-88c0-96d1ed69a4b0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"An EU summit in Brussels\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron watches while Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, left, speaks with Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, second left, and Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, centre, during a roundtable meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The UK is one of Europe’s “Big Three” states and routinely punches above its weight – in the climate field, winning everything it wanted from the 2030, shale gas, tar sands and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/feb/12/edf-energy-delays-hinkley-point-nuclear-decision\">Hinkley</a> debates, for example. Its size, imperial history, ceremony, financial clout and involvement in Europe over centuries bestow gravitas in Brussels. Its loss of influence, coupled with ongoing financial obligations for single market access and so forth would be stunning. Comparisons with other non-EU members such as Switzerland and Norway in this context are false and unhelpful.</p> \n<p>But in terms of post-Brexit relations, it’s worth noting that, unlike Norway, the UK has little hard energy to export. Unlike Switzerland it has no land borders or linguistic connections with its neighbours. Unlike Iceland, it has consolidated enmities over decades of treaty negotiations. English is a lingua franca, and British music, literature and popular culture will doubtless still exert a pull on young Europeans. But with fewer opportunities to live and study there, this too may diminish over time.</p> \n<p>David Marquand argues that a post-Brexit Britain would be <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/09/first-brexit-then-break\">a cross between a greater Norway and a greater Guernsey</a>, abiding by EU norms without political influence to shape them. He posits “a market society, governed by a market state, presiding over a glorified tax haven and financial services hub”. With inequality, individualism and civic distrust rampant, Marquand hopes that a phoenix of post-imperial self-awareness might eventually rise from flames of national dissolution.</p> \n<p>This perhaps neglects the degree to which the UK has succeeded in injecting <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/oct/12/eu-business-deregulation-concern-worker-rights\">deregulatory logic and free market imperatives</a> into the corporatist heart of EU policymaking. It is fair to ask whether a UK exit would really change the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n08/richard-seymour/bye-bye-labour\">austerity dynamics</a> that underpin national standings on both sides of the channel. In an ageing continent incrementally losing its global market share and political reach, managing decline is not a purely British phenomenon. </p> \n<p><strong>Arthur Neslen</strong></p> \n<h2>Position in the world</h2> \n<p>The dominant view among foreign policy analysts around the world is that a British exit from the EU would diminish rather than enhance the country’s standing and influence.<br /></p> \n<p>It is a view shared in Washington and Beijing, but it is not universal. Perceptions in countries such as India that have had longstanding historical – mostly colonial – relationships with the UK would be less affected, even if trade declined.</p> \n<p>On the whole, however, voices from abroad give little comfort to the view that Britain would somehow regain a unique and resonant voice in world affairs once it breaks away from a collective European identity.</p> \n<p>Ivo Daalder, a former US ambassador to Nato who is now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, said:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The idea [the UK] could have influence in the world outside the EU is risible. Its power and effectiveness is from being a strong leader in Europe.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>As seen from China, the UK is significant on its own as a financial centre. But as a world political and trading power its significance is seen as proportionate to its role in the EU. </p> \n<p>Feng Zhongping, the assistant president of the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I think from China’s point of view we don’t think that the UK, or France or Germany or any single European countries can play a global role. But the EU is different. It is the biggest market, and China’s biggest trade partner. The EU is seen as a major power in the world. If the UK left, it would hurt the UK much more than the EU.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>India is the most significant exception to the consensus of a lesser Britain outside the EU. For Delhi, Britain has many stronger associations than merely as an EU member, although those associations are not necessarily good ones, as Samir Saran, a political analyst from the Observer Research Foundation in Delhi, pointed out:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>We have always been more comfortable dealing with countries individually than as part of a club. We don’t see the UK as part of the EU, but as a distinct identity because of its history and the Indian diaspora. So it plays a different role in the Indian psyche, a unique case. It is not always positive but it is always distinct. And some of the most strategic elements in foreign policy cannot be conducted through a club like the EU, but as part of a bilateral relationship.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The existence of a strategic relationship between the UK and India, made up of defence and hi-tech ties, is another element underlying a different approach to British identity. China, lacking those ties because of trading restrictions, is more prone to viewing the UK as little more than part of a larger European trading bloc. Washington maintains an intensely strategic relationship with the UK but has grave doubts about a British exit for other reasons. In American eyes, anything that fractures the cohesion among its allies is a bad thing. </p> \n<p><strong>Julian Borger</strong></p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/11/1431333513909/197cc394-f4db-4cb1-9e48-a306c0bfc2b4-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"A hot air Balloon with a Union flag motif flying in front of dramatic storm","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/27/1430132638569/e6aa9616-60ee-4cba-b92b-71e4ea51e9a0-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Nissan Qashqai production line at the Japanese motor manufacturer’s Sunderland plant.

But then Sony announced PlayStation and everything fell apart </p>","byline":"Keith Stuart","body":"<p>Twenty years ago this week, at the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles, the head of Sega of America accidentally killed the company’s Saturn video game console.</p> \n<p>Tom Kalinske was in a bind. He knew that Sony was readying its new PlayStation machine for an autumn launch in the US (both the Saturn and the PlayStation had already been released in Japan at this point), and the hype was building. The creator of the Walkman, the portable music device that revolutionised the music industry, was coming after games. And it was serious.</p> \n<p>Sony had spent 1994 on a global charm offensive. The company’s chief system designer, Ken Kutaragi, visited developers all over the world, bringing an impressive set of graphics demos (including the famed <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rwNt_9GvpFI\">dinosaur 3D model</a>) and promising a wealth of cool development tools and favourable production deals. Sega meanwhile, had been confusing and alienating its audience and development community with a string of add-ons for the hugely successful (but increasingly dated) Mega Drive, and a wealth of promises about new hardware platforms that never materialised. Sony had one product and one message: PlayStation is the future.</p> \n<p>There were also rumours of a rift between Sega of Japan and Sega of America; although it was never quite as simple – or juicy – as that. What the divisions faced was a huge challenge in appeasing two very different markets. The Japanese office was encouraged to head straight into Saturn development after the launch of the Mega Drive because the machine hadn’t been a huge success in the domestic market. However, the company had to be much more cautious about the US, where it wanted to protect and enhance the huge market share it had torn away from Nintendo. The 32X, a semi-32-bit add-on for the old console, was engendered almost entirely by the US R&amp;D team – in fact, the original concept was designed by lead engineers Joe Miller and Marty Franz, who hastily jotted down the idea for a basic 32-bit system on a piece of hotel notepaper while attending the Consumer Electronics show in 1994. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25270d85c1ad6b1400f71d84c38237bd55e2e2e5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431513725250/8da0fb0f-4a4b-4925-a2d7-276fba4c5bd8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"PlayStation advert\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A typically gritty and mature image from Sony’s early console advertising, bearing the slogan, ‘Do not underestimate the power of PlayStation.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: public domain</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But the order to go ahead with this curious hybrid came from Sega of Japan president Hayao Nakayama who – as incredible as it may seem today – was concerned not about the looming PlayStation, but about Atari’s Jaguar console. He wanted a quick stop-gap to rival the Atari system (which would go on to flop hopelessly) and the US team agreed. But this muddied the waters for the Saturn. The 32X was an expensive failure with little software support. And, although the Saturn was selling well in Japan, shifting almost 500,000 units in its first month, PlayStation was catching up.</p> \n<p>Sega had an autumn US release for the Saturn all planned out; its production line was in motion, retailers were ready. But Japan panicked. Nakayama believed that Sega had to get into the US market early and establish a presence before Sony. So on 11 May, at the E3 event, Tom Kalinske went on stage and announced that the Saturn was not only launching early in the US, it was already on the shelves – at the basic price of $399. “Many Americans have gone to the extent of paying $800 and more for Sega Saturn units from Japan,” said Kalinske in the resulting press release. “We’ve decided to bring the product to market earlier than scheduled to meet the high consumer demand, to refine our marketing strategy over the summer, prior to the important fall season, and to get a head start on the competition.”</p> \n<p>But it was a shambles. The machines were expensive and in short supply; only a handful of major retailers got them, alienating the rest of the market. There was only a small selection of games, including an OK port of the arcade hit Virtua Fighter, with few new titles expected until later in the year. All that was to come, but the big blow was only minutes after Kalinske’s announcement. During Sony’s own E3 press event, Sony America chief Olaf Olafsson called head of development Steve Race on to the stage to make a brief announcement. In a piece of theatre that foreshadowed the cruelly funny <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA\">PlayStation 4 game-sharing video</a> produced by Shuhei Yoshida in 2013, Race calmly approached the lectern, put his notes down and said “$299”. Then left the stage. If he’d had a hand mic, he would have dropped it. The audience went wild.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExaAYIKsDBI\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ExaAYIKsDBI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>That was it. Although Saturn was hanging on in Japan, the US market was essentially lost, and with it the big British publishers and developers too. There were technical issues as well: PlayStation was comparatively easy to develop for, with its clean architecture and suite of user-friendly programming APIs. Saturn was a complex beast that used twin CPUs and another couple of video processing chips. With PlayStation, Sony understood that the future was about sleek 3D visuals at all costs; Saturn still had one foot in gaming’s 2D, sprite-based past. It also thought that games were still about teenage boys – the boys it recruited through its chaotic Mega Drive TV ads. But Sony was already shifting upward, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6Bqq38WZctA\">targeting its ads at twentysomethings</a>, licensing dance music soundtracks, sponsoring club nights. It saw a future of post-pub gaming sessions, it saw a new audience of young professionals with disposable incomes, using their formative working careers as an extended adolescence.</p> \n<p>But if Sega had held its nerve, perhaps all that wouldn’t have mattered. Even outside of Japan, Saturn had some rank-and-file dev support. Although coding the PlayStation was certainly easier, thanks to its well-coordinated architecture and useful graphics libraries, Saturn was a geek’s dream, a mess of interlocking chipsets that skilled programmers could code down to the metal. Sega also retained some close international relationships from its 16-bit days. The company had always supported Derby-based developer Core Design, for example, so when that studio was working on a certain game about a female archeologist exploring treasure-filled tombs, Saturn was the development target. Perhaps if things had gone differently, it could have been an exclusive. </p> \n<p>Furthermore, at that time, arcade game conversions were the real profit drivers in the home console space – and Sega had the best coin-op development divisions on the planet. Its Amusement Machine (AM) departments were cranking out smash hits like Virtua Racer, Virtua Fighter and Daytona USA and its Model 2 arcade hardware was enormously powerful. Sony knew it had to compete, so it tied an exclusivity deal with coin-op rival Namco to ensure games like Ridge Racer and Tekken only appeared on PlayStation, but Sega had the talent to compete. It also had great first- and second-party console studios like Team Andromeda, responsible for the gorgeous Saturn hit Panzer Dragoon Saga, and Team Sonic, that had more than a certain blue hedgehog to offer: innovative fire-fighting game Burning Rangers and flight adventure Nights Into Dreams being prime examples.</p> \n<p>PlayStation grabbed an exclusivity deal with Square to secure the hugely popular Final Fantasy series and dominate the role-playing genre. But Saturn had old ally Treasure and its wonderful Guardian Heroes, a mix of side-scrolling platformer and RPG. It also had Camelot Software Planning and the superlative Shining Force series. And it had its own groundbreaking fantasy strategy titles Dragon Force and Mystaria: The Realms of Lore. Thanks to its 2D capabilities, Saturn also got the best of the 90s fighting games including the Street Fighter Alpha series and the prescient X-Men: Children of the Atom, which cemented the relationship between Capcom and Marvel that would lead to the excellent “Vs” series. 2D shooters flourished too, with visually astonishing hits like Radiant Silvergun and Battle Garegga with which to thrill the domestic market.</p> \n<p>Interviewed recently by <a href=\"http://www.seganerds.com/2015/05/11/former-sega-president-gives-his-thoughts-on-the-saturns-launch/\">the website Sega Nerds</a>, Kalinske is adamant about how much that early US launch cost Sega: “Had we waited until we had more and better games, launching with all retailers instead of with a few, with marketing that could reach every player, we would have been much more successful, even if that meant waiting for a late October or November launch.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP3ciD4Efr0\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cP3ciD4Efr0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sega’s US advertising was meant to highlight the radical new visuals of the system, but it turned out to be more symbolic of the company’s internal business approach\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There was, of course, another possible outcome. In the early nineties, after Sony had developed a CD-Rom drive for Nintendo’s SNES console only to be rebuffed at the last minute, Sega of America approached the spurned consumer electronics giant about working together on a new machine. Sony had its own game development studio, Sony Imagesoft, based in California, and it was making games for the Sega Mega CD. A relationship was there. Kalinske saw the benefit, he understood both the marketing and development talent that Sony could bring. He saw Nintendo waiting in the wings with its next machine – which would become the N64. He thought an alliance could win out. But according to him, Sega Japan <a href=\"http://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-shot-down-joint-sony-console/1100-6153914/\">turned it down outright</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/12/how-virtual-world-edge-of-apocalypse-and-back-again\">Eve Online: how a virtual world went to the edge of apocalypse and back | Simon Parkin</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even without that deal, the Saturn was a fascinating, difficult and brilliant machine. It had interesting, beautiful games, it experimented with online play and digital downloads through its NetLink modem, it provided a platform for some emerging industry names like Tetsuya Mizuguchi (Rez, Lumines) and Hideo Kojima (the Saturn had excellent versions of his Snatcher and Policenauts titles), and it housed fabulous experiments (like the chaotic 10-player Bomberman). But Sega of Japan blinked first; after a good domestic launch it showed its hand in the US too early, allowing PlayStation to beat it straightaway on price alone. </p> \n<p>What the company didn’t see was the roots of a prevailing trend, away from arcade conversions and traditional role-playing adventures and toward a much wider console development community with fresh ideas about gameplay and structure. Within two years, we’d see the release of Grand Theft Auto and Tomb Raider, games that had no arcade origins or conventions to adhere to. The open world was coming in more ways than one and Sony leapt at it with open arms (and development budgets). But Sega stumbled and all was lost – way before the subsequent launch of the Dreamcast and the desperate last shot that it represented. </p> \n<p>No, the gunfight was already over. History beckoned and it would not be kind.</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431510206328/c8a99bee-0065-453b-88e1-b44cb02f35a6-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"public domain","altText":"Sega Saturn","cleanCredit":"Photograph: public domain"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431513726209/d581a054-0082-4b90-8fe4-b8ced7803fcb-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":351,"width":585,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A typically gritty and mature image from Sony’s early console advertising, bearing the slogan, ‘Do not underestimate the power of PlayStation.’ Photograph: public domain","credit":"public domain","altText":"PlayStation advert","cleanCaption":"A typically gritty and mature image from Sony’s early console advertising, bearing the slogan, ‘Do not underestimate the power of PlayStation.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: public domain"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-14T10:09:14Z","lastModified":"2015-05-14T12:26:17Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":186,"contributors":[{"name":"Keith Stuart","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741413/KeithStuart.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/keithstuart"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Technology","Games","Culture","Game culture","Games consoles","Retro games","Sony","Nintendo"],"tags":[{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"},{"id":"technology/games","webTitle":"Games"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"technology/gameculture","webTitle":"Game culture"},{"id":"technology/games-consoles","webTitle":"Games consoles"},{"id":"technology/retro","webTitle":"Retro games"},{"id":"technology/sony","webTitle":"Sony"},{"id":"technology/nintendo","webTitle":"Nintendo"}],"section":{"id":"technology"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Keith Stuart","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/keithstuart"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"technology"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/14/sega-saturn-how-one-decision-destroyed-playstations-greatest-rival","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48p7d","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/technology/2015/may/14/sega-saturn-how-one-decision-destroyed-playstations-greatest-rival","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/14/sega-saturn-how-one-decision-destroyed-playstations-greatest-rival"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431510206328/c8a99bee-0065-453b-88e1-b44cb02f35a6-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Sega Saturn console, originally launched in Japan in the autumn of 1994.
