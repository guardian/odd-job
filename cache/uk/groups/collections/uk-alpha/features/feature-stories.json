Investigations have revealed one rebel leader died trying to broker a peaceful solution. Nick Davies uncovers his story","byline":"Nick Davies","body":"<p>On 16 August 2012, South African police <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2012/aug/17/miners-wives-rage-south-africa-killings?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">opened fire</a> on a large crowd of men who had walked out on strike from a platinum mine at Marikana, about 80 miles north of Johannesburg. They shot down 112 of them, killing 34. In any country, this would have been a traumatic moment. For South Africa, it was a special kind of nightmare, since it revived images of massacres by the state in the old apartheid era, with one brutal difference – this time it was predominantly black policemen, with black senior officers working for black politicians, who were doing the shooting.</p> \n<p>In response, President Jacob Zuma appointed a <a href=\"http://www.marikanacomm.org.za/\" title=\"\">commission of inquiry</a>, chaired by a retired judge, Ian Farlam, which eventually sat in public for a total of 293 days, hearing evidence from miners, their bosses and the police, and reviewing video, audio and paper records of the shooting and of the seven-day strike that preceded it. At the end of March this year, the commission delivered its report to Zuma, who so far has failed to publish its conclusions. Those who may find themselves accused of colluding in the police action include not only senior figures from the ruling African National Congress but also Lonmin, the British company that owns the Marikana mine.</p> \n<p>In the evidence before the Farlam inquiry, one particular miner came to the fore. In videos of marches and meetings during the strike, this was largely because he wore a bright green blanket around his shoulders. Beyond that, it was because during those seven days of conflict, he came from nowhere as the leader, making passionate speeches through a loudhailer, negotiating with police, standing in the frontline as the shooting broke out. He died that afternoon, with 14 bullets in his face and neck and legs.</p> \n<p>The name of the man in the green blanket was Mgcineni Noki. He was aged 30, and known to his family and friends as Mambush. This is his story. It may also stand as part of the story of what has happened in South Africa since apartheid was voted into the dust of history 21 years ago. Mambush – a rock-drill operator with no official rank – emerged from the mass of black workers as a rebel leader demanding justice, while some of those who were once the spearhead of the fight against repression acted as a shield protecting privilege, exploitation and extreme violence. It is a story about power changing hands and changing colour but failing, finally, to change the lives of those in whose name that power is held.</p> \n<p><strong>* * *</strong></p> \n<p><strong>The Lonmin smelter stands like a cathedral of commerce</strong> over a bleak landscape, its chimney reaching for heaven, its conveyor belt shuffling a fortune in unrefined platinum. The miners live in its shadow. Their homes are one-room shacks. Some of them are built of breeze blocks; most are patchworks of rusting corrugated iron tacked onto frames of timber torn from local trees. The shacks huddle together in groups of several hundred. There are no roads, only dirt tracks which that turn greasy in the rain. A few chickens peck the mud. Goats stroll by.</p> \n<p>As far as the eye can see, pylons march across the landscapelike robot soldiers, bringing electricity to the mines, but most of the shacks have no power (though some steal it on cables that sag among the washing lines). The mines have water, too, to wash the ore. But not the shacks: some of the men share a communal tap (though many of them have been broken for months); some drink straight from milky streams that run nearby.</p> \n<p>In one of the shacks lives Mbulelo Noki, a lean, fit man in blue jeans and a Levi shirt, now aged 35. He has a double bed, neatly made; a small table with a plastic cloth; a metal wardrobe with the torn remains of an old ANC sticker on the door. Mbulelo is Mambush’s cousin – their fathers were brothers. Mbulelo and Mambush grew up together in a tiny village called Thwalikhulu, which sits high on the rim of a pale green valley, some 600 miles south in the Eastern Cape. The two boys were close. Mambush’s father died before he was born, and so Mbulelo’s father helped the bereaved family to survive. As they reached adolescence, the cousins went together into the hills to build a hut and to go through the rituals and circumcision that marked their graduation to manhood. Later they worked together as rock-drill operators, battering platinum ore out of the earth, 5km below ground.</p> \n<p>Mbulelo recalled that Mambush nearly missed the strike. The two of them were there as it was launched, on Thursday 9 August 2012, when hundreds of rock-drill operators gathered on the parched grass of the Wonderkop football stadium, which stands near the administrative buildings at the centre of the mine complex. They had heard that the rock-drill operators at the Impala platinum mine, 30 miles away near the town of Rustenburg, had emerged from a long and sometimes violent strike with new pay rates, while they remained on 4,000-5,000 rand a month (&pound;215-270), and they were angry. They demanded 12,500 rand (&pound;670) and agreed they would not turn up for work the next day.</p> \n<p>On the Friday morning, the two cousins got a message that their uncle – the younger brother to their fathers – had died of tuberculosis at the Impala mine. On the second day of the strike, they set off to retrieve his body, so they missed the first sign of violence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e9a429366f7dfe53750fbce9210be3e9fbfcab20\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431964571011/b6e33e9b-86ea-448b-9d63-f8206d96b409-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Marikana platinum mine\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lonmin platinum smelter in Marikana, South Africa.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It happened on the Friday evening. Small groups of strikers had gone to two of the shafts where some men were still working. The strikers “toyi-toyied” – jogging in step, chanting in time – urging them to join them. Some waved sticks. Lonmin security men asked police who were watching to disperse the strikers. The police reportedly said the strikers were not causing any trouble. Lonmin security then opened fire with rubber bullets, firing more than 40 rounds at the strikers. Two were seriously injured and hospitalised. Much later, the Lonmin log book that contained a record of this event was submitted to the Farlam inquiry – with all reference to the shooting deleted. (Another copy was later discovered in police archives, containing detailed references to the shooting. A Lonmin manager later admitted making the deletions.)</p> \n<p>The previous evening, Barnard Mokwena, then Lonmin’s executive vice president, had written an internal memo, later disclosed to the Farlam inquiry, advising that the company should not tolerate demands that were “outside the collective bargaining structure”. The strikers were rejecting their own union, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), accusing it of supporting the bosses. Since the union was not involved, the company could choose not to recognise the strike and not to negotiate. Mokwena urged that instead of talking, the company should sack the strikers and call in the police to deal with them.</p> \n<p>By Friday night, Mbulelo and Mambush were back from Impala and arguing about their next move. Mbulelo wanted to leave to arrange their uncle’s funeral; Mambush was determined to join the strike. That night, Mambush called his wife, Veronica, who was living with their two-year-old daughter, Asive, in Carletonville, a gold-mining town 90 miles to the west. This was the town where he had first worked as a miner, in 2004. In 2008, he had injured his shoulder in a rock fall and had gone to the medical station where Veronica was an administrative assistant. They had started a relationship that continued even though Mambush soon moved to Marikana, where the pay was better and the rock was harder and safer to mine than in Carletonville.</p> \n<p>Veronica had not known Mambush to get involved in a strike before, though she knew that he was angry with the NUM. Sitting on the old plastic chairs under the tree at the back of her house, he had often talked to her and her father, Ephraim, about how the NUM shop stewards were taken out of the mine and given pay rises, cars and mobile phones by the company, and how very soon they stopped speaking up for the people who had elected them. “The NUM is a sellout,” she remembered him saying. She also remembered one time when she was visiting him in Marikana, when he disappeared for an hour to register with a new breakaway union – the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu).</p> \n<p>He had talked often about the real problem, that he was struggling to get by on 5,000 rand a month. He was sending most of it back to his family in the Eastern Cape, then paying for rent on his shack and food for himself. Often he would have to borrow to get through to the end of the month, sometimes from friends, sometimes from the “micro-lender” banks who specialised in payday loans at interest rates as high as 50% a month. Veronica had told him not to worry about sending money to her and Asive. She had a brick-built house and a college education and was earning enough to get by. “Let’s deal with other issues,” she told him. “I will take care of the baby.”</p> \n<p>On the Friday night, he told her the strikers had to hold out. “The money is so little. It’s a must.” Veronica said that there was no way they would get the raise they were demanding, but she was not worried about him. Not just then. Over the following three days, the strike tumbled into a vortex of violence.</p> \n<p><strong>* * *</strong></p> \n<p><strong>On the morning of Saturday 11 August, </strong>the strikers gathered in the football stadium and decided to march to the NUM office, close by Lonmin’s, to protest that union officials had been touring the shacks urging their members to go to work. Some of the strikers were carrying sticks and chanting aggressively. The Farlam inquiry later heard that an NUM official gathered 30 of his members in their office and gave them long panga blades and at least one gun. As the strikers approached, they heard gunfire and turned and scattered. NUM men pursued them. Some strikers were beaten and cut. Two fell with bullet wounds and were hospitalised. They survived, although at the time the others understood that they were dead. The strikers abandoned the football stadium as a meeting place, because it was too close to the NUM, and began to assemble instead on a “koppie” – a rocky hill, that stood on a wide plane of wasteland near one of the settlements. They collected cash and sent for a local <em>sangoma </em>– a traditional healer – in the hope that he could protect them from violence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"03bcf1bc8e4b276d3e2bebecaf5ac915d49d0a8a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431966355961/16910c6b-c962-40cf-82b0-e6a8c5a9c347-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Striking miners\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Striking miners brandish their pangas on the day 34 were shot by police.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gallo Images/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Then others joined the strike – not just the rock-drill operators who had started it, but other Lonmin workers who were furious when they heard that the NUM was colluding with the company and had shot two of their comrades. One of the new recruits was a friend of Mambush, a short, muscular man named Xolani Nzuza, then 27, who managed a shackland football team in which Mambush played. Xolani had come to Marikana eight years earlier to finish college, aiming to become a social worker, but ran out of money. In 2006, he turned to the mine for income. Like Mambush, he had abandoned the NUM and joined Amcu. He was outraged by what was happening. As he said later: “The people who should be negotiating for us were shooting at us.” Clever and articulate, Xolani was to become Mambush’s deputy at the head of the strike.</p> \n<p>The violence escalated. The following day, Sunday 12 August, a group of about 150 strikers marched from their new base on the koppie to the Lonmin office. There were scuffles. A striker threw a rock. A security guard fired a shotgun. The strikers massed forward. Some of the workers were now carrying pangas, and they used them with deadly force, slashing one guard from armpit to hip and hacking two more to death. One of the bodies was burned beyond recognition. Over the following 24 hours, two miners were killed when they tried to go to work in the hours of darkness.</p> \n<p>Looking back at these events, the Farlam inquiry uncovered fault on all sides: the opening violence by Lonmin and the NUM; a complete absence of investigation of that violence by the South African police service (Saps); barbaric behaviour by those strikers who had killed people who defied them; and an apparently callous decision by Lonmin. As counsel to the Farlam inquiry put it: “It appears that it was possible for Lonmin to close the mine in order to protect its workers but that for business reasons, it elected not to do so.”</p> \n<p>Veronica says that Mambush was worried, telling her in phone calls: “This is so messy. This is getting too violent.” She pleaded with him to come and stay with her, but it was at this point that he decided to try to take the lead, to steer the strikers away from violence and back to their real aim, to negotiate a pay rise.</p> \n<p>By early the next afternoon, Monday 13 August, he was at the head of some 200 strikers who marched from the koppie to picket one of the mine shafts, where they had heard NUM members were still working. When Lonmin security barred their way and told them no one was working there, Mambush simply turned the march around and headed back towards the koppie, only to be stopped by the police who insisted that they must give up the sticks and pangas they were carrying. Police video caught Mambush, with Xolani by his side, reasoning with them: “Please open the way for us. That’s the only thing we are asking for. We are not fighting with anyone. We just want to go to the koppie.” Soon, the strikers had agreed that, if the police would protect them from attack by NUM members, they would surrender their weapons when they reached the safety of the koppie. The senior policeman on the scene appeared willing to accept this until – as the video shows – he took a phone call.</p> \n<p>At that moment, the provincial chief of the South African police service, Lt Gen Mirriam Zukiswa Mbombo, was sitting with Lonmin managers, monitoring the strikers on CCTV. Mbombo had joined the police in 1980 and risen fast through the ranks after the end of apartheid. She set up a joint operations centre in Lonmin’s office, where, according to evidence at the Farlam inquiry, her officers were working not only with the company but also with NUM officials who were helping them to identify strike leaders.</p> \n<p>When he came off the phone, the senior officer was no longer willing to compromise. He would count to 10, he said, by which time the strikers must surrender all their sticks and pangas. The strikers replied by chanting in Xhosa: “No matter how big you make your balls, you are nothing.” And with that, crouching low to show they planned no attack, Mambush to the fore, they began walking slowly towards the koppie. Police video shows that all was peaceful for several minutes – until some officers lobbed tear gas and stun grenades at the strikers. Nobody has ever established whether they were ordered to do this. The result was disaster. The miners started to run. Police ran after them. Two officers were surrounded by strikers and cut down and killed. Strikers stole their guns. In the melee, some of the dead men’s colleagues then turned on their own senior officer, blaming him for the deaths and threatening to kill him. Other officers pursued the fleeing strikers. Several miners were shot. Three died. None of them was carrying a firearm. One was shot through the head from an assault rifle at a distance of more than 70 metres. That evening, photographs of the hacked bodies of the two dead officers are said to have been circulated among police officers across the country.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>One striker shot through the head from an assault rifle at a distance of more than 70 metres</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>When Mambush and the others straggled back to the koppie, his cousin Mbulelo was there. He heard Mambush speak to the crowd, reporting the deaths. That evening, Mbulelo called Veronica and begged her to come to Marikana. “I tried to talk to him, told him he must come back, but he doesn’t want to listen to me,” he said. “He will listen to you. Please come.”</p> \n<p>But Veronica could not come. She was working and she had no money to get to Marikana. All she could do was to pass on her own warning to Mambush: “If police officers are killed, this is a very, very dangerous situation.”</p> \n<p>She says she was thinking he would get arrested and put in jail but that he seemed to have something worse in mind, telling her: “If anything happens to me, take care of everything, take care of my family because I trust you.”</p> \n<p>“Why? Where are you going?”</p> \n<p>“If anything happens to me, be strong for my baby.”</p> \n<p><strong>* * *</strong></p> \n<p><strong>When Nelson Mandela took power in 1994,</strong> he was backed by what South Africans call the “tripartite alliance”: the ANC; the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu); and the South African Communist party. What Mambush and his wife did not know was that his act of rebellion spat into the face of that alliance. Worse, members of the alliance were in contact with two of the most senior police officers in the country, who wielded not only political power but the power of life and death. There was a lot of activity behind the scenes.</p> \n<p>On Monday evening – at about the same time as Mambush was talking to his wife – Albert Jamieson, the chief commercial officer of Lonmin, was writing to the minister of mines, Susan Shabangu, urging her to “bring the full might of the state to bear on the situation”. Shabangu had previously been deputy minister for security. Notoriously, in April 2008, she had addressed a meeting of police officers with advice about dealing with offenders: “You must kill the bastards if they threaten you or your community. You must not worry about the regulations. That is my responsibility.”</p> \n<p>On Tuesday 14 August, as hundreds of strikers on the koppie were being given rites to keep them safe by the <em>sangoma</em>’s two sons, Lonmin executives met secretly with the provincial police chief, Lt Gen Mbombo. The meeting was recorded. The transcript shows Barnard Mokwena making the bold declaration that the company’s priority was not negotiating or settling the strike but “getting people arrested”. Even bolder, the transcript shows that Mbombo stepped outside the conventional role of a police chief, encouraging the company to take a hard line.</p> \n<p>Central to Mbombo’s thinking was the role of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/sep/08/cyril-ramaphosa-criticised-profits-game-south-africa\" title=\"\">Cyril Ramaphosa</a> – founder of the National Union of Mineworkers, one of the founders of Cosatu, the man who wrote the new South African constitution, one of the great heroes of the anti-apartheid movement. Like other ANC leaders, he had also been one of the beneficiaries of the Black Economic Empowerment programme, which now required South African companies to yield more than 25% of their shares to black owners and to give 40% of the seats on their board to black directors. By August 2012, through his company, <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Shanduka</a>, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/cyril-ramaphosa/\" title=\"\">Ramaphosa was reckoned to be worth some $700m</a>, with shares and directorships in numerous companies&nbsp;– including Lonmin. The former NUM leader’s company now owned 9% of Lonmin’s shares and he sat on its board as a non‑executive director. The national police commissioner, Riah Phiyega, had given Mbombo a strong hint that she had been coming under pressure from Lonmin representatives.</p> \n<p>Mbombo explained to the Lonmin executives that Ramaphosa had been directly involved in the ANC expelling a powerful rebel from its ranks – Julius Malema, formerly the radical leader of the ANC’s youth wing, now leader of the upstart opposition Economic Freedom Fighters. Malema had turned up at the platinum mining strike at the Impala mine a few months earlier, and had taken the credit for making peace. If Malema turned up and did the same at Marikana, she said, it would look like he was in charge of the mines. The situation, she said, “has a serious political connotation that we need to take into account”.</p> \n<p>And there was another alliance player to consider. Mbombo advised the Lonmin executives that they must be careful not to favour Amcu over the NUM. Mbombo was worried, she said, that by settling their strike, the Impala management had looked like allies of Amcu, and that generally trouble was erupting because the mining companies wanted to replace the NUM with the new union.</p> \n<p>Lt Gen Mbombo was uncompromising. She would give the strikers a chance to surrender their weapons, she told Lonmin executives and, if that did not work: “Then it is blood.” She went on to qualify that, saying “I do not want a situation where 20 people are dead. This is not what we are here for.” Mokwena appeared not to understand this. During the meeting, he discussed the resources that were available to police, adding: “The ones that impress me – the snipers.”</p> \n<p>But he and the police chief agreed on the central point. “We need to act such that we kill this thing,” said Mbombo.</p> \n<p>“Immediately,” replied Mokwena.</p> \n<p>The following day, Wednesday 15th, Ramaphosa was busy. From his position on the board of Lonmin, the former union leader could have argued for negotiation, even for a better deal for the workers. Instead – as a chain of emails released to the Farlam inquiry disclosed – he argued for the police to move in. In a message to fellow directors, he wrote: “The terrible events that have unfolded cannot be described as a labour dispute. They are plainly dastardly criminal and must be characterised as such … There needs to be concomitant action to address this situation.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Ramaphosa, the former union leader, could have argued for negotiation. Instead he argued for the police to move in</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Mambush and the 4,000 men who were then on the koppie knew nothing of this. Indeed, they were hopeful. They had formally elected Mambush, Xolani and three others to speak for them. From the safety of an armoured car, officers had agreed to talk, with Mambush standing on their front bumper and leaning in to the windscreen to make sure they understood the one thing they wanted – negotiation. The president of Amcu, Joseph Mathunjwa, came to the koppie with a welcome message: a Lonmin executive had told him that if they would go back to work, the company would address their grievances. This looked like an agreement to negotiate. The strikers, who had not all joined Amcu, said they needed time to think and agreed that Mathunjwa should come back to them at nine o’clock the following morning. Mathunjwa told a senior police officer: “I believe that tomorrow will be a day of joy for everyone.”</p> \n<p>That evening, in a Johannesburg suburb, there was a meeting of the National Management Forum of the South African police. The meeting was made aware of the Amcu leader’s initiative and its potential for peace and yet, as an official minute recorded: “After deliberations, the meeting endorsed the proposal to disarm the protesting masses and further indicated that additional resources must be made available.” The phone records of Mbombo show that immediately after this meeting, she called two Lonmin executives. If police were ending the strike, Lonmin no longer had any reason to negotiate.</p> \n<p>At Marikana that Wednesday night, more than 550 police officers gathered. Their leaders ordered 4,000 rounds of live ammunition and requested mortuary vans with berths for 16&nbsp;bodies.</p> \n<p><strong>* * *</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Early on the morning of Thursday 16 August, </strong>Joseph Mathunjwa met Lonmin executives to sort out details of his plan for the strikers’ return to work. Unaware of the moves behind the scenes, he ran into a dead end: the company now refused to discuss anything. On the koppie, the strikers saw 9am pass with no sign of the Amcu leader. At 9.30am, Mbombo held a press conference in which she said nothing about Mathunjwa’s plan and declared simply: “We are ending the strike today.” At 10.30, still waiting for the Amcu leader, Mambush saw police rolling out barbed wire in front of the koppie and angrily called on them to take it away. At noon, Mathunjwa came to the koppie, told the strikers he was getting nowhere and then went back to try again.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f545828f86ab8a766e14bd7a9d0bfc46e00a7bb4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431967638558/eb4cf131-0057-4ab8-99ab-2c0e8a826e54-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Police officers with the bodies of dead strikers after the shootings.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers with the bodies of dead strikers after the shootings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gallo Images/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mambush tried to raise morale, talking to the strikers through a megaphone, his left hand beating the air, urging them to stay until Lonmin agreed to negotiate: “We are tired of being captive. We will decide who will remain here – either the police or us. You cannot have two bulls in the same kraal.” At 1.30pm, senior police met to discuss their plan to “disarm and disperse” the strikers. Ten minutes later, the Anglican bishop of Pretoria, Johannes Seoka, unexpectedly came to the koppie. Xolani says they asked him to send food and to urge Lonmin to speak to them. Xolani took his mobile phone number.</p> \n<p>In the Lonmin office, Mathunjwa tried to speak to Mbombo and was told she had left the building. He offered Lonmin a compromise deal on the strikers’ wage demand, but representatives of the company declined to meet him. At 3.30pm the Amcu leader came back to the koppie and spoke to the strikers with passion, at one point dropping to his knees: “Comrades, the life of a black person in Africa is so cheap ... They will kill us, they will finish us and then they will replace us and continue to pay wages that cannot change black people’s lives. That would mean we were defeated and that the capitalists will win. But we have another way. We urge you – brothers, sisters, men – I am kneeling down – coming to you as nothing. Let us stop this bloodshed that the NUM allowed this employer to let flow. We do not want bloodshed!”</p> \n<p>As he finished, hundreds of striking miners began to walk down from the koppie. Xolani was at the top and had been watching what looked like preparations for war: firearms being handed out; police vans with racks of coiled barbed wire; three helicopters circling. He called Mambush on his phone to warn him. Mambush was in a small group at the foot of the koppie. One of those alongside him was Mzoxolo Magidiwana, known as Mzo, a burly locomotive driver, aged 24. He knew Mambush from football games at their villages in the Eastern Cape. He said that Mambush simply decided to lead the strikers away, saying “Don’t run. We haven’t done anything wrong.”</p> \n<p>Mzo stayed close to Mambush as their group set off on the walk to the nearest shack settlement some 400 metres across the wasteland. Video of the scene shows hundreds of armed policemen moving around them. As the group approached the settlement, a police van raced across in front of them, uncoiling barbed wire, which blocked their path. Mambush led them to the left around a small animal enclosure, made of bushes and blackthorn trees. But as they reached the far side, with the settlement in front of them, more police vans blocked their path. There was tear gas. A water cannon opened fire. And then bullets, from behind and to their left. Mzo remembered them running to their right through a small gap between the enclosure and the settlement – straight into yet more bullets, this time from in front of them. He felt three bullets pierce his left side – in the buttock, ribs and elbow. He fell, saw others fall, saw Mambush go down, felt a fourth bullet in his right thigh as he squirmed on the ground. He lay still on his back. He said his legs would not move. The firing had stopped. Then two or three police officers were standing over him.</p> \n<p>They started asking him about the <em>sangoma</em> whose sons had performed the traditional rituals for the strikers – who he was, where he was – and when he told them that he didn’t know, they shot him again in the right side of his ribs. They asked more questions, and then, he says, one of the officers kicked his legs apart and they shot him twice in the groin. Through the dust he could see Mambush, lying crashed downwards on his front, the green blanket tangled around one shoulder, his mouth slightly open, dust on his tongue.</p> \n<p>From the top of the koppie, Xolani had watched the attack begin. At first he was going to follow Mambush. He remembered hearing the shooting, running into a miner called Liau, saying he could not see Mambush any more, saying that now they must go in the other direction, where there were a couple of smaller koppies to hide in. But Liau ignored him and ran towards the settlement. He was shot in the chest – one of 17 men who died there. Xolani went in the opposite direction, tearing off his jacket as he went, in case it identified him as a strike leader and a target.</p> \n<p>For 15 minutes, there was no firing. Then two groups of officers closed in one of the two smaller koppies. Several dozen strikers were now hiding among its rocks and bushes. Police opened an explosion of intense fire – 295 bullets, many aimed from the top of the koppie down at the shapes of men huddling below. Seventeen more men died there. Police in one of the helicopters were lobbing stun grenades at fleeing miners. As Xolani zig-zagged through the chaos, he pulled out his phone and called the number of the bishop of Pretoria. “Father, they are killing us.”</p> \n<p><strong>* * *</strong></p> \n<p><strong>High over a valley in the Eastern Cape</strong> in March this year, 20&nbsp;of Mambush’s family and friends gathered in a rondavel – a traditional round hut, about 20ft in diameter, built out of baked mud and dung with a thatched roof. They had come to talk to me and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/jan/06/marikana-mine-massacre-british-lawyer\" title=\"\">Jim Nichol</a>, a veteran campaigning lawyer from London, who travelled to Marikana after the shootings and volunteered to represent the families of the 34&nbsp;dead men.</p> \n<p>They talked about Mambush’s funeral, there in the village where he grew up, about how many hundreds came down from Johannesburg in coaches, and how they were joined by the local clan chief and by ward councillors. Even the police had tried to send representatives, but the villagers told them they were not welcome. Mzo was not there – he stayed in hospital for three months. But Mbulelo was, carrying the coffin, and Xolani, who was still involved in the strike. It held out for five weeks after the killings, before Lonmin finally agreed to negotiate and to pay 7% higher wages. Veronica also came, with Mambush’s little daughter, Asive. Tucked into her bag, she carried a green blanket stained with blood, which she burned in a kind of sacrament.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"80c5ef9394f227045415c0c8cfe5dc1883d33b9e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431966626759/6dec53ec-a462-4373-ac8a-bc44ae0567a5-460x298.jpeg\" alt=\"Mbulelo Noki \" width=\"460\" height=\"298\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mbulelo Noki stands with his cousin Mgcineni’s coffin in their home village.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jim Nichol told them the latest from the Farlam inquiry, which not only explored the strike and shooting but also uncovered evidence that, when the killing was done, Saps officers planted weapons on some of the dead bodies and then set about “reverse engineering” a false story to justify their action. Counsel for the inquiry accused six senior officers of giving false testimony and found that Saps had concealed video and minutes which contradicted their story and fabricated other material to try to support it.Mambush’s family talked about life in the village; about what has changed since 1994, when Mandela became president. The ragged old rondavels which housed the junior school nearby were torn down and replaced with new brick buildings. The government delivered a new asphalt road to the village, a new bus to take children to the high school (in his day, Mambush had to walk the 5km there and back), and a new health clinic. And yet, they said, things have not changed so much. They still lived in the three rondavels that formed the heart of their village, most of them sleeping on the ground. They still had no electricity. They cooked over wood fires and used paraffin lamps for light. They still had no mains water and still drank from the same stream as their cattle. For some reason, they said, the new bus stopped running after less than a year. And the health clinic was too far to reach.</p> \n<p>Above all, they said, they still had no real income. Since 1994, they had become better off. They have social grants – modest but nonetheless important state funds for pensioners and the sick. And at school there is a feeding scheme – porridge at the beginning of the day, a proper meal at lunch. But the reality is that now, as for decades, they still rely on menfolk, like Mambush, migrating north to work beneath the ground and send home enough to keep them alive. Somewhere along the line, the engine of progress has stalled. <span class=\"bullet\">•</span></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431964164041/60f7b136-94fc-4b87-9d74-c9e1983dd347-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Leon Sadiki/Getty Images","altText":"Mgcineni Noki","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Leon Sadiki/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431964572499/b6e33e9b-86ea-448b-9d63-f8206d96b409-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Lonmin platinum smelter in Marikana, South Africa.

Should you enter the water, however, three things may happen: the surfers may surround, harass and possibly assault you. Their friends may roll rocks on you as you clamber back up the cliff. Your car may be vandalised.</p> \n<p>Lunada Bay is famous not just for its waves but also its “Bay Boys” – self-professed locals who have monopolised the spot for decades by intimidating outsiders.</p> \n<p>When a Guardian reporter and photographer recently visited, clutching surfboards, the Bay Boys warned us to leave immediately.</p> \n<p>“The reason there’s a lot of space is because we keep it like that. We fucking hassle people,” said one man in his fifties as he pulled on a wetsuit and prepared to paddle out. Like the others, he declined to give his name.</p> \n<p>They would sabotage any outsider’s attempt to surf, he said: “We’ll burn you every single wave.” Violence was a last resort because it could lead to criminal charges and hiring a lawyer, he said. “That’ll cost me 10 grand. I don’t want to go through that shit again.”</p> \n<p>Four other surfers – mostly middle-aged, all men – made similar threats and said we were being monitored from the cliffs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e4e0d861a1e957460d3c0cfeede6618d82853b9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431957615679/4184023190_cebe47271c_o-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lunada Bay, California\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lunada Bay: idyllic – unless there are local surfers around.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When we returned to our car up on the bluff it was smeared with eggs and someone had used surf wax to scratch “kooks”, slang for amateurs, on the windows.</p> \n<p>Welcome to surfing “localism” – the term for an aggressive territorial streak found in surfing communities across the world. Typically, a group declares a particular beach “local” and uses varying levels of menace to deter outsiders, dubbed “trolls”, and force them onto crowded non-local beaches.</p> \n<p>As surfing continues to explode in popularity, localism and other general boorish behaviour in the waves face increasing pressure and scrutiny. Phone cameras and drones capture violence which previously went unrecorded.</p> \n<p>Popular culture imagines a laid-back vibe, but surfing was always closer to Lord of the Flies, said Johnny Lockwood, a surfer who has encountered localism at Malibu beaches 40 miles north of Lunada Bay. “I had dreams I’d come to California and everything would be groovy. There’s this sort of under-the-wire terrorism.”</p> \n<p>Interlopers risked finding their cars covered with surf wax and sand, or being confronted in the water, said Lockwood. “The only remedy to that is if you have a crew with a bunch of buddies.” Hardcore locals, he said, were incorrigible: “It’s like dealing with warlords.”</p> \n<p>The phenomenon began in the 1960s when cheaper, lighter boards and Gidget, a fictional girl surfer popularised in a book, film and TV series, turned surfing into a mainstream sport, producing crowding on the waves.</p> \n<p>Localism declared certain beaches off limits, with Lunada Bay reputedly southern California’s most forbidding spot. “The area is known as a war zone of sorts,” the Los Angeles Times <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-05/local/me-1657_1_lunada-bay\">reported</a> in 1991, citing assaults, rock-throwing and vandalism.</p> \n<p>Outside surfers accused police and the authorities of Palos Verdes Estates, a wealthy town of big houses and lawn sprinklers, of turning a blind eye to thuggishness from well-heeled local surfers.</p> \n<p>The outsiders sued and appeared to win in 1996: a Bay Boy <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1996-12-04/local/me-5657_1_lunada-bay\">agreed</a> to pay $15,000 in damages and Palos Verdes Estate conceded to issue a public proclamation that the beach was open to everyone. </p> \n<p>But intimidation continued and outsiders stayed away. In 2002 the police chief installed a “<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/07/local/me-surf7\">surf cam</a>” to stream images from the beach and quell aggression. The Bay Boys nixed that too, by warning residents the images would lure hordes of visitors. An alarmed city council voted unanimously to remove the camera. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"089e58ccd77dffe4d1650b2c9ec8999274b9e947\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431966463465/e12b30d2-4289-470a-836b-83fb9d6774d6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"California 1960s surfers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don’t let the friendly atmosphere fool you – try to surf on their turf and these guys probably would have kicked your ass.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Kelley/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Last year a <a href=\"http://us.reddit.com/r/surfing/comments/1vaprb/monday_january_20th_lunada_bay_becomes_open_to/ \">thread on Reddit</a> prompted a renewed attempt to end the bullying of “a relatively small crew of spoiled trust fund babies”. Protestors renamed the bay Aloha Bay and <a href=\"http://www.theinertia.com/surf/peaceful-protest-by-surfers-underway-at-lunada/\">staged</a> a one-day act of defiance, with a handful paddling out into the surf, monitored by police watching from the bluffs. </p> \n<p>The event passed off without incident – and, it seems, impact. When the Guardian visited Lunada Bay recently, at a sunny weekend with a good swell, there was only one outsider surfer, a young Frenchman, sitting apprehensively in his car. A police officer had warned him he faced harassment, possibly violence, if he tried to surf, he said, requesting anonymity. He decided it was not worth the risk and drove away.</p> \n<p>At the police station, an officer told the Guardian police would respond if the Bay Boys broke the law. “They’re pretty much grown men in little men’s mindsets. It is like a game on the schoolyard to them and they don’t want you playing on their swing set.”</p> \n<p>Every surfer encountered on the beach warned of vague, unpleasant consequences if we entered the water.</p> \n<p>“Too many damn surfers, not enough waves, that’s why there’s localism, man,” said one, plucking a beer from an ice box. “If we let every nice guy surf, there’d be a hundred guys out here. You have to nip it in the bud. The reason it’s not crowded is that people protect it.”</p> \n<p>It was the only way to avoid being overrun, he said. “It’s fucked, dude. People think we’re a bunch of assholes, but you know what? We want to keep it like this so we can go somewhere where it’s fucking sacred.” Friends’ ashes, he added, had been scattered on the waves.</p> \n<p>Gidget, the fictional character who kickstarted the boom, was based on Kathy Kohner Zuckerman, who as a teenager started surfing Malibu’s deserted beaches in 1956. Zuckerman, now 76, takes pride that her father’s novel, and the film and TV adaptations, inspired millions to take up the sport. “Everybody wanted to go surfing.”</p> \n<p>She no longer surfs, but paddles while watching others. “Sometimes it gets a little crowded and people have to watch out,” she said. Zuckerman did not approve of localism. “I think we have to respect everyone that gets into the water.”</p>","section":"Travel","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431965713567/88bdea7b-10a4-4dd8-8a4c-d66bf7d15e06-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom Kelley/Getty Images","altText":"California surfers","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tom Kelley/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431957617055/4184023190_cebe47271c_o-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lunada Bay: idyllic – unless there are local surfers around.","credit":"tiarescott/flickr","altText":"Lunada Bay, California","cleanCaption":"Lunada Bay: idyllic – unless there are local surfers around."},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431966465102/e12b30d2-4289-470a-836b-83fb9d6774d6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Don’t let the friendly atmosphere fool you – try to surf on their turf and these guys probably would have kicked your ass.

What remains today is a patchwork of paint covering up any hint of political protest.</p> \n<p>This isn’t the only whitewash in Egypt now. According to a devastating report published on Tuesday, state-sanctioned sexual violence against Egypt’s women has increased dramatically since the military returned to power in July 2013. In Exposing State Hypocrisy: Sexual Violence by Security Forces in Egypt, the <a href=\"https://www.fidh.org\" title=\"\">International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH)</a> lays bare a vast array of sexualised torture by Egyptian police, military and state security forces. Interviews with scores of individual victims and NGOs in Egypt tell of sexual abuse at the hands of officials, ranging from harassment and rape to genital electrocution. And it’s not just women – members of the now-banned <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/muslim-brotherhood\" title=\"\">Muslim Brotherhood </a>and other political dissidents are being targeted, as well as run-of-the-mill arrestees, students and even children in juvenile&nbsp;detention.</p> \n<p>There is nothing new in sexual violence being used by authoritarian regimes in Egypt and the wider Arab world. “To break his eye” is the local expression for humiliating someone, and sexual torture has been the instrument of choice throughout the ages. Because of the taboos surrounding sex in the region and its powerful association with shame, sexual violence is a particularly formidable tool of control. Women are especially vulnerable since their exploitation packs a one-two punch of not only disgracing them, but their families too;&nbsp;husbands, fathers and brothers are&nbsp;often still considered the guardians&nbsp;of female honour.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26b3077ab55a9e7daa58a020fe2039cb68c1005e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431968166018/c0dd3e51-9e57-46db-8290-03c073cb4d9a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Protesters demanding the army hand power to civilians, Tahrir Square, Cairo, 2012.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters demanding the army hand power to civilians, Tahrir Square, Cairo, 2012.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suhaib Salem/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The FIDH report maintains that the current government has turned up the temperature on such violence, as part of a strategy of consolidating power and clamping down on the opposition. It describes state-sponsored sexual abuse, from university campuses to secret detention centres on military bases. Gay and transgender people are squarely in the line of fire, with a recent rise in arrests and sentencing — despite there being no law in Egypt explicitly criminalising same-sex activity or alternative gender identities. This, however, is more a question of political expediency than morality, allowing the government to walk a fine line between suppressing Islamist opposition and shoring up conservative support by cracking down on these often despised minorities.</p> \n<p>By its own admission, FIDH has had trouble verifying many of its harrowing testimonials, as well as establishing the culpability of those accused. No wonder: Egyptian authorities are not exactly forthcoming on their failings these days. Authorities point to reforms, such as the country’s new <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jun/06/egypt-criminalises-sexual-harassment\" title=\"\">sexual harassment law</a>, as evidence of their strong stand against sexual violence – which FIDH lambasts as “hypocrisy”. Mervat Tallawy, the outgoing head of the country’s <a href=\"http://ncwegypt.com/index.php/en/home\" title=\"\">National&nbsp;Women’s Council</a>, a governmental body charged with defending women’s rights, for example, famously observed that “it is impossible that a paramilitary organisation like the police would commit crimes of sexual violence in Egyptian prisons.” The devil is in the detail; activists point out that most such abuse is, in fact, meted out by other agencies of the state security apparatus.</p> \n<p>On the other side, civil society is under pressure from all quarters, and matters are not helped by a rift between the Muslim Brotherhood and the wider community of NGOs, which makes independently documenting violations against the former all the more difficult. In any case, such is the sensitivity of publicly talking about sex that women are inclined to keep quiet about assault, often for the sake of family reputation. This is as true for domestic abuse as it is for state-sponsored violence. The&nbsp;national demographic and health survey released earlier this month, for example, found that upwards of 30% of wives in Egypt under the age of 50 have experienced some form of spousal&nbsp;violence, yet less than 5% sought help outside the family.</p> \n<p>For those in power, sexual torture is an easy weapon to brutalise its victims; rape videos, for example, taken by officers on their mobile phones, are an especially potent brand of sexual blackmail and have a curious way of turning up on the internet. The very threat of these and other reprisals is often enough to deter victims from seeking redress from a legal system that is not exactly sympathetic to their&nbsp;claims in the first place.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d4d3905e1e8cfa59d642e9fd7c6d9bd8f8d29d9d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431968364430/65106fa3-8395-48e9-bd14-69ec3d0c2982-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Egypt's riot police head to Tahrir Square in Cairo in November 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Egypt’s riot police head to Tahrir Square in Cairo in November 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amr Dalsh/Reuters/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If only a fraction of the accounts in the report were true, they would still constitute a damning indictment of the current regime, but with his approval ratings soaring above 80%, it is unlikely to dent President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi’s popularity at home. Egyptians, generally speaking, crave stability, which is why the 2011 uprisings were so unexpected, and why the vast majority have rallied around the latest strongman promising them a return to solid ground after years of upheaval.</p> \n<p>For the most part, Egypt’s sharp rise in sexual violence in public spaces has been inflicted on its women; in 2013, a government study found that 99.3% of Egyptian women reported being harassed at some point in their lives. From widespread street-based harassment to the more than 600 recorded instances of mob rape in Tahrir Square during the 2011 uprisings, it is they who are bearing the&nbsp;brunt of the brutality without real&nbsp;relief in sight.</p> \n<p>Most Egyptians I know, if not actively condoning the repression of those who jeopardise their last great hope of stability, are willing to turn a blind eye to the arbitrary arrests, mass detentions and questionable sentencing of those who are seen as threatening the system. My Egyptian grandmother had a saying for this philosophy: “So long as it is away from my ass, I don’t care.” In the case of state-sponsored sexual violence,&nbsp;this&nbsp;seems&nbsp;sadly true.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431967063020/Mural-of-people-killed-du-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A mural near Tahrir Square in Cairo, depicting people killed during Egypt's uprising.

I have planned it not in a way that I expected any government authorities in the world would accept. I have planned an ideal city – a city that meets my ideal of the city of the future.” </p> \n<p>Those were the words of Walter Burley Griffin, the young American architect who won a competition to design the new Australian capital city, Canberra, in 1912. The idealistic Griffin, along with his professional and life partner Marion Mahony, spent the next eight years tied in knots by politicians and bureaucrats determined to prevent his vision from becoming a reality. <br /></p> \n<p>Griffin resigned from the project in 1920 without having created a single building, and little of his plan was put into effect, aside from a few roads and a lake. Yet the influence of Griffin and Mahony’s work pervades Australia’s most significant public building, the Parliament House created by Romaldo Giurgola almost 70 years later. <br /></p> \n<p>Griffin and Mahony believed fervently in Australia’s potential as a young and bold democracy. Griffin declared that the new capital – to be located in bushland between Sydney and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/apr/06/the-royal-exhibition-building-of-marvellous-melbourne-a-history-of-cities-in-50-buildings-day-10\">Melbourne</a> – presented a unique opportunity for a totally planned city. He said, “This virgin city under unified control … is in a position to exact unity in plan and homogeneity in expression and harmony with the whole natural environment.”<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf040a11917d38817988e49c5718de0d9e18a6f8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431512948161/0fb164ab-9882-4944-b40c-5a76f527aa02-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"View of Parliament House from a hot air balloon.

The building is integrated within the hill in order to put ‘the people above the parliament’.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Their design ingeniously mapped a geometric plan of key buildings and main avenues on to the existing topography of mountains, hills and the river. Although Griffin was officially hired by the Australian government as federal capital director of design and construction, he readily acknowledged Mahony as responsible for “much more than half” of the plan.</p> \n<p>The opposition of bureaucrats and frequent changes of government didn’t help Griffin; nor did the first world war, which focussed the nation’s attention elsewhere. One of the revolving door of ministers, William Archibald, accused Griffin of “grand theorising, moonshine and dreaming”, and eventually Griffin quit in despair. A temporary Parliament House was built by the Commonwealth Department of Works and Housing – though not at the location Griffin had planned.<br /></p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Griffin and Mahony’s idea became known in architectural circles. One of those who admired it was a young Italian, Romaldo Giurgola, who saw an illustration of the Canberra plan on a classroom wall in Rome. <br /></p> \n<p>Fast-forward several decades, and the nation decided it was time to build a new Parliament House to mark the <a href=\"http://www.australiaday.org.au/australia-day/history/1988-the-bicentenary/\">bicentenary of European settlement in 1988</a>, with Giurgola’s firm Mitchell-Giurgola Arhictects winning the design competition.</p> \n<p>Like Griffin and Mahony, Giurgola believed that buildings must be in harmony with the natural environment. He saw Canberra as “a symbolic place, an art form which could survive only if harmoniously related with the configurations of the land”. Giurgola’s proposed Parliament House was not a monument imposed on the landscape and the citizens, but was integrated within a hill, thus putting the people above the parliament.</p> \n<p>The building is packed with overt symbols of national identity. The huge forecourt mosaic – <a href=\"http://www.aph.gov.au/Visit_Parliament/Parliament_House_Art_Collection/Architectural_Commissions/Forecourt_mosaic\">Possum and Wallaby Dreaming</a> – was designed by <a href=\"http://www.redrockgallery.net/pages/Michael-Minjina-Nelson-Tjakamarra.html\">Papunya artist Michael Nelson Jagamara</a>, and the building’s 23-hectare landscape includes an indigenous garden. Inside, there are more than 5,000 works by leading Australian artists and craftspeople. These are not simply additions to the building, but an integral part of it.</p> \n<p>Like Griffin and Mahony, Giurgola has an optimistic view of the city. “I certainly cannot think of the Parliament House without Canberra,” <a href=\"http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/publications/papers-and-podcasts/designing-canberra/giurgola-guida-berg.aspx\">he told an interviewer</a>, in 2010. “It presented to me this notion of simplicity, order, relation with the natural environment … Canberra has been growing with this kind of principle all the time.”<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fc5e11afcd2b3c73a77ce28a68c633e7bd4e6a6e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431428968534/430fdac6-77a6-41db-b310-5873a2308ad2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"‘The building is packed with overt symbols of national identity’.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The building is packed with overt symbols of national identity.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Auspic</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nevertheless, Canberra today has an incoherent feel, with buildings scattered far apart in seemingly random places, lacking the unity that was originally proposed. On a more mundane level, the standard cliche is that Canberra is “boring”, with its endless quiet low-rise suburban streets, and its empty city thoroughfares. On the other hand, Canberrans speak fondly of how easy it is to get around – unlike the gridlock of Sydney and Melbourne. <br /></p> \n<p>“It was a utopia of sorts,” Eve, a friend who grew up in Canberra, tells me. “I lived in public housing and went to a state school with the children of cleaners and the children of diplomats all together. Everything felt accessible, not like the class system you get in Sydney and Melbourne. My mum was able to go to university and qualify as an economist while she was raising me by herself. I rode to school every day from the age of 10; there was no traffic and life was easy. But an outsider doesn’t see any of this, and they’re often blind to the social stratification and ghettoisation in their own cities.”</p> \n<p>As for Parliament House, Eve remembers it as a place where she and her friends would, after nights out as teenagers, roll down the grassy slopes under the tolerant eye of a lone security guard. There aren’t too many parliament buildings in the world where you can roll on the roof, and it sounds like the kind of pursuit of which the building’s designer would certainly approve.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Which other buildings in the world tell stories about urban history? <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/mar/23/50-buildings-great-stories-urban-history\">Share your own pictures and descriptions with GuardianWitness</a>, on Twitter and Instagram using #hoc50 or let us know suggestions in the comments below</em></li> \n</ul>","section":"Cities","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431512806957/fff0a996-fa59-4890-b3d4-5c311daca5a0-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dan Breckwoldt/Alamy/Alamy","altText":"Canberra’s Parliament House was built to mark the bicentenary of European settlement in 1988.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dan Breckwoldt/Alamy/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431512948576/0fb164ab-9882-4944-b40c-5a76f527aa02-2060x1374.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1374,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"View of Parliament House from a hot air balloon.

Even if it’s flawed, or turns out to be not what you expected.” Mary Kelly would know. As one of the world’s foremost feminist artists, she has pursued hers relentlessly for 45 years. It gives her a long view of the feminist movement that is refreshingly upbeat. “Something very wonderful has happened. If you look at how men engage with their children, it’s totally different. My husband Ray was the only man with a child in a backpack at the big demonstrations in the 70s. He used to get wolf-whistled picking our son up from school.”</p> \n<p>When she started out, just getting heard required a shock to the system. In the mid-70s, her installation at the ICA, Post-Partum Document, analysed her newborn son’s development, their emotional bond, his early attempts at writing – and framed and hung his stained nappies on the gallery walls. “On display at the ICA … dirty nappies!” ran the Standard’s outraged headline.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5b5a57981abf52c8853ca2160a498efab604d53f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431958924531/51acd1f4-a0fd-4cdf-8b0c-f41df861d6e1-460x372.jpeg\" alt=\"Shock of the soiled ...

Mary Kelly’s artwork Post-Partum Document became a tabloid scandal in the 70s.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But Kelly was less interested in provoking the tabloids than adding a new voice to conceptual art. Something was missing, she felt, from the work made by these mostly male Americans up to that point. Her companion piece Antepartum, a looped film of her pregnant abdomen with her child kicking beneath the skin, hammered this point home. Today, it’s shown alongside minimalists such as <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/artanddesign/serra\">Richard Serra</a> or <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2004/jan/17/art2\">Donald Judd</a>, only hers is a minimalism with a human relationship at its core.</p> \n<p>It may have been Kelly’s education that led her to challenge the establishment. She began conventionally, studying painting outside Florence. But her first job was in Beirut at the American-Lebanese University, where she met francophone intellectuals and pored over the ideas of Sartre and Lacan. When war arrived in Lebanon, she moved to Paris, just in the time for the protests of ’68. From there to London, for postgrad work at St Martin’s art school. The atmosphere in London added the final piece of her radical makeup: she joined a commune, met her husband Ray, also an artist, and entered the women’s movement – an experience she describes as utterly transformative.</p> \n<p>Today she and Ray share an immaculate white house in the hills of Bel Air. They greet us at the door, and she surprises the photographer by taking his hand to show him around. I follow Ray into the living room, which looks like a fine exhibition of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/artanddesign/bauhaus\">Bauhaus</a> furniture.

Her hair is arranged in a beautiful crown, like something a Dutch master would paint. Now in her 70s, she remains cutting-edge, and speaks fluently of social media, screengrabs and drone warfare. Perhaps her only tell is the critical theory that peppers her speech. The Post-Partum work was “overdetermined”, she says, by her pregnancy during an earlier work, <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/sisterhood/clips/activism/campaigns-and-protests/143934.html\">Nightcleaners</a> – a study of the women cleaning London office buildings. The groups involved in that project give a real flavour of the time. She was part of a women’s-lib cadre called the History Group, and was assigned to work with the Berwick Street film collective to support unionisation. Nightcleaners was intended as a propaganda film, but became a seminal work of documentary art.</p> \n<p>“The women took those jobs because they had to look after the children during the day. That began what we called the sexual-social division of labour that underpinned inequality.” But Kelly felt that the male-dominated labour movement was failing to see the real issue. “It wasn’t as simple as having someone else take care of the children. You had to understand what the pleasure was in the relationship with the child.”</p> \n<p>She seized on the idea of non-essentialist feminism, that a woman’s place shouldn’t be physically determined, but created by her experiences. The Post-Partum Document is an analysis not just of all a mother is, but the process by which she becomes those things. Suddenly those dirty nappies seem less shock tactic and more reality check.</p> \n<p>Kelly’s work has always retained its personal, emotional payload. For some years, her primary medium has been lint – you know, from a tumble dryer. Like the dirty nappies, the material can seem like an invitation to scoff, but it’s designed to emphasise the workaday. Dryer lint is, of course, more familiar to most people than bronze, canvas or oils. The sad humour is there, too: she uses the fluff to make ephemeral war memorials, which often display the words of victims of violence. Kelly is painstaking in her attempts to articulate these voices. In a recent work, Dicere, she prints the testimony of two Afghan children whose grandmother was killed in a drone attack. “They had these phrases that you couldn’t translate easily from the Urdu,” she says. “Like, ‘She was the string that holds pearls together.’ The language does something very important to me.’’</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"400965a354f724f5d248daab006d2c97e76186a3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431960313298/d22ad198-1b8e-416b-af91-0d2404727abd-460x432.jpeg\" alt=\"Circa 1968, a 2004 lintwork by Mary Kelly\" width=\"460\" height=\"432\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emotional payload ...

I imagine a team of assistants manning banks of machines, but Kelly corrects me. “I wish there were,” she says, “but it’s just a peculiarity of this one” and she points to the laundry room just beyond her studio.</p> \n<p>I ask her if it’s all been worthwhile. Despite the protest movement, decades of political art and legislation, perhaps the victims of injustice have merely changed. If she were to make Nightcleaners now, wouldn’t the people be immigrants, lower paid, and no closer to unionisation? “Well, nothing is ever finally solved,” she says. “One would be crazy to think so.”</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/talks-and-lectures/mary-kelly-conversation-hans-ulrich-obrist\">Mary Kelly in conversation with Hans Ulrich Obrist</a> is at Tate Modern, 22 May 2015</li> \n</ul>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431958219920/51a63193-0148-454b-8d16-8d6649675877-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Barry J.

It’s my house now. I’m a successful Hollywood screenwriter and when I’m not going to important meetings and attending screenings I’m floating around in my “wet-edge infinity pool” (whatever that means) and enjoying the entirely redundant warmth from my outdoor fireplace. I can’t say I am particularly keen on the gigantic Jeff Koons-style flower that dominates the courtyard but I sometimes like to pretend I’m living in a giant’s house as I sip on a spinach, chia seed and soy smoothie and admire the lights of the city twinkling in the distance below me. Best of all, it’s only six miles from my boyfriend <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/george-clooney-gives-us-a-tour-inside-his-sprawling-la-home-2012-2?op=1&amp;IR=T\">George Clooney’s house in Studio City</a>.

Well, me actually, because I’m not so great with heights. But I’ll make an exception for this Swedish property, situated in a forest in the north of the country, which is called the <a href=\"http://treehotel.se/birdsnest\">Bird’s Nest</a> for obvious reasons.</p> \n<p>Living in a treehouse requires resourcefulness, so in the spirit of Grayson Perry I have created a fictional character who lives here. Rainbow Moonbeam (given name Christine) is an ecowarrior, although protesting is quite tiring, so she’s come to the forest for some me-time. She grows her own food, which is much harder than she thought it would be, and when night draws in, she writes a blog about foraging (there are so many interesting berries in the forest, it turns out) on her brand new Macbook Air, a present from her retired, Surrey-based parents who insist she email them every week. It runs off her nifty solar charger, of course.</p> \n<h2><strong>Luxury houseboat, Berlin: watery city style<br /></strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fda9c0bb03b6b646984d01099453f25db9036bb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431953237100/141fe2c9-c7a9-4365-a82b-4a52030804f9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Luxury houseboat, Berlin.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The luxury houseboat on Lake Rummelsburg in Germany’s capital has a dishwasher and a fireplace.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Welcome Beyond/PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong> </strong>Living on a houseboat in the city has always seemed an incredibly romantic notion to me.

Cramped quarters.</p> \n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.themodernhouse.net/holiday-lets/the-modern-houseboat-berlin/\">luxury Berlin houseboat</a> solves all these problems, with mod cons including a shower room, dishwasher and, most importantly, a fireplace at your disposal. The sleek and serene home is, I feel, an ideal base for a historian, well respected in his field. He’s put his recent divorce behind him, and is feeling good about life. He teaches history and cultural studies at the Freie Universit&auml;t and in the evenings works on his new book, a time-travel thriller about a divorced historian turned spy who singlehandedly stops the second world war and alters the course of world history. Yes, it’s a slight change of direction, but living on the water is so freeing, no?</p> \n<h2><strong>Impruneta Castle, Florence: suits of armour optional</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f18f21d6da245937086b31adca5de801cb214ef8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431953280512/18a991c5-2af8-40b2-b5fa-2666d45d77b0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Impruneta Castle, Florence.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Impruneta Castle, on Florence’s outskirts in Italy, was built in 964.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aylesford International</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong> </strong>Why not just go the whole hog and live in a castle? <a href=\"http://www.tuscanyeliteaccommodations.com/uk/IMPRUNETA/Castle-Impruneta-ca.html\">Impruneta Castle</a>, on the outskirts of Florence, was built in 964 as a military garrison, and will certainly impress your friends and neighbours.

No electricity, obviously, and only the most basic of plumbing, but that’s the point isn’t it?
