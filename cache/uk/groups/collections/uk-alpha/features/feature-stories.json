The British romcom, typified by Richard Curtis and his Working Title collaborations, was our most reliably profitable cinematic export for a considerable – some might say interminable – time. As well as packing UK cinemas, the films were big hits abroad (the global take for the 2003 film <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/love-actually\">Love Actually</a> was<a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=loveactually.htm\"> $247m</a> (&pound;158m), <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/bridget-jones-diary\">Bridget Jones’ Diary</a> (2001), <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=bridgetjonessdiary.htm\">$282m</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/notting-hill\">Notting Hill</a> (1999), <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=nottinghill.htm\">$364m</a>) and led to <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/hughgrant\">Hugh Grant</a> becoming every American’s idea of what to expect from a British man. Inevitably, disappointment followed.</p> \n<p>“In the UK – and many international markets – the Working Title films did so well because they were, by and large, well made, and the company was in business with Hugh Grant, a bona fide superstar,” says Jeremy Kay, US editor of <a href=\"http://www.screendaily.com/\">Screen Daily</a>.</p> \n<p>The films even scored at the Oscars, with <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/four-weddings-and-a-funeral\">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a> wooing its way to a surprise best picture nomination in 1994 and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/renee-zellweger\">Ren&eacute;e Zellweger</a> getting a nod for best actress in 2001 for playing the wine-guzzling, diary-keeping singleton. But after a string of hits, the kisses dried up and our affection for the subgenre waned. American stars still tried their luck – Kirsten Dunst in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,4267,1311098,00.html\">Wimbledon</a> (2004), Brittany Murphy in<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qmiH4ROTtA\"> Love and Other Disasters</a> (2006) and, as recently as 2013, Anna Faris in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/151173/i-give-it-a-year\">I Give It a Year</a> – but the appetite had evaporated and middling box office results led to fewer and fewer being greenlit, let alone released.</p> \n<p>This year’s <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/man-up\">Man Up</a>, starring Simon Pegg and Lake Bell, hasn’t even made it to &pound;2m in the UK, while Karen Gillan’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2013/oct/10/not-another-happy-ending-review\">Not Another Happy Ending</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/oct/26/love-rosie-review-overwrought-tale-missed-chances\">Love, Rosie</a>, which stars Lily Collins and Sam Claflin, have been even less fortunate. Even <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/about-time\">About Time</a>, Richard Curtis’s much-publicised return to the genre in 2013, only made it to &pound;7.5m domestically, a far cry from the glory days of Notting Hill’s &pound;30.4m UK total.</p> \n<p>But what’s turning off both studios and audiences? In part, it’s a leading-man problem. When Grant abandoned the British romcom for a set of less successful American alternatives, from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2009/dec/31/did-you-hear-about-the-morgans-review\">Did You Hear About the Morgans?</a> to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/video/2014/oct/09/hugh-grant-the-rewrite-video-interview\">The Rewrite</a>, he left a foppish hole in his wake. Attempts have been made to plug it, from Rafe Spall to Domhnall Gleeson to Pegg, but Grant’s schtick has proved surprisingly difficult to replicate.</p> \n<p>“For a while after Four Weddings, much of the successful Working Title output was built around Hugh,” says Ben Roberts, director of the BFI film fund, a body whose coffers have long proved vital to the genre. “I think we are all still looking for someone who has that huge and instant broad appeal and can be an international film star.”</p> \n<p>The British archetype of the self-deprecating, slightly stuttery toff is still in rotation, but modern iterations, from Benedict Cumberbatch to Eddie Redmayne, are far too busy playing history-changing code-breakers and physicists to worry about dinner-party faux pas.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aeead23d161a5f64b4ad2b41c4f292aae369b4e3\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/aeead23d161a5f64b4ad2b41c4f292aae369b4e3/0_0_2920_1753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hugh Grant, pictured here in Notting Hill, has been surprisingly difficult to replace as a leading man.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugh Grant, pictured here in Notting Hill, has been surprisingly difficult to replace as a leading man.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polygram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The dearth of British romantic comedies is also a reflection of the expanding nature of the domestic film industry. For a while, romcoms and sub-Guy Ritchie <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/apr/02/gangsters-geezers-and-guns-the-men-behind-britains-booming-low-budget-crime-flick-industry\">gangster flicks</a> were the surest way to pack ’em in. But times changed and ambitions shifted. The British film industry now acts much more like Hollywood, its remit embracing action blockbusters such as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2015/jan/27/is-kingsman-the-most-conservative-comedy-this-century\">Kingsman: The Secret Service</a>, teen comedies such as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/aug/10/the-inbetweeners-hapless-stars-see-ourselves\">The Inbetweeners movies</a> and The Woman in Black <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/dec/25/woman-in-black-2-angel-of-death-review\">horror franchise</a>. “There’s a return to a satisfyingly broad perception of our creative chops,” says Kay. “We’ve always made diverse content, but, for a while, these romcoms became synonymous with the cultural identity of British cinema because the brilliant minds at Working Title found extraordinary success with the genre and knew better than anyone else in the UK how to get their movies seen by a global audience.”</p> \n<p>But, he says, a more crowded field led to “an explosion of quality content” that’s seen a more diverse distribution of talent. “In recent years we’ve seen the rise of other savvy, well-connected UK producers such as Marv Films, See-Saw, Warp and Rook. They’re championing daring young film-makers who have also caught the attention of Hollywood and its global distribution and marketing machine. British directors, producers and writers, not just actors, are very hot in Hollywood right now.”</p> \n<p>Roberts, who is responsible for overseeing the BFI’s lottery investments in film production, also puts the shift away from romcoms down to a more simple element: money. “I think there is something about the sheer time and expense of writing and testing and tweaking and cutting and testing again that is not always affordable or just too exposing and fraught for an independent film,” he says.</p> \n<p>Of course, it’s not just British romcoms that are in trouble. The genre is suffering a downward tailspin that has seen big names from Drew Barrymore to Emily Blunt fail to set the box office alight. The last film in the genre to make more than $100m in the US was 2011’s Adam Sandler/Jennifer Aniston hit <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2011/feb/10/just-go-with-it-review\">Just Go With It</a>, a film described by the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw as “dispiritingly awful”.</p> \n<p>Writer and director Ol Parker, who was behind 2005’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/112957/imagine.me.and.you\">Imagine Me and You</a>, a same-sex spin on the British romantic comedy, thinks it’s a familiarity problem. “The structure and formula are now so well-known that it’s become very hard for the film-maker not to commit the cardinal sin: letting the audience get ahead of the film,” he says. “So it takes some real sparkle – of which I thought Man Up had plenty, especially in the writing – to keep the viewer enjoying a by-now predictable journey.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5755845e7bfd6a507baa0c70b6381403fbb969b\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e5755845e7bfd6a507baa0c70b6381403fbb969b/0_129_2745_1646/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ren&eacute;e Zellweger received an Oscar nomination for her role in the 2001 film Bridget Jones’ Diary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ren&eacute;e Zellweger received an Oscar nomination for her role in the 2001 film Bridget Jones’ Diary.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Working Title</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Romance films of late have been largely humourless, from this year’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/feb/11/fifty-shades-of-grey-review\">slavery love story Fifty Shades of Grey </a>to the monotonous procession of Nicholas Sparks adaptations that prioritise soft lighting and teary confessions over tickling the funny bone. Last year’s most successful comedies, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/jun/05/22-jump-street-review-channing-tatum-jonah-hill-peter-bradshaw\">22 Jump Street</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/may/02/bad-neighbours-review-zac-efron-seth-rogen\">Bad Neighbours</a>, both placed romance far down their list of priorities, and this summer’s <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/pitch-perfect-2\">Pitch Perfect </a>and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/ted-2\">Ted</a> sequels are also far more interested in silliness than swooning.</p> \n<p>“These are cynical times,” Parker said. “Some of the romcoms I thought worked best in recent years were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/131231/500-days-of-summer\">500 Days of Summer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/150005/celeste-and-jesse-forever\">Celeste and Jesse Forever</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/like-crazy\">Like Crazy</a>, all of which reject the standard happy-ever-after formula. We all try to make films in keeping with the times. And the times right now just aren’t that romantic.”</p> \n<p>The best recent British romantic comedy wasn’t even a film. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/20/catastrophe-review-sharon-horgan-rob-delaney-channel-4\">Catastrophe</a>, which uses, and refreshes, many familiar genre tropes, was a six-part Channel 4 series, yet it felt like the contemporary update the traditional Working Title formula has been desperately in need of. Given the relatively low profile of the leads Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan, it might have struggled as a theatrical release but strong word-of-mouth made it a minor hit on the small screen (and via Amazon Prime in the US).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58fabb6041adb31abf4372ba967b06b5a15c87ba\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/58fabb6041adb31abf4372ba967b06b5a15c87ba/0_0_1207_724/1000.jpg\" alt=\"This year’s Man Up, with Simon Pegg and Lake Bell, hasn’t enjoyed anything like the box office success that British romcoms were once guaranteed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This year’s Man Up, with Simon Pegg and Lake Bell, hasn’t enjoyed anything like the box office success that British romcoms were once guaranteed.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The added running time also allowed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jan/14/sharon-horgan-rob-delaney-catastrophe-sitcom\">Catastrophe</a> to explore its loose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/119558/knocked.up\">Knocked Up</a>-style premise with more depth and messiness, offsetting what can be seen as a shallow and uncomplicated genre with a hint of realism. For now, the small screen might be the safest place for the genre.</p> \n<p>“The studios are focusing more than ever on tentpoles based on franchises, superheroes, animation, female comedies, action and horror,” says Kay. “That’s what is working at the box office, so other genres are getting squeezed out a bit. But they’ll come back, and there will always be one-off hits from outlier genres.”</p> \n<p>Parker believes it’s just a case of stepping up to the plate. He’s just a writer/director, standing in front of an industry, asking it to try harder, he says. “The solution, as with all things, is to do it better. To find new ways to tell a familiar story. The genre isn’t dead, it just presents a challenge. But if we get it right, people will still want it.”</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4dd0d971660011b65f2ba1b4ceb406e258991cc9/0_54_2720_1630/2720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1630,"width":2720,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"c.Universal/Everett / Rex Featur/c.Universal/Everett / Rex Featur","altText":"435119w<br>UK, EIRE, TURKEY, SOUTH AFRICA, HONG KONG, CROATIA ONLY No Merchandising.

Val was the youngest of eight children, who slept in one partitioned room. His father was a man with a drink problem but also a great deal of wisdom who, on his deathbed, told the 14-year-old Val that he was not the hero his son thought him to be, and that he would prefer to tell the boy so himself.</p> \n<p>At six, Val played in the school band, and later his brother John taught him to play the mandolin. Although his education at De La Salle college, Waterford, ended when his father died, and Val had to go to work in an orange box factory, he was sustained by his musical interests, by the determination of his older siblings and by a belief that life would hold more for him.</p> \n<p>He started entertaining at fetes with a friend, Bruce Clarke, who played the piano and guitar. In 1947, the two had their first professional engagement, playing in a seaside hotel. The son of a well-off foundry manager, Clarke was to have a significant influence on Doonican’s rise. He put up the money for both of them to make a promotional record and wrote in to Radio &Eacute;ireann asking for an audition, which led to their first broadcasts and appearances on a Dublin radio show. Clarke also lent Doonican &pound;20 to buy a Gibson guitar.</p> \n<p>The pair became regulars on radio, in the theatre and in dance halls, sometimes as a duo, sometimes as solo artists. But by 1951 the apparently laid-back Doonican was tiring of Dublin and Ireland. He became a member of the Four Ramblers, which took him to England for a regular slot on the BBC radio series Riders of the Range. He wrote the music for their first shows and stayed with them for 10 years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/gallery/2015/jul/02/val-doonican-a-life-in-pictures\">Val Doonican - a life in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A frequent performer at US air force bases, on one visit he found his appearance was advertised as the Val Doonican Show. Initially alarmed, he grew to enjoy this star billing. At the end of the 1950s, he wanted another change and joined a concert tour with <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-anthony-newley-1087464.html\" title=\"\">Anthony Newley</a>, opening in Manchester, where he met his future wife, the cabaret artist Lynnette Rae. They married in 1962 and had two daughters. It was on the Newley tour that his solo act emerged. At one cast party, everyone had to do a turn, and Doonican borrowed a Spanish guitar, perched on a stool and sang an Irish song. Newley asked him if he had ever considered something of the sort on radio or TV.</p> \n<p>The influential producer Richard Afton auditioned the singing guitarist and presented him as one of the musical interludes in the radio comedy show Variety Bandbox. When Doonican was given a 15-minute spot for anecdotes and songs, he approached the BBC’s head of light music and explained that he needed a regular engagement to make going solo financially secure. He was rewarded with 13 half-hours.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x76tT_oCeI\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3x76tT_oCeI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Val Doonican – Paddy McGinty’s Goat\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Radio listeners tended to assume he was an older man; surely no young person would sing numbers such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KqnPvFiu3M\" title=\"\">Paddy McGinty’s Goat</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1Ofhh30lwQ\" title=\"\">Delaney’s Donkey</a>?

During the boom years of the mid-60s, he had five top 10 hits: Walk Tall (1964), The Special Years (1965), Elusive Butterfly (1966), What Would I Be (1966) and If the Whole World Stopped Loving (1967). His TV show, The Val Doonican Show, which began in 1965, was the launchpad for other rising stars, including the comedian <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/2005/mar/12/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Dave Allen</a>.</p> \n<p>Doonican made an unsuccessful foray across the Atlantic in the early 70s and complained that US television had tried to “slick him up”. After The Val Doonican Music Show ended in 1986, he&nbsp;would find much British TV too brash. He took to doing afternoon live shows which, he said, “suit me and my ageing fans ... we can all be home well before bedtime”.</p> \n<p>He always insisted that he was not a show-biz person and had gone into the profession because of his love of music. “We are not as important to the outside world as we are sometimes led to believe,” he told the Stage in 2010. “It’s best never to assume that the next engagement will be easy, or that at last you’ve arrived. We are simply a little light relief.”</p> \n<p>His records sold in the millions – he recorded more than 50 albums, including Val Doonican Rocks, But Gently (1967), with which he was the first Irish artist to enter the UK albums charts – and he released a video, Songs From My Sketch Book (1990).</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jul/02/singer-val-doonican-dies-aged-88\">Singer Val Doonican dies aged 88</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He made three Royal Variety Show appearances, won awards including BBC television personality of the year in 1966, and wrote two volumes of autobiography, The Special Years (1980) and Walking Tall (1985).

Red tulips, symbols of love and mourning, are strewn over the vehicles.</p> \n<p>Like other Iranian memorials, this one tends to the grandiloquent, a sign praising the “great historic confrontation of faith and heresy, and the historical movement emanating from the will and determination against the cruelty of global arrogance headed by the US and Zionism”. The scientists were all killed by agents of Israel’s intelligence agency, the Mossad, it states.</p> \n<p>“I feel very sad,” said Fateme, a young Azeri woman sitting on a bench in front of the cars. “These were fathers who went to work and never came home.

The way they killed them in front of their houses on their way to work shows that they were not safe – even in their own country.”</p> \n<p>Fateme, like millions of her compatriots, is hoping to see a nuclear agreement emerge from the Vienna talks, despite the legacy of deep mistrust of the US. But she has begun to worry that it may not happen after this week’s warning by Barack Obama not to try to change the framework agreement reached in Lausanne in April. “Really we are suffering,” she said. Her husband lost his job in a cotton factory as the rial plummeted against the dollar two years ago.</p> \n<p>Official reverence is matched by a determination to resist too many concessions in the nuclear negotiations. Iranian officials have repeatedly claimed the scientists were assassinated after being interviewed by officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN’s nuclear watchdog, arguing that it cannot be trusted to carry out inspections of sensitive sites. There was no immediate comment from the IAEA on the claim that it had interviewed the targeted scientists, and the agency does not customarily reveal the names of people it talks to as part of its inspections.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2015/jul/01/with-a-week-to-go-in-nuclear-talks-iran-wants-focus-on-sanctions-relief\">With a week to go in nuclear talks, Iran wants focus on sanctions relief</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For Sadegh Zibakalam, a Tehran university professor and a rare public critic of the nuclear programme, the scientists’ memorial fits seamlessly into a broader Iranian narrative of resistance. “The state wants to glorify those heroic strugglers against the western powers to show that we have been through much trouble and misery and we did not give in,” he said.</p> \n<p>Still, as in any society, there are limits to respect for the dead. “Not that many people come to see these cars,” said a security guard at the museum. “In the evenings, most people go to the gardens and to the lake where there are Iranian shows.

Now scientists have concluded that we could be heading for an equally dramatic cosmic finale: the Big Rip.</p> \n<p>A new theoretical model suggests that as the universe expands, everything, from galaxies, planets and atomic particles to space-time itself, will eventually be torn apart before vanishing from view.</p> \n<p>There’s no need for immediate alarm, however: the extreme sequence of events is predicted for around 22 billion years from now.</p> \n<p>Dr Marcelo Disconzi, the mathematician who led the work at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, said: “The idea of the Big Rip is that eventually even the constituents of matter would start separating from each other. You’d be seeing all the atoms being ripped apart ... it’s fair to say that it’s a dramatic scenario.”</p> \n<p>Scientists are now fairly convinced that the universe began with the Big Bang, around 13.8 billion years ago – starting at a pinpoint of incredibly high density and expanding to what we have today.</p> \n<p>But our ultimate cosmic destiny is still the subject of intense debate.</p> \n<p>“The only thing we definitely know is that the universe is expanding and that the rate is accelerating,” said Disconzi. “That’s about the only thing we know for sure.”</p> \n<p>The latest work suggests that this acceleration may become faster and faster until every point in space itself is moving apart at an infinite rate – at which point the Big Rip occurs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67f19b2f4883934b6b5c099b64d985cef602438b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435853966814/21315b55-d766-4e84-b5fb-e25e8bea2890-460x355.jpeg\" alt=\"The timeline of the universe, from Big Bang to Big Rip, according to the new theory.\" width=\"460\" height=\"355\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The timeline of the universe, from Big Bang to Big Rip, according to the new theory.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy Teaford, Vanderbilt University</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> “Mathematically we know what this means,” said Disconzi. “But what it actually means in physical terms is hard to fathom.”</p> \n<p>The evidence for an accelerating expansion comes from observations of distant supernovae. The further away they are the redder they appear, because the light has been stretched out as it travels through space to reach us.</p> \n<p>To explain this increasing rate of expansion, scientists have come up with a cosmological placeholder, known as dark energy, which is believed to make up about 70% of the content of the universe.</p> \n<p>“It’s the physicists’ way to hide their ignorance by giving it a mysterious name,” said Professor Carlos Frenk, a cosmologist at the University of Durham. “We don’t have any physically compelling way to explain it.”</p> \n<p>Whether the universe’s expansion continues to speed up or gradually eases off comes down to a sort of gladiatorial battle between two opposing cosmic forces.</p> \n<p> “You have this competition between dark energy, that tries to expand the universe, and gravity, that tends to make it collapse again,” said Disconzi. The question is who wins?”</p> \n<p>Under the gravity wins scenario, known as the Big Crunch, the expansion eventually slows down and a kind of reverse of the Big Bang occurs.</p> \n<p>But scientists have been shifting in favour of a situation called the Big Freeze where the universe continues to expand, eventually growing so vast that supplies of gas become too thin for new stars to form and a thin soup of radiation is left. Eventually this cools down to the point where time loses any meaning because nothing happens any more.</p> \n<p>The latest work suggests that we could be heading for less a gentle finale, and predicts that dark energy wins out in the most dramatic possible fashion.</p> \n<p>The paper, published in the journal <a href=\"http://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.91.043532\">Physical Review D</a>, refines current models by finding a more consistent way to account for a property called bulk viscosity, a measure of a fluid’s ability to expand or contract. In this case, the fluid is the universe itself.</p> \n<p>Previously, according to Disconzi, viscosity had been included in the equations but in a way that predicted that under certain conditions fluids could travel faster than light.</p> \n<p>“This is disastrously wrong, since it is well-proven that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light,” said Disconzi. </p> \n<p>The latest formulation gets rid of this inconsistency, but also gives a revised prediction of where the Universe is heading, suggesting that eventually the expansion of the universe will accelerate at an infinite rate.</p> \n<p>“A Big Rip scenario is a natural consequence of the equations,” said Disconzi.</p> \n<p>One way to think of the lead-up to the event, is a speeding car that goes 10mph faster for every mile it travels. But the rate of acceleration gradually increases until it goes 10mph faster for every half mile, and then every quarter of a mile and eventually every foot. Ultimately, the front and the back bumpers tear apart from each other and then rip apart themselves.</p> \n<p>Whether this occurs in the cosmic version depends on how dark energy behaves in the distant future - a question that Frenk describes as the realm of pure speculation.</p> \n<p>“Under the rip scenario, dark energy gets stronger and you get this wild expansion that essentially rips space-time apart,” he added. “The universe would vanish in front of your eyes. Basically, you don’t want to be around for it.”</p> \n<p><br /></p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435853874782/b82bcd6a-c9e4-43c4-81f6-31386f2e292c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ace Stock Limited/Alamy","altText":"The end of the world (and indeed the universe) as we know it won’t be an explosion but a separation of the constituents of all matter, say scientists at Vanderbilt University.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ace Stock Limited/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435853967107/7aefb94d-ee19-4f0b-ae10-ff2cbdbfe880-1020x788.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":788,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The timeline of the universe, from Big Bang to Big Rip, according to the new theory.

It fronts a long sweep of the blue-green Atlantic to the east and finally peters out in the miasma of the Everglades swamp to the west and the necklace of the Florida Keys to the south.</p> \n<p>A young city (it was only incorporated in 1896 in what was then mostly wilderness), Miami is often said to have been founded on bootleg liquor and built its skyline on an infusion of cocaine money in the 70s and 80s (at the height of its cocaine wars in 1980 to 1981, the city had the world’s highest murder rate). Nearly 30 years ago, the crime writer Edna Buchanan wrote that Miami had been “a sleepy resort” that had transformed to attract “year-round ... concentrations of everything corrupt, bizarre or dangerous from everywhere in the world”.</p> \n<p>Above all, Miami is a place of exile where newcomers try to construct a new life. Upon arriving from Cuba in 1980, the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2001/jun/08/cuba.artsfeatures\">author Reinaldo Arenas</a> – who as a teenaged <em>barbudo</em> had fought with Castro’s forces but was then imprisoned and tortured both for being an independent intellectual and gay – declared Miami “a barren and pestiferous peninsula ... trying to become for a million exiles, the dream of a tropical island”. <br /></p> \n<p>No fan of the city, Arenas quickly decamped to New York, where he committed suicide in 1990. Miami, however, continued to percolate like a spoonful of Caf&eacute; Bustelo coffee from the cafe colada that residents traditionally drink every afternoon at 3:05 (the city’s area code). And it has become something more interesting than many had thought possible.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e0391ef7d1a99655d28cb1a90cd5b5941286201f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435790525725/809d01dd-580b-4ffa-8f14-83de6ae6554f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"An anti-Castro Cuban exile reacts after the announcement of restoring diplomatic ties between Cuba and United States, at an area knows as 'Little Havana' in downtown Miami, Florida December 17, 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Cuban exile in ‘Little Havana’ in Miami after the announcement of restored diplomatic ties between Cuba and the US. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barria/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In his office in West Miami near the city’s airport – a few blocks away from a branch of the city’s El Palacio de los Jugos Cuban eateries where the <em>pan con </em><em>lech&oacute;n</em> hints at the divine – Armando Valladares sits surrounded by photos of himself with political leaders: Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, Florida senator (and Miami native and presidential candidate) Marco Rubio.

Upon his release in 1982, he became a United States Ambassador to the United Nations. After residing in Washington for many years, he moved to Miami about 15 years ago.</p> \n<p>“The Cubans have demonstrated their ability and their quality of work here,” Valladares says. “It’s a unique case in the history of the United States where the identity of a city was born, in a sense, in another country.”</p> \n<p>The Cuban aspects of Miami’s identity appear to be far less monolithic than they once were, though.

In the 1960s, the city built the southern extension of Interstate 95 directly through the heart of the Overtown district, an area that had been a cultural mecca for black culture in the south. “Overtown was a very pleasant place,” says Enid Pinkney, the 83-year-old daughter of an immigrant from the Bahamas (one of the first non-indigenous communities to settle in Miami).</p> \n<p>Dispersed to other areas of the city, black residents often found themselves met with hostility.

Fatal police shootings touched off riots in the city at three other points during that decade. <br /></p> \n<p>Police departments throughout the county gained a reputation for violence and corruption that intervening years have done little to diminish, with Miami Beach police famously <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/aug/08/florida-teenager-taser-death-investigation\">fatally tasering teenage Colombian-American graffiti artist Israel Hernandez</a> in 2013. That same year, a report by the US Justice Department found that City of Miami police had “<a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-releases-investigative-findings-city-miami-police-department-and-officer\">engaged in a pattern or practice of excessive use of force</a> through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution” and that the department was tainted by “deficient tactics, improper actions by specialised units, as well as egregious delays and substantive deficiencies in deadly force investigations”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"970d504d4a123e2dca2623e97dde116fd510c023\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435316902630/2d367dc7-e523-455e-8f66-7d86f305cd2d-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"A mural of depicting Miami's Hispanic community, emblazoned with the words: 'Long live our race!'\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mural of depicting Miami’s Hispanic community, with the words: ‘Long live our race!’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Outside observers often remain mystified by Miami. Three years ago, the author Tom Wolfe attempted to capture it as he had <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2010/jan/10/bonfire-of-vanities-tom-wolfe\">1980s New York in The Bonfire of the Vanities</a>, and instead spewed forth a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2012/nov/04/tom-wolfe-back-blood-review\">right-wing caricature titled Back to Blood</a> that showed no grasp of the place the city has become. Such misconceptions are helped along by gaffe- and scandal-prone local politicians, whose peccadillos include everything from floating the idea to shut down all the city’s libraries to close a budget gap, to the by-now standard (for Miami) cash-for-favours schemes.</p> \n<p>In some areas, things have gone over the top. In South Beach – once a slum for retirees and poor immigrants, now a gay mecca and nightlife hotspot – crass commercialisation has resulted in a kind of Vegas-by-the-sea ambiance, with even the famed Lincoln Road, once a redoubt of local restaurants and retailers, now housing little more than chain stores and the bewildered tourists they prey upon. The preponderance of “juniors” (a derisive term for the rich scions of Latin America’s economic elite) in the city can be somewhat off-putting, as it seems not only the language and music of that elite is being imported, but their class system, as well.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The city has blossomed and has a new cultural heritage</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But the city has blossomed from the place that Reinaldo Arenas despised. The great <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Cabrera\">Cuban poet and anthropologist Lydia Cabrera</a>, who was during her lifetime one of the world’s foremost authorities on Afro-Cuban religion, spent the latter part of her life based in Miami, and donated her abundant collection of papers to the university here. It was home, too, for one of Haiti’s greatest poets, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Morisseau-Leroy\">F&eacute;lix Morisseau-Leroy</a>, for the last 17 years of his life. And, as testament to the city’s new cultural heritage, a new major institution, the <a href=\"http://www.pamm.org/\">P&eacute;rez Art Museum Miami</a>, opened next to the waters of Biscayne Bay in 2013; the <a href=\"https://www.artbasel.com/miami-beach\">Art Basel festival</a> attracts thousands to the city every year; and the <a href=\"http://www.miamibookfair.com/\">Miami Book Fair</a> is an autumn staple of the literary calendar.</p> \n<p>Perhaps more representative of the city than South Beach today are the northern reaches of Miami Beach, an area that is still home to many working-class residents despite spiralling property prices, where the lilting, almost Italianate sound of Argentine Spanish mixes with the caressing sounds of Brazilian Portuguese in the bodegas and on the beach. The <a href=\"http://buenosairesbakeryandcafe.com/\">Buenos Aires Bakery &amp; Cafe</a> – an establishment on Collins Avenue, only steps away from the sea – sells a variety of pastries that would make any <em>porte&ntilde;o</em> misty-eyed with nostalgia as well as several different kinds of the leafy, highly caffeinated <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(beverage)\">mate</a></em> beloved in South America, and does a brisk business. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d62350a140908e06f4135b40c55e7413fd61f8b4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435316451159/5a37c64c-a5d8-4338-b33f-286307da19d7-460x316.jpeg\" alt=\"Lucha Libre Star Blue Demon Jr waves the Mexican flag after winning a wrestling match in Miami.\" width=\"460\" height=\"316\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>Lucha libre</em> star Blue Demon Jr waves the Mexican flag after winning a wrestling match in Miami.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Joe Raedle</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When one drives south towards the Florida Keys – where the last island, Key West, is a mere 90 miles from Cuba – the county begins to descend into farmland. It was here that, in the early part of the 20th century, a Latvian-born eccentric named Edward Leedskalnin created an extraordinary structure known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Castle\">Coral Castle</a>, out of coral-formed limestone. As he worked alone and without advanced equipment, just how Leedskalnin created his “castle” remains something of a mystery – with explanations ranging from some secret mastery of the Earth’s magnetic field to telekinesis. </p> \n<p>Today, other dreams are played out in Miami-Dade’s fields, and exist in the imaginings of the many migrant workers who toil here, scant miles from the glittering high-rises of downtown Miami. Surrounded by fields of squash, okra, beans and tomatoes, the community of Homestead, despite its tropical locale, evokes the somnolent Midwestern communities of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ray-bradburyhttp://www.theguardian.com/books/ray-bradbury\">Ray Bradbury</a> story. Low-rise buildings, train tracks and empty playground swings greet the visitor, and in the street one hears the melange of accents and dialects from the agricultural workers here: Mexican, Guatemalan, Haitian, Jamaican. </p> \n<p>In the offices of the <a href=\"http://www.we-count.org/\">immigrant support group WeCount!</a> just off of North Krome Avenue (which shares its name with one of the US’s most infamous immigration detention centres located nearby), the connection between Homestead’s rural lushness and the city rising only a few miles away seems obvious.</p> \n<p>“The Mexicans are the ones that put the food on Miami’s table,” says Catalina Santiago, an 18-year-old high school student who came to the US with her agricultural-worker parents from the Mexican state of Oaxaca a decade ago. “But they are always spoken of in a condescending manner.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jul/11/miami-drowning-climate-change-deniers-sea-levels-rising\">Miami, the great world city, is drowning while the powers that be look away</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On the street below, where Santiago sits with her brother and a number of other immigrants, dusk falls and Homestead sees Mexican families gathering for Sunday-night dinner at restaurants such as Casita Tejas. When they rise for work early the following morning, some will be met by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and local police, who will be waiting to check their immigration status and arrest them for probable deportation if they are undocumented (as many are, a state of affairs on which Florida’s agriculture depends). </p> \n<p>Perhaps it is impending apocalypse, natural and man-made, that makes Miami’s frivolity all the more poignant. If climate change predictions are to be believed, large parts of Miami – Miami Beach, Key Biscayne, Virginia Key – will be under water in coming years, a phenomenon helped along by the fact that many Florida politicians, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Scott\">Governor Rick Scott</a> and the aforementioned Senator Rubio, deny that climate change can be linked to human activity. </p> \n<p>Driving home north along US1, the skyline of Miami rises above the flat land, its concrete and steel wrapped in the warmth of the tropical sunset. A city of outsiders, refugees and immigrants that – in its reflection of present-day America’s diversity – feels in many ways more “American” than the 1950s small-town Americana that some politicians and commentators are perpetually nostalgic for.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and join the discussion</em></li> \n</ul>","section":"Cities","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435315438571/29a33f0a-473d-48f0-8df2-da7247d42250-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Reuters","altText":"The Calle Ocho festival is a representation of Miami's traditional Latin culture.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435315827207/2e787b3f-ddea-4a74-81e4-c1c39b427eb6-2060x1387.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1387,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Miami is now home to thousands of Latin Americans, with sizeable populations of Russians, Indians, Persians and Orthodox Jews.

The walls have collapsed, slabs of concrete have tumbled into heaps of fallen joists and slumped plasterboard, all festooned with exposed wiring and mangled pipes. Whole rooms have been undone, and the roof is shot full of holes. Rubble litters the floor, silver air-conditioning ducts flop from the walls, and various rooms – with missing walls, and floors slanted precariously – are exposed. Toilets, tables and chairs could crash at any time. How flimsy solidity is. It is always an illusion. </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHLMUdL8feg\">Thomas Hirschhorn</a> goes about the world putting things together and tearing them apart. His art is one of wreckage and jokes, utopian dreams, philosophical proclamations and possibilities. For an art that consumes tons of recycled cardboard, dump-loads of old tyres, screeds of hand-written, printed, sprayed and recycled texts, and enough gaffer tape to package the entire solar system, Hirschhorn is fairly frugal. He makes art out of the commonplace, whether it is a cave, a hotel, an airport, a school, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2001/jul/03/artsfeatures.arts\">a launderette</a> or a monument to a dead philosopher. </p> \n<p>Building and demolishing, making and breaking are consistent tropes in Hirschhorn’s work. At the back of the precarious scene of destruction at the SLG hangs a quote, sprayed like graffiti on a torn cotton sheet: “Destruction is difficult; indeed, it is as difficult as creation.” To get close, you have to duck, weave and watch your head and your feet to get to the rear of a gallery transformed into a disaster. Taken from the sixth prison notebook of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2006/feb/11/featuresreviews.guardianreview25\">Italian Marxist thinker and politician Antonio Gramsci</a>, imprisoned by Mussolini in 1926 until his death in 1937, the statement looks as prescriptive as it is descriptive of the wreckage that surrounds us. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Though he uses tons of cardboard and enough gaffer tape to package the entire solar system, Hirschhorn is fairly frugal</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“To create destruction is an aesthetic challenge,” Hirschhorn says. Neither a simulacra or a replica of a ruin, In-Between is a model. Where real objects are used – furniture and bathroom ceramics – they are presented ironically, as stand-ins for themselves (rather than as Duchampian readymades). Somehow, the painted cardboard seems more real. </p> \n<p>The walls and roof of the space are defiantly intact, the skylights visible beyond the torn scrim. Demolition and disaster here have an almost cubist sense of rightness, even though Hirschhorn’s clarion call is always for “Energy Not Quality”. Qualities are a different matter: the visual quote, the material comic gag, the rhythms of our passage through the space, the varieties of the disaster – these show an artist who is sensitive to drama, absurdity and pathos. He is good at the pathetic, the failed aspiration, the inability of art to act. People, not artworks, are the real agents here. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7d825d8f9180fe3275d1e73c07d442dc4706f280\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7d825d8f9180fe3275d1e73c07d442dc4706f280/327_338_5244_7876/666.jpg\" alt=\"In-Between at the South London Gallery.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In-Between at the South London Gallery.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Blower</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What stops Hirschhorn’s work becoming theatre, a play on destruction? After all, the rubble, the concrete, the I-beams (which are taped together, like amateurish field bandages) are false, weightless, made of cardboard. The rubble is also hollow, made from folded and glued card. The forms have visual weight, but no substance.</p> \n<p>There is pleasure, even a kind of manic glee or joy, in ruins, especially if they are not our ruins – and sometimes even if they are. The atavistic thrill of destruction, as a retort to impotence, is all about us. Every child knows its allure, and that destruction can be a kind of ecstasy, even if it is only the collapse of a tower of wooden bricks. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>As every child knows, destruction can be a kind of ecstasy</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Ruins, says Hirschhorn, always mean something: “A ruin stands for a structural, an economical, a cultural, a political or a human failure.” The Swiss-born, Paris-based artist wants to give a form to destruction and the destructive impulse.</p> \n<p>What he presents in south London is a choreographed implosion, a building falling in on itself. Of course it is all fake. Some of it is laughable and sketchy, even though the whole thing is based on photographs of actual scenes of destruction. It is like standing in a world where violence is reversible and can be swept away. But still I gawp. His In-Between, then, is a kind of sketch. He prefers the word sculpture to installation. This is just as much a kind of painting – except that if you really found yourself in a building wrecked by a bomb or an earthquake, shoddy construction or some unforeseen disaster, art is the last thing you would think about.</p> \n<p>“<a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-34/my-picture-is-a-sum-of-destructions,-pablo-picasso-1881-1973/\">My picture is a sum of destructions</a>,” Picasso told Christian Zervos in 1935. Destruction in art has a long and venerable tradition. Whether it’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nzzLdiI9eg\">Gustav Metzger’s auto-destructive art performances</a>, or fellow Swiss artist <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/8537769\">Jean Tinguely’s machines (that were meant to destroy themselves)</a> or <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2015/may/11/chris-burden-one-of-the-most-pertinent-and-poetic-artists-of-the-age\">the late Chris Burden</a>’s Samson – a <a href=\"http://uk.complex.com/style/2013/10/chris-burden-art-new-museum/samson\">sculpture with a turnstile</a> which, attached to a geared ratchet, pushed great wooden beams into the walls of a gallery. The more people passed through the turnstile, the more likely it was the walls would collapse. Whenever I have seen it, the gearing has always been disengaged. For Burden, Samson was as much image as actuality. The idea and the potential were the thing. </p> \n<p>Ideas and potentials are at the heart, too, of Hirschhorn’s art, often produced in relation to philosophical ideas. He has built monuments to philosophers, including Gramsci (<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/29/house-philosopher\">famously, in a housing project in south Bronx, New York</a>), <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2002/nov/02/featuresreviews.guardianreview6\">Georges Bataille</a> and Spinoza. His “platforms” to <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/kurt-schwitters-1912\">Kurt Schwitters</a> (constructed on the exact spot where Schwitters built his <a href=\"http://www.merzbarn.net/hanovermerzbau.html\">Hanover Merzbau</a>), and to other artists, writers and thinkers, mix a ramshackle joyousness and sometimes melancholic sense of the past, while looking at what potentials remain in their thought. Lately, Hirschhorn has been building (or unbuilding) ruins. The last I saw was a huge, fake side of a building collapsing in the inner courtyard of the new extension to the Hermitage museum in St Petersburg last year, as part of Manifesta 10. </p> \n<p>We know that the real catastrophe – the collapse of a tower, neighbourhoods bombed and gutted, the earthquake and the bombing – is elsewhere, although this corner of Peckham has seen plenty of its own disasters, from the blitz to the disastrous fire that engulfed a nearby housing estate in 2009. With the one simple yet complex statement by Gramsci, Hirschhorn gives me pause to think about the very things this ruin can do no more than point to, however inadequately. What is being staged is not a ruin, but a thought. </p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://www.southlondongallery.org/page/thomashirschhorn\">In-Between</a> is at South London Gallery until 13 September.</p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/ee1d82cb845037eee3bf7604d0c47fa44622230e/0_0_8688_5217/8688.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":5217,"width":8688,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Mark Blower","altText":"Install shots of Thomas Hirschhorn’s exhibition for Adrian Searle review\nThe images should be credited:\nThomas Hirschhorn In-Between at the South London Gallery, 2015.
