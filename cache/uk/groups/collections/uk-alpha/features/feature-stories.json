Most of the news stories around the event have highlighted the facts: the numbers of those killed, injured and arrested, how the police responded, and whether any innocent bystanders were caught in the melee. But, as an <a href=\"http://ethnographymatters.net/blog/tag/bradley-garrett/\">ethnographer</a>, I am more interested in the culture of the bikers themselves. It seems to me that what this story calls for is long-term immersion reminiscent of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/dec/25/hunter-s-thompson-david-cox\">gonzo journalism of Hunter S Thompson</a> in the 1960s with the Hell’s Angels. As <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Smillas-Sense-Snow-Peter-Hoeg/dp/0385315147\">Peter H&oslash;eg has written</a>, “There is one way to understand another culture. Living it.”</p> \n<p>The most alluring stories about cities are those that revolve around our relationships to places and each other. Cities are where wealth pours, where the poorest hide and where power plays out in the spaces in between. This has always been the case, though now these flows are more visible than ever before. The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/live/2015/apr/27/baltimore-police-clash-protesters-freddie-gray-live\">social unrest in Baltimore</a> over the past few months has made this clear, as daily footage was streamed around the world of clashes between the state and its citizens, from thousands of perspectives. </p> \n<p>However, with increasing exposure, the risk also increases that the story gets boiled down to representations where the most spectacular components – those most resembling a Hollywood film – float to the top and are plucked and presented as wholly representative. The battle lines (sometimes less literal than in Waco) that emerge in cities are often an indication of something more systemic bubbling beneath the surface.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5815cb30f148a51ba35776e90ebaf0524eabaffc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432043773717/b0c1fea6-1805-4d47-bfbc-fa50dd124e5d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bradley Garrett.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bradley Garrett: ‘Immersion can be dangerous’</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The sensibilities of a researcher or journalist who undertakes what the anthropologist <a href=\"http://cyborganthropology.com/Deep_Hanging_Out\">Clifford Geertz called “deep hanging out”</a> is more crucial than ever. What we need in Waco, Baltimore and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/apr/25/police-use-cs-spray-as-anti-gentrification-protesters-mass-in-brixton\">Brixton</a> is not more shallow coverage of clashes; we need to embolden new ethnographers and long-form journalists in those communities to pen stories from the inside out. </p> \n<p>Understanding the nuances of city stories, and tracing those tensions, requires immersion and patience. Whether we are writing about police work, protests, squatting, free parties, banking or parkour, the best socially engaged journalism – like the best university research – is rooted in participation, spiked with empathy, and resists being reduced to spectacle fodder.</p> \n<p>As any war correspondent will tell you, immersion can also be dangerous. Going deep can cause us to lose a sense of the broader picture. Hanging out means we might be changed by our experiences. Immersion may mean that we, as storytellers, become part of that story. However, some of the most powerful work about cities has embraced those dangers and folded them into the narrative – as I tried to do in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/sep/20/urban-exploration-robert-macfarlane-bradley-garrett\">my research with urban explorers in London</a> over the past few years.</p> \n<p>When I arrived in London, in 2008, I knew little about urban exploration and even less about photography (the principal medium of these explorers). My first trespasses with what would become the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/London-Consolidation-Crew-LCC/370969792929720\">London Consolidation Crew</a>, into the power control rooms of Battersea power station and the derelict corridors of Victorian mental hospitals, were terrifying, thrilling and edifying.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c0a433674bbf920445dbbfe23306002f665e6bbe\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432043717289/d863d004-ea7d-4661-bf60-1b9c2bf8b6e9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Urban exploration on the Forth Rail Bridge, Edinburgh.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Terrifying, thrilling and edifying’: an urban explorer photographer on the Forth Rail Bridge in Edinburgh</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>By 2010, I had explored hundreds of locations in five countries with them, including an abandoned Soviet military base outside of Berlin called Vogelsang, where we stood on launch pads that once held nuclear missiles perched and primed to fire at London. Embedded with this crew, I have walked London’s hidden rivers, run railway tracks in the middle of the night to access ghost stations in the Tube, dangled my legs over the edge of an 80-storey skyscraper in Chicago and helped build a secret hideout – <em>sans permission</em> – underneath the streets of Paris. Most importantly, though, I built bonds with a community that will last a lifetime, and those experiences saturate everything I write and do now. </p> \n<p>Just as the boundaries between academic disciplines are breaking down, so too is the brittle boundary between research and journalism. A clutch of good work through history has straddled this edge. For instance, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2010/oct/16/rereading-henry-mayhew-london-poor\">Henry Mayhew’s 19th-century social surveys</a> of London’s poor, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-Company-A-Tramp-Life/dp/1594511837\">Douglas Harper’s 20th-century visual research</a> on freighthopping, and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/books/alice-goffman-researches-poor-black-men-in-on-the-run.html\">Alice Goffman’s 21st-century ethnographic accounts</a> of African Americans trapped in a revolving door of legal precarity in Philadelphia. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6e13ad674f3c455d9e28402e75867953c33ed11\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432043959220/8048da4b-a177-41ae-a73d-b08dfae3ade0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The old control room at Battersea Power Station.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bradley Garrett explored the control rooms of Battersea power station with what would become the London Consolidation Crew.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>All of these projects share a commitment to immersion that undermines the boundaries between the researcher and the researched. We are saturated in a milieu of small stories about people asserting their rights to cities in various ways. The empathetic eye of the journalist-ethnographer can locate those stories and stick with them, stepping over the line from observation to participation. Doing so carries with it dangers – but then cities have always been dangerous places. That is part of why we love living in them. <br /></p> \n<h2>Five of the most influential ‘gonzo’ ethnographies</h2> \n<ol> \n <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/On-Run-Fieldwork-Encounters-Discoveries/dp/022613671X\">On the Run: Fugitive Life in an American City by Alice Goffman</a><br /></strong>The most important ethnography I have ever read, Goffman’s gripping narrative of living for six years in an inner-city neighbourhood in Philadelphia made me see race and class in America in a different light, and wonder – as many good ethnographies will – how she ever got as close to the community as she did. </li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Women-Bullfighting-Consumption-Tradition-Mediterranea/dp/185973961X\">Women and Bullfighting: Gender, Sex and the Consumption of Tradition by Sarah Pink</a><br /></strong>Pink embedded herself with female bullfighters in Andalusia and her photographs of their practice became both invaluable research materials and valuable gifts for the community.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hells-Angels-Penguin-Modern-Classics/dp/014118745X/ref=la_B000AQ4U5U_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1432039070&amp;sr=1-3\">Hell’s Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs by Hunter S Thompson</a><br /></strong>Thompson’s first non-fiction novel is a breathless and brave portrait of the most notorious biker gang in the world, which led to him being brutally assaulted for his criticisms of their macho culture, much as he clearly also revelled in it.</li> \n <li><strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-Company-A-Tramp-Life/dp/1594511837\">Good Company: A Tramp Life by Douglas Harper</a><br /></strong></strong>A well-written and beautifully photographed ethnography of Harper’s experiences in 1960s America, crossing the country with tramps in box cars headed west on the search for transient agricultural work.</li> \n <li><strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empire-Scrounge-Underground-Alternative-Criminology/dp/0814727387\">Empire of Scrounge: Inside the Urban Underground of Dumpster Diving, Trash Picking, and Street Scavenging by Jeff Ferrell</a><br /></strong></strong>In this insightful and often mirthful auto-ethnography, everyday survival meets research methodology when Ferrell quits his job as a tenured professor and lives for eight months on what he finds in other people’s bins.<em></em></li> \n</ol> \n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.bradleygarrett.com/books/\">Author</a>, <a href=\"http://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/bgarrett.html\">academic</a> and urban explorer Bradley Garrett will be one of the speakers at the Guardian Masterclasses How To Write About Cities seminar on Saturday 23 May. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/guardian-masterclasses/2015/mar/31/uncovering-the-city-urban-writing-seminar-with-bradley-l-garrett\">Go here for more details</a>.</em></p>","section":"Cities","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432043533290/60fc0483-aed2-499f-9071-bc3f229b46e7-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Optimum Releasing","altText":"A still from the documentary film Gonzo; The Life and Work of Dr Hunter S Thompson (2008)Courtesy Of Optimum ReleasingFree to use / Must credit Optimum Releasing","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Optimum Releasing"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432043775278/b0c1fea6-1805-4d47-bfbc-fa50dd124e5d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bradley Garrett: ‘Immersion can be dangerous’","credit":"PR","altText":"Bradley Garrett.","cleanCaption":"Bradley Garrett: ‘Immersion can be dangerous’"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432043718999/d863d004-ea7d-4661-bf60-1b9c2bf8b6e9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Terrifying, thrilling and edifying’: an urban explorer photographer on the Forth Rail Bridge in Edinburgh","credit":"PR","altText":"Urban exploration on the Forth Rail Bridge, Edinburgh.","cleanCaption":"‘Terrifying, thrilling and edifying’: an urban explorer photographer on the Forth Rail Bridge in Edinburgh"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432043960597/8048da4b-a177-41ae-a73d-b08dfae3ade0-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bradley Garrett explored the control rooms of Battersea power station with what would become the London Consolidation Crew.

In a massive offensive timed to coincide with the third anniversary of the German invasion of the USSR, the First Belarusian Front of the Red Army routed and destroyed the Wehrmacht’s Army Group Centre. Some 1.7 million Soviet troops, many of them riding in trucks and jeeps supplied by the United States, crashed through the Belarusian forests and swamps, forcing the Germans to withdraw all the way to central Poland. As the Red Army approached the Vistula river, the Polish resistance, the Home Army, tried to take Warsaw from the Germans. The Red Army watched from across the Vistula as the local German garrison and SS forces defeated the Poles and murdered tens of thousands of civilians. Meanwhile the Wehrmacht, in a remarkable and generally overlooked action, turned the energy of panic into the determination to defend, and dug in at new positions beyond the Vistula.</p> \n<p>At this point, in September 1944, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/adolf-hitler\">Hitler</a> made one of the most remarkable decisions of the war: to send some of the best troops that stood between the Red Army and Berlin, notably the Fifth and Sixth Panzer armies, to fight the Americans in Belgium rather than the Soviets in Poland. Hitler gambled that the US Army could be forced by a surprise offensive into a panic, like the Red army in 1941, the French army in 1940 and the Polish Army in 1939. Although Hitler had a precise understanding of some of the operational details of the war, his choice to attack the Americans rather than defend against the Soviets was essentially psychological. Only a dramatic offensive victory, he thought, could break the will of the Anglo-Saxons and the unnatural alliance between the Soviets, Americans and British. The Americans could send their machines across the Pacific and the Atlantic, but did they have the stomach for a long war in Europe? Had Hitler known more about the way the war was fought and won in the Pacific, he might have seen this issue differently. The British could land on the continent with the Americans at Normandy, but could they stay? Or could they be seen off again, as at Dunkirk in 1940? On 17 September 1944, a day after Hitler ordered the offensive in the west, the British attempted the disastrous airborne operation known as Operation Market Garden, losing 14,000 men to no purpose.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, as <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/antony-beevor\">Antony Beevor</a> documents, the leading British and American generals on the western front were dividing the imagined spoils of a war that was far from won. General Patton’s arrogance and impatience competed with Field Marshal Montgomery’s armoured complacency, though Montgomery was far too self-absorbed to be envious. Eisenhower figures in this account as more mature than the others, but lacking in “imagination” and in the ability, at least at first, to bring his subordinates into line. Even after the success of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/d-day\">D-Day</a> and a parade in Paris, the Germans were still defending important pockets in Belgium, and the Americans foolishly chose to bull their way directly through the H&uuml;rtgen Forest. That plan, says Beevor, was “just about as foolish as it could be”. By the time the Americans emerged at the other end, they had lost some 33,000 men.</p> \n<p>In December 1944, the Germans were preparing for an offensive on the same lines as in 1870, 1914 and 1940 and no one among the allies seemed to have a clue. Only <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/uk/winston-churchill\">Churchill</a>, writes Beevor, was immune to the “victory fever”. Too dependent on “Ultra”, the decryption of German radio made possible by Polish mathematicians and the British team at Bletchley Park, the Americans and British realised belatedly that the Germans, using traditional methods, knew more about them than they did about the Germans. On the eve of the German offensive, General von Manteuffel was in disguise doing his own intelligence work, while Montgomery was asking Eisenhower for leave to go home for Christmas on the grounds that Germany was no longer capable of mounting an attack. So when the blow fell on 16 December, the brass was surprised – but the men fought. At the crux of Beevor’s book are its middle chapters, each covering a single day, which deliver the essential message of the battle and perhaps of the war: that the Americans fought even when they were losing. The Germans achieved surprise without delivering shock.</p> \n<p>The slow advance through the H&uuml;rtgen Forest had hardened and educated the green American troops. Like the Red Army in the east, they were beginning to use German tricks and, when they could, German weapons. The Americans held villages and crossroads for as long as they could, which sometimes meant only days or hours – but even this mattered. Some of the American tank units were manned by African Americans, fighting for the first time on a large scale. On Beevor’s account, they fought well; he reports that Captain John Long of the 761st Tank Battalion was fighting “Not for God and Country, but for me and my people”. We don’t know what the Germans made of this, but we do know that they were frustrated by American resistance in general. The American staff officers, surprised as they had been, had time to see the German advance resolve itself into a certain shape on their maps, and could plan their counterattack. By the end of January the “bulge”, as the Americans called the shape of the German advance, had been flattened.</p> \n<p>Given the revival of interest in the political and military history of eastern Europe, to which Beevor himself has contributed, it is no longer possible to write set-piece histories about the western front without the eastern backdrop. The shadow of the east hangs over this entire study. The Americans and the British experienced in December 1944 a total failure to see a coming German offensive, just as the Soviets had before Operation Barbarossa in 1941. The winter fighting in the shadows of forests recalled the eastern front to many of the Germans who had been there; some of those German veterans were soldiers of the Waffen-SS, who brought the habit of atrocity with them. They killed US prisoners of war, most notoriously at Malm&eacute;dy on 17 December. The Americans, as Beevor is careful to note in sections of the book that American readers might find startling, reciprocated with similar war crimes. In general, Beevor’s portrayal of the American soldier is a welcome relief from the rounded stereotypes of nationalist commemoration.</p> \n<p>All that said, the scale was completely different. The SS was aiming to punish the Belgian resistance that had welcomed the Americans; although the toll of 8,000 Belgian civilian dead is horrible, it is far fewer than the 120,000 or so Poles murdered a few months earlier in Warsaw. This suggests the greatest contrast between the eastern and the western fronts: the politics of liberation. The Belgian and French <em>r&eacute;sistants</em> fighting now alongside the allied armies were involved in a political struggle about who would govern their liberated homelands. They were frustrated as conservative politicians in exile were recognised as legitimate rulers. In the east, these questions would not arise. Local resistance movements, insofar as they survived the far harsher German reprisals, would be overmastered by the Soviets. The politicians in exile would stay there. The new governments, as far west as Berlin, would be those that Soviet authorities found palatable, which is to say communist. This political difference, nicely captured in Andrzej Bobkowski’s Polish memoir of wartime Paris, <em>En guerre et en paix</em>, is the undertone of Beevor’s fine concluding sections.</p> \n<p>The day after Christmas 1944, a week into the Battle of the Ardennes but a month before the final German defeat, General Guderian tried to explain the calculus to Hitler. As he argued, American resistance meant that the gamble in the west had already failed. As many forces as possible, he argued, should be returned to the eastern front to guard the Vistula. Hitler was enraged by his estimates of Soviet troop strengths: “Who is responsible for producing this rubbish?” On 12 and 13 January 1945, the First Belarusian Front and the First Ukrainian Front indeed attacked from their Vistula bridgeheads, and the campaign for Berlin had begun. “There can be little doubt,” concludes Beevor, “that the commitment and then the grinding down of German forces in the Ardennes, especially the Panzer divisions, had mortally weakened the Wehrmacht’s capacity to defend the eastern front.” Usually, and quite rightly, the emphasis is on the tremendous sacrifices of the Red Army on the eastern front. But at this decisive moment, it was the sacrifices of the Americans that prepared the way for a rapid Soviet advance – and thus, perhaps, for an extended Soviet empire. If the Panzer armies had remained on the Vistula, the Americans rather than the Soviets might have liberated Berlin and Vienna. Hitler’s military choice to fight on the west rather than the east ended up defining, in political terms, what “west” and “east” meant after the war.</p> \n<p>Though Beevor sketches these political implications, he has written a military history. History, and especially the martial kind, has the feature that events are portrayed much more clearly in retrospect than they can possibly have been seen at the time. The trap for the military historian, then, is to shine too bright a light through the fog of war. Beevor has the art of preserving the individual perspective on the battlefield while placing it among the perspectives of platoon, regiment, division, commanders, politicians and civilians. The pointillist whole that emerges is convincing as a portrait of war and startling in its detail. Beevor cares about the soldiers and the readers and the truth, an old-fashioned set of concerns that is balanced with modern literary skill. This book clarifies, without simplifying, the human experiences and political stakes of the battle for the Ardennes Forest in December 1944 and January 1945, bringing realism to the battlefield and coherence to the larger history of the war.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Timothy Snyder is the author of <em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/bloodlands.html\">Bloodlands</a></em>.

Much of my short marriage felt like a business transaction during which I was paid $325 a week, in an arrangement that was certainly not as privileged as those women on the Upper East Side, but would still be considered one of great fortune within larger social structures.</p> \n<p>The experience was one of obscene inequality that rarely gets recognized as such. With the backing of “romantic love” and a rhetoric of choice, I found myself knocked back the loser in a deeply ingrained power relationship that constantly renewed itself. </p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span><span class=\"bullet\">•</span><span class=\"bullet\">•</span></p> \n<p>By the time I could actually say it out loud, I had been a kept woman for over six months.</p> \n<p>That day, I walked a couple of blocks across my hip neighborhood of U Street in Washington DC and stepped into my local hairdresser. I was pleased: I had finally found someone I liked to cut my hair. Her name was Rachel and she had tattoos from neck to toe.</p> \n<p>Of all the people I had met in my lonely time in DC, I felt a kinship towards Rachel. I told her I wanted my hair cut in a mohawk and she was excited. </p> \n<p>“What do you do?” She asked me casually as she started cutting.</p> \n<p>The answer came out before I could even think about it. “I am a housewife,” I said for the first time ever. And it was true. The disappointment I felt she carried in her eyes was one I carried in myself too. To be a kept woman had been the most profoundly alienating experience of my grown-up life. Which wasn’t to say much – I was only 24. </p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span><span class=\"bullet\">•</span><span class=\"bullet\">•</span></p> \n<p>Alex and I met in Italy. I was 22 and starting my career as a journalist after spending years of free to near-free labor and hard work building it up. The day I met him in Rome was the day I found out I had been offered a job with an Italian newspaper in Milan, a four-hour train ride away. </p> \n<p>He was an American diplomat based in Rome, a former lawyer with an intellectual family. He was 16 years my elder and had reached a point in his life where he felt he was ready to get married. </p> \n<p>Our first conversation over drinks was about sexual assault, sexist policing and misogyny in Italy – all topics close to my heart. He agreed with me on everything. He expressed outrage. He said the right things. Here is a man who sees me, I thought. </p> \n<p>I took the job and moved to Milan three weeks later. We met up for romantic weekends in Tuscany and spent nights in palatial hotels his work sometimes paid for. We got drunk on Aperol spritzes. At a time of tumult and precariousness in my life, I found his Rome apartment dark and comforting. He made me feel safe. </p> \n<p>He proposed nine months later and I said yes. He said if I gave up my job now to follow him back to the US, he would compromise down the line – make sure to give up some professional gain and let me have my turn. He sold me a “10-year plan”: 10 years for his career, and then it would be 10 years for me. </p> \n<p>And in the meantime, what better thing than to be married to a diplomat, he posed, to travel to unexpected places and be exposed to so many different experiences, especially as a journalist?</p> \n<p>My family and friends were worried. It only made me more determined to go through with it. The following summer, having been in my job for less than a year and a half, I quit and moved to the US to be with him.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span><span class=\"bullet\">•</span><span class=\"bullet\">•</span></p> \n<p>The panics came quite fast, but I pushed the negative thoughts away as much as possible. I had no friends aside from his, no work visa, no social security number and no routine. </p> \n<p>We quickly agreed on a sum for my “services” as a wife. It was $325 a week. At the time, it seemed like a lot. I had never had much money as an adult. I certainly never knew money to arrive so easily. </p> \n<p>Our rent was paid by his employer. I enrolled in an intensive Arabic class, which he covered. I started volunteering with a media nonprofit and went running with homeless women. I ran a marathon and raised money for a cause. I went to the gym, and felt pressure to stay fit.</p> \n<p>My $325-a-week stipend was expected to cover our weekly shop at Whole Foods (I was expected to do all the cooking), my cellphone top-up and bits and bobs like public transportation and drinks with those friends I tried to make. I covered the odd meal out. Any frills, I would have to pass by him. He had the means, though: for a party his parents were throwing us, he covered the cost of a Vivienne Westwood dress.</p> \n<p>In the beginning, I would wait for the sound of Alex’s keys in the door with excitement and trepidation. But quickly, I grew quiet.</p> \n<p>Alex hated my lack of propensity for cleaning and the fact that I left my shoes in the way. He screamed when I put a sharp knife in the dishwasher. When we got a puppy, I was praised for how good I was with him. His family chimed in: “Rose is so good with Alfie.” </p> \n<p>Sometimes, Alex would go into silent rages and not speak to me for days. His rages would cease when I would break. After days of silence, I would break down into shaking fits of humiliated, desperate tears and he would apologize.</p> \n<p>I tried to get better at putting my shoes away before bed.</p> \n<p>He had a high sex drive and was furious we were not having sex often enough. We were having sex a few times a week instead of a couple times a day. My lack of constant sexual availability was one of the few things I felt I had to hold on to.</p> \n<p>The money started feeling dirty. Maybe it always did. He would leave it in cash on the wooden table just before the entrance to the kitchen. Without a social security number, and still waiting the interminable wait for my green card to come through, I could not (or believed I could not) have my own US bank account.</p> \n<p>Sometimes Alex didn’t have change, so he would give me $320 now, and $5 later.</p> \n<p>There were happy times too. Times when I felt we were a family and times I felt things would almost certainly get better. We lived such a conventional, fulfilled life from the outside. If only I could shut up, I would often think to myself.<br /></p> \n<p>But mostly I felt numbed by my dependence and powerlessness. I screamed a lot and was accused of being hysterical and unstable.<br /></p> \n<p>“You lied,” I told him, pointing to one of the many things – among them the fact that he had told me <em>after</em> I had moved to the US he would not allow me to work as a journalist (too controversial with his job), something he had never mentioned during our courtship in Italy. He thought I might consider instead working as a French teacher or in the admin part of the American embassy.</p> \n<p>“You lied too,” he would retort. “I had not realized I was marrying someone so emotionally unbalanced.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>I started to forgo the hairdresser and cut my hair myself. I used pink scissors that I bought in the children’s school supply section at CVS. It saved me money and difficult interactions.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Alex received news of a posting to west Africa. For bureaucratic reasons, I would not be allowed to follow him. He didn’t think twice before saying yes. </p> \n<p>Still visa-less, and therefore unable to work in the US, I applied to the best American graduate school program I could find, and got in. He paid for it. I rediscovered my brain and refused to lower my voice. I refused to lose either of them willingly ever again. </p> \n<p>Just two years and three months after marrying him, we were divorced. Guilt, shame, relief and gratitude submerged me.</p> \n<p>“You know if we get a divorce you won’t have health insurance any more?” He asked me by way of warning in our final days together.<br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432045519353/1be98715-e86d-4cee-9c41-8300be0bc893-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"H.

In a study published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, a team of Canadian researchers compared the way a group of regular gamers learn and pay attention to a group of non-gamers. Not surprisingly they found that the gamers behave differently. They also used a technique called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography\">electroencephalography</a> to show that a brain wave called the N2PC is different in gamers, which fits with their behavioural results.</p> \n<p>So far this is all pretty sensible, so where is the link to Alzheimer’s disease? In fact, the researchers didn’t look at dementia or perform any clinical tests. But they nevertheless embark on a series of logical leaps, which go like this:</p> \n<p><strong>1.</strong> The type of learning shown by the gamers has been associated in previous studies with increased use of a brain region called the caudate nucleus</p> \n<p><strong>2.</strong> Increased use of the caudate nucleus can be associated with reduced volume of the hippocampus</p> \n<p><strong>3.</strong> Reduced volume of the hippocampus can be associated with increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease</p> \n<p><strong>4.</strong> Therefore (take a deep breath) video gaming could increase risk of Alzheimer’s disease</p> \n<p>Convinced?<br /></p> \n<p>As usual, the news headlines conflate this conjecture with fact. “Call of Duty increases risk of Alzheimer’s disease”, said the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11616371/Call-of-Duty-increases-risk-of-Alzheimers-disease.html\">Telegraph</a>. “Video game link to psychiatric disorders suggested by study”, reported the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/20/video-game-link-to-psychiatric-orders-suggested-by-study\">Guardian</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3087905/Navigating-virtual-worlds-reduce-grey-matter-make-prone-mental-illness.html\">Daily Mail</a> posed the problem as a question, “Could video games increase your risk of Alzheimer’s?”, reminding us that whenever a news headline asks a question, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines\">the answer is <em>no</em></a>.</p> \n<p>We know that when science news is hyped, <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g7015\">most of the hype is already present in the press releases issued by universities</a>. This case is no exception - the press release was issued by the Douglas Mental Health University Institute, and unsurprisingly it <a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-05/dmhu-ssn051915.php\">focuses almost entirely</a> on the tenuous link to Alzheimer’s disease. </p> \n<p>The press release also includes a statement from the lead researcher that is a clear exaggeration. Dr Gregory West is quoted as saying “we also found that gamers rely on the caudate-nucleus to a greater degree than non-gamers”. Actually they didn’t find this at all, because their study didn’t measure activity in the caudate nucleus. Instead it measured a type of behaviour that previous studies have <em>associated</em> with activity in the caudate nucleus. There is a world of difference between these two, and readers would do well to take these latest claims with generous helping of salt.</p> \n<p>So once again, we’re faced with another situation in which a study that tenuously claims a negative effect of playing video games is vastly overhyped, both in the press release and the subsequent media coverage. We can do better than this.</p> \n<p><em>Source article: <br /></em></p> \n<p>West GL, Drisdelle BL, Konishi K, Jackson J, Jolicoeur P, Bohbot VD. 2015 Habitual action video game playing is associated with caudate nucleus-dependent navigational strategies.

The large drum scanners they used to grind information out of the negative photographs were last to be axed five years ago, but all the obsolete technology still has a place within their studio, even if it is, as George puts it, to be “romantic”. Throughout, artefacts haunt the rooms and shelves of Gilbert &amp; George’s Fournier Street home in east London. Of course, the benefit of working digitally has freed up their practice. No longer do the pair need to work with chemicals. As George concedes to various advancements, he confesses: “The only things we miss are the rubber gloves.”</p> \n<p>The studio came with the Spitalfields house when they bought it in 1968. Since they needed to expand, they acquired space on next-door’s land. There lay a desolate house and they got that free. An “extraordinary” outcome, says George, the word he repeatedly uses to refer to amusing, baffling and banal observations. He and George share a universal curiosity punctuated by the hyperbole of caricatured English gents. No 8 Fournier St has been fully restored to its 18th-century decor. They even restored the kitchen, though Gilbert says they have never cooked in the house – not even boiled an egg. The only amenity they use is the kettle, for instant coffee. “It took 300 years to go downhill,” explained George. “We’ve prepared it for the next 300 years, see? We’ve used the same paint as they used originally, the same plaster, everything is as it would’ve been originally.” Everything apart from the furniture, Gilbert adds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5abebaad5e7b92f2aab663659d75a97e478a6f5a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432049642588/6d106b82-bc22-4eec-b40f-de5369efa9fb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'We are very interested in what is discarded or discredited' ...

The rationale George gives is that “it has to be immaculate in order for us to make all these unpleasant pictures”. The kitchen table was the 19th-century architect and designer <a href=\"http://www.thepuginsociety.co.uk\">Augustus Pugin’s</a> own. It previously belonged to a monastery and when their dealer friend told them that, in order to purchase it, they would have to have lunch with the monks, the artists were concerned their secular world view would clash. “We said, hold on, we don’t know what sort of conversation to have with a monk,” explains George. “You don’t have to worry, said our friend, they’re a silent order.”</p> \n<p>Twin cast-iron tables by <a href=\"http://www.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/pharos/collection_pages/19th_pages/M.16-1980/FRM_TXT_SE-M.16-1980.html\">George Bullock</a>, the designer who created furniture for Napoleon in exile, symmetrically stand beside two windows facing the street. Gilbert &amp; George even have an identical hatstand to that of Napoleon. Their penchant for the great designers of the 19th century is evident. The vases of Christopher Dresser, Phillip Webb, designer of the Red House, and Edwin Godwin, who designed for Oscar Wilde, all feature. The collection prominently features objects and designers relegated to the forgotten chambers of the past, from former library books to coin collections with no monetary value. “In our art and in our life, I think we are very interested in that that is discarded or disguised or discredited.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74b50471156700d3efc14bb2e6d34df62a416f89\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432049829266/c46d0b8c-c95e-4b4c-917b-2c42187ea14c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'Don't lick the paint' ... it's lead, the same as they used in the 18th century.

Instead of acting as passive onlookers, they turned up uninvited at the private view with multicoloured, metallised heads, as living sculptures. Exclusion has always inspired them. <a href=\"http://slavamogutin.com/gilbert_and_george/\">“We always felt we were against the grain.</a> We were outside but we wanted to win with our vision of the world, with our way of making art,” says Gilbert, in English still accented from his Dolomites upbringing in Italy. The shutters to the second-floor room are usually closed to prevent light damage to the vases, furniture and the restored paint scheme, as if the exposed room itself were a fading photograph. “Don’t lick the paint,” says George. The lead paint, the same formula used to decorate the original walls, still has a faint, deathly scent.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eade224e170822db2120336dfcbda9581bbe8074\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432050056524/cc551e53-94d2-483f-90e0-5749a2623c6d-460x350.jpeg\" alt=\"A Pugin chair with Gilbert and George-designed coat of arms, featuring a large pubic louse.

Most places that we’ve been to are typical 1957 or typical 2001. This is so actual here. From Liverpool Street in the City, to here, to Bethnal Green, to Whitechapel.” The range of life is concentrated. Within 20 yards, George points out, you’ll find sex, money, race, religion, hope, fear. “The life force is the same.”</p> \n<p>History combined with the present – “the ghosts of time”, as Gilbert calls it – is what makes London modern for them. The discarded objects they gather from the street – homemade stickers, protest signs, religious propaganda, drug paraphernalia – are given a new life in Gilbert &amp; George’s images. “It’s always nature versus the city,” says George. “We love it. Just this morning we saw matchsticks and some amazing blood-red vomit down the end of the road. Extraordinary! Great explosions!”</p> \n<p>Reclaiming objects is also to do with the conventions of class. In a side room is a Pugin chair from the palace of Westminster. They had it re-gilded and sourced silk velvet from the same period. The drawings of the design, on show at the V&amp;A, show a crest in the middle. “But we didn’t want to reproduce that, so we made up our own coat of arms,” says George. “Do you recognise the nice creature in the middle?” A large embroidered pubic louse, as seen in their London E1 pictures, sits between G initials.</p> \n<p>Back in the studio, next to the large grey filing cabinets that archive their oeuvre, they’re working on the expressions of humanity. Laid out next to an A-Z map of London are a series of scribbled phrases.

The chancellor used his first speech of the new government to promise devolution to cities, but with one crucial condition – they must elect a mayor. Greater Manchester is to be the blueprint, as part of Osborne’s plan to create a “northern powerhouse” to rival the economic prowess of London. It will elect a mayor in 2017. And of course, the capital will also be gearing up for its mayoral election next May. Already, candidates for the next mayor have started to come forward with visions of what London should look like. But a group of citizens have got their own ideas – and they want them in the manifestos.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/14/george-osborne-invites-cities-to-follow-manchester-route-to-devolution\">George Osborne offers devolution route to cities with elected mayor</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The campaign has already begun, with today the deadline for applications to become Labour’s mayoral candidate. As we went to press, Diane Abbott, Tessa Jowell, Christian Wolmar, David Lammy and Sadiq Khan had declared. Policing and crime commissioner Stephen Greenhalgh has announced he will bid for the Conservative nomination, while the other parties have yet to begin their nominations process.<strong> </strong>But disappointment and a perceived lack of ambition shown by outgoing mayor Boris Johnson and his predecessor, Ken Livingstone, has led to the creation of a grassroots effort to get the ideas of Londoners on to the manifestos of the new round of candidates.</p> \n<p>Since November 2013, more than 1,000 people have been part of Changing London, a project to crowdsource ideas for London’s next mayor. Entirely coordinated by volunteers, the idea first occurred to David Robinson, an east Londoner and founder of charity Community Links, in the summer of 2013. A lifelong community worker and Labour party member, he became frustrated by speculation about candidates for the post. “This seemed to me to be far too early to be talking about who, when we should have been be talking about what,” he says. “The ‘world’s most competitive city’ is not an aspiration with which many can identify.”</p> \n<p>Robinson and policy researcher Will Horwitz, who collaborated on the project, invited Londoners to create a vision for the capital. They encouraged contributors to bring solutions, not problems, and to leave behind ideas that required a heavy cash injection.</p> \n<p>The home of the project was an online blog, where any Londoner was invited to submit an idea. Social media was crucial for finding contributors, as well as coverage in the press and “old-fashioned word of mouth.” Robinson and Horwitz gathered the ideas together last summer into a series of <a href=\"http://www.change-london.org.uk/london-papers/\">“London papers”</a>, debated at a number of consultation events and <a href=\"http://londonpublishingpartnership.co.uk/changing-london-a-rough-guide-for-the-next-london-mayor/\">published as a book on Monday</a>. Robinson and Horwitz believe that both Johnson and Livingstone have missed an opportunity. They don’t say the mayors lacked ideas; indeed they point to Boris Johnson’s Vision 2020 as “expansive and comprehensive.”</p> \n<p>“We found plenty to support but we still have a fundamental problem with Vision 2020. We didn’t think of it.” Central to the project is Robinson’s belief that policy should be developed from the ground up – that if the policy-making process starts with citizens, rather than politicians, it can better reflect their experiences and draw in “the passion and creativity of people who are otherwise quite docile in the democratic process”.</p> \n<p>“Manifestos are largely dreamt up behind closed doors with the occasional consultation event.” says Horwitz. “We wanted to start with a blank sheet and see where it leads.” Yet Robinson is clear that Changing London is neither a policy document nor a manifesto. Run entirely by volunteers on minimal resources, he says that although they would like to see similar projects run elsewhere, it does require more sophisticated research in order to be truly representative.</p> \n<p>Changing London has produced not one vision, but five. Each has a different focus – children, neighbourhoods, inequality, democracy and health – and is packed with ideas. Some are predictable: there are calls for stronger unions, measures to cap high pay and safer cycling routes. But others surface that you would be hard-pressed to find in any political manifesto or thinktank report.</p> \n<p>One such idea is for “play streets”, closed off for children. It was submitted by hospice worker Sally Muylders and comes from her own memories of playing out as a child: “For us it was fresh air, friends, games. For our parents it was a community, an excuse to chat, a sense of shared responsibility. Now children don’t play in the streets and that sense of community is often gone.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY6PQAI4TZE\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YY6PQAI4TZE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  A campaign fought by children in Amsterdam for a play street in 1972\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Muylders points to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YY6PQAI4TZE\">Amsterdam</a>, where children ran a successful campaign for a permanent play street and to those in <a href=\"http://playingout.net/\">Bristol and Hackney in east London</a>. Other contributors called for ideas that prioritise the needs of children and make London “the best place in the world to grow up”. They call for advertising to be banned near schools, for the return of the Child Trust Fund and for “a cultural guarantee”: a list of experiences with the capital’s arts scene, from seeing a play to writing with an author, that all children would have to complete as part of their schooling.</p> \n<p>A group of 30 children aged six to 11 from schools in Newham participated in a focus group. Most struggled to point to London on a map of the UK, but they had ideas – from improving the provision of sweet shops to increasing public transport. “Why can’t London be more like Sunderland?” asked another contributor, lamenting the rising social isolation in the capital.</p> \n<p>Robinson is passionate that the project is not just a catalogue of ideas but is about the process as much as the product. “People who have experience of an issue are best placed to advise on how it might best be resolved. We need to draw that wisdom into the policy-making process – not just in London, but all across the UK,” says Robinson.</p> \n<p>Much of Changing London has been inspired by mayors around the world. These include Calgary’s Naheed Nenshi, a Muslim born to South African immigrants, who was elected mayor of one of Canada’s largest and most conservative cities in 2010– despite being at only 8% in the polls six weeks before the election.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f3f7338fd83575c2912533fb6f122c18b7bfe7bf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431970118718/5c66740c-d869-4bfe-80ea-47fade4139d9-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, who allowed citizens to decide how €20m of public money was spent\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, who allowed citizens to decide how €20m of public money was spent.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Benoit Tessier/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nenshi’s promise was to deliver “politics in full sentences”, to involve voters involved in complex discussions and empower them to create their own ideas for change. During his campaign, supporters hosted Nenshi at coffee parties in their homes to discuss detailed ideas. Once he assumed office, he launched <a href=\"http://www.3thingsforcalgary.ca/\">three things for Calgary</a>, inviting citizens to create three ideas for their community. It went viral and three years later he was re-elected with three-quarters of the popular vote.</p> \n<p>Many other mayors have taken an outward-looking approach to their role. San Antonio’s former mayor Julian Castro asked voters to contribute ideas at large-scale events before setting up a charity to help them be realised. Bogota’s former mayor Antanas Mockus asked citizens to pay a 10% voluntary tax and 63,000 obliged. Oklahoma’s overweight mayor Mick Cornett took his diet public, asking the city’s residents to join him on a weight loss campaign to lose a collective one million pounds. In Paris, mayor Anne Hidalgo gave citizens the opportunity to vote on how €20m for 2014-15 – 5% of the city’s investment budget – was spent; they could choose from pop-up swimming pools to mobile rubbish collection points.</p> \n<p>But does an outward-facing mayor make for a more effective way of running a city? Osborne believes so. His plan – to be laid out in full in the Queen’s speech next week – is to devolve powers for local transport, housing, skills and healthcare to groups of cities, starting with Greater Manchester in 2017. In return, local authorities must be prepared to work together as combined authorities and act under an elected, executive mayor.</p> \n<p>In the UK, the mayoral model was established in 2000 with London’s first election and the Local Government Act, which empowered all councils to switch to the new model. There are now 17 directly elected mayors, all in England. But in a series of referendums in 2012, voters in nine cities (Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield, Wakefield, Coventry, Leeds and Bradford) rejected the model, while Bristol and Salford voted for it. “England has ended up with one of the most centralised governments in the world,” says Wyn Grant in the <a href=\"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/research/warwickcommission/electedmayors\">Warwick 2012 commission on elected mayors and city leadership</a> .“That seems to have demobilised the electorate in many localities and one of the underlying thrusts of the localism agenda is to reinvigorate the local body politic by giving power to the elected mayors.”</p> \n<p>However, the system can be unpopular with city councillors, such as the leader of Plymouth council, Tudor Evans, who argues that the local council often has a better understanding of local needs and that “there is no word about city or county regions.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/aug/10/guardian-view-on-elected-mayors\">The Guardian view on elected mayors | editorial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Others fear that smaller cities and towns will be swallowed up by bigger cities and that Osborne’s plans leaves little opportunity for rural regions that would struggle to come up with an elected mayor that had legitimacy. But, says researcher Clare Holt, “if elected mayors are going to be the future, cities are a good place to start,” pointing out that in Manchester, the mayor represents greater Manchester, not just the city.</p> \n<p>George Ferguson, the mayor of Bristol – another city that Changing London draws inspiration from – says that the model has been “transformational” for Bristol and has led to greater community engagement. “It has much more authority because the mayor is elected by citizens across the city rather than appointed by the council. It doesn’t mean that everybody loves me – I’m probably Marmite, but at least people associate change with me.”</p> \n<p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.bris.ac.uk/media-library/sites/policybristol/documents/mayoralgovernance.pdf\">report by the universities of Bristol and the West of England</a>, in 2012, 24% of people said the city had visible leadership. By 2014 the figure rose to 69%. Among civic leaders in the community, voluntary and business sectors, it soared to 97%.</p> \n<p>Critics suggest that the system affords mayors too much power and encourages egocentric candidates – in Birmingham, the no campaign was called “Vote no to a power freak”. Jenny Jones, the Green candidate for London mayor in 2012, remarked at a hustings for that election that the room was “full of testosterone”. Of the 17 areas that currently have elected mayors, only four are women. Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was recently found guilty of multiple corruption charges.</p> \n<p>In 2013, a Lord Ashcroft poll showed that Boris Johnson is the most recognisable politician in the country after the prime minister. Tom Gash, from the Institute for Government, says: “In areas where there is likely to be single party dominance you have real questions about whether you have mayors who are likely to be elected over and over again and don’t need to be that accountable”.</p> \n<p>Now the book has been published, Robinson wants to get Changing London’s ideas on to the candidates’ agendas. Most of the Labour candidates have seen the book and will discuss the ideas at a series of public events this summer<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p>The objective, says Robinson, is to raise citizens’ expectations. “They don’t think the post is particularly relevant to their lives.

For nearly 15 years, the professor at the University of California at San Diego has been obsessed with what he describes as the most complicated subject he has ever experimented on: his own body.</p> \n<p>Smarr keeps track of more than 150 parameters. Some he measures continuously in real-time with a wireless gadget on his belt; some, such as his weight, he logs daily; others, such as his blood and the bacteria in his intestines, he tests only about once every month. Smarr compares the way he treats his body with how people monitor and maintain their cars: “We know exactly how much gas we have, the engine temperature, how fast we are going. What I’m doing is creating a dashboard for my body.”</p> \n<p>At 66 Smarr is the unlikely hero of a global movement among ordinary people to “quantify” themselves using wearable fitness gadgets, medical equipment, headcams, traditional lab tests and homemade contraptions, all with the goal of finding ways to optimise their bodies and minds to live longer, healthier lives – and perhaps to discover some important truth about themselves and their purpose in life.</p> \n<p>The explosion in extreme tracking is part of a digital revolution in healthcare led by the tech visionaries who created Apple, Google, BlackBerry, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems. Using the chips, database and algorithms that powered the information revolution of the past few decades, these new billionaires now are attempting to rebuild, regenerate and reprogramme the human body.</p> \n<p>In the aggregate data being gathered by millions of personal tracking devices are patterns that may reveal what in the diet, exercise regimen and environment contributes to disease.</p> \n<p>Could physical activity patterns be used to inform decisions about where to place a public park and improve walkability? Could trackers find cancer clusters or contaminated waterways? A pilot project in Louisville, Kentucky, for example, uses inhalers with sensors to pinpoint asthma “hotspots”.</p> \n<p>“As we have more and more sophisticated wearables that can continuously measure things ranging from your physical activity to your stress levels to your emotional state, we can begin to cross-correlate and understand how each aspect of our life consciously and unconsciously impacts one another,” Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Micro and investor in mobile health startups, said in an interview.</p> \n<p>The idea that data is a turnkey to self-discovery is not new. More than 200 years ago, Benjamin Franklin was tracking 13 personal virtues in a daily journal to develop his moral character. The ubiquity of cheap technology and an attendant plethora of apps now allow a growing number of people to track the minutiae of their lives as never before.</p> \n<p>James Norris, an entrepreneur in Oakland, California, has spent the past 15 years tracking, mapping and analysing his “firsts” — from his first kiss to the first time he saw fireworks on the Mall in Washington DC. Laurie Frick, an Austin, Texas, artist, is turning her sleep and movement patterns into colourful visualisations made of laser-cut paper and wood. And Nicholas Felton, a Brooklyn data scientist, has been publishing an annual report about every Twitter, Facebook, email and text message he sends. More than 30,300 follow his life on Twitter.</p> \n<p>Most extreme are “life-loggers”, who wear cameras day and night, jotting down every new idea and recording their daily activities in exacting detail. Even President Barack Obama is wearing a new Fitbit Surge, which monitors heart rate, sleep and location, on his wrist, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/21/obama-seen-sporting-new-f_n_6916228.html\" title=\"\">as a March photograph revealed</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a0bc575de33655525ed8528d64278081dd03d277\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431697435775/795ab368-33df-48f5-83c9-2676bcecd319-205x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Personal health monitoring devices\" width=\"205\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Devices aimed to monitor health is a rapidly expanding part of the health system.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Patterson Clark and Ariana Cha/Washington Post</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Tech firms are responding by inventing devices that can collect even more data, which the tech titans foresee as the real gold mine. At the Consumer Electronics Show in January in Las Vegas, new gizmos on display included a baby bottle that measures nutritional intake, a band that measures how high you jump and “smart” clothing connected to smoke detectors. Google is working on a smart contact lens that can continuously measure a person’s glucose levels in their tears. The Apple Watch has a heart-rate sensor and quantifies when you move, exercise or stand. The company also has filed a patent to upgrade its earbuds to measure blood oxygen and temperature.</p> \n<p>In the near future, companies plan trackers that will measure from the inside out – using chips that are ingestible or float in the bloodstream.</p> \n<p>Some physicians, academics and ethicists criticise tracking as prime evidence of the narcissism of the technological age – and one that raises serious questions about the accuracy and privacy of the health data collected, who owns it and how it should be used. There are also worries about the implications for broader surveillance by governments, such as what happened in the US with mobile phone providers and the National Security Agency.</p> \n<p>Critics point to the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2011/07/05/fitbit-moves-quickly-after-users-sex-stats-exposed/\" title=\"\">brouhaha in 2011</a>, when some owners of Fitbit exercise sensors noticed that their sexual activity – including information about the duration of an episode and whether it was “passive, light effort” or “active and vigorous” – was being publicly shared by default.</p> \n<p>They also worry that wearables will be used as “black boxes” in legal matters. Three years ago, after a San Francisco cyclist struck and killed a 71-year-old pedestrian, prosecutors obtained his data from Strava, a GPS-enabled fitness tracker, to show he had been speeding and blew through several stop signs before the accident. More recently, a law firm in Calgary, Alberta, is trying to use Fitbit data as evidence of injuries a client sustained in a car crash.</p> \n<p>More sophisticated tools in development, such as an app that analyses a bipolar person’s voice to predict a manic episode and injectables and implants that test blood, offer greater medical benefit but also pose greater risks. Des Spence, a Glasgow general practitioner, argued that unnecessary monitoring is creating anxiety among tracker-wearers. “Health and fitness have become the new social currency, spawning a ‘worried well’ generation,” he wrote in the April issue of BMJ, the former British Medical Journal. “Getting the data is much easier than making it useful,” said Deborah Estrin, a professor of computer science and public health at Cornell University in New York. Constantly measuring one’s heart rate may be helpful for someone heavily involved in sports or at risk of a heart attack. “But it’s unclear how important and meaningful it is for the everyday person,” she said.</p> \n<p>Estrin and other experts argue homo sapiens have survived for about 130,000 years without such technology because the human body already has a number of built-in alarm systems. Any mother who has been woken by a crying child knows a gentle press of the back of the wrist to a forehead is fast, free and eerily accurate in diagnosing a fever.</p> \n<p>Until three years ago it was nearly impossible for ordinary people to get a read-out about the state of their bodies. Now dozens of wearable technologies with names such as the Fitbit Surge, Misfit Shine and Jawbone UP have exploited the miniaturisation of computer components and the ubiquity of smartphones to create an industry that is expected to reach $50bn in sales by 2018, according to an estimate by Credit Suisse.</p> \n<p>The research firm <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2913318\" title=\"\">Gartner forecasts that 68.1m wearable devices will be shipped this year</a>. A growing percentage are being purchased by employers, including Bates College in Maine and IBM, as perks for their workers. A survey by Nielsen last year indicated that 61% of those aware of wearable technology for tracking and monitoring medical conditions use fitness bands.</p> \n<p>In March, when Apple announced its <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3045023/researchkit-healthkit-and-an-apple-for-your-health\" title=\"\">ResearchKit initiative</a> to allow people to share the information from their apps with researchers working on projects in asthma, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer and Parkinson’s, more than 41,000 people volunteered within the first five days.</p> \n<p>But it’s unclear whether young adults’ open attitude toward sharing their data will remain when the next generation of more invasive trackers becomes commonplace.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://wapo.st/1PxEutx\"> \n <video src=\"https://videos.posttv.com/washpost-production/The_Washington_Post/20150115/54b81a9ae4b06142c6330aab/54b81aa3e4b0f8e9e9d6f1f9_1413917648266-520npb_t_1421351609563_1920_1080_5400.mp4\" width=\"460\" height=\"259\" type=\"video/mp4\" controls=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></video> \n <figcaption>\n  Researchers in St. Petersburg, Florida, are conducting a study to determine whether using Fitbit activity trackers and other technology can help teens lose weight. Video: Whitney Shefte /Washington Post\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ginger.io, which was developed by data scientists from MIT, has created an app that can alert a mental health provider to the possibility of depression or a manic episode – based on how much a patient moves around or how many people they talk to that day. Silicon Valley-based Proteus Digital Health has developed a prototype of a chip the size of a grain of sand that can be embedded in a pill. When the pill is swallowed, the chip sends a signal that’s logged on to central servers that you can access on your phone or desktop.</p> \n<p>The life sciences unit of Google X, the search company’s secretive research lab, is working on building a nano-size particle that will travel in the bloodstream. The particles would circulate throughout the body and attach to particular types of cells, such as cancer cells, or to enzymes given off by plaque in the arteries before they are about to rupture or cause a heart attack or stroke. If the particles found questionable cells or enzymes, they would send a signal to a device worn outside the body that would transmit the information to the patient or to a physician.</p> \n<p>The innovation is outpacing the scientific and legal framework for testing and regulating such devices. The US Food and Drug Administration in January indicated it would regulate devices that are invasive but take a lighter touch on wearables.</p> \n<p>According to the agency’s draft guidelines, a product crosses into the territory of a medical device, which requires a rigorous and expensive FDA review, when its intended use refers to a specific disease or condition, or it presents an inherent risk to a user’s safety. That would essentially leave hundreds, if not thousands, of “low-risk general wellness” products – a category that presumably applies to the current incarnation of Fitbits – free from extra scrutiny.</p> \n<p>In the US they would still be subject to monitoring by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which has the power to recall products to protect the public from risk of injury or death. How the data that is generated from the devices is protected and shared is murky. In the US patient privacy rules don’t apply to most of the information the gadgets are tracking. Unless the data is being used by a physician to treat a patient, the companies that help track a person’s information aren’t bound by the same confidentiality, notification and security requirements as a doctor’s office or hospital.</p> \n<p>That means the data could theoretically be made available for sale to marketers, and eventually be worth billions to private companies that might not make the huge data sets free and open to publicly funded researchers.</p> \n<p>Larry Smarr’s journey into the data of his life began when he moved to California in 2000.</p> \n<p>“I had spent 28 years in the heartland of the obesity epidemic in Illinois. I had gained a lot of weight and wasn’t exercising. I got to La Jolla and looked around and said, ‘Oh, my God, if I don’t get with the programme, they are going to send me back,’” he recalled.</p> \n<p>Smarr came to California as a computer science professor to head a $400m multidisciplinary research institute for the University of California that has been called the West Coast equivalent of MIT’s famous <a href=\"http://www.media.mit.edu\" title=\"\">Media Lab</a>. Composed of scientists, artists and technologists, <a href=\"http://www.calit2.net\" title=\"\">Calit2</a> (or the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology) aims to rapidly develop prototypes of technological innovations and test them in the real world.</p> \n<p>Embracing the institute’s multidisciplinary philosophy, Smarr took a scientist’s approach to investigating himself. Although he had no previous experience in medicine, nutrition or biochemistry, he trained himself, he said, by reading more than 600 journal articles on monitoring and health.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ee1b8941ffd36f0520a556abe373c186f48cf98\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431697615580/b55a4928-5b3d-45c6-8d95-5d90a272674c-460x421.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearable electronic fitness devices\" width=\"460\" height=\"421\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smart garments are forecast to soon outpace sales of related devices.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Patterson Clark/Washington Post/Source: Gartner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He measured his way to lifestyle change: no coffee after 10am, because he tested how long the effects lasted after his last drop; 40 minutes on the elliptical, because that was how long it took for him to reach his optimal heart rate; new vitamin supplements every few months, as dictated by his evaluation of his blood work.</p> \n<p>“We are in a once-a-century period of discovery about the human organism,” Smarr said. Quoting science fiction author William Gibson, he said “the future is already here – it’s just not very evenly distributed”.</p> \n<p>Smarr’s mantra is that these devices and tests will help people take personal responsibility for their own health. And an increasing body of behavioural medical research has found that patients who track their diet, physical activity and weight achieve better results than those who don’t, suggesting that wearable monitors provide feedback that reinforces personal accountability.</p> \n<p>“The mythology in this country is you can do whatever you want to your body, and a doctor will give you a pill to fix it,” Smarr says. “That needs to change.” Few people may be willing to go as far as Smarr. In 2009, when blood tests showed he was secreting excessive amounts of something called C-reactive protein, a substance found in blood plasma that is a marker of inflammation, he took the results to his internist: “There’s something terrible going on.” The doctor asked how he felt. “Fine,” said Smarr, and so the doctor laughed and sent him home, he recalled.</p> \n<p>“This is when I began to realise there is a disconnect between science and medicine,” said Smarr, who countered by writing down how he was feeling in a diary. “I realised I could data-mine this information,” he said, on a spreadsheet with a scale for the severity of issue. He was surprised at all the things he had dismissed as minor: blurriness and stinging in his eyes for a short while – “like you touched jalape&ntilde;o” – arthritis, swelling in his belly. The record-keeping didn’t yield a diagnosis, so in 2011 he decided to try to identify the organisms in several months of stool samples. With more than 90% of the cells in the human body made up of other organisms, the idea of keeping one’s “microbiome” healthy was just taking off; Smarr was curious about how that applied to him.</p> \n<p>“You are an ecology, and the health of those bugs determine how you are,” he said. He looked at all his data and had a eureka moment: he had Crohn’s, an inflammatory bowel disease.</p> \n<p>Last year, Smarr ventured further in his quest for self-discovery. He got an MRI of his abdomen and used a 3D printer to create a model of his own colon. But that didn’t lead to any new insights, and the model is now a paperweight on his desk.</p> \n<p>One weekday afternoon in his lab, Smarr studied his life on a 5.5m by 2.5m monitor that spans most of the room. On the board were 150 key variables about his body over a 10-year period, displayed in coloured rectangles. Most were green, meaning they fall within the expected, healthy range. But some were yellow (one to 10 times outside the healthy range), and a handful were red (10 to 100 times outside the healthy range).</p> \n<p>According to the custom-built “future patient” program built by coders at the research centre Smarr oversees, the scientist’s body was still in attack mode for some reason.</p> \n<p>It has been nearly three years since Smarr discovered the issue, and he’s tens of thousands of metrics down the road, but he has yet to find a way to treat it. “People overestimate what knowledge can do for you,” he said with a shrug.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p><em>This article appeared in </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a><em>, which incorporates material from the Washington Post</em></p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431443107719/Larry-Smarr-a-professor-i-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Larry Smarr, a professor in Computer Science and Engineering, tracks his own biometric data.
