Many of them were dressed as famous Hollywood characters, and he saw the opportunity for a more personal project. “What interested me was seeing whether you could show the person behind the mask,” he says. “One performer backed out because he thought taking a picture without his mask on was unprofessional and insulting to the character.” Hermann hopes the photos come across as “a little surreal, a little weird. Instead of just picking the best-dressed ones, which almost looked like the real deal, I wanted characters with a little bit of oddness.” </p>\n<ul>\n <li><em>See more of his work at <a href=\"http://kenhermann.com/\">kenhermann.com</a></em><br /></li>\n</ul>","byline":"Alex Dean","body":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54226e7f40b56c32aef41b86f3472f26c0ff9883\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434636563379/aa46de1d-313e-4a9f-8f91-10a2c1b1fd3c-361x480.jpeg\" alt=\"Ken Hermann Hollywood Street Characters Street Performers\" width=\"361\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Minnie Mouse - Milagro Aguiar</strong> <br /><br /> “This was one of the first shots: I wanted one of the classic characters,” says Hermann. “I like the contrast between her age and the very childish, girly dress.”</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca34d33bb964bca04bd2cd6db9034c969b5d9c31\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434636660108/2b9bb3a4-8274-4c53-8946-3c681ef07d98-351x480.jpeg\" alt=\"Ken Hermann Hollywood Street Characters Street Performers\" width=\"351\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Captain Boulevard – Jason Hughes </strong><br /> <br />“This is a made-up superhero.
