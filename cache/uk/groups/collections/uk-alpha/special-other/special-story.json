No one knows how it started. I lost my brother and mother. I officially died three times of smoke inhalation in the first week and they had to resuscitate me. I&nbsp;had a tracheotomy for almost six&nbsp;months.</p> \n<p>When I got out of hospital after eight or nine months I was nearly four, and went to live with my father in Arizona. He told me he threw me out of a window to save me, jumped out and broke his leg. It turns out he was never there. My aunt told me he was sitting in a park because my mother had kicked him out of the house; another aunt told me he was in a bar. Some speculated he might have started it.</p> \n<p>My father was mean, and a drunk. When he drank he would blurt out things and I wouldn’t know whether they were true. He would say he’d started the fire hoping my brother would be saved and the rest of us would die. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had broken bones or bruises; I couldn’t go to school for three weeks because I was concussed after he threw me against a wall. I&nbsp;lived with him on and off until I&nbsp;was 13. If I annoyed him, he would send me back to Massachusetts, to family on my mother’s side, and then he’d come and take me back to Arizona. I&nbsp;dreaded him coming to get me; I&nbsp;would hide behind a door hoping he wouldn’t see me.</p> \n<p>When I was 13, I went to live with&nbsp;a relative again. We had an argument and she kicked me out. I&nbsp;lived on the streets of Boston for three months. A social worker, who was a&nbsp;customer at a restaurant where the cook used to sneak me food, put me in foster care.</p> \n<p>I was about eight when my father showed me this photo, from the original newspaper article. I said he was lying: “There’s no way I&nbsp;would have peed myself!” When I&nbsp;was 18, after leaving foster care, I&nbsp;went to the library to look at it. I&nbsp;was trying to figure out if it was actually me. My aunt showed me some photos of me around that age and that’s when I realised.</p> \n<p>I started researching, and one night&nbsp;in 2010 I got frustrated and&nbsp;hit&nbsp;my computer, and the photographer’s page came up. I&nbsp;emailed him. We appeared on the news and he took me to meet Alfred&nbsp;Chase, the firefighter who saved me. That’s when I found out what really happened.</p> \n<p>He told me he crawled down a&nbsp;hallway and came across a “pile”, which he realised was my brother lying on top of me. He passed me to another firefighter, George Girvan, who was on a ladder up to our second-floor window, then went back for my brother. He and a family friend’s daughter who was staying with us, Debbie, came out without a&nbsp;pulse. They managed to resuscitate them, but they died hours later. My mother was burned over 90% of her body and passed away two weeks later. I was the only one who didn’t suffer burns, because my brother was lying on top of me. I guess he was trying to protect me. He was two days shy of his seventh birthday. It was a relief to finally find out what happened, but I&nbsp;cried. It reinforced how many times my father, who is now dead, had lied to me.</p> \n<p>Now my boyfriend, whom I’ve been with for 15 years, is a firefighter. As annoying as it is that I&nbsp;can’t keep anything plugged in around the house because it might cause a fire, I&nbsp;feel safe.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> As told to Erica Buist.</p> \n<p>Are you in a famous photograph?

Sylviane’s jogging bottoms are a particular winner here: take away the water bottle and trainers, swap the tracksuit top for a white shirt, and you have some viable work trousers. Natalie’s Fila jacket is perfect for running, as well as for everyday. Ava looks cool in her graphic patterned leggings, and a long-sleeve jumper such as Lisskulla’s is ideal for yoga classes. Seasoned gym bunnies, meanwhile, will appreciate Elina’s coordinated outfit: those old leggings and baggy T-shirts can be relegated to the bin.<br /><strong>Melanie Wilkinson</strong></p>\n<p>Photographs: David Newby for the Guardian.
