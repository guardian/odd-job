Listen to the exclusive here and tell us what you make of it</p>","byline":"Harriet Gibsone","body":"<p>A few years ago, Stuart Braithwaite from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/mar/03/mogwai-review-driving-krautrock-played-seat-shakingly-loud\">Mogwai</a> forwarded fellow Scottish post-rock group the Twilight Sad an email from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/mar/31/the-cure-robert-smith-4-14-scream-new-album\">the Cure’s Robert Smith</a>, in which Smith said that he was a fan of the band. <br /></p> \n<p>“For as far back as I can remember, we have all been huge fans of the Cure, so reading that was obviously very mind blowing – although I was always slightly sceptical, thinking it was maybe Barry Burns from Mogwai, trying to pull some elaborate joke on us,” says Twilight Sad guitarist Andy MacFarlane.</p> \n<p>The email was no prank. So the band endeavoured to squeeze a little more from this celebrity endorsement. After the release of their third album – No One Can Ever Know – the Twilight Sad were planning a remix version of the record with bands such as the Horrors, and Liars, and decided to email Smith to see if the project was something that would interest him. Which it did, but because of tour commitments, he couldn’t make it happen. So they tried again.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/sep/09/the-cure-cover-the-beatles-exclusive\">Hear the Cure cover the Beatles on their first new recording for six years – exclusive</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“After we recorded Nobody Wants to be Here and Nobody Wants to Leave I sent it to Robert to have a listen, and he said it was ‘BEAUTIFUL’. We wanted to do something special for the It Never Was the Same single, as it was going to be the last release from the album. I knew it was a pretty far-fetched idea, but thought I might as well chance my arm and ask Robert if he’d be up for covering one of our songs to feature as a double A-side. I couldn’t believe it when he replied saying he’d like to cover There’s a Girl in the Corner. </p> \n<p>“He sent it over when we were playing San Francisco in March, and we listened to it over and over in the van, driving out after the gig. Hearing someone that we’ve all looked up to for so long sing and play one of our songs is definitely one of the most surreal moments that we’ve ever had.”</p> \n<p>So there you have it.

Intricate ‘crop circles’ with geometric designs about six feet (2 meters) in diameter were found on the seafloor off the coast of Amami-Ōshima Island. They turn out to be the work of this new species of pufferfish. Males construct these circles as spawning nests by swimming and wriggling in the seafloor sand","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Yoji Okata/ESF"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432216358391/03e90940-6ab5-4e8c-b22d-1f951e718806-2060x1379.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1379,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The nests, used only once, are made to attract females.
