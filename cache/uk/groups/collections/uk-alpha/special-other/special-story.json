London from Staffordshire, artist Daniel Frost fell in love with the city’s diversity ","standFirst":"<p>When he moved to London from Staffordshire, artist <a href=\"http://danielfrost.co.uk/\">Daniel Frost</a> fell in love with the city’s diversity. “Everyone was from different parts of the world, with different personalities, characters and styles,” he says. He is now based in Hackney, east London, and in a new fold-out book he celebrates the heads of the varied crowd he sees on his way to the studio every morning. “I didn’t want them to be stand-alone images – they’re meant to be seen together, like a crowd of people. I like how you can capture someone’s personality in a few simple shapes – you can learn a lot about a person from that.” </p>\n<ul>\n <li>Haircuts of Hackney (<a href=\"http://www.hoxtonminipress.com/collections/books/products/haircuts-of-hackney\">Hoxton Mini Press</a> &pound;12.95) is out 20 May<br /></li>\n</ul>","byline":"Kathryn Bromwich","body":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9204a1d738d3b72ebeae33f76f47a13712cb130\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431598672191/c271ed23-e515-45df-97b2-4663c6fa1771-1020x1020.jpeg\" alt=\"Beardway Market \" width=\"1020\" height=\"1020\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Beardway Market</strong> <br /> “As the name suggests this is mainly based on bar staff from Broadway Market,” says Frost. “It’s a modern take on 1950s rockabilly but with a trendy beard, with the tattoos feeding out of the back of the shirt.
