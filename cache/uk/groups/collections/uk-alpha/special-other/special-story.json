On Wednesday refugees entered through the border town of Ak&ccedil;akale, where they were being checked for health problems before being transferred to camps or allowed to join relatives in Turkey. Kurdish fighters are closing in on Isis in Tel Abyad, capturing towns and villages in the country’s north-east, supported by US-led airstrikes.
