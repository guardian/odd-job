Biggie was dead six weeks later’</p>","byline":"Interview by Jenny Stevens","body":"<p>When I first met Biggie Smalls (aka the Notorious BIG), I thought, “He’s going to rip my head off,” but he was the nicest guy you would ever want to meet. So friendly, with the softest handshake.</p> \n<p>In the early 90s, I was an indie-rock photographer. I worked with Nirvana, Sonic Youth and the Beastie Boys. But then I started getting hired by hip-hop artists – they wanted me because I made them look like rock stars. I’m a grunge guy, not a hip-hop guy, though, and I did not fit into their world.</p> \n<p>Everyone wanted to be shotpointing a gun at the lens. I had to ask the art directors to pull the bullets out of them so they wouldn’t shoot me by accident.</p> \n<p>I never saw Biggie with a gun though. I was hired to shoot his second album, Life After Death. The concept was very overt. The suit was made to look like an undertaker’s and they wante him in a graveyard. It was in the middle of the east coast-west coast feud and a lot of people were getting shot. Tupac had already been killed. They were turning up the drama with this album.</p> \n<p>The shoot took place in New York near Jackie Robinson Highway. Biggie was popular, but he wasn’t a legend yet. Still, it was the biggest job I’d ever had. I hired tonnes of speciality cameras and fancy lenses. The first shot we did became the album cover – Biggie standing in front of a hearse with the licence plate changed to B.I.G. When everything was in place, I asked my assistant to pass me my wide-angled lens. It wasn’t there. We searched everywhere, but the whole lot was gone: $15,000 of equipment. It must have been lifted while we were loading it into the van. I was nearly sick. I didn’t have time to think about what had happened, I just had to work through until the next break, when I sat in the graveyard on the phone to the insurance company.</p> \n<p>I took this up a hill in an area called Tombs of the Unknown Soldiers. It was a real effort getting Biggie up there. He had a huge entourage – multiple SUVs filled with bodyguards, pot smoke billowing out of the windows.</p> \n<p>I was hired by his manager Puffy – which is what he called himself before he became P Diddy. The guy was a real mastermind – he was the brains behind Bad Boy Records and the whole east-coast hip-hop movement. But he was also a jerk, and really difficult to deal with.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>P Diddy was a real mastermind. But he was also a jerk, and really difficult to deal with.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>At one point, we were looking for another location. The graveyard was so big, you had to drive around it. Puffy got in the front seat; Biggie got in the back. An Elvis song came on the CD: Suspicious Minds. Puffy went off: “What the hell is this crap?!” Then Biggie’s voice came from the back: “Man … chill out. Elvis was <em>cool</em>.”</p> \n<p>We curved up the hill and parked and Biggie got out of the car with his cane and hobbled to the edge of the tombstones. He had a lot of physical ailments – he walked slow and heavy, and had this wandering left eye, which really infects this image.</p> \n<p>I wanted the whole shot lined up with tombstones; no other distractions. The way that he is turned away from them is a symbol of defiance – a powerful stance that says: “You can’t touch me.”</p> \n<p>Biggie died six weeks later. He was gunned down in Los Angeles. Nobody ever proved who shot him.</p> \n<p>All these years later it’s still the most powerful image I have. The image of a young black man in a graveyard is politically very powerful. It was a news story every day then, and it still is now.<em> </em></p> \n<h2><strong>CV</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Born:</strong> San Francisco, 1963.</p> \n<p><strong>Studied:</strong> Parsons School of Design, New York.</p> \n<p><strong>Influences: </strong>Philippe Halsman, Robert Frank, Garry Winogrand, Diane Arbus.</p> \n<p><strong>Career high:</strong> “I just shot the campaign for the show Empire.

It is a disputed theory that states that black dogs are the last to get adopted at shelters, perhaps because of superstition or a perception that they are aggressive. The idea inspired Levy to begin his <a href=\"http://caninenoir.tumblr.com/\">Black Dog Project</a> on their behalf. The dogs Levy photographed came from owners he recruited through his Facebook page. He had also started working with abandoned dogs referred to him by shelters – sharing their photos online in search of permanent homes. They are difficult to photograph well. A <a href=\"http://book coming out in the fall, http://www.qbookshop.com/products/218451/9781631060885/Black-Dogs-Project.html\">book of the project</a> is due out later this year</p>","byline":"Fred Levy/fredlevyart.com","body":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58dc3652ba5fec6d442b72ff655f60136c72e23f\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/58dc3652ba5fec6d442b72ff655f60136c72e23f/0_57_3000_1943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aki - A  springer spaniel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"648\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Aki</strong> A springer spaniel.
