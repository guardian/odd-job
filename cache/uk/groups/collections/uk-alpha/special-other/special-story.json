To her, it’s a form of witchcraft, hence the name ‘Witchoria’: ‘Digital manipulation has given me the ability to create my own alternate realities where anything is possible. Sometimes it feels like magic.’ </p>","byline":"Morwenna Jones","body":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"858917aeeb9ee6f3438625f94e5474bf61fd35a6\"> \n <img

This weekend, however, an altogether different sub-culture was in charge, as Creepers, Zombies, Skeletons and thousands of children congregated to celebrate a common digital passion: Minecraft.</p> \n<p>Minecraft involves exploring a world made out of digital blocks, which can be broken up and made into new materials and structures, from pickaxes and swords to buildings and carts. Its “creative mode” puts the emphasis on building, while its “survival mode” sees players having to battle monsters which come out at night.</p> \n<p>Initially a PC game, it has since crossed on to games consoles, smartphones and tablets, finding a huge audience of children along the way.</p> \n<p>The game’s developer, Mojang, brought its Minecon conference to London for the first time, with 10,000 fans filling the venue – a small sliver of the 70 million people who have bought the game since 2009, enticed by its blocky blend of crafting and battling.</p> \n<p>Those fans made Mojang worth $2.5bn to Microsoft when it bought the Swedish developer in 2014, and since then the company has been keen to reassure them that the new ownership will not be changing its focus.</p> \n<p>“People had their concerns, and that totally makes sense. But people are starting to see that Mojang hasn’t gone away: we’re still here, the same people working in the same office in the same city, and we have a new partner in Microsoft,” said Mojang’s chief operating officer, Vu Bui. “Mojang is still driving what Minecraft is: it’s not like an acquisition where the product is handed off to a whole new team and everything changes. It’s only been eight months, so we haven’t had time to show the community yet what the future is going to look like. But we also haven’t scared them by going in any weird directions that would seem out of character.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b61003613d9e4b0f77307cd59fc9b89e59cf2f1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436033283719/27e28793-8fa8-4c3a-9712-6672ff7f3c32-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Minecraft's main character, Steve.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Minecraft’s main character Steve heads to work (pursued by a green creeper, right).</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dotted around the show were artworks depicting popular characters and monsters from the game, with the centrepiece being a giant Ender Dragon hanging off a blocky Big Ben. Children posed for selfies with character statues while patiently explaining to parents who they were. Some had come in costumes – most involving cardboard boxes – to take part in an onstage fancy dress contest judged by Mojang staff.</p> \n<p>There were stands for the company’s merchandising partners, including book publisher Egmont and toy maker Mattel, which is launching an app to help children make stop-motion films using its range of Minecraft mini-figures. Meanwhile Think Geek’s stand, selling toy diamond swords for &pound;20 each, was doing a roaring trade.</p> \n<p>The stars of the show were the gamers who run YouTube channels showing off their exploits in Minecraft, some of which are among the most popular on Google’s online video service.</p> \n<p>British gamer Joseph Garrett, for example, has more than 6 million subscribers for his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj5i58mCkAREDqFWlhaQbOw\" title=\"\">Stampy channel</a>, aimed at children, which was the fourth biggest channel on YouTube in 2014 with more than 2.2 billion video views – just behind Katy Perry’s 2.4 billion, but ahead of Shakira’s 2 billion.</p> \n<p>Garrett’s “Stampy and Friends” session was the big draw of Minecon’s first morning, with close to 5,000 children and parents gathering at the event’s main stage to watch him play live with some of his online collaborators.</p> \n<p>The likes of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/sqaishey\" title=\"\">Sqaishey Quack</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/iBallisticSquid\" title=\"\">iBallisticSquid</a> may not be familiar in the wider world, but to their young audience they are genuine celebrities. When the compere asked children in the audience how much time they spend watching Minecraft on YouTube, one mother’s muttered “Years!” sparked laughter from the parents around her.</p> \n<p>“Minecraft is a bona fide phenomenon on YouTube,” said Ryan Wyatt, YouTube’s global head of gaming. “Its beauty is its openness: anyone can create a new Minecraft world and share it with others. The result is really rich, often weirdly wonderful content and very engaged communities.”</p> \n<p>Wyatt added that, in 2014 in the US, Minecraft was the second most searched-for subject on YouTube. “Could anyone have predicted the huge success of Minecraft way back when? I doubt it. But content beauty is in the eye of the beholder,” he said. “Long may the reign of this game continue.”</p> \n<p>Microsoft kept a low-profile presence at Minecon, although the company was running sessions showcasing Minecraft’s use in schools and giving private demonstrations of the game running on its HoloLens augmented-reality headset, which is currently in development.</p> \n<p>Mojang also had other developers exhibiting their wares in an “indie zone” at the show.</p> \n<p>“The big appeal of Minecraft to children is that it’s their world: it belongs to their imagination and no one is telling them what to do in it. They have the complete freedom to create whatever they want, without the pressures of outside influence,” said Chris O’Shea of developer Cowly Owl, who was showing off his Monster Mingle children’s app.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7970d61d7e7e11407d9f5e667d6f982b31cc42d3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436033385498/4210c70b-e3ba-4383-b992-e7b66f76aa64-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Francesca Stevens, aged 7, in her costume for the fancy dress contest at Minecon.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Francesca Stevens, aged 7, in her costume for the fancy dress contest at Minecon.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose /Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I’ve personally taught a four year-old to use it, who now, at eight, is building massive structures – moving underground train systems and all kinds of contraptions, surpassing anything I could build. I don’t see it as a craze like other mobile games. It’s easily got another 10 years’ run. The freedom of expression, the power of creation and imagination never gets old.”</p> \n<p>This points to the key reasons for Minecraft’s popularity with parents. The game values crafting as highly as it does fighting, while its creator has been careful not to be over-aggressive in its merchandising strategy or in how it charges people to play. Its moves into education, meanwhile, are aiming to persuade teachers that Minecraft can be a good teaching aid for everything from history and physics to computer coding.</p> \n<p>“A lot of people think now that children play so many digital games and spend so much time in front of their screen, they’ve maybe become disconnected from other people,” said Bui. “But people connect in different ways: they can communicate with a lot of people from their bedroom and less when they leave – but maybe that time, when you add it up, is the same amount of human interaction.</p> \n<p>“But there are also a lot of people who interact in the real world when it comes to Minecraft, meeting up and playing together. That’s why we love being able to bring the community together like this once a year.”</p> \n<h2>MINE FACTS</h2> \n<p>■ Minecraft has sold more than 70m copies since its launch in 2009.</p> \n<p>■ The original main character was called Steve, but in April he was joined by an alternative default character, Alex – a woman with a red ponytail. .</p> \n<p>■ In April 2015 alone, 3.9 billion Minecraft-related videos were watched on YouTube ,according to research firms Octoly and Newzoo.</p> \n<p>■ Minecraft’s educational version, MinecraftEdu, is being given to every secondary school in Northern Ireland free, in a government-funded project.</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436033095776/Attendees-at-Minecrafts-M-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Attendees at Minecraft's Minecon exhibition in the ExCeL Centre, London Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer","credit":"Katherine Anne Rose/Observer","altText":"Attendees at Minecraft's Minecon exhibition in the ExCeL Centre, London","cleanCaption":"Attendees at Minecraft's Minecon exhibition in the ExCeL Centre, London Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436033284356/27e28793-8fa8-4c3a-9712-6672ff7f3c32-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Minecraft’s main character Steve heads to work (pursued by a green creeper, right).","credit":"PR","altText":"Minecraft's main character, Steve.","cleanCaption":"Minecraft’s main character Steve heads to work (pursued by a green creeper, right)."},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436033387011/4210c70b-e3ba-4383-b992-e7b66f76aa64-1360x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1360,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Francesca Stevens, aged 7, in her costume for the fancy dress contest at Minecon.
