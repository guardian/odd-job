The woman hosting this Tupperware party bought a rake to make it stand up three inches’","standFirst":"<p>‘Look at that carpet! The woman hosting this Tupperware party bought a rake to make it stand up three inches’</p>","byline":"Interview by Kate Abbott","body":"<p>When I left the Peace Corps, in the 1970s, I got a job as the staff photographer at&nbsp;a newspaper in <a href=\"http://www.cityoflivermore.net/\" title=\"\">Livermore, a small suburban city in California</a>. It didn’t seem particularly well-to-do, but as soon as my wife and I got there we were in shock: everyone our age already had two cars, all the mod cons, everything. Because we’d lived abroad, we had nothing.</p> \n<p>I decided to photograph the most normal things, the stuff people never think to show. I made a list of 200 classic&nbsp;suburban moments: people having barbecues, riding their bikes, doing the dishes, laying turf, playing Ping-Pong – and throwing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF9mTGm8Suo\" title=\"\">Tupperware parties</a>. I&nbsp;decided I wouldn’t set anything up or fake things. So when I got an invite to this party, I went along.</p> \n<p>Tupperware is a classic, as American as apple pie. It’s tied up with the dream of plenty, but it’s also about being thrifty, so you can preserve both your food and your way of life. The woman hosting this party is standing beside me. She’s not in the shot. And look at her shag carpet! She’d&nbsp;recently bought a rake to make it stand up two or three inches. You could walk across it&nbsp;and see your footprints.</p> \n<p>The lady standing up wasn’t friends with the others, though. She was a professional salesperson who went from town to town within a 30-mile radius, working on commission. Here she’s selling a standard eight-quart bowl and spinner. On the side of her coat you can see all the awards she’s won for outstanding sales. This woman devotes her life to selling Tupperware and she’s dressed up nice. I love her white boots. You wouldn’t know it from their deadpan faces, but I can assure you that this was a lively party. The ladies were all having fun. There’s a glass of wine in front of each of them, and that’s&nbsp;a sure sign of a good time.</p> \n<p>Because I worked for the local newspaper, everyone knew who I was, which was important for my project. It’s not like being a photographer with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2013/dec/06/125-years-of-national-geographic-photography\" title=\"\">National Geographic</a>, where you work on one project for two months, then leave. I had to be there all year, invisible, to capture glimpses of real life, to show who we were as a nation. I&nbsp;wasn’t critiquing these people, though. I was fascinated by them. And it didn’t take my wife and me long to catch up with the suburban lifestyle. That American dream – two cars and a fridge full of food – is a way of life emulated by people all&nbsp;over the world.</p> \n<p>Eventually, I had enough images to do my book, <a href=\"http://www.billowens.com/suburbia/\" title=\"\">Suburbia</a>. I kept a box of outtakes, the bad photographs, for 40 years. One day, I told my&nbsp;son I wanted to burn them, like Edward Weston did. But then I was contacted by a woman who told me she represented a collector who wanted outtakes. I said: “<em>What</em>? He wants all my prints that have been in a box?” Two months later, she told me she had sold 1,000 of them for $200 each and sent me a cheque for $200,000. I couldn’t keep that money, so I gave it to my son.</p> \n<p>I’ve taken photographs that have been viewed by millions of people. It&nbsp;was me who photographed the Hells&nbsp;Angels beating people up at <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/theguardian/2011/dec/08/rolling-stones-concert-altamont-1969\" title=\"\">that Rolling Stones concert in Altamont in 1969</a>. But I’m not proud of that image. I’m proud of the Tupperware.
