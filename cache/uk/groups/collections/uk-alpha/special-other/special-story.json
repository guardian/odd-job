He explains that contact with Mojang began in 2012, and that the partnership has so far raised nearly $3m for real building projects.</p> \n<p>His colleague Jos&eacute; Chong talks about the definition of public spaces: anywhere people meet, shop, play sport... “All places publicly owned or for public use, accessible and enjoyable by all for free and without a profit motive,” is the official definition. “This is something where we are facing a lot of problems in many countries,” he adds.

The process involves British developer FyreUK, which uses source materials like Google maps, plans and photos to build the virtual versions of the cities in Minecraft. Then UN-Habitat runs workshops with citizens using those builds to get their ideas on how their city’s public space should develop - and often the resulting plans are used for real building works.</p>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-55991986e4b00bdd27707d1f","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-05T12:08:59Z","body":"<p>Block By Block seems an inspiring project: Eugenio Gastelum Pons from Mexico is talking about getting children involved in creating the designs for new parks, figuring out what they want from basketball courts to lighting, with Minecraft the conduit for their ideas to reach city planners.</p> \n<p>Matt Needler and Phil Southam from FyreUK are showing some of the models they’ve built for Block By Block, starting with one in Nepal:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vine.co/v/e1l2lwjMMVx\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/e1l2lwjMMVx/embed/simple\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>“It’s quite a fun challenge, because if you’ve seen our videos, you’ll know we aren’t usually building real structures,” says Needler. “It’s been really interesting trying to find things in Minecraft that can represent things in real life,” adds Southam.</p> \n<p>They show their biggest model, built for a space in Haiti, which is massive. “We want to make it as detailed and accurate as possible,” says Needler. “We want to make it somewhere you can visit <em>in</em> Minecraft.” Meanwhile Southam talks about the experience of visiting the real cities after creating the builds: “I’m always worried I’m going to have missed a corner or something!”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vine.co/v/e1lEgQUDIi1\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://vine.co/v/e1lEgQUDIi1/embed/simple\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>“The fact that we can produce something using a game that helps people in the real world is really special,” says Southam, before handing over to Mojang’s Vu Bui, who explains that the original idea came from an outside organisation in Sweden, using Minecraft in an urban regeneration project.</p> \n<p>“To be able to use what is designed and created purely as a game in things that are not directly gaming-related... and to use that to help people’s lives, is really special for us. This is not ‘the architect version’, this is just the pure game, but it can be used for uses outside what it was originally intended for, which is really exciting for us,” says Bui.</p> \n<p>Currently, UN-Habitat is running between 30 and 35 projects, with 12 of those using Minecraft, with one having been completed. “By the end of this year we should be at about five, and with more finishing in 2016,” says Westerberg. Meanwhile, Needler says FyreUK is exploring the idea of making its builds available for the wider Minecraft community to explore. But they won’t be editable: only people in the cities covered by the projects will be involved in that process.</p>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-559923b9e4b032a39a3ba844","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-05T12:33:37Z","body":"<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/activrightbrain/statuses/617671156120821760\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">At the world's largest live <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Minecraft?src=hash\">#Minecraft</a> show Olivia is sat on the floor playing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CutTheRope?src=hash\">#CutTheRope</a>.
