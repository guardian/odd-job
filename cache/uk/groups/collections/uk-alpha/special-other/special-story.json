Stylist: Melanie Wilkinson. Photography: David Newby ","standFirst":"<p>If you haven’t worn dungarees since you were playing in the sandpit, now’s the time to reconsider them. Indigo flares, as worn here by Ava, will let you dabble in the 70s trend without looking as if you are wearing noughties boot-cuts, while a clean-lined cotton pair such as Lisskulla’s will look sleek with a crisp shirt. Take a leaf out of Elina’s book and style with flat boots for a tougher take on the trend, or go for a timeless look with Sylviane’s effortless blue denim plus pale grey. Natalie’s distressed pair offers a refreshing break from skinny jeans; team with a boxy jacket for a decidedly grownup look. <strong>Melanie Wilkinson</strong></p>\n<p>Photographs: David Newby for the Guardian.
