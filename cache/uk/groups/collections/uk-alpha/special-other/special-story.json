</p>","byline":"Nadia Khomami","body":"<p>A survivor of the 7/7 bombings, who has never publicly spoken about her experience, has created an animation video detailing the attack and thanking the “guardian angel” who helped her on the day.</p> \n<p>Georgina Ferguson was on her way to work on 7 July 2005, when the underground train on which she was travelling was blown up by one of the four suicide bombers who attacked London’s transport network, killing 52 people. She has been reluctant to talk about her memories of that day, to the extent that many of her friends don’t even know she was involved in the tragedy.</p> \n<p>Now, in what she calls an act of “remembrance, tribute and gratitude”, the graphic designer and teacher from south London has made a video to mark the 10-year anniversary of the event and to thank the stranger who helped her move on.</p> \n<p>“I was one of the Londoners involved in the King’s Cross bombings,” Ferguson wrote in the description to the video. “That morning I found myself on the carriage behind the one that was bombed, in which 26 people lost their lives.</p> \n<p>“I have never publicly spoken about what happened that day. Nor do a lot of my friends know that I was even involved. A year ago I realised that it was going to be the 10-year anniversary this July and decided that this would be a good time to share my experience. I am no wordsmith so I thought it might be best to use animation to communicate my story; as a motion graphic designer this felt most appropriate to me.</p> \n<p>“This is my story of Seven Seven, and how a stranger’s kindness helped me get out and start to move on. I never asked my guardian angel’s name, something I regret as I’ve never been able to really thank them.

Amid crashing sounds and a piercing background noise, she explains where she was when the bomb went off and how she got out of the underground train. She recalls:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I had a new job, it was my second day and I didn’t want to be late. I waited for a train on the platform. It was really busy, so I moved along a carriage. It was only the next carriage, but moving that small distance would minutes later save my life ...</p> \n <p>There was soot coming through the ceiling. I and many others believed there was a fire. I looked at the faces around me, everyone was panicking. People were yelling at the others to stop screaming, people were speculating about where the soot was coming from. I couldn’t see anything, no one could, there were too many people in the way.</p> \n <p>I didn’t know what was happening. I felt afraid, I felt alone, I believed I was going to die, and started to cry. Out of nowhere a man took a photo of me. Another man nearby saw it happening and tried to comfort me, it was only then that I realised that I still had my headphones in. When we spoke I began to calm down ...</p> \n <p>The man that helped me earlier remained by my side the whole time. I was worried about being late for my new job, I still thought I had to get there. </p> \n <p>I was surprised to see that there was chaos above the ground too. We walked down the road, aimlessly at first. People kept approaching us and asking if we were okay. I had no idea why, but I now know it was because I had a black face from the soot.</p> \n <p>We ended up walking all the way to Angel, where we tried to find a cab. Some passersby tried to help, others just helped themselves. Eventually I got hold of my mum, I explained I’d been in a train crash, it was not until then that I realised what had happened. </p> \n <p>As the man left the cab he assured me that I shouldn’t let this experience affect my life. I wish I had asked his name. The following Monday I was back on the tube.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/132068126\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/132068126\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Ferguson’s video comes as plans are put in place to mark the 10-year anniversary of one of the deadliest terror attacks Britain has witnessed. Survivors of bombings and relatives of those who died will join David Cameron, Boris Johnson and other politicians and members of the emergency services at memorial events next week.</p> \n<p>Ferguson, now the mother of a young son, ends her video with the note: “This animation was created by Georgina Ferguson to share her memory of 7th July 2005 ... to say thank you to her guardian angel for helping her ... and pay tribute to the 52 people who lost their lives that day.

I wish you no ill will, but I am going to resist.” I&nbsp;think I told him I loved him’","byline":"Theo Simon","body":"<p>I had been involved in the road protests at <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/gallery/2012/sep/28/twyford-down-m3-protest-pictures\">Twyford Down</a> in the early 90s, but Newbury bypass was the moment when direct action really entered the public consciousness.</p> \n<p>At the start, the protests were simply mass resistance – people getting in the way of diggers. It was very successful at first, but the police got wise and sent in hundreds of security. So we set up nine camps and began to “tree-sit” in the woodland around the proposed bypass route. I was arrested on my first day and banned from the site.</p> \n<p>The protests became a long game of cat and mouse: lots of drawn-out evictions (getting the protesters out of trees) and arrests. The police cut off branches from below, or sent in climbers, or cherry pickers. Road protests are quite traumatic: you become closely identified with the environment you’re trying to protect, and then it gets destroyed. I’ve seen lots of problems afterwards, with drugs and alcohol. Back then there was no support system; it’s better now.</p> \n<p>A few months into the protests, I broke my bail to join the crowds watching an eviction. I was at the base of a tree, outside a police cordon, that was attached to another tree inside the cordon via a pair of rope walkways. I decided to climb it. I’m no climber, so it was scary, but most of the adrenaline came from the fact that I knew I would be arrested. When I got to the top, a cheer went up.</p> \n<p>The police sent up a professional climber. In the photograph, I’m struggling because I’m trying to stop him attaching his carabiner clip and rope to me. I spoke to him as we always speak to authorities: “You don’t have to do this. I want you to think again. I wish you no ill will, but I am going to resist.” I think I told him I loved him. But he managed to get the clip on me, and I was whisked to the ground.</p> \n<p>Of course our campaign was last-ditch – all road protests are. But it’s always worth resisting because it sends a powerful signal. For the first time, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_wEQoj5fgI\">the media were reporting heavily on an environmental campaign</a>, and I think what we were doing started to gain public approval. Very few new roads were built after that, certainly nothing on the previous scale. Newbury sowed the seed for many other campaigns, too, most notably against GM crops, and that led to the growth of the organic sector, so I’m proud of that.</p> \n<p>Recently, I decided to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000932\">stand for the Greens at the election</a>, in Somerton and Frome. I was standing against David Rendel, the Lib Dem who, when he was the MP at the time of the protests, advocated the building of the bypass. So I made a bit of that. He lost to the Tories.</p> \n<p>My view now is the same as it was 20 years ago – all road building has to stop. We need a shift to sustainable transport. We’re addicted to cars – I own one, as I have no alternative way of getting around. But this has to change.</p> \n<p>Newbury destroyed my fear of arrest – I’ve been arrested 13 times now. I’m currently awaiting trial for blockading the gate to the dock where Trident is being serviced in Plymouth. But if I lose, my neighbour, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/michael-eavis\">Michael Eavis</a>, says he’ll pay my costs.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Interview by Hannah Booth.</p> \n<p>Are you in a famous photograph?
