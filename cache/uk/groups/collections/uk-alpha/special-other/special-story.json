He was very concerned that, despite all that was being written and photographed about the area, where tight-knit communities were being pulled apart by redevelopment, its people were being forgotten.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69696d14a99bb0fb573ed818d677be7f5edb10cd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431961081572/02613e5c-fed9-41d2-8f12-51b0f9821422-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Street football team in Toxteth\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A street football team in Toxteth, Liverpool, in 1974</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> Who were they? As a young photographer, I set out with David to find them, to tell their story in words and pictures as they went about their daily lives. </p> \n<p>We started at the Bedford Stores, which had been recently relocated across the road to the new Myrtle Street shopping parade. Mr and Mrs Boswick and their staff told of former days when the Bedford Stores was a high-class grocer’s serving the wealthy in the area. They wanted to keep some of the ambience of the store in its new “supermarket-type” venue. We built up our contacts from there.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36aa082e8502391b0a2af44798602fb2b3c86c1d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431961492708/96bebf21-e4e5-4ed1-8ea2-e2466f8da37e-278x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Patricia at the grocery shop.\" width=\"278\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young woman in Ali’s News</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ebeb22c630aaa360d13573ce2adead1bd76d252\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431961220832/e4ddb18b-2fef-410e-933c-4a79a33ba6cd-317x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Toxteth - Shopping\" width=\"317\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shopping in Ali’s News</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The resulting Bedford Street exhibition was shown at the Liverpool Academy of Arts, and later the Half Moon Gallery in London.
