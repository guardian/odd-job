an assignment in Los Angeles in March, Danish photographer Ken Hermann became interested in the street performers he’d spot near his hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. Many of them were dressed as famous Hollywood characters, and he saw the opportunity for a more personal project. “What interested me was seeing whether you could show the person behind the mask,” he says. “One performer backed out because he thought taking a picture without his mask on was unprofessional and insulting to the character.” Hermann hopes the photos come across as “a little surreal, a little weird. Instead of just picking the best-dressed ones, which almost looked like the real deal, I wanted characters with a little bit of oddness.” </p>\n<ul>\n <li><em>See more of his work at <a href=\"http://kenhermann.com/\">kenhermann.com</a></em><br /></li>\n</ul>","byline":"Alex Dean","body":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54226e7f40b56c32aef41b86f3472f26c0ff9883\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434636563379/aa46de1d-313e-4a9f-8f91-10a2c1b1fd3c-361x480.jpeg\" alt=\"Ken Hermann Hollywood Street Characters Street Performers\" width=\"361\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Minnie Mouse - Milagro Aguiar</strong> <br /><br /> “This was one of the first shots: I wanted one of the classic characters,” says Hermann. “I like the contrast between her age and the very childish, girly dress.”</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca34d33bb964bca04bd2cd6db9034c969b5d9c31\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434636660108/2b9bb3a4-8274-4c53-8946-3c681ef07d98-351x480.jpeg\" alt=\"Ken Hermann Hollywood Street Characters Street Performers\" width=\"351\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Captain Boulevard – Jason Hughes </strong><br /> <br />“This is a made-up superhero.
