We’ve got <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHtDo-sfU3o\">a zombie special clip </a>to kick off this week’s chart – a Lego brick film featuring Norman Reedus’s character Daryl Dixon. The zombie killer’s story has been recreated using more than 250,000 bricks and took Canadian film maker MonsieurCaron a month to create.</p> \n<p>Staying with zombies – no, sorry, moving on to politicians – David Cameron’s general election victory spawned a series of spoofs, and one of the best is the self-confessed Spider-Man 3 fan doing the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aBoZNI_tY\">spidey strut</a> in New York.

Those of you into comedy classics will remember the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GQSwMCHJNU\">National Lampoon’s Vacation</a> series of films. The 1983 National Lampoon holiday to Walley World has been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScMOyURq9os\">remade as Vacation</a>, with Ed Helms playing a grown-up Rusty Griswold who takes his wife Debbie – Christina Applegate – and their sons on the trip of a lifetime. Original stars Chevy Chase and Beverly D’Angelo make a return appearance as Clark and Ellen Griswold. There’s another blast from the past – this time from the world of DC Comics – as CBS reveals <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm46-envrHo&amp;list=PL-DfNcB3lim9IZmUXEjE1Ov0Ir1NDa3Yr&amp;index=2\">a first look at the new Supergirl</a>. </p> \n<p>The Simpsons are a more recent animated classic but the future of Bart, Homer and Co could be in some doubt with news of the departure of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/may/14/harry-shearer-ned-flanders-mr-burns-set-to-leave-the-simpsons\">Harry Shearer, who voices Ned Flanders, Mr Burns and other characters.</a> We’ve got <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-uSJnwCTWc\">a tribute to his amazing vocal talents</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9aBoZNI_tY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9aBoZNI_tY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Cameron’s spidey strut\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>1) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHtDo-sfU3o\">The LEGO Walking Dead -
