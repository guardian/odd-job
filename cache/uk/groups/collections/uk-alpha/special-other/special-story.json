Dutch circus lover Jaap Best devoted his life to collecting vintage posters from across Europe. After he died in 2002, the Jaap Best Circus Archive Foundation bequeathed his 8,000 posters to the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, which put them on an online database (<a href=\"http://www.circusmuseum.nl/eng/\">www.circusmuseum.nl/eng/</a>). Foundation board member Herman Voogd says: “These are historic documents. You can think what you like about it, but the old style of circus is disappearing: in many places they don’t allow live animal shows any more.

I guess he was trying to protect me’</p>","byline":"Tammi Brownlee","body":"<p>I don’t remember anything before the fire. It was in an apartment building and we lived on the second floor. No one knows how it started. I lost my brother and mother. I officially died three times of smoke inhalation in the first week and they had to resuscitate me. I&nbsp;had a tracheotomy for almost six&nbsp;months.</p> \n<p>When I got out of hospital after eight or nine months I was nearly four, and went to live with my father in Arizona. He told me he threw me out of a window to save me, jumped out and broke his leg. It turns out he was never there. My aunt told me he was sitting in a park because my mother had kicked him out of the house; another aunt told me he was in a bar. Some speculated he might have started it.</p> \n<p>My father was mean, and a drunk. When he drank he would blurt out things and I wouldn’t know whether they were true. He would say he’d started the fire hoping my brother would be saved and the rest of us would die. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had broken bones or bruises; I couldn’t go to school for three weeks because I was concussed after he threw me against a wall. I&nbsp;lived with him on and off until I&nbsp;was 13. If I annoyed him, he would send me back to Massachusetts, to family on my mother’s side, and then he’d come and take me back to Arizona. I&nbsp;dreaded him coming to get me; I&nbsp;would hide behind a door hoping he wouldn’t see me.</p> \n<p>When I was 13, I went to live with&nbsp;a relative again. We had an argument and she kicked me out. I&nbsp;lived on the streets of Boston for three months. A social worker, who was a&nbsp;customer at a restaurant where the cook used to sneak me food, put me in foster care.</p> \n<p>I was about eight when my father showed me this photo, from the original newspaper article. I said he was lying: “There’s no way I&nbsp;would have peed myself!” When I&nbsp;was 18, after leaving foster care, I&nbsp;went to the library to look at it. I&nbsp;was trying to figure out if it was actually me. My aunt showed me some photos of me around that age and that’s when I realised.</p> \n<p>I started researching, and one night&nbsp;in 2010 I got frustrated and&nbsp;hit&nbsp;my computer, and the photographer’s page came up. I&nbsp;emailed him. We appeared on the news and he took me to meet Alfred&nbsp;Chase, the firefighter who saved me. That’s when I found out what really happened.</p> \n<p>He told me he crawled down a&nbsp;hallway and came across a “pile”, which he realised was my brother lying on top of me. He passed me to another firefighter, George Girvan, who was on a ladder up to our second-floor window, then went back for my brother. He and a family friend’s daughter who was staying with us, Debbie, came out without a&nbsp;pulse. They managed to resuscitate them, but they died hours later. My mother was burned over 90% of her body and passed away two weeks later. I was the only one who didn’t suffer burns, because my brother was lying on top of me. I guess he was trying to protect me. He was two days shy of his seventh birthday. It was a relief to finally find out what happened, but I&nbsp;cried. It reinforced how many times my father, who is now dead, had lied to me.</p> \n<p>Now my boyfriend, whom I’ve been with for 15 years, is a firefighter. As annoying as it is that I&nbsp;can’t keep anything plugged in around the house because it might cause a fire, I&nbsp;feel safe.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> As told to Erica Buist.</p> \n<p>Are you in a famous photograph?
