But they should ask why it’s so popular","byline":"Polly Toynbee","body":"<p>Groping for British emblems to bind together an ever more diverse and fissiparous society, politicians struggle to find cultural and emotional social glue. Make your own list from the Queen to Glastonbury, but overwhelmingly people put the NHS and the BBC right up there near the top, deep-dyed into British DNA.</p> \n<p>But not this government. Whatever Conservatism once meant, it’s no longer about conserving precious things. The NHS staggers under the fragmenting <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2013/mar/30/health-act-means-death-of-nhs\" title=\"\">Lansley act</a> and the BBC is under more severe assault than ever before, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/14/jonathan-dimbleby-warns-of-powerful-vested-interests-attacking-bbc-licence-fee\" title=\"\">threatened with licence fee cuts</a> – and perilous charter renewal ahead. Is it payback time for Rupert Murdoch’s election support? According to BBC political editor Nick Robinson, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/21/nick-robinson-cameron-threatened-close-down-bbc-election-bus\" title=\"\">Cameron on his battle-bus said of the BBC</a>: “I’m going to close them down.” Joke or threat, it’s too close to what many in his party want to be laughed off. Many of the newer Tory MPs, Thatcher’s children, detest the very existence of the BBC – its phenomenal success an affront to market ideology.</p> \n<p>Threats come thick and fast. John Whittingdale, newly promoted culture secretary, called the &pound;145 licence fee “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2014/oct/29/bbc-licence-fee-poll-tax-tory-john-whittingdale\" title=\"\">worse than the poll tax</a>” in his former role as head of the culture select committee. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27840991\" title=\"\">complained this month</a> that the licence fee was “a large amount for many families” and “needs looking at”. Other Tories shed crocodile tears for the poor who can’t afford the TV licence, calling for non-payment to be decriminalised – a compassion not shown to twice as many prosecuted for not paying council tax.</p> \n<p>Decriminalisation would lose the BBC an estimated &pound;200m a year – and that’s deliberate. The BBC may lose &pound;600m if forced to carry the Department for Work and Pensions’ cost of exempting over-75s from the licence fee. And there’s a proposed five more static years to add to the current seven-year licence fee freeze.</p> \n<p>The risk is that these become seen as “moderate” cuts, a “compromise” with the factions that want the BBC killed off. Yet they are so severe that they risk sending the BBC into a downward spiral, where fewer good programmes mean weakened public support, allowing yet more cuts. The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/bbc-loses-control-olympic-tv-rights-discovery-eurosport\" title=\"\">loss of the Olympics to Eurosport</a> from 2022, for an unaffordable &pound;920m, is exactly what the BBC’s head of sport warned recently: as BBC income shrivels it can’t compete – and the licence fee looks less good value.</p> \n<p>Barely a day goes by without the Mail, Telegraph and Rupert Murdoch’s papers attacking the BBC. This week’s Sunday Times had a full page of gleeful, barely veiled encouragement to the young <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Society/article1574591.ece?linkId=15185879\" title=\"\">not to pay their licence fee</a> if they only watch catch-up TV on iPads or smartphones. It reported 150,000 more households in the past three months abandoned traditional TV and the licence fee, claiming not to watch it live. Everyone admits there’s a growing problem with attaching the licence fee to a TV set – but that’s easily fixed with a household fee or by bringing iPlayer under the licence.</p> \n<p>Murdoch bullies ceaselessly for a subscription system, to shrink the BBC to the tiny size of America’s PBS. His paper’s poll shows apparent “waning” public support, with only 48% saying the licence fee is value for money, slightly more preferring funding by advertising. Left out was the inconvenient answer to one poll question which found only 9% want it funded by subscription. The BBC quotes 11 other polls showing that support for the licence fee at 42% is higher than for any other form of funding. What’s astonishing is that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28401160\" title=\"\">96% of people use the BBC every week</a>, spending an average of 18.5 hours watching, listening or online.</p> \n<p>This week BBC Radio 4 launched its new season with a special celebration. With strong emphasis, its director general, Tony Hall, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/may/12/tony-hall-tells-bbc-staff-to-be-bold-and-inventive-as-licence-fee-battle-looms\" title=\"\">warned in a speech</a>: “It’s something none of us should take for granted – there’s nothing else like it in the world.” He’s right, the station is the soundtrack to the nation, a never-ending conversation of remarkable intelligence and pleasure, reaching deep among Sun and Mirror readers, defying accusations that it’s a middle-class silo. By rights, this Reithian relic should have died out long ago: instead its listeners keep growing – up from 9 million a decade ago to 11 million now.</p> \n<p>In the kitchen, in the car or out jogging with an iPod, I can’t imagine life without it. On a desert island, isn’t the entire back catalogue what you’d choose? <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qgt7\" title=\"\">The Now Show</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qshd\" title=\"\">More or Less</a>, Neil Macgregor’s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nrtd2/episodes/downloads\" title=\"\">History of the World in&nbsp;a 100 Objects</a> – only God and gardening have me reaching for the off button. Now here comes a whole day of poetry. Even the awfulness of the Archer&nbsp;family has me gripped.</p> \n<p>Those 11 million Radio 4 adherents listen for an average of 12 hours a week&nbsp;–&nbsp;and each shining hour costs just&nbsp;1.4p per listener. Nothing was ever such good value. The entire BBC has half&nbsp;the&nbsp;budget of Sky and a quarter of&nbsp;BT’s&nbsp;– which offer a fraction of the quantity or quality.</p> \n<p>Choice busts out of every new provider – Amazon, Netflix and many more to come – yet the BBC, at &pound;12 a month, dominates the British airwaves, while Sky charges an average &pound;47.</p> \n<p>The other line of attack will be on BBC governance – even though its every&nbsp;move is already over-policed by governors, trust and all the acronyms: <a href=\"http://www.ofcom.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Ofcom</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nao.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NAO</a>, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/\" title=\"\">PAC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government\" title=\"\">DCLG</a>, plus many parliamentary committees. From millions of BBC words, blunders and scandals are relatively few.</p> \n<p>The BBC’s success infuriates its enemies because it defies <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek\" title=\"\">Hayekian</a> laws of gravity; the market ought to offer better value but it doesn’t. Attacks on BBC “bias” rain down: James Harding, head of BBC News, protested at the “hell on wheels” “ferocity” of attacks during the election – a little faux-naive, perhaps, from a former Murdoch editor who knows the agenda from the other side.</p> \n<p>The BBC has a near impossible task in finding unbiased truths in an ideological world – and sometimes it splits the difference to stay on the safe side when forced to choose between sense and nonsense. The establishment leans heavily, the weight of an 85% Tory and europhobic press breathes hard to push it off its foothold. There is too often a blandifying of essential arguments when intimidation by bullies drains life out of reporting on the NHS, benefits, austerity or Europe.</p> \n<p>Pinko bias is an illusion of the right – and voters gave Cameron his win. Before wielding axes, Tory MPs should think hard about constituents who spend 18.5 hours a week with the BBC – and of its place in national life as an unmatched cultural treasure.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435605004727/Illustration-by-Joe-Magee-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'The cuts are so severe that they risk sending the BBC into a downward spiral.'

Dorling","body":"<p>The majority of young adults and the parents of young children in the UK did not vote for this government and with good reason. The only age group to swing towards the Conservatives were people aged over 65. Just enough of the affluent elderly were located <a href=\"https://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/3575/How-Britain-voted-in-2015.aspx?view=wide\" title=\"\">in just the right places to matter</a>. Never under a democracy have so few wielded so much power over so many.</p> \n<p>So, the people who care most about education did not vote for the Tories, with their record of creeping privatisation, high-stakes testing, no new school building, the hiring of unqualified teachers and the raising of tuition fees.</p> \n<p>After the election, primary school children in my home town <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/13330891.Dear_David_Cameron__Our_school_s_unsafe__underfunded_and_falling_apart/\" title=\"\">wrote to the prime minister </a>imploring him to allow some spending so they did not have to freeze in their classrooms in winter. In&nbsp;response, the government said it was&nbsp;the council’s responsibility. But it is central government that has cut council budgets, including those to maintain school buildings and heating systems.</p> \n<p>This government does not care about schools or children in poor areas. Why should it? Hardly any of its members of parliament represent such areas, or poorer children. So they do not repair damaged schools, or root out inequality, or shore up struggling families for the sake of their children’s future.</p> \n<p>Instead, they show what strange priorities they have. Even in hard times, money can be found for their untested educational whims. Some &pound;241m has already been spent setting up free schools in areas where <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/312410/Free_Schools_Pupil_Applications_and_Places_final.pdf\" title=\"\">no need for new schools has been forecast [pdf]</a>. Much more such spending is planned. Think how many school boilers and buildings could&nbsp;be repaired with <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n12/letters\" title=\"\">that money</a>.</p> \n<p>Huge amounts are also to be wasted on a few ministers’ pet theories. From September, all children in English state schools <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-31964225\" title=\"\">will be tested</a> on their “ability” in their first few weeks at school. What a stupid way to start a child’s education – unless you really want to instil a sense of failure from a very early age.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We test so much because our government wants children, schools and parents to know their place</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Private companies have bid to carry out the new baseline tests, designed to create the illusion that you can determine a child’s potential future at age four. The tests have been criticised and a <a href=\"http://reclaimingschools.org/2015/06/17/baseline-testing-science-or-fantasy/\" title=\"\">call has been made</a> to boycott them.</p> \n<p>You cannot with any accuracy predict an individual child’s future. The test scores of thousands of four-year‑olds will severely restrict their future achievement. The least confident, often children growing up in poverty, will be labelled “low ability” and of “limited potential” from the start.</p> \n<p>By the time 2020 comes, what sort of state will the schools system be in? The buildings will be even more dilapidated. There will be an over-supply of places where <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n09/dawn-foster/free-schools\" title=\"\">free schools have proliferated</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jan/08/george-osborne-budget-surplus-cut-taxes-2020\" title=\"\">The government is set to pass a law</a> committing future governments to spend less than they raise in taxes each year and not to borrow. At present, the government borrows from the rich by selling them bonds that we all have to pay back with interest. But what if, instead of borrowing from the rich in future, we taxed them properly, at normal European rates of taxation? For the sake of education and the young we should look at better taxation of the affluent older generation.</p> \n<p>Many <a href=\" http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/Among%20Equals%20Spring%202015_0.pdf\" title=\"\">models for doing this</a> are being proposed. None are as radical as suggesting we should tax and spend at normal European levels. But we currently tax and spend so lowly in comparison with other countries in Europe that we have a huge <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/apr/15/tories-reduce-uk-public-spending-estonia-imf-figures\" title=\"\">range of options</a> open to us.</p> \n<p>We tax and spend so little because it is in the short-term interest of the affluent. We test so much because our government wants children, schools and parents to know their place and focus on their own little individual aspirations.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, lifting the cap on student numbers at university will not necessarily produce more places. Markets create winners and losers but result in failing firms, failing hospitals and failing&nbsp;universities.</p> \n<p>If current trends continue, in five years’ time, our education system will resemble a production line with only the interests of a tiny minority at heart. Great damage is being done – perhaps enough to inspire people to move the trend back towards genuine education and cooperation, and away from testing and competition.

Neither man had a criminal record, and each was described by friends and neighbours as “normal”. There is no evidence of either travelling abroad to train for combat, and both had provoked little interest from the security services. They were thought to be “self-radicalised”, rather than members of a wider cell.</p> \n<p>Unlike Rezgui, Salhi survived and is said to be offering “personal reasons” as mitigation for his sadistic criminality. He has played down his links with global jihad, according to sources close to the case, instead suggesting that he simply did not like his victim. Yet, crucially, he has told interrogators that he was interested in provoking a “media coup”: making a name for himself in front of an audience of millions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Nowadays anyone can claim a link with Isis or al-Qaida and their dark crimes. All it takes are a few shouted slogans</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>So it is that, in a few minutes of pure evil, vengeful inadequates harbouring grudges go from being complete unknowns to internationally infamous killers – their characters and motivations picked over endlessly, as people try to explain their demonic behaviour. Commentators invariably place them at the centre of a fantastical global mission, using thoroughly misplaced terms such as“holy warrior” and “religious struggle”.</p> \n<p>In fact, the men’s affiliation to Islam seems based mostly on a twisted attempt to justify their barbarity. By vaguely attaching themselves to a greater “cause” they feel their nihilism somehow has a purpose: that there is a reason for their cowardly championing of death and destruction.</p> \n<p>In this sense men like Rezgui and Salhi are “micro-terrorists” – wretched freelancers, so-called lone wolves, just like the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2014/feb/26/lee-rigby-killers-michael-adebolajo-adebowale-whole-life-ruling\" title=\"\">killers who hacked British soldier Lee Rigby to death</a> on a London street two years ago. Their atrocities could have been planned in a single day, yet they have an impact that provokes as much publicity and fear as any terrorist “spectacular” around the world this century.</p> \n<p>Nowadays anyone can claim a link with the so-called Islamic State or al-Qaida and their dark crimes. All it takes are a few shouted slogans, a selfie next to a bloodied body part, or an obscure flag. Affiliations are usually based on what someone has seen on television or online. The media will do the rest. The vast growth in social media platforms over the past decade, combined with 24-hour rolling news, has provided the micro-terrorists with unparalleled exposure. This is intensified by commentators and politicians, who associate the killers not only with “global brand” terrorist movements but also with Islam&nbsp;itself.</p> \n<p>So it was that David Cameron disgracefully claimed that a significant number of Muslims in the UK <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33192306\" title=\"\">“quietly condoned” Isis</a> – conjuring up the image of thousands of otherwise peaceful citizens gently nodding in agreement as they contemplated the next decapitation, burning or drowning.</p> \n<p>In reality, making out that the lone wolves are anything other than sociopaths is like suggesting that the gunmen who regularly mass-murder their fellow citizens in the United States are also representative of the communities they come from.</p> \n<p>When <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/20/dylann-roof-fbi-website-manifesto-charleston-shooting\" title=\"\">Dylann Roof, a white 21-year-old, slaughtered nine African Americans </a>in a church Bible study class this month, his pitiful character and personal history were plain for all to see. His obsession with supremacist groups around the world, including disbanded historical ones, was rightly viewed as an indication of his low intelligence and huge inferiority complex. If Barack Obama had played on Roof’s hatred, and announced that many within mainstream American society “quietly condoned” his racism, there would have been an outcry.</p> \n<p>By making a connection between deranged, antisocial individuals and overwhelmingly moderate communities, politicians play along with the warped media myths which are the lifeblood of micro-terrorists. Just as news websites that post regular images of Isis beheadings and other executions provide the group with some of its best propaganda, so sensationalist portrayals of the lone wolves will ensure that many more will emerge to take the places of those killed or imprisoned.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435597159578/Seifeddine-Rezgui--008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Seifeddine Rezgui, who gunned down 38 people at a beach resort in Tunisia, was described by friends and neighbours as 'normal'.

Perched on narrow wooden benches, they’ll be locked in conversation or poring over their MacBooks. As you breathe in the scent of single origin coffee beans, you may well detect a whiff of unapologetic pretension. But don’t scoff at the hipsters: they’re maintaining a well-established English tradition. Exposed lightbulbs aside, this scene could have come straight out of the 18th century.</p> \n<p>In her lighthearted retelling of English history, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Life_Among_the_English.html?id=fx4VbFpK74IC\" title=\"\">Life Among the English</a> (1942), Rose Macaulay gently lampoons the 18th-century coffee house, writing that “Young law students would arrive at their coffee house, newspapers in hand, and saunter away their time, admiring one another’s get-ups”. Unlike most of the text’s comedy – which is derived from the ludicrously unfamiliar practices of the past – the account of the coffee house gets a laugh because it is still so recognisable.</p> \n<h2>A cultural icon</h2> \n<p>Representations of the coffee house throughout the ages are remarkably consistent. Even today, coffee is connected with fashionable sophistication. As a cultural icon, the coffee house stands alone in a broadly imagined hinterland, somewhere between the stuffy cloisters and libraries of the university academy and the hipster corners of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/shortcuts/2014/nov/23/shoreditch-golden-age-of-90s-london-hipster-hangout-jonny-woo-show\" title=\"\">London’s Shoreditch</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2013/feb/04/locals-guide-to-manchester\" title=\"\">Manchester’s Northern Quarter</a> and certain stretches of <a href=\"http://www.sheffieldinsider.co.uk/sheffield-pubs-and-bars/city-centre-division-street/\" title=\"\">Sheffield’s Division Street</a>.</p> \n<p>The contemporary coffee shop yearns nostalgically – almost subconsciously – for the coffee culture of a bygone era. It aspires to a representation of the coffee house galvanised during the 18th century; a romantic perception nurtured by the writing of figures like <a href=\"http://www.luminarium.org/eightlit/addison/addisonbio.htm\" title=\"\">Joseph Addison</a> and <a href=\"http://www.luminarium.org/eightlit/steele/steelebio.htm\" title=\"\">Richard Steele</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"33a3d539aca98dcb80979d3d3e8e362dcd519c0a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435599477295/d218ab12-ef9a-4105-8169-f672637b2cc6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cup of coffee\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘As a cultural icon, the coffee house stands alone in a broadly imagined hinterland, somewhere between the stuffy cloisters and libraries of the university academy and the hipster corners of London’s Shoreditch, Manchester’s Northern Quarter and certain stretches of Sheffield’s Division Street’.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is in literary works such as these that the most enduring descriptions of 18th-century coffee house culture survive. At the dawn of the 1700s, London was becoming Britain’s first 24-hour consumer society. This was a period that welcomed coffee, tea, porcelain, sugar, chocolate, dictionaries, novels and newspapers. It became the fashion to drop into club-like coffee houses, where people could discuss politics, literature, culture and their own lives. Thanks to technological advances and lapses in licensing rules, news and gossip now permeated the printed world.</p> \n<p>It was into this society that Joseph Addison and Richard Steele released a periodical titled The Spectator in 1711 (no relation to the magazine of the same name). This paper’s manifesto was to fill these coffee houses with knowledge, culture, ideas and – above all – conversation. The paper’s fictional editor modestly claimed: “I shall be ambitious to have it said of me, that I have brought Philosophy out of closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and in coffee-houses”.</p> \n<p>But this image of the coffee house as a public sphere of enlightened debate and discussion is – as Macaulay points out – undermined by the fact that these coffee houses were commercial enterprises that preyed upon the pretentious, extorting money from lazy posers in exchange for a den where they could imagine themselves to be great thinkers, philosophers and politicians.</p> \n<h2>A culture of commerce</h2> \n<p>In the 18th century, the coffee house was satirised for this very reason. Memorably, when the heroine of Alexander Pope’s mock epic <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174172\" title=\"\">The Rape of the Lock</a> (1712) arrives in a London coffee house, her commodity of choice is introduced as: “Coffee, (which makes the politician wise/And see thro’ all things with half-shut eyes).”</p> \n<p>By the early 20th century, the coffee house of The Spectator was seen as a kind of half-waking dream, which alluded the clinical scrutiny of the biographer or historian. As Virginia Woolf describes in her 1928 novel <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2011/dec/05/winter-reads-orlando-virginia-woolf\" title=\"\">Orlando</a>:</p> \n<blockquote>\n  To give a truthful account of London society at that, or indeed any other time, is beyond the powers of the biographer or the historian. Only those who have little need of truth, and no respect for it – the poets and the novelists – can be trusted to do it, for this is one of those cases where truth does not exist. Nothing exists. The whole thing is a miasma – a mirage. \n</blockquote> \n<p>Nevertheless, the dream was a popular and lucrative one. The coffee house that Addison and Steele inhabited might not have been quite the enlightened hub of culture they reported. But in penning this imagined coffee house, they created a legacy that still survives today.</p> \n<p>What these coffee shops also did – and what they continue to do – is provide a space. The coffee house remains a place for people to meet and converse, and that alone is worth celebrating. Even Woolf’s Orlando – unsettled by the disconnect between her idea of the coffee house and the commercial reality – acknowledged that the contradictions of coffee house culture do not diminish its splendour: “At one and the same time, therefore, society is the most powerful concoction in the world and society has no existence whatsoever”.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/uk\" title=\"\">the Conversation</a>, part of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/guardian-comment-network\" title=\"\">Guardian Comment Network</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\".\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://counter.theconversation.edu.au/content/43943/count.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"width:1px !important;height:1px !important\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435598664906/Coffee-shop-in-west-Londo-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘You’re likely to see intimate groups of well-dressed (or fashionably scruffy) sophisticates.

While the UK has made progress in reducing its emissions, much more needs to be done. We are not on track to meet our carbon budgets in the 2020s, and important risks that will arise in the future from climate change have not been fully addressed. If the UK is to be taken seriously in its ambition to deliver progress at a global level, urgent steps are required. </p> \n<p>On Tuesday, our committees present their first joint report to the new parliament detailing where action is needed most.

This crucial step is needed to allow investors to plan with confidence at least 10 years ahead in line with their investment cycles. It should help unlock &pound;100bn of investment in low- carbon electricity generation. </p> \n<p>There is also an opportunity to decrease energy bills. While there has been some improvement in the energy efficiency of our homes and buildings, our report shows a need for further dramatic improvement if we are to meet our long-term emissions targets. The good news is that action in this area could save consumers &pound;100 annually by 2020 in reduced electricity and heating bills and remove a million homes from fuel poverty at the same time.</p> \n<p>There are also significant opportunities for motorists to save money from improved government policies, while also reducing the UK’s carbon footprint.

Supporting electric vehicle roll-out now opens up the potential for future savings in fuel costs, while also tackling the health problems related to air pollution. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/mar/10/electric-cars-could-cut-oil-imports-40-by-2030\">Electric cars could cut oil imports 40% by 2030, says study</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In fact, the impacts of climate change pose significant risks to health, particularly when it comes to heat. The government urgently needs to promote measures to prevent homes and buildings overheating during hotter summers. Take hospitals, for example. Internal temperatures often exceed 30C when it’s only 22C outside, making sleep, and recovery from illness, more difficult. </p> \n<p>Climate change will also lead to more UK homes falling into high flood risk categories, where mortgages and flood insurance may become problematic. We’re urging the government to help people protect their homes and limit new development in at-risk areas rather than needlessly spending public money subsidising the costs of flood insurance. </p> \n<p>There may also be benefits to the UK, for instance in increased food production, but only if the key natural capital, soil and water, is properly managed, and the current plans for doing this fully implemented. </p> \n<p>If the UK fails to meet its own ambitions on climate change, the dangers are clear: stop-start investment leading to increased costs to us all and lost opportunities for increased food production, for new jobs and new areas of growth. </p> \n<p>The government has until October to respond to our report. As negotiations intensify in the lead up to the Paris conference, it is only with ambitious domestic climate policies that the UK’s international credibility can be assured. Actions speak louder than words. </p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435593995817/7018bda3-0146-4cb6-98db-dcc190b89f2c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Steven May/Alamy","altText":"An electric vehicle recharging point provided by Ecotricity at a service station on the M1","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Steven May/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T08:59:03Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T08:59:04Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Lord Krebs","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/lord-krebs"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Climate change","Greenhouse gas emissions","Environment","Cop 20: UN climate change conference | Lima","Global climate talks","Energy efficiency","Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars","Energy","Ethical and green living","Travel and transport","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"environment/climate-change","webTitle":"Climate change"},{"id":"environment/carbon-emissions","webTitle":"Greenhouse gas emissions"},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment"},{"id":"environment/cop-20-un-climate-change-conference-lima","webTitle":"Cop 20: UN climate change conference | Lima"},{"id":"environment/global-climate-talks","webTitle":"Global climate talks"},{"id":"environment/energyefficiency","webTitle":"Energy efficiency"},{"id":"environment/electric-cars","webTitle":"Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars"},{"id":"environment/energy","webTitle":"Energy"},{"id":"environment/ethical-living","webTitle":"Ethical and green living"},{"id":"environment/travel-and-transport","webTitle":"Travel and transport"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"environment"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Lord Krebs","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/lord-krebs"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"environment"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jun/30/uk-centre-fight-limit-climate-change","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a89k","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/environment/2015/jun/30/uk-centre-fight-limit-climate-change","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/30/uk-centre-fight-limit-climate-change"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435593995817/7018bda3-0146-4cb6-98db-dcc190b89f2c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An electric vehicle recharging point provided by Ecotricity at a service station on the M1.

So different from 1986, when football-crazy girls like me were definitely not normal","byline":"Sam Haddad","body":"<p>It’s 1986. I’m dressed head to toe in Liverpool kit and I’m hiding in a hedge. We’ve just moved to a new house and some of the neighbourhood kids have come to see if I want to come out and play. My dad’s calling me, but I stay hidden until they leave. I don’t want them to think I’m weird. Once they’ve gone I get back to re-enacting the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAT82pijymM\" title=\"\">FA Cup Final of that year, where Liverpool beat Everton 3-1</a> to clinch the double. I am Ian Rush, dribbling past invisible defenders and belting the ball between two perfectly spaced goalpost-trees. The crowd roars …</p> \n<p>I’ve loved football from an early age. We had no decent local teams, so like many of the boys in my class I picked a side to support based on how good they were and my favourite colour.

At school when I tried to play football with the boys in the playground I’d be stopped every time. The boys didn’t much mind, but the teachers said no. It wasn’t ladylike. I should go and play with the girls, who, to my mind at least, just stood around chatting.</p> \n<p>In PE it would be the same story. Boys playing football, me sulkily kicking a netball around until I got told off. Later I tried to join a local team, only to be told I couldn’t. They had no girls’ team and the FA had a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2006/jul/25/football.schools\" title=\"\">ban on girls playing in boys’ teams</a>. Pre-internet there was no way of finding other football-loving girls, and I’m not sure I even believed they existed. The message was loud and clear: football was not for girls.</p> \n<p>I was still a supporter, but I’d play in the garden less and less, and be wary about mentioning it with new people. But I was also lucky. I had good PE teachers who channelled that love of football into other sports and I’ve been pretty active and sporty ever since. Though I’d still have rather spent those years playing football.</p> \n<p>Fast-forward to now, and things couldn’t look more different. At my five-year-old son’s football classes the girls are some of the best players. Yesterday I watched one of them half-volley in a shot <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9-P2UF9JIg\" title=\"\">Gerrard-v-Olympiakos</a> style. The massive grin on her face was almost as big as her dad’s, watching from the sideline. My cousin’s daughter is the star of her quadruple-winning under-11s team, and I have high hopes for my fast and fearless five-year-old goddaughter, whose dad is a massive Reading and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/england-fran-kirby-mexico-womens-world-cup-group-f\" title=\"\">Fran Kirby</a> fan.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I’m not sure I believed other football-loving girls existed. The message was loud and clear: football was not for girls</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>We know that playing sport makes people happy and healthy, and that girls and women participate less than boys and men. And we know that needs to change. The focus is often on fitness through sports such as running and cycling, which are of course great – I love doing them both. But there’s something deeply meditative about chasing a ball around a pitch. The intense focus, the teamwork, and the fact you’re exercising without really noticing: it makes it easier, somehow.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jan/12/sport-england-launched-fitness-campaign-to-encourage-women-to-take-up-sport-and-exercise\" title=\"\">This Girl Can</a> has been a brilliant campaign, encouraging more girls to take part in all kinds of different sports, but it’s hard to understate the significance of the England’s women’s football team reaching a <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/women-s-world-cup-2015\" title=\"\">World Cup</a> semi-final this week.</p> \n<p>Some dinosaur sports reporters (at other sites, I should add) have been <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3127128/Pointing-flaws-Women-s-World-Cup-doesn-t-make-sexist-Men-s-football-allowed-lousy-genuine-equality-women-s-too.html\" title=\"\">trying to take the shine off things</a> with negative pieces, but all I can see is a great moment for football fans of all genders.
