Hated by politicians. Deplored by the press. As for the party supposedly overrun by trade union barons, whoever can name an occasion when one of their leaders has publicly supported a strike will win a part-share of my <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/mar/29/diane-abbott-labour-immigration-controls-mugs-shameful\" title=\"\">immigration-control mug</a>.</p> \n<p>To such genteel ears, what I’m about to say will sound as sophisticated as breaking wind at a palace garden party. But some things demand directness – which&nbsp;is why I’d urge you to support the&nbsp;binmen, <a href=\"http://socialistworker.co.uk/art/40228/Barnet+care+workers+strike+back+against+Tory+service+cuts\" title=\"\">care workers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.barnetunison.me.uk/?q=node/1576\" title=\"\">librarians</a> and other <a href=\"http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/12927538.Barnet_Council_workers_take_strike_action_in_protest_at_outsourcing/?ref=rss\" title=\"\">council staff striking in Barnet&nbsp;right now</a>.</p> \n<p>Allow me to be blunter still, and say that this fight in an outer-London borough forms the frontline of one of the most important battles in Britain today. Because the men and women who normally serve kids’ meals, pick the rubbish off the streets and look after residents with mental-health needs are having to defend their services from a threat that may soon be coming to your local council: their jobs are about to be handed over to a private company.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/dec/15/local-services-barnet-council-town-hall\">Outsourced and unaccountable: this is the future of local government | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The process is usually described as outsourcing – but that term does no justice to what’s happening in this leafy part of the capital. Councils of all stripes have been outsourcing for decades, which is why your local traffic warden is usually tramping the streets on behalf of a private firm. But that isn’t enough for Tory-run Barnet – it is on a mission to make itself disappear. It has begun a programme to farm out so many of its services that the local trade union calculates staff will <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/dec/15/local-services-barnet-council-town-hall\" title=\"\">shrink from 3,200 in&nbsp;September 2012 to just 332</a>.</p> \n<p>Everything from registering births to mowing the local cemeteries has either already been outsourced or is about to about be. And most of the key tasks have been given to the FTSE giant <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/public-leaders-network/2014/nov/20/capita-avoid-public-service-contracts\" title=\"\">Capita</a>. Not just for a few months or a couple of years, mind you: Capita will run these services for at least 10 years.</p> \n<p>So an arm of Britain’s local government has in effect agreed to a friendly takeover by a &pound;7bn multinational. Whoever Barnet residents vote for in local elections, they will always get Capita. Whenever they phone or email or visit, they will speak to a Capita employee. The FTSE giant will face no competition for the next decade; nor will it endure the same scrutiny as democratic government, as previously public information is veiled under “commercial sensitivity”.</p> \n<p>This scale of outsourcing is new to Barnet, but has already given rise to some monstrous cock-ups. I’ve mentioned one here before: the loss of legal expertise meant that Barnet councillors were given the wrong reports to vote on last summer, prompting an independent inquiry that concluded: “<a href=\"http://www.times-series.co.uk/news/11519194._Inexperienced__staff_who_have__no_understanding__of_local_government_law_at_Barnet_Council/?ref=mr\" title=\"\">There is no one who understands local government law in depth at Barnet</a>.” And while the council claims the point of outsourcing is to save money, evidence of that is thin. One local blogger, who writes under the pen name <a href=\"http://reasonablenewbarnet.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/barnet-payments-to-capita-250-to.html\" title=\"\">Mr Reasonable</a>, makes it his habit to go through the accounts and can’t identify any of the much-touted savings. He has offered to donate &pound;250 to charity if the council can prove its claims, but so far there’s been no reply. I asked the local authority the same question this afternoon, but staff couldn’t come back to me in time.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the cost of interim and&nbsp;agency staff is ballooning from &pound;12.5m two years ago to &pound;15.5m.</p> \n<p>If you want to see the world of outsourcing at its most illogical, spend a bit of time with detail-hunters like Mr Reasonable. He tells me about phoning his local library to see if a children’s book was in stock. The call was of course routed to a Capita call centre in Coventry, where staff spent ages unable to help before connecting him back to the librarians just down the road. By his&nbsp;calculations, for that wasted call Capita would charge Barnet &pound;8.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Barnet now pays Capita &pound;800 for a day’s training in how to take minutes</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Outsourcing is full of these invented costs, which is how the privateers make their billions. Mr Reasonable can tell you about how Barnet now pays &pound;800 for a day’s training in how to take minutes, or <a href=\"http://reasonablenewbarnet.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/capita-special-projects-barnet.html\" title=\"\">&pound;14,628 for just two months of occupational health assessments</a>. In both cases these are services that would previously have been provided in-house for minimal cost. In the era of cost savings, however, they become very profitable indeed.</p> \n<p>These examples would be comic, if they didn’t cost blameless taxpayers so much money. But for the staff on strike this week, outsourcing has been much more painful. They’ve seen their colleagues transferred to new employers and suffer pay cuts. And now they’re facing the prospect of more services leaving the council within months – everything from children’s centres to&nbsp;school dinners.</p> \n<p>What you’re seeing in Barnet is not some one-off, but a test case. Forced to make deep cuts, many Tory authorities are using this crisis as the perfect opportunity to hollow out their services. That description certainly applies to Margaret Thatcher’s former constituency backyard of Barnet, which dreamed up its disappearing act even before the banking crash. <a href=\"http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/news/local/budget-cuts-of-148-million-will-result-in-northamptonshire-county-council-outsourcing-95-per-cent-of-staff-1-6463894\" title=\"\">Northamptonshire has announced plans to outsource 95% of staff</a>. <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/news/third-wave-of-strikes-at-bromley-council-as-tories-run-amok-over-mass-privatisation-plans/\" title=\"\">Bromley’s local authority is enmeshed in strikes</a> over its plans to hand out most of its services.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Trade unions were wiped out in the private sector in the 1980s; they could be destroyed in the public sector this decade</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The fact that these are all Tory councils is no surprise: it was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2012/oct/16/thatcher-outsourcing-fantasy-fails-reality\" title=\"\">Thatcher’s former lieutenant Nicholas Ridley</a> who came up with the idea of the night-watchman local authority, where town hall staff only turned up once a year to sign contracts with the private companies delivering local services. But this trend is not only true blue: two former executives at Barnet have already moved on <a href=\"http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/9969996.New_Haringey_CEO_taking_pay_cut_with_move_from_Barnet/\" title=\"\">to top jobs at Labour-run councils of Haringey</a> and <a href=\"http://www.barkinganddagenhampost.co.uk/news/politics/barnet_officer_chris_naylor_appointed_as_barking_and_dagenham_council_s_new_chief_exec_1_3863880\" title=\"\">Barking</a>, presumably to work the same outsourcing magic there. In David Cameron’s first term, public sector outsourcing <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/244f0bd8-eccb-11e4-a81a-00144feab7de.html#axzz3bpscRNhS\" title=\"\">almost doubled to &pound;120bn</a>. When he was re-elected, the National Outsourcing Association commented: <a href=\"http://www.noa.co.uk/files/732.pdf\" title=\"\">“We expect to see a plethora of new outsourcing deals, both public and private, over the coming months.”</a></p> \n<p>This makes what’s happening this week in Barnet, and the fight it’s part of, so vital. If the staff lose there, and the council does hive off all the services, then others will be encouraged to go further and faster in their outsourcing. The trade unions were wiped out in the private sector during the strikes of the 1980s; they could be destroyed in the public sector this decade.</p> \n<p>If you support decent public services, you have to support those strikers in Barnet foregoing pay. And if you want to live in a country run as a democracy, with all its flaws and failings – rather than by big companies answerable to hardly anyone – their cause is yours.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433185161723/Council-staff-on-strike-i-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration by Bill Bragg","credit":"Guardian","altText":"Council staff on strike illustration by Bill Bragg","cleanCaption":"Illustration by Bill Bragg"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-01T19:07:48Z","lastModified":"2015-06-01T23:00:59Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":720,"contributors":[{"name":"Aditya Chakrabortty","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/24/1411565194870/Aditya-Chakrabortty-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/adityachakrabortty"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Local government","Conservatives","Public sector cuts","Local politics","Privatisation","Politics","Society","Capita","Business","London","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"society/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local government"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"society/public-sector-cuts","webTitle":"Public sector cuts"},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics"},{"id":"politics/privatisation","webTitle":"Privatisation"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"business/capitagroup","webTitle":"Capita"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Aditya Chakrabortty","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/adityachakrabortty"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/01/cameron-shrink-state-barnet-future-local-services","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49d5j","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/01/cameron-shrink-state-barnet-future-local-services","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/01/cameron-shrink-state-barnet-future-local-services"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433185161723/Council-staff-on-strike-i-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘The local trade union calculates staff will shrink from 3,200 in September 2012 to just 332.’ Illustration by Bill Bragg","credit":"Guardian","altText":"Council staff on strike illustration by Bill Bragg","cleanCaption":"‘The local trade union calculates staff will shrink from 3,200 in September 2012 to just 332.’ Illustration by Bill Bragg"}},"importance":7,"byline":{"title":"Aditya Chakrabortty"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[]},{"title":"Steve Bell on David Cameron and Scotland","rawTitle":"Steve Bell on David Cameron and Scotland","item":{"type":"article","id":"politics/picture/2015/jun/01/steve-bell-on-david-cameron-and-scotland","title":"Steve Bell on David Cameron and Scotland – cartoon","trailText":"‘The baked bean in danger’ -

No, the journey towards good universal childcare and nursery education is proving long and winding. But one of the encouraging surprises of the last election was the political arms race in free childcare promises.</p> \n<p>First <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2013/sep/23/labour-25-hours-free-childcare-balls\" title=\"\">Labour pledged to raise free childcare</a> for three- and four-year-olds from 15 to 25 hours. Then the Lib Dems leapfrogged that, offering 20 free hours, but starting right from the end of maternity leave. At the last moment, the Tories trumped it with a 30-hour offer. Yesterday <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/jun/01/childcare-free-nurseries-challenge-david-cameron-pledge-double\" title=\"\">David Cameron brought forward a pilot to September 2016</a>.</p> \n<p>What’s impressive in this broad political enthusiasm for early years is that it scores pretty low in voters’ spending priorities: too few have under-fives at any one time. Parents soon forget the guilt-ridden time of holding down a job, scraping together childcare money and finding a place, let alone somewhere good enough for their child’s most vital years. So will the&nbsp;government stump up the money to&nbsp;cover these extra hours – and improve&nbsp;the low-quality, low-qualifications patchwork of inadequate nurseries to match their promise?</p> \n<p>Social mobility and equal opportunity – every politician preaches these pieties. They know the incontrovertible evidence that the earliest years matter most. Yet changing education priorities to reflect that evidence defeats them: we spend in inverse ratios to the value added to the child. Why spend most on university students already destined for success while too many toddlers are merely warehoused by minimum-waged semi-trained nursery assistants who themselves failed at school?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There is scant sign of a radical change to unravel the bizarre complexity of funding mechanisms</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Labour was the pioneer in 1997, adding the missing cradle in the “cradle&nbsp;to grave” welfare state. They brought free nurseries to three- and four-year-olds when the Tories still argued that under-fives were a family and not a state responsibility. Labour opened 3,500 Sure Start children’s centres as community hubs: the best in poorest areas had childcare, health visitors, speech and language therapy, parenting classes and help finding jobs.&nbsp;But councils suffering severe cuts&nbsp;have already <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32166233\" title=\"\">closed or merged 763</a>:&nbsp;half will close more.</p> \n<p>Some state-maintained nurseries survive in some poor districts, beacon centres for training nursery teachers, scoring the highest Ofsted scores. But they are under threat. A famous leader in a very deprived patch, the 40-year-old Maxilla nursery under the Westway will be shut by Kensington and Chelsea Council next month, losing 40 places and its children’s garden, although the new Kensington MP, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/mar/14/victoria-borwick-kensington-conservative-candidate\" title=\"\">Victoria Borwick</a>, is a governor. Private nurseries usually score far less well with Ofsted, with few opened in poor areas, as they need parents who can pay fees to top up the inadequate state subsidy. Most only survive by charging fees for hours above the free 15, but now 30 hours will be free, unless the state pays significantly more per hour, they risk collapse.</p> \n<p>If only Labour had started out with enough money and a simple system. But, afraid of upsetting the existing mediocre private sector, they grafted tax credits on the top. Cameron has announced a funding review before starting his extra free hours, but there is scant sign of a radical change to unravel the bizarre complexity of funding mechanisms.</p> \n<p>Imagine you’re a parent needing childcare, and follow this madness if you can: if you’re in the 40% lowest income bracket, you can have 15 hours of free care when your child is two. At three and four, you can get 15 hours free – but you will only get Cameron’s extra 15 free hours if you both work at least eight hours a week. (That excludes the chaotic non-working families with mental and other problems whose children need most help.) Your overall childcare costs will be paid by the state up to 85% of cost if you are low-paid enough to get universal credit if/when it comes in. Right now you just get 70%.</p> \n<p>If you earn above that level, between&nbsp;&pound;30,000 and &pound;40,000 as a couple, the 85% subsidy drops to a 20% tax relief instead, a killer cliff-edge drop costing you thousands a year for the crime of earning a little extra overtime. Tax relief goes to families earning up to &pound;300,000, despite acute shortage of&nbsp;nursery funding.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0bb725526e2dbfa0a3b27995127ed69dd779f555\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433185527062/5f52fc21-041c-404a-a78c-159963937f9d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kindergarten in Stockholm, Sweden \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘In Sweden, parents have a right to an excellent local free childcare centre, where half the staff are graduates.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Images Group /DeAgost/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Try costing this cat’s cradle of shifting reliefs, <a href=\"http://www.familyandchildcaretrust.org/childcare-cost-survey-2015\" title=\"\">warns the Family and Childcare Trust</a>. Both DWP and HMRC must check your status and place and hours of your childcare: the admin costs are mind-boggling. In this regard, Sweden was Labour’s intended direction of travel. I joined a ministerial fact-finder to see how universal care can be provided. Simply, is the answer. Parents have a right to an excellent local free childcare centre, where half the staff are graduates. How far we are from that. The UK has among the most expensive and variable childcare, resulting in the fewest working mothers in the OECD.</p> \n<p>This month marks exactly 50 years since US president Lyndon Johnson founded Head Start, the centrepiece of his Great Society. Young children, he said “are the inheritors of poverty’s curse, not its creators”. That breakthrough early-years programme for deprived children and their parents was so popular it lasted through all the Republican years, though shrunken and of erratic quality. Marking the anniversary, some of the 32m Head Start children have emerged to thank it. <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/whats-legacy-head-start-50-years/\" title=\"\">Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, recalls</a> sitting on the porch of “our little shotgun shack in Ames, Texas” with his mother, when a woman approached to offer a Head Start place. “It changed my life. It allowed me to imagine, to think creatively about the world beyond my environment and what my life might be.”</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.highscope.org/content.asp?contentid=219\" title=\"\">study that caught Labour’s eye</a> followed a group of children on a highly structured Head Start-type scheme in Ohio, comparing them with a control group. They didn’t soar up aspirational ladders, but two intensive years of pre-school cognitive and emotional support protected many from disaster. By the age of 40, 46% fewer Head Start children had been to jail, fewer girls had unplanned babies, fewer drew welfare or needed mental treatment, while more stayed on at school and had jobs.

The latest from Chicago is about new blockbuster drugs&nbsp;that can manipulate the immune&nbsp;system to “con” cancer cells. This year the focus has been on melanoma, where&nbsp;a&nbsp;combination of two drugs has been shown to be highly effective in a subset of patients.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/jun/01/immunotherapy-the-big-new-hope-for-cancer-treatment\">Immunotherapy: the big new hope for cancer treatment</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I have sat through the presentations here in Chicago thinking over and over about my friend, slightly younger than me when she was diagnosed with advanced melanoma. I connected her with a reputable melanoma team and she received every available treatment. She thought her doctors were godly in their care. Fifteen months after her diagnosis she died, peacefully, at home. I can’t bring myself to add, “the way she wanted”, because beneath her admirable stoicism lay inexorable sadness that she would not live to see her children’s future unfold. Before she died, she told me that she knew the miracles had been exhausted, and commended her oncologist for telling her that despite the heady remissions, her disease was ultimately fatal.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/01/paradigm-shift-hailed-in-treatment-of-lung-cancer\" title=\"\">drug combination for melanoma</a> causing the latest media excitement halted the progression of disease for up to a year in nearly 60% of cases. Could my friend have won another summer with her children? Or would she have been among the 50% who experienced significant toxicity, or even the 36% who dropped out of the trial due to “adverse events”? We can only guess, but I can’t think of her without recollecting another person who needed my help around the same time.</p> \n<p>The young man’s father lived in rural India and had recently received a diagnosis of melanoma at a Mumbai institution. The proposed treatment was unaffordable, even though the family was willing to sell the modest amount of gold his mother had received on marriage. The young man was astonished to read that on a per-miligram basis one melanoma drug, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipilimumab\" title=\"\">ipilimumab</a>, was 4,000 times more expensive than gold, so his question to me was quite simple. How could he keep his father out of pain in a village which lacked reliable power or water, let alone good painkillers? I ended up acting as the young man’s confidant as he navigated his family through indescribable angst at being too poor to even have a chance of treatment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We must work collectively to help the world’s poorest countries to reach an acceptable level of equity in cancer care</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Every year, news of another miracle drug saturates the global media followed by patients, medics and advocacy groups agitating for funding. The oncologist in me loves the feel-good stories presented in neat slides. As a privileged doctor working in a rich country, I know my patients are likely to realise the promise of new discoveries. Talk of miracles has no place in our evidence-based profession and I will keep telling them that advanced melanoma remains incurable but that incremental gains will help them live longer and better. Who knows, for a small percentage, melanoma may eventually become a chronic disease.</p> \n<p>But as a global citizen, I struggle with the implications of mind-bogglingly expensive drugs that are at best associated with modest benefits in the vast majority of patients. I think about the societal responsibility we bear to ensure that cancer suffering is reduced not only in our direct vicinity but for the millions of invisible and forgotten patients in poorer countries too.</p> \n<p>The medical profession has traditionally failed to face this elephant in the room. For a long time we have believed that the patient before us is the only one who matters and that it’s the job of bureaucrats to tussle with big pharma to work things out. But are we deluding ourselves? The conversation about what is sustainable and appropriate when it comes to exorbitantly priced drugs that will benefit only a select group must involve individual doctors and patients.</p> \n<p>Two things strike me as important. One, while celebrating the latest breakthrough we should temper our enthusiasm so that patients get the correct message. They deserve an individualised assessment of their risks so that the hard-won gains for honest communication are not drowned in a chorus of “But I thought they have finally beaten cancer!”. No, “they” have not beaten cancer but they are getting better at untangling it. The progress of robust, evidence-based medicine is necessarily slow to avoid doing harm to the many for the benefit of a few.</p> \n<p>Two, we must work collectively to help the world’s poorest countries, where the burden of disease is the greatest, to reach an acceptable level of equity in cancer care. This will come through research, genuine partnerships and good governance. Big Pharma is to be commended for running more clinical trials in poor countries, but to my mind, companies should then be under an ethical obligation to supply proven effective drugs at an affordable price. This remains a big barrier to global cancer care. It is also right for every government to question how cancer funding fits with affording life-saving vaccinations, childhood education, disability support and infrastructure.</p> \n<p>How much easier it is to herald another “cure for cancer” than grapple with the ethical challenges posed by the advent of increasingly costly drugs. Yet it is a conversation we must have. The portrayal of cancer in the popular press presents a challenge. Like many oncologists, I am realising that one patient’s miracle is another’s blow.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433183919090/e5f82d64-b66e-45f4-b2e6-d11636d30427-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Science Photo Library","altText":"Cancer cell research ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Science Photo Library"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-02T07:00:11Z","lastModified":"2015-06-02T07:26:17Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":10,"contributors":[{"name":"Ranjana Srivastava","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/11/18/1416320691328/Ranjana-Srivastava-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ranjana-srivastava"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cancer","Cancer","Health","Society","Medical research","Science","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"science/cancer","webTitle":"Cancer"},{"id":"society/cancer","webTitle":"Cancer"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"science/medical-research","webTitle":"Medical research"},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ranjana Srivastava","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ranjana-srivastava"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/doctor-cancer-patients-cure","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49d5x","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/doctor-cancer-patients-cure","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/doctor-cancer-patients-cure"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433183919090/e5f82d64-b66e-45f4-b2e6-d11636d30427-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Talk of miracles has no place in our evidence-based profession.’ Photograph: Science Photo Library","credit":"Science Photo Library","altText":"Cancer cell research ","cleanCaption":"‘Talk of miracles has no place in our evidence-based profession.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Science Photo Library"}},"importance":4,"byline":{"title":"Ranjana Srivastava"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[]},{"title":"Why do female drivers pose such a threat?","rawTitle":"Why do female drivers pose such a threat?","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jun/01/female-drivers-saudi-arabia-stamford-hill-ban-independence","title":"Why do female drivers pose such a threat?","trailText":"From Saudi Arabia to Stamford Hill, north London, bans on women getting behind the wheel are designed to curb independence and keep them at home and not out in the wider world – these fears need to be forced to take a back seat","standFirst":"From Saudi Arabia to Stamford Hill, north London, bans on women getting behind the wheel are designed to curb independence and keep them at home and not out in the wider world – these fears need to be forced to take a back seat","byline":"Laura Barton","body":"<p>It was a strange and unsettling row that flared in Stamford Hill, north London, last week, when leaders of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/28/hasidic-sect-london-mothers-stop-driving\" title=\"\">orthodox Jewish sect Belz</a> wrote to parents to voice concern about the number of women driving. “There has been an increase in incidences of mothers of our students who have begun driving cars,” they stated, “something that goes against the laws of modesty in our society.” From August onwards, the letter said, children whose mothers drove them to school&nbsp;would be barred from the&nbsp;classroom.</p> \n<p>In the days that followed, Nicky Morgan, minister for women and equalities, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/29/nicky-morgan-orthodox-jewish-women-driver-ban-belz-london\" title=\"\">declared the ban “completely unacceptable in modern Britain”</a>. Dina Brawer, UK ambassador of the <a href=\"https://www.jofa.org/\" title=\"\">Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance</a> told the <a href=\"http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/136878/stamford-hill-sect-bans-women-drivers\" title=\"\">Jewish Chronicle</a>, “The instinct behind such a draconian ban is one of power and control, of men over women. In this sense, it is no different from the driving ban on women in Saudi Arabia. That it masquerades as a halachic imperative is shameful and disturbing.”</p> \n<p>The&nbsp;Belz community duly issued an appeasing statement: “It is a fact that most women in our community do not drive cars. It is equally true that a fair number of women do drive cars openly and entirely unhindered. They and their families are as respected within our community as any other members and we have no intention of&nbsp;changing&nbsp;that.”</p> \n<p>What was shocking about the Stamford Hill case was its proximity – the idea that, within our realm, women should be prohibited from driving. After all, Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that bans women from driving –&nbsp;in fact, a woman must show written consent from a <em>mahram</em> (a close male relative), if she is to travel at all.</p> \n<p>But just what is it about a woman driving a car that is immodest or unsettling? In <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Taking-Wheel-Women-Coming-Motor/dp/0826313957\" title=\"\">Taking the Wheel: Women and the Coming of the Motor Age</a>, Virginia Scharff writes about the first licensed female driver in 1899, the ambulance drivers of the first world war, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Huyler_Ramsey\" title=\"\">Alice Huyler Ramsey</a>, a 22-year-old housewife and mother, who became the first woman to drive coast to coast across the United States. It took her 59 days with all-female passengers: her sisters-in-law and a friend. The expedition was conceived as a stunt for a car manufacturer, but it had a serious point, too. As Scharff wrote, “Some hoped the motorcar would simply make their lives easier, more fun, and more interesting. Whether venturing out in cars on mundane errands, competing in organised racing events, or undertaking ambitious cross-country journeys, they&nbsp;challenged&nbsp;the&nbsp;social limits of&nbsp;femininity.”</p> \n<p>A decade or so ago, I attended a car fair in Switzerland to see a vehicle designed especially for women. It had a special headrest to accommodate a ponytail and textile panels that could be switched to allow a change of colour scheme, as if an automobile had to be domestic in order for it to appeal to women. Really, I think this is the issue with women and cars – that the ability to drive represents women’s move out of the domestic sphere and into the wider world. With that move comes a great challenge to men’s perception of their own power – not only to their social authority and financial clout, but also to their sexuality.</p> \n<p>The car has long been an emblem&nbsp;of&nbsp;sexual potency and, at the heart of the consternation about female drivers, I&nbsp;suspect, sits the great male fear that, in taking the wheel, women are also claiming their sexual independence. If&nbsp;that it is&nbsp;indeed the case,&nbsp;it&nbsp;would be stronger&nbsp;and&nbsp;smarter&nbsp;not to ban, but&nbsp;to&nbsp;force those&nbsp;fears to take&nbsp;a&nbsp;back&nbsp;seat.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433176279571/WRA-Corps-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The feared loss of modesty is rooted in halting women’s liberation out of the home, and into sexual independence.

Got Damn! Smile baby! Shorty you phat as shit! Bring dat ass over here!” ripped from the corner where about 30 of us stood. We are all different guys, with 30 different occupations, all bought up in the same abrasive culture where many men feel entitled to harass women. </p> \n<p>“Chill man, leave her alone!” I yelled. My friend T echoed: “Yeah man she don’t want y’all bums anyway!” </p> \n<p>The woman stopped and muffled her child’s ears: “Y’all some fuckin’ clowns!” and continued down the block. </p> \n<p>Most of the dudes burst out in laughter, some of us shook our heads in despair. One dude mixed up in our group, a light-skinned kid with one big gold tooth spoke out: “Yo that’s why I only fuck wit white women now – black ones be too angry!” </p> \n<p>It’s never been my style, but dudes have been hollering, cat calling or cracking on women years before I was even born. I grew up in east Baltimore’s dope-boy culture, where the coolest guys attracted women by dressing nice, being popular and having conversations. Screaming at women and acting thirsty always looked stupid to me and always will. Seeing the look on that young woman’s face while she was walking with her child made me realize how scary it can be for a woman to walk down the street. </p> \n<p>If we men are the problem, we can also be part of the solution.</p> \n<p>“Men should call each other out when they see their friends violating women”, Juliana Pache, an activist, told me. The co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.eatthispussypower.com\">Pussy Power</a>, a Philly-based feminist group with the purpose of creating spaces where women can feel safe and free to express themselves, Pache said: </p> \n<p>They should sit them down and explain to them how wrong they are. Just like white people need to call each other out on racism. If you are in a privileged group, and you want to help oppressed people, one of the best things you can do is teach other people in your privileged group. As a person of privilege, you do not have to actually face the oppression, so you have time to teach. Oppressed people do not have the energy to teach everyone about the oppression they have to live through everyday.</p> \n<p>The day I watched my friends harass the young mother, I tried.</p> \n<p>“Yo, she had her son with her!” I chimed in. “What if somebody said: ‘Lemme squeeze your sexy fat ass’ to your grandma?’ Would that be cool?” </p> \n<p>The light-skinned kid shrugged. Travis, the tallest kid out there answered: “Yo, little man gotta learn the game. One day he’ll yell at somebody’s sister on the street!”</p> \n<p>And that’s the problem. Remaining silent and following suit is how our misogynistic culture is sustained for generations. Little guys see big guys street harass and then grow up to street harass and this toxic tradition is so strong that the kid in front of me shrugs at the idea of me telling his grandma that she has a sexy fat ass. </p> \n<p>“Man ya’ll sound like Captain Save-a-hoes!” said Travis, pulling a Black-N-Mild from his ear and sparking it: “Lemme get y’all some capes!” Everyone laughed. </p> \n<p>I reminded most of them of who they live with, whose cell phone account they’re on, who feeds them or fed them when they were flat broke, who brought them into the world, who let them stay on the basement couch past the age of 30, who raised them, who they call when they get in trouble, who co-signs, who got that bail money, who was there when everyone else ditched them and how when trouble strikes, “Mommy!” the first thing they always yell out.</p> \n<p>Some fronted but most nodded in agreement, acknowledging that their go-to people are always their black grandmothers, black wives, black girlfriends, black sisters and black daughters.</p> \n<p>I asked Pache how do we move forward. “Privileged groups should stop expecting oppressed groups to teach them. We’re busy being oppressed. The whole concept that privileged people won’t learn unless we teach them is just pure laziness. If you care about the people around you, you’ll do the work to educate yourself.” </p> \n<p>Educating and making myself aware to the issues that many of the women in my community face is only half the battle. As a kid in Keep Ya Head Up, Tupac rapped “And since we all came from a woman/ Got our name from a woman/and our game from a woman!” He painted a clear picture of what he felt every male needed to acknowledge. Many didn’t, leaving him to continue with: “I wonder why we take from our women/ Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?/ I think it’s time to kill for our women/ Time to heal our women, be real to our women!” </p> \n<p>Pac had it right: us men are responsible for not only stopping guys from harassing women, but also telling others to do the same. For this is the only way to shift the culture. </p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432929178087/bc44ebf9-af1b-46ce-bc4a-24375bfa6941-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"harassment","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-01T14:15:04Z","lastModified":"2015-06-02T07:04:44Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":334,"contributors":[{"name":"D Watkins","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/d-watkins"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Women","Feminism","Gender","Life and style","Society"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"world/feminism","webTitle":"Feminism"},{"id":"world/gender","webTitle":"Gender"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"D Watkins","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/d-watkins"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/01/my-friends-harass-women-i-cant-silent-any-more","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/499h2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/01/my-friends-harass-women-i-cant-silent-any-more","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/01/my-friends-harass-women-i-cant-silent-any-more"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432929178087/bc44ebf9-af1b-46ce-bc4a-24375bfa6941-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"If street harassment is to stop, men must be the ones to make a change.

There was Ukip with almost 4m votes and one seat, the Greens with 1m votes and one seat, and the Lib Dems with 2.4m votes and eight seats – 300,000 votes per MP. By&nbsp;contrast, it took little more than a tenth of that, 34,000 votes, to elect a Tory MP, and 40,000 to elect a Labour one. But most starkly of all, the SNP with 1.4m votes now has 56 members of parliament – at 25,000 votes a shot. As the <a href=\"http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Electoral Reform Society argues</a>, Britain’s voting system is overstating differences so that they create national and regional divides. In effect, the way we vote is contributing to the pressure on the union.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>In Scotland, the half of the population that supports UK-wide parties is now represented by just three MPs</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>First past the post is a system that tends to produce Commons majorities by exaggerating party support in some places and suppressing it others. In Scotland, the half of the population that supports UK-wide parties is now represented by just three MPs. In England, Labour should have more MPs in the south and there should be more Conservatives in the north. There are similar distortions in Wales.</p> \n<p>The defenders of the status quo argue that the clarity of its outcomes justifies the way it also quells diversity and misrepresents the political mood. Coalitions take place within, not between, parties. When the great majority of people voted for either of the two main parties, that was a defensible position. But that has not been true for more than 40 years. Since 2005, Labour and Conservatives have shared only about two thirds of the votes cast. The remainder have found new homes, first with the Lib Dems and now with the SNP and Ukip. First past the post no longer does its job of representing national political opinion because there is no national political opinion. It is not the only thing wrong with our politics. But without a more proportional voting system it may be all the harder to get the wider reform of parliament and its relationship with the constituent nations of Britain needed to save the union.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4d4dd4a7e978867c8d2bf286b4af9f1cf0d06fdd/0_104_4500_2702/4500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2702,"width":4500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA","altText":"Callum McCaig, Eilidh Whiteford, Alex Salmond, Kirsty Blackman and Stuart Donaldson as SNP as North-East Scotland MPs gather outside Parliament, London","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-01T18:26:46Z","lastModified":"2015-06-01T23:00:56Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":269,"contributors":[{"name":"Editorial","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/editorial"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["General election 2015","First past the post","Electoral reform","Politics","UK news","Constitutional reform"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/general-election-2015","webTitle":"General election 2015"},{"id":"politics/firstpastthepost","webTitle":"First past the post"},{"id":"politics/electoralreform","webTitle":"Electoral reform"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/constitution","webTitle":"Constitutional reform"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Editorial","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/editorial"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/01/guardian-view-lessons-2015-general-election","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49d2x","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/01/guardian-view-lessons-2015-general-election","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/01/guardian-view-lessons-2015-general-election"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4d4dd4a7e978867c8d2bf286b4af9f1cf0d06fdd/0_104_4500_2702/4500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2702,"width":4500,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘The SNP with 1.4m votes now has 56 members of parliament – at 25,000 votes a shot.’ Alex Salmond, centre, with four of the SNP’s MPs outside the Houses of Parliament.
