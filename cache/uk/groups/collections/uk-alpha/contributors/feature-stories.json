Even an address of astonishing political audacity – as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/10/george-osborne-took-much-more-from-poor-budget-2015-ifs\" title=\"\">George Osborne’s</a> was – has its longueurs, its moments when the stats are coming in such a blizzard, the borrowing projections merging with the annual growth percentages, that the brain, briefly blinded, looks elsewhere.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, mine wandered to Philadelphia. Not the city itself, but rather <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2000/aug/02/uselections2000.usa5\" title=\"\">the Republican national convention held there in 2000</a>. They gathered to anoint George W Bush as their nominee and laid on a spectacle that had one striking feature. Though only 4% of the delegates in the hall were black, one headline speaker after another was either African-American or from some other identifiable minority.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/10/george-osborne-took-much-more-from-poor-budget-2015-ifs\">George Osborne took 'much more from the poor' in budget</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Primetime slots were given to Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, obviously, but the three co-chairs also happened to be a black Oklahoman, a Latino Texan and a white single mother. They found room for a gay congressman, while music came from Harold Melvin and Chaka Khan (African-American) with a cameo from Jon Secada (Cuban).</p> \n<p>The whole effect was so brazen, it was almost comic. (One reporter likened the extravaganza to the Black and White Minstrel Show.) But the political logic was clear. The Republicans didn’t expect huge swaths of black American voters to end their historic allegiance to the Democrats and join them. They knew their prospects among Latino and gay Americans were limited. But those groups were not the target audience.</p> \n<p>What Bush wanted to do was reassure white, suburban, swing, or floating, voters – especially women – that the Republicans had lost their harsh edge. That they were no longer so mean-spirited that a vote for them made you a bad person. The diverse faces on show at Philadelphia were there to salve the consciences of white soccer moms hesitating before backing Bush.</p> \n<p>Which might explain why the memory of it returned on Wednesday. For a similar dynamic was at work. Who was Osborne appealing to with his announcement of a “national living wage”? He knows that precious few of Britain’s lowest-paid workers are set to rally to the Tory banner any time soon.</p> \n<p>No, the voters Osborne wanted to reach are those for whom the Conservative brand is still tainted, those who may be doing quite well themselves, but who still associate the Tories with selfishness and even a callous disregard for the poor. Osborne was making a long-term bid for those votes. He knows they already trust him to have a cool head. Now he wants them to believe he has a warm heart.</p> \n<p>This calculus is not new. It underpinned the modernisation project on which Osborne and David Cameron embarked a decade ago. When 2005-era Cameron spoke of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2011/oct/02/cameron-tory-party-modern-compassionate\" title=\"\">“compassionate Conservatism”</a> it was not the poor he was wooing. He wanted the votes of those who care about the poor, or more accurately those who don’t like to think they’re the sort of person who doesn’t care.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Osborne has co-opted a halo brand that is not his – the living wage</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>If that sounds cynical, that’s only partly because – to quote the Resolution Foundation, the group name-checked by Osborne when he announced the policy – <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/RF-National-Living-Wage-briefing.pdf\" title=\"\">the “national living wage” is a misnomer</a>. Now that tax credits are to be taken away, you couldn’t actually live on it. It’s simply a welcome boost to, and relabelling of, the regular minimum wage. With unassailable chutzpah, Osborne has co-opted a halo brand that is not his – the living wage – in the hope that some of its glow will shine on him.</p> \n<p>There is a deeper reason for scepticism. Osborne’s generosity was very carefully rationed. His judgment on who should be helped was not based not so much on need as political value. At its most obvious, there was the now-familiar bias against the young, who don’t vote, in favour of the old, who do. But this is about more than just voting blocs. Running through the chancellor’s decisions was a judgment about who the public will deem deserving and who undeserving.</p> \n<p>Privately, the prime minister says pensioners have to be protected because they cannot change their circumstances. Which implies that the 20-year-old who will continue to work on the existing, miserly minimum wage, and is soon to be denied housing benefit and the possibility of a maintenance grant for study, is master of all he surveys, and only in his current situation because he has chosen not to change it.</p> \n<p>It’s not important whether Cameron or Osborne truly believe this. What matters is their assumption that the voters believe it. They are gambling that Britons have empathy for pensioners and underpaid over-25s, but little for the young, for those on incapacity benefit, or on a low income with more than two children and for those who work in the public sector – all of whom were hit hard by the budget.</p> \n<p>The cynical person here is Osborne himself. He is making a judgment about the limits of sympathy the majority of the electorate have for those falling behind. He has seen the shift in public mores, from the Cathy Come Home era of half a century ago to the Benefits Street culture of today, in which the poor are just as likely to induce anger as compassion.</p> \n<p>And what compassion there is, Osborne has learned not to take too seriously. He doubtless remembers those 80s opinion polls which for years showed Britons insisting they regarded mass unemployment – the issue then championed by Labour – as the prime challenge facing the country, only for those same voters to re-elect Margaret Thatcher again and again.</p> \n<p>Osborne has surely concluded that you need to do just enough to show you care – and then you can get away with plenty. Witness the inheritance tax giveaway that will take nearly &pound;1bn a year out of the public purse by 2020 and which hands the children of those with assets a big slab of untaxed, unearned income.</p> \n<p>In the supermarket trolley of Osborne’s budget were stashed a variety of such luxury treats, but he concealed them by putting a conspicuously organic, free range item – his “living wage” plan – on top.</p> \n<p>Labour should be watching and learning. It would be a mistake to conclude the British public is uncaring. But nor can Labour make its pitch to the electorate on empathy alone. Voting is not an act of charity, but of self-interest – even if that self-interest includes the kind of society you want to live in. Voters want to know they can trust you to run the economy – and if you can be kind to the less fortunate, the deserving ones at least, then that’s a very pleasant bonus. But it’s that way around – and George Osborne knows it.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436549478694/National-Minimum-Wage-To--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'The “national living wage” is a “misnomer”.

When we first revealed the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2007/jun/23/firsttimebuyers.buyingtolet\" title=\"\">vast tax reliefs paid to landlords</a>, Alistair Darling was about to assume the role. Why did it take a Tory chancellor – much to the shock of his voters – to take the first steps to clamp down on the excessive tax privileges enjoyed by landlords?</p> \n<p>Stephen Ludlow, chairman of big letting agent Ludlow Thompson, is – like many in the industry – bewildered by George Osborne’s cuts to tax relief. “Many investors voted against Labour in the election because of their attitude towards buy-to-let. They will not have expected such a move from the Conservatives,” he said after the budget speech.</p> \n<p>In the immediate aftermath of the speech the shares of specialist landlord lenders and housebuilders fell sharply, although most have since recovered. They underestimate the impact Osborne’s tax bombshell is going to have. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/jul/10/buy-to-let-budget-tax-profits-mortgage\" title=\"\">As we report today</a>, investors who rely on a typical buy-to-let mortgage to finance a purchase will see their returns shrivel dramatically. Annual returns could be slashed by around two-thirds, leaving investors with yields of as little as 0.6% a year on their properties. If and when interest rates rise, it could be game over for the amateur investor.</p> \n<p>How much have we read about newly liberated pension savers cashing in to invest in property? If they have to pay 6%-7% for the loan, can’t automatically write off 10% of their interest payments as “wear and tear” (what a fiddle that was), can only obtain tax relief at 20%, and can’t rely on the taxpayer to subsidise them with housing benefit payments, then it’s difficult to see how the financial equation will stack up.</p> \n<p>Property investment will pay out if house prices continue to rise, with investors cashing in on capital gains, subject of course to capital gains tax. But it’s a brave investor who thinks that at today’s elevated level of house prices there is going to be much more in the way of price growth. The market is at a stalemate: on the one hand prices are supported by a rising population, low interest rates and persistently low building volumes. On the other, mortgages are more difficult to obtain and, more importantly, income multiples at near breaking point in much of the country.</p> \n<p>We will hear heaps of tosh about how Osborne’s attack on landlords will hurt tenants most. The supply of rented property will dry up, they say, in the deluded belief that families today choose to rent rather than being forced to by high house prices. In any case, there are indications that the new tax regime will support institutional investment in rental property, which if it happens should lead to a saner, rather more German-style lettings market.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> The silent losers from this week’s budget are the self-employed. Not the high-earning IT and financial consultants, but the millions of people who have been forced into long hours and miserable pay since the financial crisis struck. For them the new national living wage is meaningless. There will be no automatic pay rise, but there will be a cut in tax credits, particularly if they had so irresponsibly had a third child.</p> \n<p>Self-employment has grown dramatically over the past decade and now accounts for one in seven of the workforce. Their pay is, on average, 40% below that of conventional employees, according to the Resolution Foundation. Between a quarter and a third of the growth in the self-employed is down to an increase in the numbers moving from unemployment into self-employment rather than becoming employees.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, employers will do their best to escape the new minimum wage legislation by outsourcing work to the “self-employed” when in truth they will be disguised employees. We should welcome the higher minimum wage – though it falls well short of what is needed to counter cuts in tax credits. And if the new living wage is going to have any credibility, enforcing it thoroughly is crucial.</p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436538652459/george-osborne-budget-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"George Osborne signals a red light to amateur buy-to-let landlords.

Looks like I’m just going to have to wing it <br /></p>","byline":"Tim Dowling","body":"<p>I’m in the supermarket, without a list; it must have fallen out of my pocket. I’ve already gone back to search the car, and to chase a few bits of windblown paper across the car park. I am presently reliving the moment, just before I left the house, when my wife made me show her the list to prove I had it with me.</p> \n<p>I ring her, but she doesn’t answer. I send her a&nbsp;text; she doesn’t reply. I&nbsp;ring my children in turn, oldest to youngest, but nobody picks up. “Why do we even have phones?” I&nbsp;say, out loud, into the&nbsp;phone.</p> \n<p>I close my eyes to try to picture the list, but I&nbsp;only remember it being long and specific, as if it contained the ingredients for an untested recipe. I wasn’t really listening when my wife handed it over. In truth, I&nbsp;have no idea why I’ve been sent here. As I pace the aisles with nothing but an empty shopping bag in my trolley, I move from being angry with myself to being angry with everything. It feels like progress.</p> \n<p>I ring my wife again. I send her an email that says, “ANSWER YR PHONE FFS.” I ring all my children again.</p> \n<p>Eventually, the youngest one picks up. “Why do you keep ringing me?” he asks, sounding groggy and pissed off.</p> \n<p>“Are you still in bed?” I say.</p> \n<p>“What do you want?”</p> \n<p>“Get Mum,” I say.</p> \n<p>“Ugh,” he says. “Hang on.”</p> \n<p>“Hurry up,” I say. “My phone’s running out.” For two minutes I&nbsp;hear nothing but footsteps, and the&nbsp;rustle of phone against cloth.</p> \n<p>“She’s not here,” he says.</p> \n<p>“How can she not be there?” I&nbsp;shout. “She was just there!”</p> \n<p>“I dunno,” he says.</p> \n<p>“Please get her to call me,” I say. I&nbsp;look up to find myself side-on in the bread aisle, oblivious and in the&nbsp;way.</p> \n<p>I don’t hear from anyone. I&nbsp;contemplate the prospect of going home empty-handed, or of spending&nbsp;all day wandering these aisles. After 10 minutes I ring the youngest one again.</p> \n<p>“I can’t find her,” he says.</p> \n<p>“Is her car out front?” I say.</p> \n<p>“Hang on,” he says. “Yes, it’s there.”</p> \n<p>“If the car’s there, then she’s there,” I say.</p> \n<p>“She isn’t,” he says.</p> \n<p>I think about this for a while. “She must be at one of the neighbours,” I say. “Either next door or round the corner.”</p> \n<p>“You can’t make me go looking for&nbsp;her,” he says.</p> \n<p>“Just go into the garden and scream, ‘Mum’,” I&nbsp;say. “Everyone’s windows are open.”</p> \n<p>“I’m not doing that,” he says.</p> \n<p>“Make it sound as if you’ve hurt yourself,” I say.</p> \n<p>“No,” he says.</p> \n<p>“It’s an emergency!” I say. “I have no list!”</p> \n<p>“Jesus Christ,” he says. My eye snags on something at the bottom of&nbsp;my shopping bag: a&nbsp;piece of paper, once folded in four, slowly opening like a flower. Along one edge, I see bit of&nbsp;my wife’s handwriting: “Cereal x 2”.</p> \n<p>“OK, thank you,” I say.</p> \n<p>“What?” says the youngest.</p> \n<p>“Gotta go,” I say. “Bye.”</p> \n<p>I shop quickly, hoping to finish before my wife rings, but the queues are long. I’m still waiting when the call comes.</p> \n<p>“Yes?” she says.</p> \n<p>“It was nothing,” I say. “I lost the&nbsp;list.”</p> \n<p>“Shall I text it to you?” she says.</p> \n<p>“No, I just guessed,” I say, deliberately discarding one of the two cereals to mimic the appropriate margin of error. “I think I got most of it.”</p> \n<p>“I can easily text it to you,” she says.</p> \n<p>“Too late,” I say. “I’m in the car.” I&nbsp;make a mental note to destroy the list, but I find it in my pocket two days later.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/7/1436270389969/Dowling-shopping-list-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","credit":"/Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","altText":"Dowling: shopping list","cleanCaption":"  Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-11T05:00:08Z","lastModified":"2015-07-11T05:00:08Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":9,"contributors":[{"name":"Tim Dowling","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733750190/TimDowling.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/timdowling"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Family","Life and style","Marriage","Parents and parenting"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/marriage","webTitle":"Marriage"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tim Dowling","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/timdowling"}}],"series":{"title":"Tim Dowling's Weekend column","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/timdowlingsweekendcolumn"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/11/tim-dowling-lost-shopping-list","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4adaf","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/11/tim-dowling-lost-shopping-list","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/11/tim-dowling-lost-shopping-list"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436270463745/0cadad70-cb0a-4985-8e41-1c6d698fe596-705x720.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":705,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","credit":"Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","altText":"Dowling: shopping list","cleanCaption":"Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian"}},"importance":4,"kicker":{"title":"Tim Dowling"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/7/1436270389969/Dowling-shopping-list-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","credit":"/Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","altText":"Dowling: shopping list","cleanCaption":"  Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"George Osborne's budget marks his full transformation from green ally to foe","rawTitle":"George Osborne's budget marks his full transformation from green ally to foe","item":{"type":"comment","id":"commentisfree/2015/jul/10/george-osbornes-budget-green-fuel-tax","title":"George Osborne's budget marks his full transformation from green ally to foe","trailText":"With the Lib Dems gone, the brake is off.

And <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2011/mar/23/budget-2011-george-osborne-green-bank\">he pushed through the creation of the green investment bank</a>, which the coalition would later point to as evidence they’d lived up to their <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2010/may/14/cameron-wants-greenest-government-ever\">aspiration of being the “greenest government ever”</a>.</p> \n<p>But fast forward to this week, and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/11718594/Green-energy-subsidies-spiral-out-of-control.html\">the Tories were briefing</a> that the chancellor believed the Liberal Democrats had let subsidies on clean energy – <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/policy-impacts-on-prices-and-bills\">which actually account for a tiny fraction of spending</a> – run out of control. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/blog/2012/nov/23/energy-bill-carbon-target-delay-live\">We know</a> the Lib Dems acted as a brake on Osborne’s attempts to water down environmental policies.</p> \n<p>Now that brake is off, as the emergency budget demonstrated. </p> \n<p>New roads will be built, fuel duty will be frozen (again), vehicle excise duty (“road tax”) will be reconfigured from 2017 so that, after the first year, the buyer of a low-carbon electric car will pay the same as buyers of the most polluting 4x4s and sports cars. </p> \n<p>Friends of the Earth calculates that the changes to road tax mean it’ll cost &pound;1,000 more to run a greener car over seven years. Even the industry doesn’t like it, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33447106\">saying it will disincentivise the takeup of low-emission vehicles</a>. </p> \n<p>On energy, the criteria for previously announced tax breaks for North Sea oil and gas exploration will be broadened. There is vague talk of a sovereign wealth fund for communities living near shale gas, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2014/nov/10/uk-proposes-shale-gas-sovereign-wealth-fund\">something Osborne has floated before</a>, despite <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jun/29/fracking-application-cuadrilla-rejected-lancashire-county-council\">communities in Lancashire giving shale exploration a resounding thumbs-down last month</a>.</p> \n<p>Energy efficiency schemes for business <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamvaughan_uk/status/618762879609753600\">will be reviewed later this year</a>, for which you can read watered-down. A target set during the last government to keep increasing the proportion of revenue from environmental taxes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamvaughan_uk/status/618763216999591936\">was dropped</a>. The green investment bank <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jun/25/senior-tories-slam-governments-green-investment-bank-sell-off\">is to be largely sold off</a>. </p> \n<p>But the big one was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/09/green-energy-sector-attacks-budget-climate-change-levy\">scrapping the exemption that renewable electricity producers had under the climate change levy</a>, a tax that is meant to help cut emissions. In effect, a green tax just became an energy tax. As one Friends of the Earth campaigner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamvaughan_uk/status/618808830768599040\">put it</a>, it’s “like making apple juice pay an alcohol tax”.</p> \n<p>All this comes on top of the newly elected government’s quickfire moves of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jun/18/tories-end-onshore-windfarm-subsidies-2016\">ending subsidies for onshore windfarms</a> and making it easier for local people to block them. </p> \n<p>And in case you were in any doubt about the direction of travel, on Friday <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/443897/Productivity_Plan_print.pdf\">the Treasury effectively killed off</a> a longstanding goal of making all new homes “zero carbon” from 2016. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem former energy secretary, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EdwardJDavey/status/619495261317033985\">said</a> of the decision that “Cameron may as well hug a coal power station”.</p> \n<p>Several senior figures in government, such as Cameron and the new energy and climate change secretary, <a href=\"https://decc.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/09/clear-priorities-for-decc/?utm_content=buffer683e0&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer\">Amber Rudd</a>, appear to be genuinely committed on a personal level to green issues.

No clear picture has emerged. Unless, that is, you disregard the investigations of the police and the courts, and do before-and-after comparisons of the newspapers themselves. Titles that once splashed on celebrity scandal day after day, their stories setting febrile agendas that seemed hard to escape, now quite often have to content themselves with news, politics and sport. One of those titles, of course, doesn’t even exist any more.</p> \n<p>“Celebrity culture” trundles on. But it’s a much less dominant and unruly force than it was at its peak. Private lives stay more private. “Superinjunctions” have stopped being the supposed legal menace that they were previously portrayed as being. “This is so much none of your business that we’re not even allowed to tell you that it’s none of your business,” the champions of the cheap press once thundered. Now, exclusives revolve around amazing facts such as a tennis player going out with a man who used to go out with another tennis player. There’s speculative gossip, but there’s not much exposure of real lives and relationships in actual meltdown. And that’s a good thing, because it’s seldom edifying, and seldom involves an angry and frustrated outburst that isn’t regretted.</p> \n<p>Willing victims do still come along though, offering object lessons in how quickly media exposure can make a bad situation worse. Karen Danczuk was until recently no more familiar to me than the spouse of an MP ought to be – which is not at all. Then news stories started appearing, reporting that the former Rochdale councillor posted lots of selfies <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karendanczuk\">on Twitter</a>, which featured cleavage, gaining lots of followers. There was only one possible conclusion to be drawn: this woman had breasts, and people like looking at breasts. I jest – the one possible conclusion that could be drawn was that Danczuk craved some attention and found it on social media.</p> \n<p>Sure enough, tutting all the while about how dreadful it was to crave attention on Twitter, the media obliged by giving it to her as well. But with that familiar twist the press loves, Danczuk was to be taught that she should be careful what she wished for. The attention was largely judgmental and negative.</p> \n<p>Plenty of people believe that, having attracted negative media attention, they can turn it round to “do good”. Danczuk was one such. She told the Sun that her selfies were a hard-won celebration of sexual attractiveness, something she had become able to express only after years of therapy. Danczuk said that she had been abused and raped by a “family friend” between the ages of six and 11. Her husband, Simon Danczuk, is the Labour MP for Rochdale, and is routinely described as “a maverick”. He is well known as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/jul/06/child-abuse-inquiries-widespread-cover-up\">a campaigner for the investigation of historic sexual abuse</a> in his constituency, and co-authored a book about Rochdale’s former MP, Cyril Smith, whose sexual abuse of young boys was fully acknowledged by the establishment only after the Jimmy Savile scandal.</p> \n<p>One of Karen Danczuk’s brothers, Michael Burke, has been arrested twice, first after a complaint by Danczuk herself, then again after two other women came forward with allegations of sexual abuse. Burke denies all allegations and has not been charged. But consequences in the home lives of the Danczuks have been more fast-moving. The couple have separated, and Simon Danczuk has announced that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/06/simon-danczuk-steps-back-campaigning-against-child-abuse\">he is withdrawing from his work on historic abuse</a>, saying that the strain of it has caused depression and alcohol dependency.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457418578__\n</div> \n<p>Ill-advisedly, they had “taken to Twitter”, as the papers say, while their marriage fell apart, each accusation and insult gleefully repeated in the press. One Mirror columnist, having described every detail of the saga except the involvement of either partner in historic sexual abuse in any way, beyond Simon Danczuk being “obsessed with downing paedophiles”, accused them of serving up “more of the same self-serving saccharine, slush-puppy emotion that passes for true feeling in the world of social media”, and of being “unintelligent idiots so selfish they are innately unsuited to the selfless role of parenthood”.</p> \n<p>How astounding. I can’t imagine what it’s like being a wife trying to support a husband knee-deep in testimony about child abuse at the best of times, let alone in circumstances like these. Sure, neither of the Danczuks have dealt with the situation in an exemplary fashion. I doubt many people could. Yes, social media can be a quick, easy and unreliable way of gaining a feeling of personal power and validation. But the mainstream media certainly wasn’t thinking of the children when it decided to highlight Danczuk’s use of it. Likewise, Danczuk is berated because she is “reportedly top of Channel 5’s wishlist” for Celebrity Big Brother. The person who put her at the top of this wishlist seems to be willing to exploit another person, while Danczuk is exploiting only herself. I know which I think is worse.</p> \n<p>Nobody has to hack the Danczuks’ phones to find out all this stuff about their personal lives. The couple’s mistake is in interpreting prurience as positive interest. They are naive to trust the media, social and otherwise. But at the heart of it all is a woman who may have good reason to be damaged and needy, who has waived her anonymity and spoken.</p> \n<p>All the media seems to have to offer in return is contempt, knocker-shot galleries and a slot on a TV freak show. One could argue that the couple brought it all on themselves. But as the phone-hacking revelations taught us, you don’t have to actively seek the attention of the media for them to riffle through your laundry basket and pronounce it in need of a wash. Unless, of course, it’s laundry so dirty that nothing could ever get it clean. Simon Danczuk knows what it’s like to sort through that. I doubt he foresaw that it would end with self-promoting idiots calling him a self-promoting idiot. The Danczuks may be messy. But things do get messy when you’re facing sheer depravity every day of your life.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436526589119/9a3bee45-3649-49f4-8400-476287bec0c0-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Gary Calton for the Observer","altText":"Karen and Simon Danczuk","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-10T15:07:35Z","lastModified":"2015-07-10T23:02:39Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Deborah Orr","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/8/20/1408550842728/Deborah-Orr-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/deborah-orr"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Social media","Newspapers","Celebrity","Digital media","Media","Newspapers & magazines","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"media/social-media","webTitle":"Social media"},{"id":"media/newspapers","webTitle":"Newspapers"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/celebrity","webTitle":"Celebrity"},{"id":"media/digital-media","webTitle":"Digital media"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"media/pressandpublishing","webTitle":"Newspapers & magazines"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Deborah Orr","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/deborah-orr"}}],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-457418578","source":"BBC / World at One ","durationInSeconds":59,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/06/150706SimonD.m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/06/150706SimonD_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/6/1436192032886/KP_344008_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for MP Simon Danczuk says child abuse campaigning made him depressed - audio","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for MP Simon Danczuk says child abuse campaigning made him depressed - audio","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for MP Simon Danczuk says child abuse campaigning made him depressed - audio"}}],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/10/tabloid-humiliation-danczuks","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agng","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jul/10/tabloid-humiliation-danczuks","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/10/tabloid-humiliation-danczuks"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436526589119/9a3bee45-3649-49f4-8400-476287bec0c0-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Danczuks were naive to trust the media, social or otherwise, writes Deborah Orr.
