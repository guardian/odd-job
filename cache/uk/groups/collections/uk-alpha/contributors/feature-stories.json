For the likes of Meg, no such genius seed is necessary. The concept is simply that a big fish presumed lost to history wasn’t, in fact – like a set of keys that turns up behind the sofa, or some burnt onions that are just about about edible after all.</p> \n<p>I’d always assumed dinosaur movies are such reliable cash cows because they’re family-friendly. The threat at their centre is, in the real world, pretty negligible. You could legitimately worry about cannibals or killer sharks or even poltergeists. But only the youngest among us would fret about something that’s extinct?</p> \n<p>Wrong. A friend on Facebook has asked people not to post about Jurassic World on account of her dino-phobia. She’s serious. Yet humans and dinosaurs never coexisted; there can be no hardwired evolutionary memory such as that which programmes us to move aside should a sabre-toothed tiger come round the corner.</p> \n<p>Such an irrational reaction, then, is a fantastic coup for cinema – great testimony to the power of movies to make the real unreal, to capture the imaginary. It also bodes well for Meg: Hell’s Aquarium.</p> \n<h2><strong>The garden of Franzen</strong></h2> \n<p><strong> </strong></p> \n<p>On Tuesday Lonely Planet <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/jun/17/kent-voted-europes-top-family-holiday-destination-by-lonely-planet\" title=\"\">voted Kent its top choice</a> as a family holiday destination. The guide cited the regenerated retro <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2011/aug/05/kent-coast-art-summer-holiday\" title=\"\">charms of Margate, and the posh caffs of Whitstable</a>.</p> \n<p>Kent would also, I’d suggest, be a good vacation tip for Jonathan Franzen. Not only is there lots of birdwatching, but trips to <a href=\"http://www.rochesterdickensfestival.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Rochester</a> and <a href=\"http://www.broadstairsdickensfestival.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Broadstairs</a>, to the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2012/jun/08/thames-hub-boris-island-hoo-peninsula\" title=\"\">marshes at Hoo</a> and the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2013/jun/13/trust-funds-church-treasures\" title=\"\">church at Cooling</a>, would help sate a Charles Dickens fixation that reaches giddy new heights in his new novel, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/27/jonathan-franzen-purity-novel-misanthropy\" title=\"\">Purity</a>.</p> \n<p>The heroine of that book is Pip. She’s an almost-orphan with a Havisham-ish mother and deep need of a benefactor. There’s a fugitive from justice who has committed a compassionate crime, much melodramatic coincidence, and a defence of the sort of long-form, socially conscious journalism that led to work such as Great Expectations in the first place. The biggest novel of the year has its roots firmly in the garden of England. Visit Kent should be thrilled.</p> \n<h2><strong>Fantasy fancies </strong></h2> \n<p><strong> </strong></p> \n<p>Recent discussion of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/kristen-stewart\" title=\"\">Kristen Stewart</a>, the actor whose mother may or may not have confirmed her bisexuality, has been accompanied by clapping and tutting – but not a lot of self-examination. Some say that the media has revealed its essential prejudice in its coverage; others accuse avaricious studios of stopping gay stars from coming out.</p> \n<p>Actually, such issues begin and end with us, the audience. Studios cater for markets; newspapers too. As witnessed at the time of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2014/apr/28/george-clooney-reported-engagement\" title=\"\">George Clooney’s engagement</a>, it appears many of us assume that if we fall into the broad category of people a movie star could fancy, they’re more likely to fall into bed with us. Yet such odds remain sadly slight. There is almost more chance of dinosaurs roaming the earth once more than Stewart sleeping with you, regardless of gender.</p> \n<p>Until our own egos can learn to cope with this, neither stars nor studios should be blamed for seeking to placate us.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434560643989/JURASSIC-WORLD-2015-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'A friend on Facebook has asked people not to post about Jurassic World on account of her dino-phobia.'

The more she<strong> </strong>parades her delusional thinking, the more she convinces everyone else that her notion of identity as a choice is simply wrong. Is she mad, bad and dangerous to know? She is certainly maddening. Her fraud, at first seen as a kind of extreme wiggerism, now appears pretty dreadful. Sure, she was extremely adept at feigning “blackness”, but appearance isn’t everything. Whatever she thought she was doing, she has taken jobs, scholarships and funding away from black people in pursuit of this strange mixture of narcissism and super-victimhood.</p> \n<p>People have every right to be angry with her, and her defiance is being stoked by the media. She continues to perpetuate the offence by talking of herself as “transracial”, a term that has been used to describe primarily the identities of black people who were adopted by white parents. Her cultural appropriation seriously knows no boundaries and that is why her case starts to point to what those boundaries might be.</p> \n<p>All culture <em>is</em> appropriation but she has so clearly “profited” from deceit that no one can think this OK. But can you try? Is transracial actually a thing? Should we try and go along with it? It turns out, amazingly, that it is not really a thing at all and it just shows how twisted up we have got. This woman could have been an advocate or a supporter of the organisation she worked for (NAACP) without this elaborately confected blackface. Her personality crisis is now a full-on psychodrama but what is at issue, what is eating away at our certainties, is this notion of authenticity.</p> \n<p>It has been important that a political understanding of identity, whether around race, class or gender, insists on the primacy of lived experience. We literally need to speak for ourselves, instead of having others define us and speak for us. Experience matters. This woman, then, cannot know what it is actually like to have black skin; her privilege is enacted exactly through her insistence that racial identity is a choice.</p> \n<p>She could instead have imagined what it is like to be black and spoken from that position. Why was that not enough? It seems to me that something quite disturbing is happening here that we are seeing more and more of, especially on social media and that is connection without empathy. There is now, on every level, unprecedented access to the lives of others but there is also something vicarious in this access. “I can feel your pain without going through it myself,” says the empathetic person. “I can feel your pain and speak for you,” says the psychopath.</p> \n<p>Somewhere in the middle of all this is surely a position where one can acknowledge difference but express a desire to stand together: good old-fashioned solidarity. Something has become completely skewed if one can only ever speak for oneself and never anyone else. Actual politics becomes undoable. Instead it is replaced by the constant policing and bickering in a war of positions based on smaller and smaller identities. Look at Twitter, where people’s bios are often little more than lists of symptoms, dressed up as some kind of radicalism, where the modus operandi is infinite “micro-aggression”. Here, the personal is not merely political, it trumps it.</p> \n<p>The personal is then seen as the only guarantor of the real and desire for the authentic is everywhere. The yearning of the Labour party right now to be represented by a real person – or Alan Johnson – is part of this.</p> \n<p>Yet all of us are told constantly both to be ourselves and to make ourselves up. You can be anything you want to be and you must keep it real are the twin messages. However artfully constructed our identities are, they rub up against lived experience and actual biology. Dolezal can argue all she likes that race is a social construct, but it is a social construct with very real consequences.</p> \n<p>Her fabrication of identity and need to assume the position of the victim has reminded some of Binjamin Wilkomirski, whose 1995 memoir as a holocaust survivor, Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood, complete with death-camp stories, tuned out to be completely made up. He wasn’t even Jewish.</p> \n<p>The ability to imagine someone else’s pain or oppression is different to claiming it for oneself. This ability to put yourself in someone else’s shoes, to identify beyond the narrow realms of one’s own experience, is actually fundamental to any kind of political movement. This kind of empathy leads to action; this kind of empathy makes us human. Without it, we can watch migrants drown.</p> \n<p>But identity politics, indeed all politics, gets entirely stuck when somehow it becomes reduced to only identity, to the oppression Olympics. That’s when cheating becomes an option.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434562777555/a5070382-d8c3-48d8-9bdf-a2c45a79d925-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Anthony Quintano/AP","altText":"Rachel Dolezal appears on the Today show with Matt Lauer.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Anthony Quintano/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-17T18:37:46Z","lastModified":"2015-06-18T07:13:22Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":165,"contributors":[{"name":"Suzanne Moore","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733749965/SuzanneMoore.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/suzannemoore"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Rachel Dolezal","Race issues","Politics","US politics"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/rachel-dolezal","webTitle":"Rachel Dolezal"},{"id":"world/race","webTitle":"Race issues"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"us-news/us-politics","webTitle":"US politics"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Suzanne Moore","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/suzannemoore"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/17/empathy-is-healthy-but-rachel-dolezal-claimed-someone-elses-pain-for-herself","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49qez","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/17/empathy-is-healthy-but-rachel-dolezal-claimed-someone-elses-pain-for-herself","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/17/empathy-is-healthy-but-rachel-dolezal-claimed-someone-elses-pain-for-herself"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434562777555/a5070382-d8c3-48d8-9bdf-a2c45a79d925-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rachel Dolezal appears on the Today show with Matt Lauer.

Except according to vet Linda Hornisberger, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3126254/Are-causing-DOG-suffer-psychological-burnout-Vets-say-pets-suffering-chronic-fatigue-living-anti-depressants-owners-busy-lifestyles.html\" title=\"\">canine depression isn’t a joke</a>. Cases of anxiety and chronic fatigue are on the rise - many dogs now have to be medicated just to deal with the stress of living with us.</p> \n<p>Hornisberger, who is also a behavioural psychologist, is reported as saying: “Today, dogs are increasingly completely overwhelmed and need to take antidepressants.”</p> \n<p>If the modern dog were to be allowed on to the psychiatrist’s couch, what would we discover? In the not too distant past, dogs mostly had to work for a living and were probably very often physically and mentally fatigued at the end of the day – which is why we have the expression “dog-tired”.</p> \n<p>Could the stress of being made redundant be the source of this apparent unhappiness? Dog behaviourist Penel Malby told me: “Dogs live very differently to the way they used to. Lots more dogs, lots more people, lots more stress for everyone, I think. If you think back even just 50 years, dogs were allowed to roam free every day, socialise with their neighbourhood friends. Now they either go out with a dog walker or go out for an hour if they’re lucky, and the rest of the time is spent at home.” And as people have become increasingly glued to social media and hand-held devices, dogs have well and truly had their noses put out of joint.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>One of my dogs has perfected hitting the restart button on my laptop to get my attention</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>There are reports of dogs becoming reactive to the sounds of phones and laptops. One of my own dogs has perfected hitting the restart button on my laptop to get my attention.</p> \n<p>Penel says part of the problem is the wrong dog in the wrong home: “You can’t get a working-strain gundog if you live in central London and expect it to be OK with a 30-minute trot around the park. Get the dog that fits your lifestyle, and be prepared to change your life as well. Dogs are emotional beings and need you too.”</p> \n<p>Tamara Cartwright-Loebl, another behaviourist who has offered dog daycare to London-based clients says: “Boredom is a big issue and a lack of company and also a lack of consistency and boundaries, and the fiddly-faddly ways of people. One daycare client came to me straight from America, complete with his Xanax. To be honest, I think I needed to take it when I saw it. It was a huge semi-wild working dog that she was treating as a baby – he had pyjamas and a special song.”</p> \n<p>Neither of the specialists I spoke to believed that drugs were the most effective way of treating dog behaviour – that is usually best tackled by addressing any problems with the owner. Having said that, there will always be some cases where drugs are a helpful tool. Jo Maisey’s dog Taffy has been on dog Prozac for a couple of years, and it has changed his life. At two years old Taffy came from a pound in Wales and was frightened of everything. He was scared of human hands, of noises, of pretty much everything. He appeared to have lived his life before that tied to a post, and his only interactions with humans were bad ones.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"25c5ce896a6b950f654cbc109bb2eea410728787\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434553088701/7d0f3a91-e3de-426e-9a04-3b794cb2d47d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sad dog\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Boredom is a big issue and a lack of company and also a lack of consistency and boundaries, and the fiddly-faddly ways of people’.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Radius Images/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jo told me: “The drugs give him a window to learn new coping strategies. They make him less fearful, less inhibited – slightly braver about trying something new. It’s not a cure on its own, but he now sometimes solicits attention from people where before he was too scared to go into our garden to go to the toilet.”</p> \n<p>So how do you know if your dog is depressed? What are the symptoms? Penel says: “Any change in behaviour should first be followed by a visit to the vet and a thorough check up to rule out a physical cause.” Tamara adds: “Trouble is, the most likely cause of depression is the owner’s treatment of the dog, so they’re unlikely to spot it. If it’s not medical, then maybe something has changed in their life – a divorce, kids leaving home, a new housekeeper or walker, another pet dying.” Many dogs will take such things in their stride. The depressed one may be missed as it won’t be causing trouble. It will be quieter, less inclined to walk or play, and may stop eating, just wanting to stay in its bed or to lie close to the owner.</p> \n<p>Those “devoted” dogs lying on their masters’ graves? They’re depressed. “Many dogs are simply depressed for their whole lives because they’re deprived of the normal amount of attention, exercise, and stimulation they need from day one. These humans won’t know they have a problem and won’t want the dog any livelier as that wouldn’t fit in with their lifestyle,” says Tamara.</p> \n<p>Since we can’t ask dogs to tell us what is worrying them, we must try harder to figure it out for ourselves. That often starts by looking at our own behaviour.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434551723818/A-Rhodesian-Ridgeback-pup-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'If the modern dog were to be allowed on to the psychiatrist’s couch, what would we discover?'

The full gory details of the &pound;12bn benefit cuts the Tories <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/08/tories-12bn-welfare-cuts-mythical-scroungers-conservatives\" title=\"\">refused to identify</a> in the election will have to wait for next month’s “emergency” budget. But Osborne has already rushed through &pound;4.5bn of new cuts and asset sales to get us all in the mood. And he and Cameron are counting on a punch-drunk Labour frontbench to smooth the imposition of a punitive fiscal regime. To wrongfoot the opposition still further, the chancellor now plans to enforce permanent budget surpluses in law. It is, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/12/osborne-plan-has-no-basis-in-economics\" title=\"\">as 77 leading economists warned</a>, a dangerous political gimmick that could help trigger <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/12/academics-attack-george-osborne-budget-surplus-proposal\" title=\"\">another 2008-style debt crisis</a>.</p> \n<p>But indefinite austerity, which transfers wealth from public to private and poor to rich, is Osborne’s aim. Under the coalition it brought economic recovery to a halt and had to be quietly shelved even to achieve the faltering growth of the past couple of years. But now they’re going to kick it all off again, just as the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/ng-interactive/2015/jun/17/greek-debt-crisis-what-happens-next\" title=\"\">Greek crisis is engulfing the eurozone</a>.</p> \n<p>Powerful Tory figures and the OECD are warning Osborne to slow down his planned cuts – or risk stifling growth and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/11/george-osborne-pressure-slow-welfare-cuts\" title=\"\">hitting workers dependent on tax credits and housing benefit</a>. But instead he’s plunging into a fire sale of government assets: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/11618980/George-Osborne-to-privatise-23bn-of-taxpayer-assets.html\" title=\"\">&pound;23bn worth of privatisations</a> – from the huge public stakes in <a href=\"http://weownit.org.uk/blog/george-osborne-dont-be-chump-keep-our-top-trumps\" title=\"\">RBS, Lloyds, Royal Mail, the Royal Mint, Met Office and Channel 4</a>.</p> \n<p>Not only did the Tories fail to mention most of these privatisations – opposed by the public in repeated polling – before the election, but RBS alone is to be sold at a &pound;13bn loss, throwing away the chance of a publicly owned bank that could help rebuild&nbsp;the economy. And their exchange of long-term revenues for short-term cash injections will do nothing to reduce the deficit.</p> \n<p>But then that’s not really the point. The idea is to hand over anything and everything to the City while massaging next year’s borrowing figures. The same determination to enrich their friends while disabling opponents is evidently what also drives <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/15/unison-boss-to-tell-government-that-efforts-to-crush-unions-will-fail\" title=\"\">Cameron’s plans to make most strikes illegal</a>. And he’s planning to slash Labour party funding by forcing trade unionists to jump an extra legal hurdle to assign their political levy.</p> \n<p>Opposition to all this has barely begun. But there’s no democratic reason for people to accept it. The Tories were elected by fewer than 37% of voters. Only 24% of those eligible backed the Conservatives – and that’s not counting the unregistered.</p> \n<p>The Conservatives have never won a parliamentary majority on a lower share of the vote in their history. Most of the public oppose the extreme austerity the Tories are preparing to mete out, just as they reject the privatisations. Like the new <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/27/labour-funding-hit-change-political-levy-bill\" title=\"\">union political levy “opt-in”</a>, they didn’t feature in the Tory manifesto. The Conservatives have no mandate for these measures. And as for ramping up strike-ballot thresholds while denying trade unionists the chance to vote online, that is a straightforward attack on democratic rights – which should, and will be, resisted.</p> \n<p>But the response of Labour’s leadership candidates has been to run a Dutch auction of progressive policies, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/31/labour-leadership-yvette-cooper-attacks-rivals-andy-burnham-liz-kendall\" title=\"\">“swallow the Tory manifesto”</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/20/blairite-revival-leadership-contest-labour-breakup\" title=\"\">compete to be the most “pro-business”</a>.

He's likely to do better than pundits think</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>That’s why the success of the campaign to get the veteran Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn – or “terrorist-loving leftie” as the Sun prefers to call him – on to the leadership ballot must be welcome. By providing a rallying point for those who want opposition to austerity and endless war, his candidacy should at least halt the mainstream candidates’ stampede to the right – which is taking them further away from the <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/juncture/a-defeat-to-reckon-with-on-scotland-economic-competence-and-the-complexities-of-labours-losses\" title=\"\">voters they need to win back</a>.</p> \n<p>Given that any <a href=\"https://supporters.labour.org.uk/leadership/1\" title=\"\">Labour supporter</a> can now sign up to vote for &pound;3, the reluctant Corbyn is likely to do better than many media pundits imagine. There’s a clear parallel with the insurgent role of the socialist US senator <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/01/us/politics/challenging-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-gains-momentum-in-iowa.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Bernie Sanders</a>, currently challenging Hillary Clinton from the left for the Democratic party presidential nomination. Dismissed by the establishment, Sanders has galvanised support from young people with his opposition to corporate greed and support for higher taxes on the rich and military spending cuts — and is now running <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/16/bernie-sanders-new-hampshire-primary-poll_n_7598408.html\" title=\"\">within 10 points of Clinton in the New Hampshire primary polls</a>. Partly because of the mood Sanders is drawing on, <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/08/hillary-bill-clinton\" title=\"\">Clinton is having to shift ground on issues </a>such as inequality and “free trade” deals.</p> \n<p>One way or another, the political establishment cartels have to be broken open if the majority are going to get a look-in. In Britain, last month’s election has been portrayed as a Conservative landslide. It was nothing of the kind. Cameron has a majority of 12 in the Commons – which has already shown itself vulnerable to pressure, despite Labour prevarication – and none in the Lords.</p> \n<p>The Tories are far from having the wind in their sails. Regardless of the election result, they’re still widely regarded as the creatures of a discredited elite, with no answer to the now almost universally acknowledged crisis of inequality – except to deepen it. They are slashing support for an economy yet fully to recover and which is in no state to withstand renewed shocks.</p> \n<p>There’s no necessity to put up with the attacks they’re about to launch on millions of people’s living standards, and every reason to resist them. The austerity programme needs to be opposed in parliament, but also with industrial action, demonstrations and local campaigns. That process is already kicking off, with a <a href=\"http://www.thepeoplesassembly.org.uk/end_austerity_now_national_demonstration_saturday_20th_june\" title=\"\">national anti-austerity march in London this Saturday</a>.</p> \n<p>If opposition is to be successful beyond particular issues, it will need to become a social movement. But the starting point has to be a break with a post-election sense of public powerlessness. Unchecked austerity is not&nbsp;inevitable.

As Athens will be unable to satisfy its financial obligations after a default, many hardliners expect Greece to leave the eurozone, and printing as much neo-drachma as necessary. Some see this as the only solution to the Greek crisis: it would allow Greece to devalue its new currency, supposedly making the country competitive and resulting in economic growth and the ability to repay its debt. Others are more sceptical: they fear that the new drachma would be an obstacle to trade, increasing the cost of imports and making it impossible for Greece to ever repay anything.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/live/2015/jun/16/greek-crisis-negotiations-deadlocked-as-time-runs-short-live-updates\">Greece crisis: US urges compromise after Greek PM attacks IMF - as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What many commentators appear to be missing, however, is that Greece may not have to leave the eurozone after a default. The legal basis for “forcing” a country out is certainly shaky. Since both the treaty on the European Union (Maastricht, 1992) and the treaty on the functioning of the European Union (Rome, 1958) are designed to strengthen integration, becoming a member of the EU and eurozone is meticulously regulated, while only article 50 of the EU treaty regulates how a state can leave the union. And a mechanism for leaving only the eurozone or for expulsion even has not been provided for at all.</p> \n<p>Using the euro without being a member of the eurozone or even the EU is hardly unprecedented: Montenegro, Kosovo, the Vatican City, Andorra, San Marino and Monaco all do so at the moment. Nor are these exceptions euro-specific oddities. The US dollar is currently legal tender in Ecuador, El Salvador, East Timor, several micro-states and Zimbabwe, while in Panama only dollar bills are in use.</p> \n<p>If this is common practice, Greece cannot be put into a worse position than states using the euro without being a member of the EU and who did not have to meet the convergence criteria. Instead, Athens’s voting rights on euro-related issues could be suspended, as well as the right to mint coins and print banknotes until Greece meets the convergence criteria again.</p> \n<p>Keeping Greece in the eurozone despite a default would preserve its access to the eurozone market, avoid the vast expense of reintroducing of the drachma, and pave the way for negotiations on credit payments in the future – while still remaining in line with the EU treaties. This procedure would also defend the integrity of the euro: an important goal if the currency is to be perceived as a stable alternative to the US dollar. Above all, it is possible that the markets are going to test the eurozone’s stability by attacking other states – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-20-years-pound-erm\">as in 1992</a>, when the European exchange rate mechanism was destroyed. Making use of a weak spot in the system cost European taxpayers billions at that time.</p> \n<p>Of course, nobody really knows what happens if Greece chooses to leave the eurozone or stay within, or if it is forced out, for instance by the ECB severing the money supply.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>According to the EU treaty, its aim is to promote peace and the wellbeing of its peoples</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Regarding bankruptcy, there are several hints that a default might not be quite as catastrophic for Greece’s economy as many assume. In 2014, Carmen Reinhart and Christoph Trebesch stated in their paper <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w20577\">A Distant Mirror of Debt, Default and Relief</a>, “the economic landscape after a final debt reduction is characterized by higher income levels and growth, lower debt servicing burdens and lower government debt”. Not only were growth rates after a default significant, but access to new credits recovered surprisingly quickly: in the 1980s it took on average four years while credits in the 1990s were handed out almost immediately after bankruptcy.</p> \n<p>Certainly, another bankruptcy immediately after a default is less likely, making a new credit an attractive investment. Additionally, Greece should also have access to EU support – unlike those states that were part of the aforementioned study.</p> \n<p>No matter what the proposal on aid for a post-default Greece, whether a parallel currency or a new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Marshall_Plan\">Marshall plan</a>, details are open to debate and a constructive debate needs time. This June, the UN independent expert on foreign debt, <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Development/IEDebt/Pages/IEDebtIndex.aspx\">Juan Pablo Bohoslavsky</a>, stated the “no bailout clause” of the Lisbon treaty would function best in combination with a human rights-based sovereign insolvency mechanism. In the meantime, the IMF research team under Oliver Blanchard debunked the myth of the trickledown effect and admitted that the effects of IMF policies in Greece were misunderstood. Both examples show that the discussion with new ideas has just started.</p> \n<p>According to the EU treaty, the EU’s aim is to promote peace and the wellbeing of its peoples. Based on the rule of law, the EU should achieve economic growth, price stability, full employment, social progress and solidarity among its member states. A Juncker administration rediscovering the European commission’s role as the guardian of the treaties should lead a meaningful and honest discussion on state bankruptcy. Keeping Greece in the eurozone after a default is in line with the treaties but can only be a first step.

I suspect this won’t end well","byline":"Kathryn Flett","body":"<p>Chris Evans is an instinctive, populist broadcaster already comfortably embraced by the BBC, not to mention a devoted petrolhead with an excess of anarchically boys-y form (and cars). He&nbsp;has long since atoned – in print and on air – for his many tediously brattish sins, so when the story of Jeremy Clarkson’s inevitable sacking unfolded, Evans was the first name to trend on social media as the likely candidate for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/17/top-gearchris-evans-bbc-pay-radio-2-graham-norton\" title=\"\">the Top Gear gig</a>. Being a white, middle-aged, multimillionaire man of the people clearly didn’t hurt either. Jodie Kidd and/or Idris Elba really never&nbsp;stood a chance.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/17/top-gearchris-evans-bbc-pay-radio-2-graham-norton\">Top Gear deal set to make Chris Evans the BBC's highest-paid star</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Therefore, despite his repeated denials of interest, last Friday’s one-off (allegedly) <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/15/chris-evans-tfi-friday-channel-4-bbc-radio-2\" title=\"\">return to Channel 4 for TFI Friday</a> turned out in effect to be an audience-wooing job application: a pre-recorded clip featured a guest appearance by Clarkson “auditioning” Evans for the role; the former world touring car champion Jason Plato turned up disguised as “The Stink”, Chris’s 89-year-old mum did a lap of the Top Gear track in a (reasonably priced) mobility scooter. Finally, there was a mis-pitched headline spot for the current Formula One champion, Lewis Hamilton, who has a &pound;100m Mercedes contract, a current (alleged) date – Kendall Jenner – but not an excess of on-screen charisma.</p> \n<p>Unsurprisingly, this approach didn’t please everyone (“boooooring” shouted Twitter, as Twitter is toddlerishly wont to do), yet TFI’s 3 million-plus viewers ensured C4 an 18% share of the available audience, so Evans and the Beeb will presumably both be grateful for last Friday (even though, according to his six-minute monologue on today’s Radio 2 Breakfast Show, the BBC’s boss class had in fact sent their pretty-please-come-and-present-Top-Gear text to Evans the day before TFI).</p> \n<p>I’m mostly an Evans fan. We share a birthday – the character-forming 1 April – and my car radio is often tuned to his show for the school run. But I do worry that in its desperation, the corporation has swapped one too-big-to-control uber-star for another. Like Clarkson when he was on Top Gear, Evans will be the BBC’s highest paid presenter.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Jodie Kidd and/or Idris Elba really never stood a chance</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Whenever the subject of cars crops up on his show (which is a lot), I invariably turn off. This is not because I am uninterested in cars – in fact, I’m a bit of a petrolhead myself on the quiet – but because I find his show’s adrenalised, car-themed, alpha-male Children in Need auctions and year-round motor-related fundraising spinoffs faintly noxious listening.</p> \n<p>I may well be in a minority here (he raises enormous amounts of money, yada yada … ) however Evans’s apparently unchecked public co-opting of a petrol-fumed world previously kept discreetly behind expensively closed hotel function-room doors can feel uncomfortably divisive.</p> \n<p>This smugly back-slapping high-end charity auction circuit is to rich-listees what EuroMillions and meat raffles are to the rest of us. The charity auction circuit is a big guilt-stripping and asset-dumping part of the lives of many slebs&nbsp;and super-rich. The idea is clearly that the sound of haves coughing up cash to purchase posh treats offers turbo-charged vicarious thrills for listening have-nots. But whenever I hear&nbsp;Evans using the show to encourage this privileged minority to fork out even&nbsp;more hundreds of thousands of pounds to buy themselves into, say, the pit-lane at Monaco – forever beyond the reach of the majority of his listeners – I just wish he’d stop being quite so bloody&nbsp;gauche, close the door gently, put on black tie and go and do it all somewhere else, and far more quietly.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Yet I don’t blame Evans, whose trajectory towards full-blown adulthood is steady but not speedy</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>So he is indulged even now. Yet I don’t blame Evans, whose trajectory towards full-blown adulthood is steady but not speedy (and which will, ironically, probably become even slower once he gets to put his foot down at Top Gear), but the Beeb – which still remains in thrall to its biggest, most charismatic money-spinning stars.</p> \n<p>Even pre-post-Clarkson, I’ll bet nobody at the BBC was prepared to say, “Actually, Chris, this self-congratulatory rich blokes pledging hundreds of grands thing doesn’t actually make great radio” – so who would dare now? Best we&nbsp;just strap&nbsp;in and brace ourselves for a lot more Evans-driven multiplatform car-related BBC synergy.</p> \n<p>Ultimately the issue is not “Will Evans make a great Top Gear presenter?” (of course he will, he’s effectively been auditioning for it his whole life), but “Can the BBC learn from its previous mistakes and rein in yet another famously petulant celebrity cash cow?”. In short, could topping up the tank with a presenter arguably even further&nbsp;removed from the rest of us than was Clarkson potentially – ahem – backfire? And how much bigger than Evans’s own vaulting ambition is&nbsp;that venerable brand Top Gear?</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434561348051/Chris-Evans-and-his-Ferra-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘I do worry that in its desperation, the BBC has swapped one too-big-to-control uber-star for another.

Corbyn is different from the other candidates for obvious reasons. He has been an outspoken critic of government cuts, opposes Trident, has been a respected voice of reason on foreign policy, and recognises that addressing climate change is a way out of our economic crisis, not a distraction from it. His candidacy ensures these critical issues will be on the agenda.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/17/caroline-lucas-urges-labour-to-back-progressive-pacts-with-other-parties\">Caroline Lucas urges Labour to back 'progressive pacts' with other parties</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But whoever takes over the reins of the Labour party needs to recognise that, if Labour is to increase its relevance and appeal, it needs to become a movement that embraces the energy and vibrancy of all those who support a progressive, multi-party politics, both inside political parties and in our communities. This must include support for a fairer voting system, a commitment to genuine engagement with voters, and an open mind, at least, on locally agreed electoral pacts. It’s certainly a challenge, but an entirely different type of politics could be the result.</p> \n<p>So my question to candidates taking part in tonight’s hustings is this: will you be part of this new multi-party politics for Britain?</p> \n<p>Before the next general election, those of us promoting a more progressive politics must think long and hard about how we achieve it, given the longstanding opposition to electoral reform from the majority of both Tory and Labour MPs. First-past-the-post is designed to keep power in the hands of the few – it’s clear that we need to hack the system before we can change it.</p> \n<p>One strategy – which is my personal view and on which I would value contributions from others – might be to consider the potential for progressive pacts. A possible first step could be for Labour, Greens, Lib Dems, the SNP and Plaid Cymru to empower local branches with the ability to back candidates from other parties if they wish.</p> \n<p>Secondly, and in a transparent and open way, those of us who want progressive pacts could set out a core set of pledges that parliamentary candidates must follow if they want cross-party support. No doubt, for a local Green party to back a candidate from another party, that candidate needs to commit to serious action on tackling climate change, recognising that we must live within ecological limits, and take a very firm stance against further austerity and the selling-off of our public goods. Crucially, local voters would need to have their say and be properly involved – they’re the ones who should be the ultimate beneficiaries.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Labour, Greens, Lib Dems, the SNP and Plaid Cymru could empower local branches to back candidates from other parties</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But a prerequisite for a progressive politics of the future must be an acceptance that we desperately need a fairer voting system for general elections. As the sole Green party MP – despite more than <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/08/green-party-vote-increases-caroline-lucas\">one million people voting Green in the last election</a> – I’m aware that my calls for a fairer voting system may sound self-interested. But it’s time for Labour in particular to realise that if it wants to call itself “progressive”, it cannot stand for an electoral system that systematically marginalises the vast majority of people’s views – and hands supreme power to a party that 76% of people didn’t vote for.</p> \n<p>Moreover, the result in Scotland, where <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/08/jim-murphy-scottish-labour-bounce-back-snp\">Labour won 700,000 votes but only one MP</a>, must surely be a loud enough wake-up call that our broken electoral system can no longer be relied upon by Labour, even in purely self-interested terms. It’s worth noting here that the SNP, which benefited so significantly from first-past-the-post, continues to back a proportional voting system for Westminster.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/08/green-party-vote-increases-caroline-lucas\">Green vote increases four-fold, but Caroline Lucas remains party's only MP</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I do not pretend to offer a complete solution to our political malaise, and I recognise the challenges inherent in what I’m setting out. For example, many Labour or Lib Dem candidates wouldn’t get approved by a Green party meeting, or vice versa. But what I cannot be more sure of is the fact that those of us who are serious about addressing the climate crisis, or halting and reversing the destruction of our welfare state, must find a way to work together – and do so quickly. In the grim context of accelerating climate change and deepening austerity, and when one in five families say they’ve already had to cut back on food because of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2013/jan/03/child-benefit-changes-what-they-mean\">child benefit changes</a>, the need for a new progressive politics could not be more urgent.</p> \n<p>I hope that Labour’s leadership candidates recognise that multiparty politics is here to stay – and I look forward to hearing how they’ll embrace the change rather than attempt, against the tide of history, to clamp down on it.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434540860818/Labour-Canvass-For-Votes--007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images","altText":"Labour Canvass For Votes Before May's General Election","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-17T13:08:30Z","lastModified":"2015-06-17T13:51:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":806,"contributors":[{"name":"Caroline Lucas","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/6/17/1434548570311/Caroline-Lucas-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/carolinelucas"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Electoral reform","Local politics","Labour party leadership","Labour","Proportional representation","Green party","Politics","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/electoralreform","webTitle":"Electoral reform"},{"id":"politics/localgovernment","webTitle":"Local politics"},{"id":"politics/labourleadership","webTitle":"Labour party leadership"},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour"},{"id":"politics/pr","webTitle":"Proportional representation"},{"id":"politics/green-party","webTitle":"Green party"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Caroline Lucas","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/carolinelucas"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/17/challenge-labour-hack-system-multiparty-politics-local-pacts","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49qx3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/17/challenge-labour-hack-system-multiparty-politics-local-pacts","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/17/challenge-labour-hack-system-multiparty-politics-local-pacts"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434540860818/Labour-Canvass-For-Votes--007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Labour MP Stephen Twigg canvasses before the general election in Battersea. ‘Local voters need to have their say and be properly involved - they’re the ones who should have be the ultimate beneficiaries of any pacts.’ Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images","credit":"Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images","altText":"Labour Canvass For Votes Before May's General Election","cleanCaption":"Labour MP Stephen Twigg canvasses before the general election in Battersea. ‘Local voters need to have their say and be properly involved - they’re the ones who should have be the ultimate beneficiaries of any pacts.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images"}},"importance":3,"byline":{"title":"Caroline Lucas"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"cutout","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/6/17/1434548570311/Caroline-Lucas-R.png"}}]}],"lastModified":"2015-06-18T08:07:42Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/uk-alpha/contributors/feature-stories","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/uk-alpha/contributors/feature-stories"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"uk-alpha/contributors/feature-stories/front"}
