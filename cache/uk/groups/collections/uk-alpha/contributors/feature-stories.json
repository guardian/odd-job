After the shooting at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, it surely has to go","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>A common refrain in America’s south is that the region has changed, and the persistent image of racism is unfair. It is pointed out, with some justification, that race-related violence is as much a problem in divided northern cities, maybe even more so. But such claims of a change are undermined by the sight of the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/confederate-flags-flies-south-carolina-debate-continues-symbol/story?id=31892710\" title=\"\">Confederate flag flying on the lawn outside the state capitol in Columbia</a>, South Carolina. Some whites argue that the flag is part of the southern heritage, a reminder of a civil war that they say was as much about state rights as slavery. But for African Americans – and many whites – the flag is a symbol of racial hatred.</p> \n<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People began a boycott in 1999, urging tourists to avoid the state, in protest at the flag. It became an issue, too, in the Republican presidential race a year later. In the end, state legislators <a href=\"http://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/race/041300race-ra.html\" title=\"\">opted in 2000 for a cynical compromise</a>, moving it from the roof of the capitol but only as far as a flagpost on the lawn, amid statues of politicians, many of them segregationists.</p> \n<p>In the aftermath of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church shooting in Charleston, <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/jeb-bush-mitt-romney-south-carolina-confederate-flag\" title=\"\">there are fresh calls for the removal of the flag</a>. There were protests in Charleston and Columbia at the weekend against racism, with many whites present, buttressing the idea of a changing south. But it is a disgrace that the flag is still flying, a daily slight to African Americans who make up more than 40% of Columbia’s population. It is long past the time for it to come down.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/dfe73c990990f4cb4a103a97f7d0592b58195a2e/0_42_3500_2099/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2099,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jason Miczek/Reuters","altText":"The US flag and South Carolina state flag fly at half mast in the grounds of the South Carolina State House in Columbia after the shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church shooting in Charleston.

Young and old, first-time protesters alongside old hands, said they were going home to organise. The shock of the election result had galvanised them to action. But what next, and how?</p> \n<p>Sober indignation was the tone.

The format is a killer: the four of them in a row, given only a minute to answer each question, just time for a soundbite, but no more. What serious job interview would be conducted like that? Where is the chance to probe them on the economy, cuts, the EU referendum, health and social care? Thundering platitudes are the result: is there any politician anywhere who doesn’t proclaim they want every child to have a fair start in life? It’s not their fault the format irons the three main contenders flat. With a series of these achingly painful parades to come, let’s hope the coming&nbsp;television and radio hustings are&nbsp;better at revealing hidden depths and shallows.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Jeremy Corbyn is a good man, sincere, ascetic, beloved by constituents – but voting for him is ignoring the electorate</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But the format greatly advantages <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Corbyn</a>, who wins on the clapometer. He is the free spirit, the outsider not playing by the usual political rules. Unfettered by what a majority of voters beyond Islington might support in a real election, he’s a romantic, saying what no doubt many Labour members believe. Uninhibited, he makes the rest sound cautiously lock-jawed, knowing what they say now will be used against them by the Tories and their press in future.</p> \n<p>Politics is often about symbols, not reality. Take<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2014/oct/25/trident-defence-treaty-nuclear-weapons-programme\" title=\"\"> Corbyn’s anti-Trident stand</a>: I imagine, but I don’t know, that the potential leaders would not choose to spend tens of billions on these four submarines. But Labour is pledged to them, because any hint of unilateralism brands the party as unelectably reckless. I can argue against Trident, but Labour in opposition dare not.</p> \n<p>Corbyn is a 1983 man, a relic of the election that brought him to parliament when Labour was destroyed by its out-of-Nato, anti-EU, renationalise-everything suicide note. He’s a good man, sincere, ascetic, beloved by constituents – but voting for him is ignoring the electorate. Goodness knows Labour faces tough dilemmas – how to win north and south, reclaim the lost votes of the old (<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/22/election-2015-who-voted-for-whom-labour-conservatives-turnout\" title=\"\">47% of over 65s voted Tory</a>) and win back Scotland, while fighting off Ukip in the heartlands.&nbsp;Every Corbyn vote gives ammunition to Labour’s enemies: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/politics-blog/11680016/Why-Tories-should-join-Labour-and-back-Jeremy-Corbyn.html\" title=\"\">Toby Young won’t be the only Tory maliciously paying &pound;3</a> as a “supporter” to vote for him so they can claim Labour is back to the days of delusion.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, as the hustings trundle on, the government is charging ahead with its monstrous <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/21/andy-burnham-rejects-osborne-call-labour-support-12bn-welfare-cuts\" title=\"\">&pound;12bn benefit cuts</a>, hoping the savagery will be forgotten in five years. Cameron maintains the&nbsp;breathtaking pretence that cutting tax credits will somehow relieve instead&nbsp;of add to poverty, with no attempt to offer a living wage.</p> \n<p>Nor will he safeguard disability benefits. ONS figures released later this week are expected to show that some 300,000 more&nbsp;children are in poverty. Gargantuan cuts in the coming budget will be the best reminder of why selecting the most electable Labour leader matters – not because of ideologies, but to put bread and butter on the tables of those&nbsp;driven&nbsp;to&nbsp;food&nbsp;banks.</p> \n<p>It’s early days, with so many hustings still to come, but as candidates react to events between now and September, the argument between the three main contenders is shaping up. Those who say “they’re all the same” are just not&nbsp;listening.</p> \n<p>L<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/15/liz-kendall-labour-leadership-interview\" title=\"\">iz Kendall</a>, fresh and relatively unknown, has disappointed some backers who hoped she’d have the dynamism of the insurgent. Her presentation has been lacklustre. She adopts totemic policies – for free schools, higher defence spending and the “centre ground”. She’s a “moderniser”, but calls for “reform” may seem a little otiose by 2020 if few services remain in the public realm. “<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-party-leadership-blairite-liz-kendall-emerges-as-fresh-rival-to-ed-miliband-10000840.html\" title=\"\">What matters is what works</a>” – well, yes, but who says otherwise? She has yet to show policy depth behind the words, with no flashes of Tony Blair’s 1997 radicalism – an equivalent to his minimum wage or &pound;5bn windfall tax.</p> \n<p>Unless she ups her game, the contest is between <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/andyburnham\" title=\"\">Andy Burnham</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/yvette-cooper\" title=\"\">Yvette Cooper</a>. His Liverpool working class backstory is a great asset. Cooper has a bit of the northern too – and the advantage that Labour needs a woman leader. The decider may be less about right and left than who has the credibility, solidity under fire, and the economic confidence and intellect to carry the argument against extreme austerity. Burnham’s <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3132916/Labour-leadership-frontrunner-Andy-Burnham-says-party-toxic-Ed-Miliband.html\" title=\"\">interview in the Mail on Sunday</a> seems to row back from his recent claim that Ed Miliband’s was the best manifesto he had ever stood on, resiling from some of it. Burnham was fast out of the traps to attack Osborne’s benefit cuts yesterday – but Cooper was there too, defending tax credits and calling for a living wage.</p> \n<p>Cooper is on the up, her every outing leaving audiences thinking better of her. She even impressed the press gallery last week, the toughest gig of all. This question killed Miliband: did Labour overspending leave Britain vulnerable in the crash? Unlike Kendall, Cooper refuses to concede. It’s not true, she won’t say it and she can say why with a punchy economic explanation poor Miliband never learned. No need to choose yet: any of the three may shine brighter in the next months, but my hunch is Cooper is the one to beat.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The decider may be less about right and left than who can carry the argument against extreme austerity</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434997221829/Yvette-Cooper-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Labour Party leadership candidate Yvette Cooper speaks at a hustings event in Stevenage.

The humanitarian response has been life-saving and heroic. But it has also been inadequate. The scale of human catastrophe demands new thinking, not just about how much more aid is needed, but also about how much better the aid could be.</p> \n<p>The bulk of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/apr/08/foreign-aid-spending-2014-least-developed-countries\" title=\"\">$135bn given in aid by major donors</a> goes to stable states with low or middle incomes by world standards. These countries are indeed where the majority of the world’s poor live, with a third in India alone. However, in India and China, in the rest of east Asia and in the more stable parts of Africa, economic growth and foreign remittances dwarf the impact of aid in alleviating poverty. Trade regimes, agricultural subsidies and tariffs, and migration policies have a bigger impact on poverty in these countries than aid.</p> \n<p>This is not the case for states consumed by conflict – and the geography of poverty is shifting towards these countries. Almost half the world’s extreme poor (defined as living on less than $1.25 a day) now live in what are classed as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/feb/12/aid-billions-fragile-states-icai-dfid\" title=\"\">“fragile” states</a> – states that lack the capacity, will or legitimacy to protect their citizens. By 2030 two-thirds of the world’s poor will live in such places, which are also far more likely to suffer droughts, floods, hurricanes and the many disasters of climate change. This is where aid can save lives. But at the moment only 38% of the budget is currently allocated to fragile states.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The aid budget to fragile states must double over the next decade</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The aid budget to fragile states must double over the next decade. But to make this proposition attractive, we also need to reform the type of aid we give.</p> \n<p>For example, over the past decade there have been more than 2,500 impact evaluations comparing the effect of an anti-poverty intervention with a control group that received nothing. Scientific scrutiny has challenged conventional wisdoms and prejudices. Cash transfers, for example, turn out to be used wisely by recipients, and spur entrepreneurialism rather than trapping people in dependency. A number of rigorous evaluations show that those who receive cash are more likely to start their own business, earn more and send their children to school rather than into work. And giving people cash, rather than food, clothes or livestock, allows recipients to choose what they need, as well as stimulating local markets.</p> \n<p>Yet the growing evidence about aid suffers from the same problem as aid itself: it focuses far too much on relatively stable countries, with fewer than 100 impact evaluations conducted in crisis-affected places.</p> \n<p>That is not to say there is no transferable knowledge. Vaccinations, clean water and good hygiene will help tackle the spread of infectious diseases whatever the context. There are, however, many problems specific to fragile states. A health worker may not show up at a clinic, or a family may fail to make the long journey to reach a clinic because the cost and distance is too great, or the security threat too severe.</p> \n<p>The task is therefore to apply what we know, and invest in solving what we don’t. Government donors should establish a new principle of only funding programmes that are based on sound evidence, or which will generate that evidence. They should allow independent auditors to assess whether their donations are going on evidence-based or evidence-generating work.</p> \n<p>This will require investment in designing and testing new solutions in places affected by conflict. It will also mean changing what is done with aid when the results emerge, however challenging this may be. Cash transfers, for example, disrupt the traditional model of humanitarian aid – where organisations do things on behalf of people – so remain rare. Figures are imprecise, but best estimates suggest that between 2009 and 2013, less than 3.5% of humanitarian aid was handed over as cash. When donors give out grants, they should ask whether the programme will deliver greater impact for every dollar spent than would be achieved by just transferring money directly to people.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/feb/12/aid-billions-fragile-states-icai-dfid\">Aid billions yet to make a difference in fragile states, UK watchdog says</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Of course, better designed programmes must also be implemented effectively. A vast amount of data is collected to monitor programmes – but often the wrong things are measured: whether children have attended classes, for example, rather than whether they can read, write or count better.</p> \n<p>Donors also need to shift the incentives for organisations to use data to adapt and improve their programmes.

No one could argue with that ambition. But with the education and adoption bill now in the Commons, the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, is putting her foot hard down on the accelerator despite question marks over whether the headlong rush to academy status is delivering the improvements she says she wants. It is true that there is some evidence that they deliver some better results, but it is far too soon to be&nbsp;confident that they will work everywhere, and too there is much history showing that one structure rarely fits all.</p> \n<p>In the past year, the <a href=\"http://www.nao.org.uk/report/academies-and-maintained-schools-oversight-and-intervention/\" title=\"\">National Audit Office</a>, the public accounts committee and <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmeduc/258/25803.htm\" title=\"\">the education committee</a> have all flagged up the complex relationship between attainment, autonomy and accountability. The new regional schools commissioners and headteacher boards that are intended to monitor performance only came in last year and are still taking shape. The current system, the NAO warned, can miss failing schools for years.</p> \n<p>The worst of the legislation is not only that it embeds the bias against local authority control and ignores the question of accountability, but that it then removes the right of local parents and teachers to object to plans to convert schools. The education secretary claims that it is necessary to streamline the process to sideline parents who might, rather than put their children’s schooling first, object solely for the ideological motive of keeping schools in local authority control, a claim that sits oddly with her own drive to encourage all schools to become academies. Meanwhile, as the shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, argued in the Commons, all the other burning issues in education, from the future of Sure Start to meeting the needs of 16– to 19-year-olds, are lost in yet another bit of structural change, the main purpose of which seems to be to paint Labour into a corner.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/96841b8c80a05549eb67ea69b1afb95e2927039c/305_238_4263_2558/4263.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2558,"width":4263,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter Byrne/PA","altText":"The prime minister David Cameron talks to students at an academy in Runcorn","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-22T18:57:09Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T23:01:05Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":42,"contributors":[{"name":"Editorial","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/editorial"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Academies","Education policy","Schools","Education","Politics","UK news","Nicky Morgan"],"tags":[{"id":"education/academies","webTitle":"Academies"},{"id":"politics/education","webTitle":"Education policy"},{"id":"education/schools","webTitle":"Schools"},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/nicky-morgan","webTitle":"Nicky Morgan"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Editorial","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/editorial"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/22/guardian-view-education-bill-needs-improvement","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3xg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/22/guardian-view-education-bill-needs-improvement","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/22/guardian-view-education-bill-needs-improvement"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/96841b8c80a05549eb67ea69b1afb95e2927039c/305_238_4263_2558/4263.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2558,"width":4263,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The prime minister, David Cameron, talks to students at Ormiston Bolingbroke academy in Runcorn, Cheshire.

From the man who doesn’t even need to try to frighten and scare people, this was pots and kettles. The Tory party understand his lack of appeal well enough to have kept him away from public consumption throughout the election campaign and for the first six weeks of the new government. When you’re trying to appear One Nation cuddly, IDS is definitely not your man.</p> \n<p> The work and pensions secretary can’t help looking Bond villain sinister and menacing; that’s just the way he was born. Even when he’s smiling, he looks as if he’s planning a minor war crime. Someone, though, could possibly have worked on the tone of his voice, which seldom deviates from either patronising – his version of nice – or contemptuous, while he was locked away from the country. But no; finally unleashed for his first outing at the dispatch box in the new parliament, IDS had months of pent-up disdain and anger to get off his chest and nothing was going to stop the Beast getting the beast off his back. Hopefully, it was therapeutic for him, if no one else. </p> \n<p> “This is a caring country that really cares about carers,” he said with a barely disguised boredom, his eyes never looking up from his brief, as he rushed through a pre-scripted answer. IDS is one of the few people with the gift of making compassion sound like a deadly sin. He also couldn’t quite bring himself to acknowledge that his opposite number, Rachel Reeves, was on maternity leave. At the DWP, having a baby is just another opportunity to scrounge child benefit. “Send her my thanks,” he mumbled, to everyone’s confusion.</p> \n<p> The opposition benches were understandably eager for IDS to flesh out the prime minister’s speech earlier in the day, in which he had declared “the best way to give people opportunities is by taking their benefits away”. In Cameron One Nation world, employers have been begging the government to get rid of tax credits so they can pay their workers more; but even in the Labour party, where dialectics are a more well-trodden philosophical model, this provoked some scepticism – that IDS did little to allay.</p> \n<p> The more bombastic and sneering the works and pensions secretary gets, the more vague he becomes. “We are committed to protecting the most vulnerable,” he declared. “We are changing people’s lives.” He forgot to say whether it was for the better or worse. On where the government’s &pound;12bn benefit cuts were to be made, all IDS could promise was that he would let everyone know when the chancellor had made up his mind. This was even too hazy for one of his own backbenchers, Andrew Percy, who suggested there was a link between benefit sanctions and increased use of food banks. IDS gave Percy a death stare. Didn’t he know that hard-working families are only willing to pay their taxes if other people lower down the food chain are suffering?</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>When Abrahams asked why the government refused to publish the figures for those who had died while waiting for benefits, IDS was fit to explode. “It’s not our job to collect them,” he exploded, in a thankfully un-E L Jamesian explosion. Quite right. When you’re dead, you’re dead. Time to move on. Tory Heidi Allen, a vacant-eyed devotee of positive thinking, had her own solution which was for everyone to try to think a bit more positively about how positively all IDS’s plans were working. Thanks, grasshopper. Don’t call us, we’ll call you.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434996425712/a60ec5de-26c4-45c5-b8fd-dca365eec979-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Rex Shutterstock/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Iain Duncan Smith","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Rex Shutterstock/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-22T18:19:58Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T00:05:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":302,"contributors":[{"name":"John Crace","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/11/3/1415028976132/John-Crace-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/johncrace"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Politics","UK news","Iain Duncan Smith","Conservatives","Labour","Benefits","Society"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/iain-duncan-smith","webTitle":"Iain Duncan Smith"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour"},{"id":"society/benefits","webTitle":"Benefits"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"John Crace","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/johncrace"}}],"series":{"title":"The politics sketch","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/series/the-politics-sketch"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/22/bond-villain-iain-duncan-smith-unleashed-for-first-time-since-election","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3vq","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jun/22/bond-villain-iain-duncan-smith-unleashed-for-first-time-since-election","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/22/bond-villain-iain-duncan-smith-unleashed-for-first-time-since-election"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434996425712/a60ec5de-26c4-45c5-b8fd-dca365eec979-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Iain Duncan Smith: even when he’s smiling, he looks as if he’s planning a minor war crime.

When I saw her name come up on my phone the Monday before, I answered with joy: “We can’t wait to see you, Schmoo Bear” (what we had called her since she was a baby). But it was not Erika on the other end of the phone; instead it was her boyfriend, Sean. This is how our nightmare began.</p> \n<p>We never had a chance to talk to Erika again. Our beautiful, caring, full of life, daughter, only just 24, had collapsed in her apartment, and had two heart attacks in the ambulance on the way to hospital. A doctor called to say we needed to get there as soon as possible. We took a flight at midnight and arrived by her side on Tuesday morning, but she was still in a coma.</p> \n<p>One of the first things the doctors asked was whether Erika had been using hormonal contraceptives. When they found out she was using <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/medicine-guides/pages/MedicineOverview.aspx?condition=Contraception&amp;medicine=Nuvaring&amp;preparationNuvaRing%200.12mg/0.015mg%20per%20day%20vaginal%20delivery%20system\">NuvaRing</a> – a vaginal ring that releases so-called <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2009/aug/14/contraceptive-pills-blood-clot-risk\">third-generation synthetic hormones</a> – they removed it immediately. On the Wednesday before Thanksgiving we were shown scans of her lungs, which were full of massive blood clots. We were told NuvaRing was the cause of the pulmonary embolisms, heart attacks and subsequent irreversible brain swelling. On Thursday – Thanksgiving – they told us Erika wasn’t coming back. She died that day. It absolutely broke our hearts.</p> \n<p>We considered ourselves well-informed people, Erika even more so, and yet we did not know NuvaRing had this risk. We soon learned that most people, including many doctors, are not aware of the potential dangers or even the symptoms to look out for. Erika had been prescribed NuvaRing four years earlier as a treatment for ovarian cysts – an off-label use.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e53bcf3092d976e5604591131db6f033bb8c67e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434987303803/c20229d0-0ba9-4beb-b887-6529ec3bfcbb-460x329.jpeg\" alt=\"Karen Langhart with Erika\" width=\"460\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karen Langhart with Erika.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Langhart</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>From Sean we learned that Erika had felt her leg was sore, but thought it was from helping her friends move the previous weekend. She had had some congestion in her chest and thought she was coming down with a cold. Erika was always too busy to worry about such things. Unfortunately she did not know these are the symptoms of <a href=\"http://www.stoptheclot.org/learn_more/blood_clot_symptoms__dvt.htm?gclid=COXTmZS-kMYCFYqEfgodw20A0g\">blood clots</a> (leg pain) and pulmonary embolisms (congestion).</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/10/birth-control-share-your-experiences-of-hormonal-contraception\">Birth control: share your experiences of hormonal contraception</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As we tried to make sense of Erika’s death, we learned that Food and Drug Administration hearings to discuss rising concerns about NuvaRing – as well as newer hormonal contraceptives, <a href=\"http://msmagazine.com/blog/2012/02/09/just-how-safe-is-yaz-women-need-to-know/\">Yaz and Yasmin birth control pills</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm094909.htm\">Ortho Evra patch</a> – were scheduled two weeks from that fateful Thanksgiving. We told our lawyer that if we were to agree to pursue a legal case on behalf of Erika, first and foremost we would never “settle” her case. We were only interested in seeing the NuvaRing manufacturer, Merck, examined in a jury trial. He explained they were planning to fast-track Erika’s case in order to get to jury trial within the year, so the truth would come out and save lives. Terrified, but determined to help other young women, we agreed.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately the attorneys involved in the class action lawsuit against Merck did end up <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2014/06/05/100m-settlement-over-mercks-nuvaring-now-final/\">settling out of court</a>. These cases included 3,800 women, 83 of whom had died. We never got that jury trial we were promised. My husband and I <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/07/us-merck-nuvaring-idUSBREA1615F20140207\">refused to opt in</a> to the $100m settlement agreement. Merck would not now be held accountable in a trial – to us this felt like watching Erika die all over again. The only thing that has ever mattered to us is the pursuit of truth in honour and memory of our beloved Erika.</p> \n<p>In our opinion, Merck got away with murder, and continues to do so to this day. In 2011 NuvaRing made the company $623m; in 2013 it was $686m; and in 2014, after the settlement, Merck made a staggering $723m from it. Settlements are just the cost of doing business to Merck, all at the expense of women’s health and lives.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3c575dab-5ae4-4d48-850d-d4e7e5f4d048\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434961551961/34b6ca13-eef5-4d9b-9d93-363c0cf2c044-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Merck, makers of NuvaRing\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Merck, makers of NuvaRing</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>During the FDA hearings, we heard the “argument” that NuvaRing, Yaz, Yasmin and the Ortho Evra patch all have “acceptable risk factors” because “it is more dangerous to be pregnant”. Our daughter was not an “acceptable risk factor percentage”, and neither are you or your daughter, wife, mother or friend. Erika was our 100%. It makes no sense when there are safer, effective alternative contraceptives available. Women do have other choices, if only they knew all the facts. To say these drugs have “acceptable risk factors” is an insult to women who have been injured and or who have died as a result of that acceptability.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>In our opinion, Merck got away with murder</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>We talk about what happened to Erika to everyone we meet; we know it’s too important not to be shared. Erika’s classmate at university nearly lost her life after being told by four doctors her symptoms were not related to NuvaRing, though she later learned they were. As a result of <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/politics/2014/01/nuvaring-lethal-contraceptive-trial\">an article written about Erika in Vanity Fair magazine</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/06/us/families-lawsuits-raise-questions-about-nuvaring/\">CNN report</a>, many women who have been injured and the families of women who have lost their lives have been in touch with us. There are too many incidents such as this that we have come across. We have stopped calling them coincidences.</p> \n<p>It fills us with horror to think of all the women out there using NuvaRing and other risky hormonal contraceptives because they think there is no alternative for them but an unplanned pregnancy. If you are using it, please take the time to consider the <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/paragard/basics/definition/prc-20013048\">ParaGard copper IUD</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bustle.com/articles/81248-i-ditched-my-birth-control-pills-for-a-diaphragm-because-it-lets-me-control-my-reproductive\">barrier methods</a>, and the support of <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/08/health/fertility-awareness-methods/\">fertility-awareness methods</a>.</p> \n<p>We believe it is doing a huge disservice to women when media reports written about the risks of hormonal contraceptives end with the minimising message that it is more dangerous to be pregnant.

According to 6,000 or so people questioned across the continent, English people tend to be more shy and conservative on the beach than their Spanish or Italian counterparts.</p> \n<p>Before we go any further, I’d like to slip in a quick disclaimer and admit that I’m French and that, as an immigrant here, part of my contract requires me to advocate for more nudity and fewer Jagerbombs, which is exactly what I’m about to do, so it’s all great.</p> \n<p>Getting back to British nudity (or lack thereof), the news is not really surprising. If you think about it, half-naked 20somethings throwing up on their barely there bikinis, and the idea of a coy nation collectively raising an eyebrow at topless sunbathing are two faces of the same coin.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/apr/08/tinder-dating-sobriety-incompatible-drinking-alcohol-dating\">Tinder and sobriety are incompatible</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Of course large groups of drunken idiots can be found anywhere up and down the UK on any given Saturday night, but it does feel as though said drunken idiots make a special effort to behave even worse when abroad. We’re all slightly more hedonistic versions of ourselves when we go on holiday, but some Brits seem to go that extra mile to put bacchanalian orgies to shame. What’s interesting, though, is that it’s not very clear who exactly “they” are, how many of them exist, and whether there really are enough of them to justify the horrified tabloid front pages.</p> \n<p>The Magaluf revellers feel in part like a media construct, reinforced by a collective need to constantly be outraged by something. If these intoxicated groups didn’t exist, someone would invent them – partly, I think, because of an underlying quiet jealousy.</p> \n<p>If, as the recent study suggests, 40% of Brits are “uncomfortable” when faced with “women in skimpy underwear” on the beach, then surely newsstands should be a bit less quick to feature full-page splashes of practically naked teens downing vodka shots? Or are these acceptable because those women are easily shamed for their appearance and demeanour?</p> \n<p>The cognitive dissonance is quite staggering – we frown upon these partying youngsters so much that we just can’t get enough of them.</p> \n<p>But why oh why do they behave the way they do? While getting hammered is a universally recognised way of spending a decent evening, some can’t help but push it too far. And it’s quite a British problem – heaven knows that we on the continent like to make arses of ourselves after a few bottles of wine too, but rarely to the extent that people here do.</p> \n<p>There are probably several explanations for this, but the most obvious one is that other nationalities don’t need alcohol to feel comfortable in their bodies and – let’s be honest – sexualities. This isn’t to say that Britain is a lone repressed, patriarchal island stuck by the shores of a continent where people enjoy a sweet life of red wine, olive oil and free-flowing genitals, but there is truth to the cliche of Brits being far too repressed for their own good.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>When on holiday, some Brits go that extra mile to put bacchanalian orgies to shame</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>A complaint I’ve heard from many fellow immigrants is that people here need to have downed their own body-weight in beer before making a move on someone, by which point they normally try to ram their tongue down your throat with the grace of a starving anteater. This presumably means that they’d been thinking about it all damn evening, but only had the courage to act upon it once drunk.</p> \n<p>The same reasoning seems applicable to the British attitude to holidays: you’ll spend all year quietly tutting at people having remorseless fun, then spend two weeks in July somewhere mildly sunny, behaving like teenagers who stumbled upon a stash of unlimited condoms and blue WKD.</p> \n<p>You may think that the kids of Magaluf sully the reputation of your wonderful country, but this is a monster you created, and only an – admittedly extreme – symptom of your inability to let go of yourselves. Would you really need to be this aggressive in your demand for drunken debauchery on holiday if you weren’t so hopelessly frustrated by your normal lives?</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434983855516/Tourists-in-Magaluf-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Half-naked twentysomethings throwing up on their barely there bikinis, and the idea of a coy nation collectively raising an eyebrow at topless sunbathing are two faces of the same coin.'
