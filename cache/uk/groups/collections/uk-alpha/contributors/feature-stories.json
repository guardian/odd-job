Beyond opposing harmful conduct that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jun/22/revenge-porn-women-free-speech-abuse\">disproportionately targets women</a>, Google has essentially demonstrated how something akin to the European Union’s <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/technology/right-to-be-forgotten\">right to be forgotten</a> can, and should, work in the US. </p> \n<p>Some Americans have panicked over Europe’s <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/05/google-cant-forget-you-but-it-should-make-you-hard-to-find/\">woefully misnamed</a> right to be forgotten, anxious at the thought of the “<a href=\"http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/privacy-paradox/right-to-be-forgotten\">biggest threat</a> to free speech online” “erasing history” and “breaking the internet”. But such a right doesn’t have to exact an exorbitant price tag, and it can come about in many <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/jul/22/a-manifesto-for-the-future-of-the-right-to-be-forgotten-debate\">different ways</a>. </p> \n<p>In the case of the right to be forgotten, Google has shown that the world won’t be knocked off its axis if the company goes beyond protecting financially relevant information (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/copyright/?hl=en\">copyrighted works</a>,<a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2744324\"> social security</a> numbers, and bank information), and takes aggressive steps to remove links to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/feb/18/the-right-be-forgotten-google-search\">socially relevant</a> information that can harm autonomy, reputation, and emotional well-being.</p> \n<p>As the debate over online privacy in the US advances, there are three important things to keep in mind.</p> \n<p><strong>1) Both government and industry must invest in data protection rights<br /></strong></p> \n<p>The First Amendment <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/right-to-be-forgotten-vs-free-speech/2014/05/14/53c9154c-db9d-11e3-bda1-9b46b2066796_story.html\">restricts</a> the ways the US government can oblige companies to provide citizens with data protection rights. The corporate free speech interests of <a href=\"http://volokh.com/2012/05/09/first-amendment-protection-for-search-engine-search-results/\">Google</a> and others will <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-there-be-a-right-to-be-forgotten-on-the-internet/europe-wants-to-censor-americas-internet\">likely</a> ensure that the US cannot mimic data correction and erasure rights in the EU. What this means is that the public must demand that Google – along with other online intermediaries – exerts leadership and avoids adopting a mentality that’s concerned more with <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/c5d17a80-0910-11e4-8d27-00144feab7de,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2Fc5d17a80-0910-11e4-8d27-00144feab7de.html&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cambridge-code.org%2Fgooglespain.html#axzz37RvLHHSw\">legal compliance</a> than <a href=\"http://concurringopinions.com/archives/2014/09/the-right-to-be-forgotten-not-an-easy-question.html\">social good</a>.<br /></p> \n<p>Even cynics must admit that Google made a voluntary choice to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jun/20/google-excludes-revenge-porn-internet-searches\">take action</a> against revenge porn at a global level. This is the case even if the policy deflects some attention away from the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/14/google-right-to-be-forgotten-academics-letter\">tougher questions</a> <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-05/14/google-right-to-be-forgotten-transparency-letter\">raised by</a> delisting requests from EU citizens, and even if it follows moves by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/14/reddit-anti-harassment-policy-cyberbullying\">Reddit</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/12/twitter-bans-revenge-porn-in-user-policy-sharpening\">Twitter</a>, and other prominent companies in responding to online harassment. Evidence now suggests that if the public keeps applying pressure, industry and government can be partners in ensuring that it is hard for undesirable parties to obtain some of the information we have privacy interests in.<br /></p> \n<p>Seen from this <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Crimes-Cyberspace-Danielle-Keats-Citron/dp/0674368290\">perspective</a>, good can come from the fact that Google is not legally required to make free speech exceptions for links to information some would deem newsworthy. Even countries with broader privacy rights like those in the EU could benefit from an invested industry.</p> \n<p><strong>2) Personal data rights will evolve through information-specific categories </strong></p> \n<p>The entire regulatory framework for protecting privacy in the US is fragmented and largely focused on safeguarding specific kinds of sensitive information, like <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/\">health</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/brief-financial-privacy-requirements-gramm-leach-bliley-act\">financial</a>, and <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html\">education</a> records. The right to be forgotten in the US will not be any different.<br /></p> \n<p>To be sure, a category-based approach to privacy has its drawbacks. It fuels an incremental orientation towards privacy protection, and every victory puts us at risk of being too complacent to go further and take up far-reaching and robust reforms. </p> \n<p>But a category-based approach also has numerous advantages. Different solutions, ranging from expunging a minor’s criminal record to deleting stale <a href=\"http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html\">credit</a> history and delisting non-consensual pornography, can be worked out independently of one another. Clear justifications can be given for why special types of information are so problematic they should be obfuscated or removed from different systems. At the end of the day, categories of information that clearly do not belong in the wrong hands, such as non-consensual pornography, can be handled with comparative ease. Meanwhile, grey areas, like what to do about privacy-invasive public records, can be addressed later on as the discourse surrounding them matures. </p> \n<p>Google’s <a href=\"http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2015/06/revenge-porn-and-search.html\">calculus</a> for delisting seems to target information that is both harmful and without legitimate value to the public. This is a useful criterion, and the cases it covers can be expanded. As new technologies evolve and we become clearer about which categories of information should not be ripe for the picking, company policy or law might obscure additional classifications, such as biometrics and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/your-money/mug-shot-websites-retreating-or-adapting.html?_r=0\">mugshots</a> used to exploit people.</p> \n<p><strong>3) The right to be forgotten in the US will be, in effect, the right to obscurity</strong></p> \n<p>The entire history of “forgetting” in the US is really about making things hard to find. A minor’s criminal records and a person’s outdated credit activity aren’t obliterated; indeed, many people know about them. In effect, then, what Google’s new policy does is give people a limited <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Passcode/Passcode-Voices/2015/0415/Why-you-have-the-right-to-obscurity\">right to obscurity</a>.</p> \n<p>Obscurity protections are not perfect and, as Google <a href=\"http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2015/06/revenge-porn-and-search.html\">acknowledges</a>, revenge porn will remain available on websites. But delisting it from search engines can make information harder to access and interpret. Such a <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/obscurity-a-better-way-to-think-about-your-data-than-privacy/267283/\">burden</a> can effectively deter many people from doing harmful things. According to University of Miami law professor Mary Anne Franks, given Google’s global dominance, delisting revenge porn “<a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/google-to-remove-revenge-porn-images-from-search-results/?_r=1\">will mean fewer victims of revenge porn in the future</a>”.</p> \n<p>The ideals driving the poorly-described right to be forgotten are about striking the right balance between information availability and obscurity. Although Google claims that its stance on revenge porn is but “<a href=\"http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2015/06/revenge-porn-and-search.html\">narrow and limited policy</a>,” the company is actually paving the way towards something far more substantial in the US. </p> \n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.samford.edu/cumberlandlaw/faculty/?id=21474863310\">Woodrow Hartzog</a> is an associate professor at <a href=\"http://www.samford.edu/cumberlandlaw/\">Samford University’s Cumberland School of Law</a>.

As images of atrocities by the jihadi terror group Isis multiply online, and a steady trickle of young Europeans and North Americans head to Syria and Iraq to join them, Muslim communities are under siege. Last week <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33195611\">David Cameron accused British Muslims of “quietly condoning”</a> the ideology that drives Isis sectarian brutality, normalising hatred of “British values”, and blaming the authorities for the “radicalisation” of those who go to fight for it.</p> \n<p>It was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/19/prime-minister-british-muslims-isis\">too much for Sayeeda Warsi</a>, the former Conservative party chair, who condemned the prime minister’s “misguided emphasis” on “Muslim community complicity”. He risked “further alienating” the large majority of Muslims fighting the influence of such groups, she warned. Even <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11692385/Top-security-chief-warns-against-portraying-Muslims-as-intrinsically-extremist.html\">Charles Farr</a>, the hawkish counter-terrorism mandarin at the Home Office, balked. Perhaps fewer than 100 Britons were currently fighting with Isis, he said, and “we risk labelling Muslim communities as somehow intrinsically extremist”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/19/prime-minister-british-muslims-isis\">Remember, prime minister: British Muslims hate Isis too | Sayeeda Warsi</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But Cameron and his neoconservative allies are preparing the ground for the government’s next onslaught. The target will not be terrorism, but “non-violent extremism”. Next month, from nursery schools to optometrists, health services to universities, all will be legally obliged to monitor students and patients for any sign of “extremism” or “radicalisation”.</p> \n<p>The new powers represent a level of embedded security surveillance in public life unprecedented in peacetime. We already know from the government’s Prevent programme the chilling impact of such mass spying on schools, where Muslim pupils have been reported for speaking out in favour of Palestinian rights or against the role of British troops in Afghanistan.</p> \n<p>But the “counter-extremism” bill announced in the Queen’s Speech is about to take the anti-Muslim clampdown a whole stage further. The plans include banning orders for non-violent individuals and organisations whose politics are considered unacceptable; physical restriction orders for non-violent individuals deemed “harmful”; powers to close mosques; and vetting controls on broadcasters accused of airing extremist material. It’s censorship under any other name.</p> \n<p>That was the view of Sajid Javid, then culture secretary, in a leaked letter to the prime minister earlier this year. But Cameron shows every sign of pressing ahead with what amounts to a full-blown assault on basic liberties. Most ludicrously, the new powers are defended in the name of “British values”, including “individual liberty” and “mutual respect and tolerance”.</p> \n<p>But as became clear in the aftermath of the murderous Paris attack on Charlie Hebdo earlier this year, we are not all Charlie when it comes to freedom of speech. Anti-extremism powers will be used overwhelmingly against Muslims, rather than, say, non-Muslim homophobes and racists who have little interest in mutual respect and tolerance.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Add in media hostility, Islamophobia and state surveillance of Muslim communities, and alienation can only spread</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>And they will fail, as their earlier incarnations have done, to discourage the small minority drawn to terrorism at home or jihadi campaigns abroad. Government ministers claim such violence is driven by “ideology” rather than injustice, grievance or its own policies. But, given that they <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/16/muslim-council-of-britain-says-government-hampering-anti-isis-efforts\">refuse to speak to any significant Muslim organisation they don’t agree with or fund</a>, perhaps it’s not surprising to find them in thrall to an ideology, neoconservatism, of their own.</p> \n<p>Any other explanation for the terror threat would in any case implicate the government and its predecessors. In reality, it shouldn’t be so hard to understand why a small section of young alienated Muslims are attracted to fight in Syria and Iraq with Isis and other such groups. Jihadi “ideology” has been around for a long time. But there were no terror attacks in Britain before US and British forces invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, and those behind every violent attack or terror plot have cited western intervention in the Muslim world as their motivation.</p> \n<p>Isis has a different appeal to al-Qaida. It has taken huge stretches of territory using naked terror, destroyed borders and set up a self-proclaimed caliphate. In the Middle East it presents itself as the defender of Sunnis in a convulsive sectarian war. For a few young marginalised western Muslims, such groups can offer the illusion of a fight against tyranny and a powerful sense of identity.</p> \n<p>But add in relentless media hostility, rampant Islamophobia, state surveillance and harassment of Muslim communities, and such alienation can only spread. In the past year, we’ve had the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-31905704\">“Trojan Horse” Birmingham schools plot that never was</a>, the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/apr/29/lutfur-rahman-tower-hamlets-mayor-verdict-undue-spiritual-influence\">ousting of an elected Muslim mayor of Tower Hamlets</a> by a judge – including on grounds that he had exercised “undue spiritual influence” on Muslims – and evidence of an increasing level of anti-Muslim attacks. <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/01/09/britains-cautious-attitude-criticising-islam/\"> Islamophobia now far outstrips hostility to any other religion or ethnic group</a>.</p> \n<p>Ministers and their media allies downplay the role of “foreign policy” in Muslim radicalisation, against all the evidence. By foreign policy, they mean multiple western invasions and occupations of Muslim states, torture and state kidnapping on a global scale, and support for dictatorships across the Arab and Muslim world. That includes Saudi Arabia, of course, which shares much of Isis’s “ideology” and practices; and Egypt, whose ex-military leader, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, overthrew the elected president in 2013 and is soon to be welcomed to Downing Street.</p> \n<p>Isis is itself the direct product of the US and British occupation and destruction of Iraq, and both countries back armed rebel groups fighting in Syria – as they did in Libya. So no wonder would-be jihadis <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/us-isis-syria-iraq\">get confused about who is on whose side</a>. Western Isis volunteers are a disaster for Syria and Iraq, but so far they haven’t carried out return attacks at home.</p> \n<p>That could of course change, not least as the government criminalises dissent, brands conservative religiosity “extremist” and, in the formulation of ministers, “quietly condones” Islamophobia. The British government has long fed terrorism with its warmaking abroad. Now it’s also fuelling it with its scapegoating of Muslims at home.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435174607784/David-Cameron-at-Jamia-Ma-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'David Cameron accused British Muslims of “quietly condoning” the ideology that drives Isis sectarian brutality.'

It is a fancy title for the marketing world’s Mad Men on sea. Rumour has it that half the world’s annual ad revenue is negotiated on its yachts and in its hotels and bars. It thus joins the Cannes film festival, the Frankfurt book fair, cancer research in Chicago and arms fairs everywhere as geographical fixed points in the post-digital world.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the stars of vlogging and blogging are scheduled to gather at the Skip festival – held not on some virtual cloud but in London’s O2 arena. This is found by a search engine no faster than a Jubilee Line train. Is this the shock of the new?</p> \n<p>In the 90s we were told all this stuff was yesterday. The digital revolution would replace the need for human contact by the wonders of electronics. Home-working, telecommuting and Skype would eliminate the need for office blocks, universities and mass transit. Video-conference would supplant expensive trips to distant hotels. Who needed to shake hands on a deal? Use a robot.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/23/kanye-west-glastonbury-2015-offers-abundance-of-alternatives\">Can't stand Kanye West? Glastonbury offers an abundance of alternatives</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The craving of business people, indeed of humans in general, to congregate seems resistant to all technology. The commercial fair, like the arts festival, recalls the stock exchanges of 19th-century Europe. It revives the global markets of the Great Silk Road, the Calais staple and medieval Kiev and Novgorod. The digital age may facilitate the modern meeting, but it cannot supplant it.</p> \n<p>The post-digital phenomenon is embodied in “the cult of live”. I see it first in the small things. Watch the BBC each night and you get a recorded item of news, then a moment when the presenter “goes live” to the same reporter on location, who says the same thing again. It wastes time, but the story is clearly felt to need the authenticity of “real” time and place.</p> \n<p>The power of live is most evident in the music industry. Recording revenues in the past decade have halved for myriad reasons such as piracy. But no one can tell how far this has been matched by soaring revenues from live performance. Madonna and Kanye West must go on tour to reach their markets, as Sir Martin Sorrell must sell his ads from a yacht off Cannes. Stocks and shares may trade digitally, but not even so sophisticated a market as advertising.</p> \n<p>This particularly applies to leisure. There are now some 900 music festivals in Britain, with 7 million fans spending an average &pound;900 each at them. These events are on a medieval scale. The valley of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/23/kanye-west-glastonbury-2015-offers-abundance-of-alternatives\">Glastonbury</a> this week will make <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/apr/22/the-field-of-the-cloth-of-gold-review-britain-in-miniature\">Henry VIII’s field of cloth of gold</a> seem like a vicarage tea party. The BBC Proms should be “unnecessary”, given perfect sound reproduction and broadcasting. But each year they sprawl ever further across west London. When I was young we were told that London theatre was dead. Now you cannot get into a popular West End play without paying touts hundreds of pounds.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>A row of outdated futurology books on my shelf forecast the death of the workplace, the neighbourhood and the city</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Even the British book trade has been revitalised through live. Bookshops fight Amazon with coffee and events. Forty literary festivals in the 80s have become hundreds. Poetry is reverting to Homer’s day. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jun/21/simon-armitage-walking-away-review-prosaic-nation\">Simon Armitage must traipse the countryside reading to his public</a>. From idyllic Charleston, Sussex, to massive Hay, literature has emerged from the salons of London in search of exchange between author and reader.</p> \n<p>I found myself earlier this month at a digital summit just off London’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2014/mar/10/slow-death-of-silicon-roundabout\">Silicon Roundabout in Shoreditch</a>. Gathered together were the thrusters of the digital age, charting the outer fringes of their universe. Why were they unable to do it online? They were tweeting and networking, and that was part of the experience. But like the conferees at everything from Davos to Bilderberg, they wanted to be with each other in time and place. Even the digitised zombies of David Eggers’ The Circle had to live together in one office. However well-connected, cyberspace is lonely.</p> \n<p>A row of outdated futurology books on my shelf forecast the death of the workplace, the neighbourhood and the city. The nation state was to be rebuilt as an e-democracy. Now we are told that economic growth needs ever bigger cities, ever more networking hubs and ever more planes, trains and cars. The internet has not re-invented social geography. The conference is the pilgrimage destination of our age, even if much of its appeal, as David Lodge wrote, is “sex on expenses”.</p> \n<p>I was not alone in once dismissing the digital revolution as a passing craze. (I embarrassingly wrote that the internet would be useful only to lawyers and pornographers.) But Marx was right, that all revolutions attract their antithesis. I find it exhilarating that the post-digital antithesis should be live experience. Live is an instinctive reaction to an excess of screen-gazing, app addiction and the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/opinion/sunday/the-flight-from-conversation.html?_r=0\">“flight from conversation”</a>.</p> \n<p>Figures show patterns of household spending shifting from products to services. Last year the Boston Consulting Group reported that “consumers are moving from owning a luxury product to having a luxury experience”. They seek the shared emotions, surprises, fulfilments that come from participating, not just observing. This is typified by the success of the dating app, Tinder, that results in real meetings. Post-digital lies at the core of the new economics of happiness.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I was not alone in once dismissing the digital revolution as a passing craze</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The valued jobs of the future will deliver these individual and collective experiences. In business it means more emphasis on contact with consumers – witness the plethora of “chief customer officers”. In leisure it means those new graduate destinations of food, fashion, exercise, travel, life-style, counselling and therapy. We crave to relate more closely with those we are supposed to love – and cannot do so online.</p> \n<p>The goal of human endeavour has never been to make a better phone, pad or watch, but a happier person. The digital age is emerging as no more than a portal to such a goal, which emerges from the architecture of personal relationships. That applies in business as in pleasure. That is why the urge to congregate is now stronger than ever.</p> \n<p>One day we will all treat the computer in our pocket as casually as we treat the watch on our wrist. We will move on. But in a BBC attic will lurk some digital Jeremy Clarkson, cavorting with his greying nerds and testing old laptops on “Top Cloud”.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435173624461/Post-digital-world-illust-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration by Ellie Foreman-Peck","credit":"Guardian","altText":"Post-digital world illustration by Ellie Foreman-Peck","cleanCaption":"Illustration by Ellie Foreman-Peck"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-25T08:04:07Z","lastModified":"2015-06-25T08:04:08Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":17,"contributors":[{"name":"Simon Jenkins","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733749150/SimonJenkins.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/simonjenkins"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Festivals","Music","Culture","Communities","Life and style","Technology","Mobile phones","Telecoms","Health & wellbeing","World news","Society","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"society/communities","webTitle":"Communities"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"},{"id":"technology/mobilephones","webTitle":"Mobile phones"},{"id":"technology/telecoms","webTitle":"Telecoms"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Simon Jenkins","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/simonjenkins"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/25/festival-flights-fulfilment-post-digital-world-lonely-cyberspace","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a5vk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/25/festival-flights-fulfilment-post-digital-world-lonely-cyberspace","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/25/festival-flights-fulfilment-post-digital-world-lonely-cyberspace"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435173624461/Post-digital-world-illust-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration by Ellie Foreman-Peck","credit":"Guardian","altText":"Post-digital world illustration by Ellie Foreman-Peck","cleanCaption":"Illustration by Ellie Foreman-Peck"}},"importance":5,"byline":{"title":"Simon Jenkins"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435173624461/Post-digital-world-illust-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration by Ellie Foreman-Peck","credit":"Guardian","altText":"Post-digital world illustration by Ellie Foreman-Peck","cleanCaption":"Illustration by Ellie Foreman-Peck"}}]},{"title":"Black and minority ethnic people are shortchanged by mental health services","rawTitle":"Black and minority ethnic people are shortchanged by mental health services","item":{"type":"comment","id":"healthcare-network/2015/jun/25/black-minority-ethnic-people-shortchanged-mental-health-services","title":"Black and minority ethnic people are shortchanged by mental health services","trailText":"For many, long term care is denied in favour of sectioning and medication, and there is no support after they are released","standFirst":"<p>For many, long term care is denied in favour of sectioning and medication, and there is no support after they are released</p>","byline":"Samir Jeraj","body":"<p>Ramone is in his mid-20s and with his family emigrated to the UK around 10 years ago from eastern Europe. He developed a severe mental illness that requires long-term care, but is not eligible for treatment. This means that when he becomes extremely ill, he is sectioned (usually by the police) and admitted to a mental health unit where he is medicated to a point where he can be released, with no care afterwards. This pattern has repeated itself for six years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/healthcare-network/2014/feb/05/12-years-slave-black-mental-health\">What 12 Years a Slave tells us about 21st century black mental health</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>People from some black and minority ethnic (BME) backgrounds are more likely to use crisis mental health care. Racism, poor mental health services and stigma are often cited as the reasons for this inequality. However, once in crisis care, many people like Ramone find the care they are offered does not work for them. His was one of dozens of stories we collected at the Race Foundation to show the experiences of BME people, and was used as evidence by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in their <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/12/ae-staff-attitudes-to-patients-in-mental-health-crisis-often-shocking\">review of mental health crisis care</a>.</p> \n<p>What we found mirrored much of the CQC’s findings. People had generally had bad experiences in a crisis system that left them feeling disempowered. They often didn’t believe staff would be caring and compassionateWhen asked whether they had complained, they normally responded that they felt nothing would change as a result. </p> \n<p>Services such as the police, A&amp;E, social services and the benefit system did not work together to help people affected by mental illness. In fact, these were holding them back, as they were caught in a cycle without the support they needed to work towards recovery. </p> \n<p>Where individual staff and services did work together, the results transformed lives. However, in many of the situations we encountered, this had not happened and people had only received crisis care to make them safe in the short term. Left in a state of crisis, there was a failure to address the underlying causes of their distress.</p> \n<p>As in other parts of the mental health system, we found that BME people were not being offered psychological “talking” therapies. Instead, medication continued to be the most common treatment, with some people spending years on heavy medication with severe side-effects. Non-compliance usually resulted in individuals being sectioned, yet many were never given the option of a slow, supervised reduction of their medication.</p> \n<p>However, we did find some things could really help. Stable housing that supports people to work on their recovery is significant. James, who had been homeless, told us that he would have died on the streets if he hadn’t found his way on to a housing scheme for BME people with severe mental illnesses. Access to benefits, volunteering and work also helped people to recover and prevent future crises. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/healthcare-network/2014/aug/05/black-men-inequalities-cancer-care\">Black men face inequalities in cancer care</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Many of those we spoke to had experienced, or continued to experience, racism and other forms of discrimination. Having an environment in which they felt able to be themselves was really important for their recovery. </p> \n<p>One clear message, also echoed in the CQC report, was that people were happier and more satisfied with services provided by voluntary organisations. However, in some areas, local mental health services had disappeared because of cuts. Someone told me they felt their area has been left “high and dry” following the loss of a local service and its skilled staff. This adds to the already strong sense expressed to us by people from BME communities that their mental health is not a priority.</p> \n<p>If we want to close the inequalities in mental health for BME communities, we need to make health services work for them. That means listening, particularly to those who are currently in the system and their carers. It also means supporting the voluntary and community organisations that are meeting the needs of communities and individuals. Without this, it will be impossible for BME people to have confidence in crisis care. </p>","section":"Healthcare Professionals Network","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/355d18c140221c2fd694cb138570c4eeee0c6787/1133_620_3731_2238/3731.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2238,"width":3731,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tara Moore/Getty Images","altText":"Services such as the police, A&amp;E, social services and the benefit system do not work together to help people affected by mental illness.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tara Moore/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-25T06:45:11Z","lastModified":"2015-06-25T08:37:30Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":57,"contributors":[{"name":"Samir Jeraj","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jeraj-samir"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Healthcare Network","Mental health","Care Quality Commission (CQC)","Mental health","Health","Society","Communities"],"tags":[{"id":"healthcare-network/healthcare-network","webTitle":"Healthcare Network"},{"id":"healthcare-network/mental-health","webTitle":"Mental health"},{"id":"society/care-quality-commission","webTitle":"Care Quality Commission (CQC)"},{"id":"society/mental-health","webTitle":"Mental health"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"society/communities","webTitle":"Communities"}],"section":{"id":"healthcare-network"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Samir Jeraj","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jeraj-samir"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"healthcare-network"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/healthcare-network/2015/jun/25/black-minority-ethnic-people-shortchanged-mental-health-services","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a4c5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/healthcare-network/2015/jun/25/black-minority-ethnic-people-shortchanged-mental-health-services","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/jun/25/black-minority-ethnic-people-shortchanged-mental-health-services"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/355d18c140221c2fd694cb138570c4eeee0c6787/1133_620_3731_2238/3731.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2238,"width":3731,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Services such as the police, A&amp;E, social services and the benefit system do not work together to help people affected by mental illness.

There was no mass break-in to Britain.</p> \n <p>More important, the scenes at Calais are <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/24/illegal-migrants-enter-uk-via-heathrow-visa-not-lorry\">very untypical of illegal migration</a> into the UK. Most illegal migrants do not hide under trucks, throw themselves at passing Eurostar trains, submit to being locked in airless containers or conceal themselves in the baggage holds of airliners. </p> \n <p>Instead they enter Britain legally and openly on flights into Heathrow airport on visas that they then breach by overstaying”.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Now, in the light of that assessment, let’s look at editorials elsewhere. The Times believes <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/leaders/article4479118.ece\">the migration crisis is in danger of creating serious social tensions across Europe.</a> So “the aim of a cogent response must be to reverse the tide”.</p> \n<p>It contends that an EU plan based on setting up permanent camps in Greece and Italy to process migrants “is misconceived and fundamentally flawed”.</p> \n<p>It agrees that most of the migrants entering Europe “are propelled by war and terror in Syria, Afghanistan and Eritrea” or “are pulled from sub-Saharan Africa by the prospect of wages in Europe’s grey economies that would be unimaginable in their own countries”. </p> \n<p>But “rewarding” those migrants who wish to stay in Europe “is undesirable”. Instead, migrants must be turned round. It continues:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“What Europe needs are robust border controls and a coherent strategy for reversing the flow of illegal immigration at its many sources. This will require much closer engagement with some of the world’s poorest governments, but also facilities to shelter the vulnerable and distinguish between legitimate asylum seekers and economic migrants. </p> \n <p>These facilities must be located in the region where the crisis is unfolding, but, crucially, they must be in Africa, not Europe...</p> \n <p>Human rights activists do not have a monopoly on compassion for desperate people seeking a better life. Instead, Europe’s leaders must try to make sure through the use of targeted aid that these people have better lives at home. </p> \n <p>The tide will only turn when migrants report back to their families that the journey is not worth it”. </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The Telegraph, in a leader headlined “Europe’s porous borders are beyond our control”, thinks “it is the responsibility of the EU country in which a migrant claiming asylum arrives to process their application”. </p> \n<p>It is unimpressed by the call by the mayor of Calais to insist that the UK should adopt the Schengen (open borders) agreement. “This is just a game of diplomatic pass-the-parcel,” says the paper. </p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“If all the migrants gathered in Calais were allowed across the Channel, then Britain would have to bear the considerable cost of processing asylum applications, though since many are principally looking for work they would simply disappear into the black economy”. </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The Telegraph therefore wants to see Britain institute a four-point plan: the elimination of free health care for immigrants; the documentation of people arriving in Italy and Greece; action “to stop the flood of migrants through Africa to the Mediterranean”; and a revision by the EU of its “no-borders” policy.</p> \n<p>The Mail simply blames the French for the problem, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3138351/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-Putting-price-public-s-right-know.html\">accusing the country of hypocrisy</a> for, allegedly, doing all it can “to lure migrants to the Channel coast, tempting them to cross to the UK”.</p> \n<p>“Before they blame us for encouraging the boat people to journey hundreds of miles across France”, says the Mail, “they should look at a map”.</p> \n<p>And the Express takes a similar line: “The response of French policy-makers”, it says, has “left a lot to be desired. Yet again rather than facing up to their responsibilities they tried to pin the blame on us. </p> \n<p>Britain must not be saddled with the thousands of migrants who, “due to the ineffectiveness of the French police, have been allowed to settle in Calais. This is madness... Pointing the finger at Britain will do nothing to resolve a crisis that has rapidly got out of hand”.</p> \n<p>The Sun <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/sun_says/6500866/The-Sun-Says.html\">appears uncertain about what should be done</a> and throws up its hands in despair: </p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“The government says human rights laws prevent it from sending illegals back to broke Greece. Now Hungary has pulled out of the deal altogether. At every turn Britain’s options are narrowing”.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>So let me return to the Guardian leader, which calls on EU leaders to “rise to the occasion” which they have failed to do previously “largely from fear of domestic political consequences”. It concludes: </p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“It is time for Europe both to admit the scale of the migration tragedy and to accept greater responsibility towards some of its victims... <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=51208#.VYrZpHqHr7I\">According to the United Nations</a>, the world faces its largest number of displaced persons in modern times, with nearly 4 million refugees from the crisis in Syria alone...</p> \n <p>According to the UN, the EU could easily take 1 million of these refugees. This is true in theory if not in political practice. Yet this week, the EU’s leaders will agree to accept a mere 60,000. Britain prioritises hunting and destroying the smugglers’ boats in Libya to searching for and rescuing the smugglers’ abandoned victims. </p> \n <p>Yet there is a place for both a coercive and a humanitarian approach. There must also be a recognition that this is a shared challenge for <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/europe-news\">Europe</a>, and that a shared solution is the only realistic approach”.</p> \n</blockquote>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435216535903/b362e779-1087-465c-a00b-f8dda31c66b6-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Philip Toscano/PA","altText":"Calais","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-25T08:23:58Z","lastModified":"2015-06-25T09:00:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":20,"contributors":[{"name":"Roy Greenslade","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733747830/RoyGreenslade.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/roygreenslade"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Media","Migration","National newspapers","Newspapers","The Times","Daily Telegraph","The Independent","The Guardian","Daily Mail","Daily Express","The Sun","Daily Star","Daily Mirror","i","Metro","Europe","World news","European Union","United Nations"],"tags":[{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"world/migration","webTitle":"Migration"},{"id":"media/national-newspapers","webTitle":"National newspapers"},{"id":"media/newspapers","webTitle":"Newspapers"},{"id":"media/thetimes","webTitle":"The Times"},{"id":"media/dailytelegraph","webTitle":"Daily Telegraph"},{"id":"media/theindependent","webTitle":"The Independent"},{"id":"media/theguardian","webTitle":"The Guardian"},{"id":"media/dailymail","webTitle":"Daily Mail"},{"id":"media/dailyexpress","webTitle":"Daily Express"},{"id":"media/sun","webTitle":"The Sun"},{"id":"media/dailystar","webTitle":"Daily Star"},{"id":"media/daily-mirror","webTitle":"Daily Mirror"},{"id":"media/i","webTitle":"i"},{"id":"media/metro","webTitle":"Metro"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"world/unitednations","webTitle":"United Nations"}],"section":{"id":"media"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Roy Greenslade","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/roygreenslade"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"media"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/greenslade/2015/jun/25/calais-migrants-crisis-what-the-national-press-reports-and-thinks","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a56j","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/media/greenslade/2015/jun/25/calais-migrants-crisis-what-the-national-press-reports-and-thinks","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/jun/25/calais-migrants-crisis-what-the-national-press-reports-and-thinks"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435216535903/b362e779-1087-465c-a00b-f8dda31c66b6-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Migrants are trying to board UK-bound lorries on the road into the Calais ferry port.

Poverty is flat on most of the measures, and even falling on one. So the government will be satisfied that the big rise which some of the charities were predicting has not come about this year. As I wrote yesterday, below, the numbers get buffetted about by too many things to be confident about what will change between one year and the next. There are hundreds of pages of data to digest, but my best guess as to what is going on is that in this year, rising employment is making up for falling benefit income, a good story for the government. </em></p> \n<p><em>However, I would caution – as I also wrote yesterday – that there will be less good news further down the track. The new numbers are already out of date: they cover 2013/14, when average earnings were still falling back in real terms, and unemployment was falling faster than now. As a result, the relative poverty line did not rise as it would do in more prosperous times, and stagnant incomes at the bottom were sufficient to avoid any rise in poverty. <br /></em></p> \n<p><em>There are already signs of what could happen next, though. Firstly, overall income inequality has risen a little bit this year. Secondly, there is a sharp divergence in the fortunes of disabled people and others. For disabled people – one of the groups that depends most heavily on benefits – poverty (measured after housing costs) is up by a statitically significant 300,000. That is a harbinger of what will happen to other benefit-dependent groups as the cuts continue to come: groups that most importantly include families with children.</em></p> \n<p><em>Here is the original piece from Wednesday …</em><br /></p> \n<p>There is more to poverty than lack of money, of course. As the Conservatives manoeuvre to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/23/child-poverty-measures-figures-first-rise-in-decade\">redefine what it means to be poor</a>, they are surely right about that. The frugal life of, say, an ascetic monk may not be impoverished at all, if it is short in cash, but rich in purpose, community and understanding. By contrast, a life that enjoys material advantages unimaginable to generations gone by – smartphones, convenience food, cheap flights perhaps – might still be poor if it is lived without hope, company or direction.</p> \n<p>The main official measure of poverty – which defines being poor as living in a household with a disposable income of less than 60% of the contemporary median – is narrowly financial. It also has some implications which seem to fly in the face of common sense, as a Downing Street spokeswoman pointed out on Tuesday, when she said that a recession may actually appear to rescue poor people from penury, simply by dragging down the benchmark of typical pay.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Ministers have every reason for wanting to move the goal posts, and opponents have every reason to suspect them of that</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But for all these undoubted problems, I’d defend the existing poverty target, which I had a hand in designing in Whitehall about a decade ago. It is a clear measure of a meaningful thing – the prosperity gap between the poor and the rest – which a government can actually hope to effect. If relative poverty falls during a slump, then that is an oddity, but it is not meaningless. Because if the lowliest living standards fall by less than those of others in hard times, then those with the broadest shoulders are indeed bearing the heaviest burden. And that is surely important.</p> \n<p>The Conservative plan to move to a new measure of the “root causes” of hardship, such as worklessness, debt and addiction, sounds reasonable, but the purpose is to cloud accountability – to create so many indicators that there is bound to be some nugget or other of good news to point to, even in a land where the poor are getting very much poorer. The objective is to whip up confusion in place of clarity, and provide cover for a shrinking state to retreat to in the war on poverty, to shift from energetic activism towards malign neglect. These are harsh words, but the cynicism is justified by both the backdrop to the poverty rethink, and by the Conservatives’ changing political game.</p> \n<p>The immediate backdrop is provided by Thursday’s official poverty figures. Now, I’ve not seen the numbers at the time of writing, and nor – to be fair – am I assuming that the prime minister will have enjoyed a sneak peak before he trashed the existing statistics as creating an “absurd situation”. The number of poor people on this relative definition does indeed depend on a median income, which can be buffeted about by all kinds of things – wage settlements, changing patterns of employment and statistical noise – so it is unwise to make assumptions about the new data, covering 2013/14. But the best guess of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/apr/29/poverty-child-rising-welfare-cuts-tory-claims\">New Policy Institute</a>, which worked various factors into its forecasts, is that the coalition’s benefit cuts are finally going to start translating into rising poverty rates. That would signal a turn in the tide on a decade of pre-recession progress on child poverty in particular. And even if NPI’s pessimism doesn’t turn out to be borne out in this year’s data, as the cuts, caps and freezes on the benefit incomes of the poor compound one another, it will certainly be borne out before long.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/23/child-poverty-measures-figures-first-rise-in-decade\">Tory plan to redefine child poverty as figures set to show first rise in decade</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ministers, then, have every reason for wanting to move the goal posts, and their opponents have every reason to suspect them of that. That was true before Cameron’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-on-opportunity\">speech on Monday</a> about ending “the merry-go-round” of low earners paying taxes and then claiming tax credits, but it is doubly true in its wake. The Tories have reaffirmed their pre-election promise to hack, hack and hack again at benefits, until &pound;12bn can be saved. Neither the post-dated and modest rise that is mooted for the minimum wage nor prospective increase in the tax allowance will be anything like enough to compensate the millions of families set to lose many hundreds of pounds annually if their credits face the expected chop.</p> \n<p>The rethink on poverty is also part of a piece with a broader rethink of Conservative strategy. As a young opposition leader before 2010, Cameron wanted sunshine to win the day. He made a point of disavowing the Thatcherite Tory John Moore’s <a href=\"http://conservative-speeches.sayit.mysociety.org/speech/599937\">dismissal of relative poverty</a>, pledged to measure it and tackle it, and even prodded his policy brain chief Oliver Letwin to sign up expressly to Labour’s precise poverty targets <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2006/apr/11/comment.politics2\">in the pages of the Guardian</a>. It was all part of the great effort to sweeten the party’s “aroma”, as the Cameroons called their brand in those days, when their chief concern was winning the Tories a second look from the sort of people who might wear a Greenpeace T-shirt at the weekend. Those days are gone. Now the strategy, vindicated at the recent election, is “blue-collar Conservatism”, appealing to working-class Tories who are not much interested in such abstractions as relative poverty, but can certainly be rallied against those who are felt to be living at the expense of hard-pressed taxpayers.</p> \n<p>It is not just about branding, however, it is about hard currency too: in his first budget George Osborne actually <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/budget/7846849/Budget-2010-Full-text-of-George-Osbornes-statement.html\">increased the child tax credit</a> by &pound;150 a year, to protect the poor from wider retrenchments. Today, a government that has lurched to the right is about to embark on the exact reverse course, cutting tax credits so that more of the pain of austerity than ever before will be shouldered by the poor. No wonder they have decided it is a good moment for a rethink of how poverty is measured.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435161735980/Cameron-and-Osborne-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Osborne and Cameron.
