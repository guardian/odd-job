The brutal austerity imposed on Greece is mild compared with earlier versions. Take the 19th century Irish and Indian famines, both exacerbated (in the second case caused) by the doctrine of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/spectre-laissez-faire-haunts-britain\" title=\"\">laissez-faire</a>, which we now know as market fundamentalism or neoliberalism.</p> \n<p>In Ireland’s case, one eighth of the population was killed – one could almost say murdered– in the late 1840s, partly by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/victorians/famine_01.shtml\" title=\"\">the British refusal to distribute food</a>, to prohibit the export of grain or provide effective poor relief. Such policies offended the holy doctrine of laissez-faire economics that nothing should stay the market’s invisible hand.</p> \n<p>When drought struck India in 1877 and 1878, the British imperial government insisted on exporting record amounts of grain, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2005/jan/27/britishidentity.politicalcolumnists\" title=\"\">precipitating a famine that killed millions</a>. The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2005/dec/27/eu.turkey\" title=\"\">Anti-Charitable Contributions Act of 1877</a> prohibited “at the pain of imprisonment private relief donations that potentially interfered with the market fixing of grain prices”. The only relief permitted was forced work in labour camps, in which less food was provided than to the inmates of Buchenwald. Monthly mortality in these camps in 1877 was equivalent to an annual rate of 94%.</p> \n<p>As <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2008/nov/09/economics-creditcrunch\" title=\"\">Karl Polanyi argued in The Great Transformation</a>, the gold standard – the self-regulating system at the heart of laissez-faire economics – prevented governments in the 19th and early 20th centuries from raising public spending or stimulating employment. It obliged them to keep the majority poor while the rich enjoyed a gilded age. Few means of containing public discontent were available, other than sucking wealth from the colonies and promoting aggressive nationalism. This was one of the factors that contributed to the first world war. The resumption of the gold standard by many nations after the war exacerbated the Great Depression, preventing central banks from increasing the money supply and funding deficits. You might have hoped that European governments would remember the results.</p> \n<p>Today equivalents to the gold standard – inflexible commitments to austerity – abound. In December 2011 the <a href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/\" title=\"\">European Council</a> agreed a <a href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ec/126658.pdf\" title=\"\">new fiscal compact</a>, imposing on all members of the eurozone a rule that “government budgets shall be balanced or in surplus”. This rule, which had to be transcribed into national law, would “contain an automatic correction mechanism that shall be triggered in the event of deviation.” This helps to explain the seigneurial horror with which the troika’s unelected technocrats have greeted the resurgence of democracy in Greece. Hadn’t they ensured that choice was illegal? Such diktats mean the only possible democratic outcome in Europe is now the collapse of the euro: like it or not, all else is slow-burning tyranny.</p> \n<p>It is hard for those of us on the left to admit, but Margaret Thatcher saved the UK from this despotism. European monetary union, she predicted, would <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/peteroborne/100064330/margaret-thatcher-knew-the-single-currency-would-devastate-europe/\" title=\"\">ensure that the poorer countries must not be bailed out</a>, “which would devastate their inefficient economies.”</p> \n<p>But only, it seems, for her party to supplant it with a homegrown tyranny. George Osborne’s proposed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/12/academics-attack-george-osborne-budget-surplus-proposal\" title=\"\">legal commitment to a budgetary surplus</a> exceeds that of the eurozone rule. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/reality-check/2015/apr/13/what-difference-does-labours-budget-responsibility-lock-make\" title=\"\">Labour’s promised budget responsibility lock</a>, though milder, had a similar intent. In all cases governments deny themselves the possibility of change. In other words, they pledge to thwart democracy. So it has been for the past two centuries, with the exception of the 30-year <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2012/mar/26/journey-from-keynesiani-economics-to-austerity\" title=\"\">Keynesian respite</a>.</p> \n<p>The crushing of political choice is not a side-effect of this utopian belief system but a necessary component. Neoliberalism is inherently incompatible with democracy, as people will always rebel against the austerity and fiscal tyranny it prescribes. Something has to give, and it must be the people. This is the true road to serfdom: disinventing democracy on behalf of the elite.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/georgemonbiot\" title=\"\">@georgemonbiot</a>.

Relatively few people have experienced pristine, undisturbed rainforest at first hand, but many of those who have are awed by the soaring cathedral of life they find themselves in. The subdued light, the constant temperature and humidity, and often the quiet, add to the awe. The capacity for rainforests to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2014/oct/31/amazon-rainforest-deforestation-weather-droughts-report\" title=\"\">moderate the climate </a> embody the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2008/apr/28/scienceofclimatechange.biodiversity\" title=\"\">Gaia hypothesis</a> – the concept that the Earth self-regulates to create the conditions to support life.</p> \n<p>A constant supply of sunlight and water in rainforests has encouraged the proliferation of species. There is a parallel to be drawn between rainforests and great cities. Both require a constant supply of life’s essentials (imagine a city left a week without electricity), and both encourage specialists.</p> \n<p>The extraordinary <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/mar/13/french-guiana-biodiversity-expedition-science\" title=\"\">diversity of rainforests</a> is without doubt their greatest value to humanity, for it has turned the rainforests into a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2014/oct/08/cancer-tumours-destroyed-by-berry-queensland-rainforest\" title=\"\">great natural pharmacopeia</a>. The warmth and humidity below the canopy allow pathogens to abound. If any one species becomes too abundant, disease transfers easily, and it will be ravaged by an epidemic. But the ubiquity of pathogens has also led to a proliferation of physical and chemical defences in every organism that inhabits the forest. As humanity gathers together in ever greater urban aggregations, the need for defences against pathogens grows. Around a quarter of all medicines originate from tropical forest plants, and it’s a fair bet that cures for many of humanity’s present and future ills lie undiscovered below the verdant canopy.</p> \n<p>Rainforests fulfil other needs. They are the source of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/rainforest-alliance-partner-zone/2014/sep/15/seven-everyday-foods-linked-to-the-rainforest\" title=\"\">much food and other products</a>. From Brazil nuts to bananas, and from rubber to resins, they enhance our lives. They are also vital sources of clean, reliable water, acting as great cleansing filters and sponges which provide a steady source for pristine streams that can flow right through the dry season. The Amazon rainforests store around half of Earth’s available fresh water, and right across the tropics many cities and farms depend on rainforests for their water supplies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"915fc789581baab2d3b68d3403b78c840e7c482c\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/915fc789581baab2d3b68d3403b78c840e7c482c/0_220_5250_3150/1000.jpg\" alt=\"River in Lowland Rainforest of Danum Valley Sabah State, Borneo, Malaysia --- River in the Lowland rainforest of the Danum Valley on Borneo, Sabah State, Malaysia. --- Image by Frans Lanting/Corbis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rainforests also play a larger role in the water cycle, in that they create their own rainfall. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frans Lanting/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But rainforests also play a larger role in the water cycle, in that they create their own rainfall. The rainforest canopy transpires enormous quantities of water. This occurs when the individual leaves open tiny pores, known as stomata, to gain access to the CO2 in the air. While the stomata are open, the plant loses moisture through its leaves, which accumulates over the forest as water vapour, eventually to fall as rain. It’s been estimated that the Amazon creates as much as 80% of its own rainfall.</p> \n<p>Rainforests are also crucial in the Earth’s carbon cycle. Through photosynthesis, the CO2 the plants absorb from the air is turned into leaves, bark, timber and fruit – indeed all the tissues of living plants. You can think of trees largely as congealed CO2. Up to half of all the carbon stored in land-based ecosystems resides in rainforests, in the form of living organisms as well as soil carbon. One thing rainforests are not, however, is the “lungs of the planet”. Although significant producers of free oxygen (via photosynthesis), they play a far smaller role in producing free oxygen than do single-celled algae in the ocean.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10432dbe9f469505b9aab7b48ce7651b0d9de362\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/10432dbe9f469505b9aab7b48ce7651b0d9de362/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A chainsaw operator stands on the cut roots of a Shiwawaco tree during a forest management project in Inapari, Peru\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not everyone accepts that rainforests are important to humanity and the planet.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Beyond the functional reasons that rainforests are important must be counted the place they hold in our imaginations. Rainforests are so extraordinarily ancient that they allow us, imaginatively at least, to travel in time. Fifty-five million-year-old fossils from the lignite mines of Germany come from plants and animals whose barely altered descendants can be found today in the rainforests of Malaysia. The <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/world/gondwana\" title=\"\">rainforests of central eastern Australia</a> are even more ancient, telling of a time when the landmasses of the southern hemisphere formed the supercontinent of Gondwana. The harpy eagles of south America and New Guinea are among the world’s most awesome birds of prey. Genetic studies show that they are each other’s closest relatives. Yet neither the south American nor the New Guinean harpy eagle ever stray outside the rainforest, and they have failed to colonise even large, rainforest islands lying near the lands they occupy. They came to occupy their widely separated homes because their ancestors inhabited rainforests that flourished in Antarctica 60 million or more years ago.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a7b27df24853d0fd2b8a88389459a06b1e52ca23\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a7b27df24853d0fd2b8a88389459a06b1e52ca23/0_0_2895_4344/666.jpg\" alt=\"Captive harpy Eagle photographed in a Huaorani village in the Ecuadorian Amazon.

One Australian I asked thought about rainforests much like Groucho Marx did about future generations – why should I care about them: what have they ever done for me? He thought that rainforests could be put to better use, as timber and croplands.</p> \n<p>There is no doubt that rainforest timbers bring high prices on markets, nor that there is money to be made in felling them and growing crops. In both instances the great common benefits that rainforests provide are exchanged for private gain for the few.</p> \n<p>But even that gain is largely illusory. The soils of the rainforest are notoriously infertile, as was inadvertently illustrated in one of the most memorable scenes in the 1972 cult classic Aguirre: The Wrath of God. A beleaguered conquistador, starving, fever-racked, and hallucinating, gazes at a butterfly perched serenely on his finger.</p> \n<p>In a surreal film steeped in violence and the alien world of the Amazon, the friendly butterfly seems as absurd as the galleon another conquistador sees floating in the treetops. But anyone who has lived in the rainforest knows that visits by the most glorious butterflies is an everyday occurrence. They come to drink our sweat, for the sake of the minerals it contains. Almost all the nutrients in a rainforest are incorporated in the plants and animals that comprise it, so animal sweat is one of the few mineral sources available. Cut, burn and carry them away, and the wealth we gain is as transient as a butterfly’s visit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1a50d6dc445f513152e645492b6cfe0167f181e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436282428551/243d148d-3e07-4bd8-8c00-0ae77840c06b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The subdued light, the constant temperature and humidity, and often the quiet, add to the awe\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The subdued light, the constant temperature and humidity, and often the quiet, add to the awe’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter van der Sleen/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436282267202/Tree-frog-Sarapiqui-Costa-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Rainforests are so extraordinarily ancient that they allow us, imaginatively at least, to travel in time.'

href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/06/osborne-slashes-bbc-budget-pay-over-75s-tv-licences\" title=\"\">fund free TV licences for the over-75s from its licence fee revenue,</a> as the government has announced it will do, is profoundly unconstitutional. Free licences are currently a welfare benefit, introduced by Gordon Brown in 2001. If the bill has grown too high in these austere times, the government should take the decision to end it or phase it out. It looks like ministers are too frit to do so.</p> \n<p>Instead, shockingly, the BBC will be responsible for deciding in 2020 whether to continue with the free-licence perk. It should not: the licence fee is paid by almost everyone, and should only ever be used to pay for universal public broadcasting. Young people or parents would be right to ask themselves why a fifth of the money they pay for the BBC and its programmes should be going to pensioners.</p> \n<p>This raid on the BBC’s budget is also a further and massive attack on the broadcaster’s independence. Over time this convention has been steadily and dangerously eroded. The last licence fee settlement, in 2010, was another example. It too was conducted as a hijack by the government with no public discussion. Then too the government demanded that the BBC take on the over-75s’ licence fee perk. I was one of several BBC trustees prepared to resign over this at the time, and that part of the plan was withdrawn. But we reluctantly accepted other elements of top-slicing then – taking the World Service on to the licence fee, subsidising broadband and local TV – as these were related to universal access to broadcast services, and the deal would bring five years of financial certainty.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>A similar hijack was attempted in 2010. I was one of several BBC trustees prepared to resign over the deal</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The BBC hasn’t just been subject to successive top-slicing raids. In addition, BBC executives and trustees were summoned by parliamentary committees more than once a month. during the last parliament, more than members of any other organisation. They were increasingly posed questions about editorial matters, in complete breach of longstanding protocol.</p> \n<p>But it’s the erosion of financial independence that is the most serious issue. The problem dates from an obscure judgment by the Office for National Statistics back in 2006. The statisticians then concluded that the BBC should be reclassified, from being a public corporation to a part of central government. This meant that licence fee income was redefined as a tax, not a fee; that BBC and BBC Worldwide borrowing scores against the&nbsp;public borrowing requirement; and that the chancellor can now meet his target for reducing welfare spending in&nbsp;part by piling part of it on to the licence fee.</p> \n<p>The BBC has been putting a brave face on this week’s heist. It has gained some small concessions, in the modernisation of the licence fee to cover all online viewing, and in the restoration of a link between the fee and general inflation for the first time in seven years. The former should have gone ahead anyway, just as the licence fee has been modernised several times over the decades to keep up with technology. The link to the consumer price index is welcome but will not involve much more money in a low-inflation era. The bill for the free over-75 licences will also be phased in.</p> \n<p>However, beyond the first few years, and thanks to the rapid growth in the number of people aged over 75, there will probably be service closures as a result of the raid. The amount involved – &pound;650m a year and rising – is so large that it is about the same as the budget for BBC2, or all of BBC radio, or all of BBC3, BBC4, Radio 5 and Radio 6 Music plus local radio. It will be hard to justify continuing to spend about &pound;90m a year on S4C. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/07/cuts-bbc-threaten-tv-industry-pact-george-osborne\" title=\"\">The BBC’s spending on independent productions will have to be&nbsp;slashed</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/30/bbc-threat-success-market-ideology-conservative-mps\">The BBC is under threat because its success challenges market ideology | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is a scandal that such a profound cut to the BBC’s ability to deliver its services to the people who pay for it was imposed in a bullying backroom deal over a couple of days. The scope of the BBC and the size of the licence fee needed to fund its activities must be a matter of public debate. The charter renewal debate that will take place over the next few months is the time to involve the public.</p> \n<p>One of the principles that ought to be agreed is that the licence fee settlement and discussions about the BBC’s responsibilities and services will always be linked in future, and will always involve a public consultation. A majority of people – 55% – <a href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/news/2015/audience_research.pdf\" title=\"\">think the licence fee should be set by an independent body</a>, compared with 23% who say the government or MPs should decide. This would be a significant step back towards safeguarding the BBC’s independence.</p> \n<p>It is also vital that the statistical categorisation of the BBC as part of central government be reversed. The ONS was naive to claim then that its judgment would not damage the BBC’s independence. It has done, profoundly, and the judgment was incorrect. I hope parliament will also debate seriously the delegation of the payment of a welfare benefit from a department of state to a public broadcaster, and reject this unprincipled move.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436280083742/BBC-Broadcasting-House-in-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'It’s the erosion of the BBC's financial independence that is the most serious issue.'

It will lay the groundwork for a lower-tax and low-welfare Britain, where the state is in retreat. This brave new world coincides with the renewal of the BBC charter, the agreement that defines its remit and governance, as well as the new financial settlement that sets the level of the licence fee. The BBC is one of Britain’s great national institutions. It reflects, informs and shapes the public realm. It is admired abroad and widely loved at home. It is also a player in the fierce, highly commercial digital wars, a player whose privileges are under unprecedented attack. It needs the support of the people who pay &pound;145 a year for it. That should be won through open and transparent funding negotiations. The events of the past week were neither. Secret talks ended with the BBC agreeing to pick up the tab for free TV licences for pensioners, thereby becoming dangerously enmeshed in the politics of social policy in a way that could jeopardise rather than underpin public support.</p> \n<p>No one at the BBC, neither the chair of the trust, Rona Fairhead, who is supposed to be the guardian of its governance, nor the director general, Tony Hall, defends the process. Sir Michael Lyons thought he had beaten back the same plan when he was chairman five years ago. Then, he agreed to bear the cost of the BBC World Service. In <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm150706/debtext/150706-0001.htm#1507066000004\">the Commons on Monday</a>, John Whittingdale, the culture secretary who only in February <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmcumeds/315/31503.htm\">chaired the committee that concluded</a> “No future licence fee negotiations must be conducted in the way of the 2010 settlement”, ducked the invitation to explain how exactly the same thing had just happened again. At the very least, the terms of this deal must now be published so that Mr Osborne can be held to account.</p> \n<p>The BBC might not defend the process, but it does defend the deal. Lord Hall believes that in the course of five days he managed to get agreement to make the licence fee fit for the multi-platform age; the burdensome “top-slicing” of the licence fee to provide cash for the broadband roll-out will end; and the licence fee itself will be uprated in line with the consumer price index. In cash terms, the deal means no actual cut. So far so good.</p> \n<p>But what of the principle? What of a world where part of benefits policy is in the gift of Britain’s national broadcaster? This is the third settlement in a row where the chancellor of the day has raided the licence fee to fund some other project. First it was the digital switchover, and then the same fund was redirected to extending broadband. In 2005, it was the cost of the World Service. And now, pensioner policy. This may be the way the licence fee ends, absorbed bit by bit into general government spending.</p> \n<p>The independence of the BBC’s funding, independent not just of government but advertisers too, is an integral part of its status as a force for the national good. Commercial TV makes many great programmes – not least because of the competition from the BBC – but Sky, ITV and Channel 4 are not public institutions. Tory politicians recognise but often seem to struggle with this idea. It is not only Conservatives who sometimes resent its news coverage, but it is only Conservatives who attribute its alleged statist bias to the way it is funded. David Cameron is one of a long line of prime ministers who have had bruising encounters in BBC studios, but during the election he linked his irritation at repeated challenges about the impact of austerity from BBC journalists with the future of the BBC itself. Reporters on the campaign trail were not so sure that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/21/nick-robinson-cameron-threatened-close-down-bbc-election-bus\">a remark about closing down the corporation</a> was made in jest.</p> \n<p>With negotiations for the renewal of the charter, the real fight for the future of the BBC begins. Both the chancellor and the culture secretary have indicated that the funding settlement is contingent on a “satisfactory” outcome. To Mr Whittingdale and many of his colleagues that means smaller and leaner. The threat of decriminalising licence fee evasion, which <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/12/conservatives-bbc-licence-fee-david-cameron-decriminalisation-non-payment\">could cost the BBC &pound;200m</a>, still hangs in the air. While Mr Osborne claims to like Strictly Come Dancing and to believe in the breadth of the BBC, both he and Mr Cameron think its web presence has become quasi-imperial. Faced with such a hostile environment, it is easy to see why the director general defends the deal.

And that means the first Conservative-only budget in almost 20 years. At 12.30pm on Wednesday, George Osborne will take to the despatch box to announce his plans for the finances of the country. Here’s everything you need to know.</p> \n<h2><strong>1. What even is the budget?</strong></h2> \n<p>Put simply, it’s the announcement the chancellor of the exchequer makes to MPs in the House of Commons, outlining the public spending of the government over the course of parliament.</p> \n<h2><strong>2. Why do I care?</strong></h2> \n<p>Because often there’s something in there about the changing cost of alcohol.</p> \n<h2>3. Ah, I see. Could you please tell me more about how the budget works?</h2> \n<p>Sure. The chancellor will talk about the current state of the economy, and forthcoming increases and decreases in taxes. The actual legislation comes after, and is known as the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/occasions/budget/\">finance bill</a>.</p> \n<p>After the budget, typically <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/occasions/budget/\">four days of debating</a> takes place in the House of Commons. Then the finance bill has to go through the usual stages of a bill being passed into law. It’s all very exciting.</p> \n<p>But before the debates (I know, I’m sorry), the leader of the opposition (rather than, as you might expect, the shadow chancellor) responds immediately to the chancellor’s speech.</p> \n<h2>4. Who will respond tomorrow?</h2> \n<p>Well, given that Labour is currently <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/labourleadership\">undergoing an identity crisis</a>, the response will come from Harriet Harman (below), the party’s interim leader. Prepare for the Daily Mail to scrutinise exactly what she’s wearing, because that’s the most important thing. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"688f600444f9d25ca55d87de73f65d230a93985a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436282082888/cc5cc4a8-89ac-4d53-ae88-f69ec303c62d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"harriet harman\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harriet Harman will respond to George Osborne’s budget.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>5. Where is the government getting its dosh from?</h2> \n<p>Taxes. Think income taxes (on what people earn); VAT (value added tax) on things we purchase, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12099638\">currently set at 20%</a>; and taxes known as duties (on items such as cigarettes, alcohol and petrol). Other taxes too.</p> \n<h2>6. Anything else I should know?</h2> \n<p>Oh, just that the whole thing is presided over by someone with the awesome title of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_Ways_and_Means\">“chairman of ways and means”</a>. Currently a position held by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Hoyle\">Lindsay Hoyle</a>, a Labour MP. He gets to nip in and speak before the leader of the opposition responds.</p> \n<h2>7. So what can we actually expect in the budget tomorrow?</h2> \n<p>The top line of the budget speech will be, as a rather brilliant BBC headline puts it: “<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33399650\">George Osborne: &pound;12bn of welfare savings have been found</a>” – as if he’d lost them down the back of the sofa.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Osborne has a plan … and it isn't pretty</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>This is the news that after announcing significant – but unbudgeted – cuts in the Tory general election manifesto, Osborne has worked out a plan. And it isn’t pretty.</p> \n<p>It’s expected that he will <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jan/27/david-cameron-cutting-benefits-cap-britain-work\">decrease the annual benefits cap</a> from &pound;26,000 to &pound;23,000 for those living in London, and to &pound;20,000 for those outside. This, it is hoped, will save &pound;135m. He’s also pledged to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/housing-network/2015/may/18/housing-benefit-cuts-disaster-young-people\">remove housing benefit for those aged 18 to 21 on jobseekers allowance</a>, which will apparently make &pound;120m in savings. </p> \n<h2>8. Anything else?</h2> \n<p>Osborne has also set out plans to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/11717394/Budget-2015-George-Osborne-to-remove-inheritance-tax-loophole.html\">raise the inheritance tax threshold</a> for couples to &pound;1m by 2017.</p> \n<h2>9. What does that even mean?</h2> \n<p>It means that inheritance tax will now only have to be paid on assets over &pound;500,000 for single people, and &pound;1m for couples.</p> \n<p>In addition to the &pound;325,000 in personal assets already permitted to be passed on tax-free, Osborne is creating an additional &pound;175,000 tax-free allowance per person for property. So if you die, you are allowed to pass on assets worth &pound;500,000, including a house, to your children, without paying inheritance tax. So that’s a weight off the mind.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14d0548944f817250a5f2758f0feb4e216dd7665\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436282600678/dd7c23a0-87eb-47ed-ad5d-d76951fa23c4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"loadsamoney\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raising the inheritance tax threshold will mean couples can pass on &pound;1m of assets without being taxed. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: London Weekend Television/Rex Features</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>10. What’s the news on housing association tenants? I love all that.</h2> \n<p>Local authority and housing association tenants who earn more than &pound;40,000 in London (or &pound;30,000 elsewhere), <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/budget-2015-george-osborne-to-axe-subsidies-for-higher-income-earners-in-social-housing-10366555.html\">will have to pay market rents</a>, or almost market rents, from 2017 or 2018. </p> \n<h2>11. And what’s all this about the BBC?</h2> \n<p>Osborne is gunning for the BBC. Everybody is always gunning for the BBC. Leftwing bias, rightwing bias, let’s call the whole thing off. Which is what Osborne is hoping to do, given the changes he is making.</p> \n<p>Osborne will shift the &pound;650m cost of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-33400935\">free television licences for the over 75s</a> from the Treasury to the Beeb itself. </p> \n<h2>12. Um, doesn’t that mean the BBC is being forced to help with Osborne’s austerity plans?</h2> \n<p>Yes. Osborne maintains that channels will not have to be axed or major changes made, but given that the BBC recently moved BBC3 online and only saved around &pound;50m, that’s, to coin a phrase, rich. Meanwhile, &pound;650m represents one fifth of the BBC’s entire budget.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I'm going to close them down after the election</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>David Cameron</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Osborne has also said he will close the loophole that allows viewers who only watch catch-up television on BBC iPlayer – not live transmissions – to avoid paying the licence fee.</p> \n<p>Last week it was announced that the BBC was to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/02/bbc-cut-more-1000-jobs-cost-saving-push\">cut 1,000 jobs</a> to save &pound;150m. Earlier this year, journalist Nick Robinson relayed a conversation in which David Cameron <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/21/nick-robinson-cameron-threatened-close-down-bbc-election-bus\">threatened to close the BBC down</a>. So far so good.</p> \n<h2>13. Didn’t we already have a budget this year?</h2> \n<p>Yes.</p> \n<h2>14. Could you please explain?</h2> \n<p>Certainly. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-31929772\">previous budget</a>, also presented by Osborne, as he was also chancellor then, was a pre-election budget that took place in March. Now we’ve had a change of government, which requires a new budget. And this time, the Conservatives don’t have to worry about their former coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats.</p> \n<h2>15. Is it always so boring?</h2> \n<p>It shouldn’t be, given that budget day is the only day when alcohol is allowed to be consumed in the House of Commons chamber – but only by the chancellor. Plus, if Greece has taught us anything (and the Greeks have taught us rather a lot), it’s that the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/business/debt-crisis\">economy can be anything but dull</a>. </p> \n<p>Unfortunately, Osborne sticks to a glass of water. The longest ever budget speech on record was made by William Gladstone in 1853, who clocked in at a withering <a href=\"http://qz.com/65163/heres-why-brits-brandish-that-weird-little-red-suitcase-on-budget-day/\">four hours and 45 minutes</a>, aided by a concoction of <a href=\"http://www.totalpolitics.com/print/4128/top-tenbudget-facts.thtml\">sherry and beaten egg</a>. The merciful Benjamin Disraeli took just three quarters of an hour to deliver his 1867 speech. Um, but he also took five hours on one occasion in 1852 (but with a break). </p> \n<h2>16. Why is George Osborne carrying a red lunch box?</h2> \n<p>How rude. That’s not a lunch box. It’s a briefcase, containing the budget speech, Dairylea lunchables and a carton of Um Bongo.</p> \n<p>The original lunch box, sorry, briefcase was used by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Ewart_Gladstone\">William Gladstone</a>, circa 1860. The formal title of the briefcase is actually the budget box, and it is just one of many ministerial boxes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e81a56c0a41cf5af644c614d3beaac9dbec8f0e2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436282790394/e4ea745f-5612-444b-8028-7f15aa81c250-258x420.jpeg\" alt=\"gordon brown budget box\" width=\"258\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gordon Brown had his handcrafted.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>None of the other ministerial boxes have their own photoshoot outside No 11 Downing Street, however, while gripped with the force and positioning of a man holding a handrail seven people removed on the Tube.</p> \n<p>More than one budget box exists. Gladstone’s original wooden one, lined with black satin and covered in scarlet leather, was redesigned in <a href=\"http://www.britishpathe.com/video/james-callaghan-in-his-office-aka-james-callaghan/query/Budget\">1965</a> for James Callaghan, and <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-information-office/p05.pdf\">again in 1997</a> for Gordon Brown, who made a big deal of his new box being handcrafted by trainees from his Dunfermline East constituency.</p> \n<p>Alistair Darling from 2007, and Osborne in 2010, reading that “vintage is in”, used Gladstone’s original.</p> \n<p>In 2011, however, a brand new budget box was produced<a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/15-07-10-acnra-summary-for-web.pdf\"> by the National Archives</a>. It <a href=\"http://www.24dash.com/news/central_government/2011-03-31-Osborne-slammed-for-spending-4-300-on-new-red-Budget-box\">cost &pound;4,300</a> to make. Gladstone’s original is now housed at the <a href=\"http://www.iwm.org.uk/visits/churchill-war-rooms\">Imperial War Museum</a>.</p> \n<p>Fact fans might be pleased to note that Norman Lamont didn’t use the budget box. Instead, his then secretary William Hague <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/events/budget_99/budget_briefing/282109.stm\">carried his speech in a plastic bag</a> – because the box itself contained a bottle of whisky. I haven’t made that up. And pity poor George Ward Hunt, who in 1868, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Ward_Hunt\">forgot to bring the budget box</a>, or the speech inside it, depending on who you believe.</p> \n<p>Finally, let us also take a moment to remember Liberal Democrat Danny Alexander’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/mar/19/budget-yellow-box-lib-dems-alternative-commons-danny-alexander\">alternative yellow budget box</a>, a 2015 election gimmick only narrowly pipped at the post by the dreaded <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/13/the-ed-stones-fate-resting-in-peace-in-a-south-london-garage\">EdStone</a>.</p> \n<h2>17. Is the budget always on a Wednesday?</h2> \n<p>It doesn’t have to be on a Wednesday, but it usually is. This is because the budget speech takes place after <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/pmqs\">PMQs</a> (prime minister’s questions), and Tony Blair <a href=\"http://www.totalpolitics.com/blog/28148/30-facts-about-pmqs.thtml\">shifted PMQs</a> from 15-minute sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays to once a week for half an hour, on Wednesdays, when he took office in 1997.</p> \n<h2>18. What is the autumn statement?</h2> \n<p>This takes place, as its name suggests, in November or December. Although personally I would argue that December is clearly in winter. The last <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/uk-news/autumn-statement-2014\">autumn statement</a> was delivered by – you guessed it – Osborne, on 3 December 2014. </p> \n<p>It’s basically just a review of the government’s spending and a look at future spending based on report from the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/business/office-for-budget-responsibility\">OBR </a>(office for budget responsibility). The OBR produces two forecasts annually: one at the budget, and one at the autumn statement.</p> \n<h2>19. I don’t get why he is called the chancellor of the exchequer</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/06/budget-george-osborne-austerity-tory\">This budget is George Osborne’s best chance to show us austerity has a purpose | Matthew d’Ancona</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In other countries, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/chancellor-of-the-exchequer\">chancellor of the exchequer</a> would just be known as the finance minister. The name derives from a checked board, on which <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HIMiWHVKLDkC&amp;pg=RA1-PR156&amp;lpg=RA1-PR156&amp;dq=checkerboard+chancellor+exchequer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cB1Q4XNtFj&amp;sig=0YkHqb7uY5G3Pjk7pbJrL0GDf74&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3-ebVYiUCYyVNpCwnZAC&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=checkerboard%20chancellor%20exchequer&amp;f=false\">counters would be used</a> to mark revenues.</p> \n<h2>20. This all sounds so fun! Can I watch it unfold live?</h2> \n<p>You sure can, my little masochistic friend. Osborne’s speech will be broadcast on BBC2, BBC News and BBC Parliament (possibly with erroneous, rude subtitles) and you will also be able to watch on Sky News and ITV. The Beeb, keen to ensure it really knows its enemy, will also have live coverage on Radio 4.</p> \n<p>The best place to follow Gorgeous George, however, will of course be right here at the Guardian.

Today’s emergency budget, we’re assured, will turn us into One Nation. Unfortunately that nation is Greece.</p> \n<p>There’s a lot of projection among our elites. Perhaps they have to imagine the people they prey on as having their own worst qualities, so currently we hear a lot about scroungers and parasites and frauds, as a class of yacht-owning, show jumping, off-piste-skiing, incestuous monsters projects the shame it feels at its own greed on to a population whose idea of decadence is probably bath bombs.</p> \n<p>George Osborne has already achieved a lot as chancellor – for example, dystopian sci-fi now only has to be set 18 months in the future. To us he seems to be firmly <a href=\"http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/House_Lannister\">House Lannister</a>, if you overlook his terrible record on debt, but the true horror of Osborne is that he is actually one of the more human faces in the Conservative parliamentary party. He doesn’t even have that penetrating delivery that upperclass English people evolved to make themselves heard over musket fire and the screams of dying foreigners. His strained voice is more like the one you’d use to try to book tickets on an automated phone line, or in the final six months of a relationship.</p> \n<p>Yet it’s important not to respond with our own projection and imagine humanity in people who feel none. Your ruling class don’t care about what happens to you. What seems like some enormous upset in your community is undetectable from a helicopter or a speeding motorcade. They are pitiless. Sitting down and trying to make a moral argument against austerity to our elites is like addressing global warming by opening negotiations with the sea. They don’t care about things like education. They feel there needs to be enough provision so that prostitutes are numerate enough to find hotel rooms, and that’s it.</p> \n<p>The Tories are obviously attuned to word choice, which is why they gave us a couple of months’ notice of their emergency budget. So why do they feel so sanguine about the ubiquity of “austerity”? This isn’t austerity; it’s a transfer of assets from public to private ownership. One of the main advantages of the word “austerity” is that it suggests a gradual process, when, in reality, we are caught under the wheels of a chariot.</p> \n<p>We live in a society that doesn’t even care to address the fact that the planet is dying. Establishment attitudes cover a narrow spectrum from survival being less important than growth to climate change being a hoax. Suggesting what? That the crafty international scientific community has got together to talk down the value of beachfront property? This is a budget that will result in people with disabilities dying, not as an unfortunate side-effect, but as a direct consequence of a system that is empirically indifferent to life.</p> \n<p>Our ruling class are largely unaware of the struggles of unknowable muggle lives, but our desiccated culture has probably left us alienated enough to be able to empathise with theirs a little. I want you to try something. Imagine that you become a member of our elite. You have every success you’ve ever wanted but have to spend your time surrounded by the worst people on earth. It’s like being a Chelsea fan. You start to take cocaine, partly because you now socialise exclusively with people it wouldn’t be safe to fall asleep around. You buy a yacht.</p> \n<p>Being on a yacht is, at best, like being in a Premier Inn during an earthquake. So why is it an entrance requirement for the super-rich? Because it provides a floating crime scene. You and your jaded friends can now take your parties into international waters. You can stop off at the Channel Islands and take onboard a consignment of orphans who will afterwards be thrown into the giant beak-like mouths of the blasphemous undersea deities that you all worship.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/07/inevitable-grim-toll-of-george-osborne-housing-and-benefits-policies\">The inevitable grim toll of George Osborne’s housing and benefits policies | Letters from David Blunkett, Dr Georgina Toye and others</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And then one day you find yourself sitting in the ruins of some charmless party, an arms dealer slurring at you that he’s made more money out of Africa than Bob Geldof, a couple of members of the Illuminati in a corner debating whether hinting at their existence on banknotes might be counterproductive. You suggest that the central bankers have Greece in a chokehold. “Stranglehold!” corrects a humourless former member of the KGB, a point that he insists on demonstrating on a resigned-looking waiter. Later, the boat rocks slightly and you assume that the body has been dropped overboard and something has risen to feed on it.</p> \n<p>You step out on to the deck, where there is an eery, humid calm. There is a thought in the heart of every addict. It is universal, but we all think it’s unique to just us. It is: “I am no damn good.” Every rich person has a secret thought at their centre too, and now that I think about it the two must be related. You reach for it here for comfort.

In the House of Commons, Chris Grayling’s life is travelling in the opposite direction. Having been caught trying to sneak English votes for English laws through parliament using a change in standing orders rather than the full legislative process last Thursday, the leader of the house was forced to suffer a worse nightmare after Lib Dem Alastair Carmichael dug out a standing order of his own to trigger an emergency debate on why the house had not been allowed to have a debate on Evel.</p> \n<p>It was a virtual rerun of the previous week, with the same characters making exactly the same points as before. Only in greater depth and at greater length. While Carmichael re-catalogued the failings of his proposals – an extensive list that ran the full spectrum from incompetence to stitchup – Punxsutawney Chris pretended he was elsewhere by examining his mobile phone for long periods. Presumably to check whether this kind of humiliation was in his job description. Leader of the house is usually given to a politician in the twilight of his career and Punxsutawney Chris isn’t the kind of bloke you’d want to settle a boundary dispute between two allotment holders, let alone one between four countries.</p> \n<p>Eventually he was forced to admit he was indeed at least alive. Tuesday? Thursday? His eyes swivelled desperately for help. None was forthcoming, even from his own benches. “I am pleased to have a further chance...” he stuttered. “What he must understand is one of the things that wasn’t understood. It’s very simple.” So simple that Punxsutawney Chris couldn’t explain it as anything other than a series of ever-moving targets in which the budget became estimates and devolved powers became anything he said they were.</p> \n<p>Shadow leader, Angela Eagle, was not quite sure where to begin. He had ignored the McKay Commission and there were 22 pages of amendments to standing orders bundled in a take it or leave it package. “It’s a constitutional mess,” she shrugged. “I was only trying to make things more transparent,” Punxsutawney Chris replied. <br /></p> \n<p>John Redwood was one of the few MPs willing to come to his rescue. He, too, got shot down. “If the honourable gentleman had been here from the start of the debate,” Eagle observed, “then he would have known that I had already answered that.” Redwood looked daggers. He’s not used to being talked to like that and it’s hardly his fault if, like Punxsutawney Chris, he is living in a time loop.</p> \n<p>Others killed with kindness. Tory Charles Walker, chair of the Commons procedure elect committee, longed to find something reassuring to say. But couldn’t. His hands were tied, post-legislation scrutiny was far from ideal. “I’m not sure what I can do about it,” he concluded. He did, though suggest MPs would need to work much longer hours, which didn’t go down too well. Sunday trading is for the lower orders. <br /></p> \n<p>Punxsutawney Chris’s fate was sealed when Ed Miliband joined in. And who could blame him? After years of being everyone’s favourite whipping boy, the former Labour leader had earned his chance to kick someone else when they were down.</p> \n<p>Long before the end, Punxsutawney Chris knew the game was up and did not even bother to stay for the result of the vote. Groundhog Day would be coming round again and he would have to be back in the Commons the following week to relive the horror, the horror. If the movie is a reliable guide, Punxsutawney Chris has only got another 10 years or so of this before he comes up with a solution to Evel.
