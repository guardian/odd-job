Monbiot","body":"<p>Kindness is cruelty; cruelty is kindness: this is the core belief of compassionate conservatism. If the state makes excessive provision for the poor, it traps them in a culture of dependency, destroying their self-respect, locking them into unemployment. Cuts and coercion are&nbsp;a&nbsp;moral duty, to be pursued with the&nbsp;holy fervour of inquisitors overseeing an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-da-f%C3%A9\" title=\"\">auto da f&eacute;</a>.</p> \n<p>This belief persists despite reams of countervailing evidence, showing that severity does nothing to cure the structural causes of unemployment. In Britain it is used to justify a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/08/tories-12bn-welfare-cuts-mythical-scroungers-conservatives\" title=\"\">&pound;12bn reduction</a> of a social security system already so harsh that it drives some recipients to suicide. The belief arises from a deep and dearly held fallacy that has persisted for more than 200 years.</p> \n<p>Poverty was once widely understood as a social condition: it described the fate of those who did not possess property. England’s old poor law, introduced in 1597 and 1601, had its own cruelties, some of which were extreme. But as the US academics Fred Block and Margaret Somers explain in their fascinating book <a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674050716\" title=\"\">The Power of Market Fundamentalism</a>, those who implemented it seemed to recognise that occasional unemployment was an&nbsp;intrinsic feature of working life.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/21/osborne-to-proceed-with-12bn-welfare-cuts-despite-anti-austerity-protests\">Osborne to proceed with &pound;12bn welfare cuts despite anti-austerity protests</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In 1786 however, as economic crises threw rising numbers on to the mercy of their parishes, the clergyman Joseph Townsend sought to recast poverty as a moral or even biological condition. “The poor know little of the motives which stimulate the higher ranks to action – pride, honour, and ambition,” he argued in his Dissertation on the Poor Laws. “In general it is only hunger which can spur and goad them onto labour; yet our laws have said, they shall never hunger.”</p> \n<p>Thomas Malthus expands on this theme in his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_the_Principle_of_Population\" title=\"\">Essay on the Principle of Population</a>, published in 1798. Poor relief, he maintained, causes poverty. It destroys the work ethic, reducing productivity. It also creates an incentive to reproduce, as payments rise with every family member. The higher the population, the hungrier the poor became: kindness resulted in cruelty. Poverty, he argued, should be tackled through shame (“dependent poverty ought to be held disgraceful”) and the withdrawal of assistance from all able-bodied workers. Nature should take its course: if people were left to starve to death, the balance between population and food supply would be restored. Malthus ignored the means by which people limit their reproduction or increase their food supply, characterising the poor, in effect, as unthinking beasts.</p> \n<p>His argument was controversial, but support grew rapidly among the propertied classes. In 1832 the franchise was extended to include more property owners: in other words, those who paid the poor rate. The poor, of course, were not entitled to vote. In the same year, the government launched a royal commission into the operation of the poor laws.</p> \n<p>Like Malthus, the commissioners blamed the problems of the rural poor not on structural factors but on immorality, improvidence and low productivity, all caused by the system of&nbsp;poor relief, which had “educated a new generation in idleness, ignorance and dishonesty”. It called for the abolition of “outdoor relief” for able-bodied people. Help should be offered only in circumstances so shameful, degrading and punitive that anyone would seek to avoid them: namely the workhouse. The government responded with the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act, which instituted, for the sake of the&nbsp;poor, a regime of the utmost cruelty. Destitute families were broken up and, in effect, imprisoned.</p> \n<p>The commission was a fraud. It&nbsp;began&nbsp;with fixed conclusions and sought evidence to support them. Its interviews were conducted with like-minded members of the propertied classes, who were helped towards the right replies with leading questions. Anecdote took the place of data.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Macroeconomic policy mistakes were blamed on the victims. Does that sound familiar?</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In reality, poverty in the countryside had risen as a result of structural forces over which the poor had no control. After the Napoleonic wars, the price of wheat slumped, triggering the collapse of rural banks and a severe credit crunch. Swayed by the arguments of David Ricardo, the government re-established the gold standard, which locked in austerity and aggravated hardship, much as George Osborne’s legal enforcement of a permanent budget surplus will do. Threshing machines reduced the need for labour in the autumn and winter, when employment was most precarious. Cottage industries were undercut by urban factories, while enclosure prevented the poor from producing their own food.</p> \n<p>Far from undermining employment, poor relief sustained rural workers during the winter months, ensuring that they remained available for hire when they were needed by farms in the spring and summer. By contrast to the loss of agricultural productivity that Malthus predicted and the commission reported, between 1790 and 1834 wheat production more than doubled.</p> \n<p>As Block and Somers point out, the rise in unemployment and extreme poverty in the 1820s and 1830s represented the first great failure of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Ricardian_economics\" title=\"\">Ricardian, laissez-faire economics</a>. But Malthus’s doctrines allowed this failure to be imputed to something quite different: the turpitude of the poor. Macroeconomic policy mistakes were blamed on the victims. Does that sound familiar?</p> \n<p>This helps to explain the persistence of the fallacy. Those who promoted laissez-faire economics required an explanation when the magic of the markets failed to deliver their promised utopia. Malthus gave them the answer they needed.</p> \n<p>And still does. People are poor and unemployed, George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith claimed in the Sunday Times, because of “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/21/osborne-to-proceed-with-12bn-welfare-cuts-despite-anti-austerity-protests\" title=\"\">the damaging culture of welfare dependency</a>”. Earlier this month, Duncan Smith, in a burst of Malthusiasm, sought to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/01/downing-street-rejects-iain-duncan-smith-plan-for-new-limit-on-child-benefit\" title=\"\">restrict child benefit to two children per family</a>, to discourage the poor from reproducing. Analysis by the Wellcome Trust suggests that the government, which will place <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/apr/17/hundreds-of-mental-health-experts-issue-rallying-call-against-austerity\" title=\"\">350 psychologists in job&nbsp;centres</a>, now treats <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2015/WTP059337.htm\" title=\"\">unemployment as a mental health disorder</a>.</p> \n<p>The media’s campaign of vilification associates social security with disgrace, and proposes even more humiliation, exhortation, intrusion, bullying and sanctions. This Thursday, the new household income figures are likely to show a sharp rise in child poverty, after sustained reductions under the Labour government. Doubtless the poor will be blamed for improvidence and feckless procreation, and urged to overcome their moral failings through aspiration. For 230 years, this convenient myth has resisted all falsification. Expect that to persist.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/88d4b32cc53e16f35813704076f284365d6e038f/171_147_5445_3267/5445.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3267,"width":5445,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christopher Furlong/Getty Images","altText":"A family outside their council home in Salford, Manchester","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T16:45:10Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T23:01:10Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1068,"contributors":[{"name":"George Monbiot","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/10/1410361956546/George-Monbiot-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/georgemonbiot"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Benefits","Welfare","Poverty","Social exclusion","Society","Politics","Austerity","Conservatives","George Osborne","Economics","Business","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"society/benefits","webTitle":"Benefits"},{"id":"politics/welfare","webTitle":"Welfare"},{"id":"society/poverty","webTitle":"Poverty"},{"id":"society/socialexclusion","webTitle":"Social exclusion"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"business/austerity","webTitle":"Austerity"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"politics/georgeosborne","webTitle":"George Osborne"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"George Monbiot","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/georgemonbiot"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/23/skivers-strivers-200-year-old-myth-wont-die","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3yq","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/23/skivers-strivers-200-year-old-myth-wont-die","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/23/skivers-strivers-200-year-old-myth-wont-die"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/88d4b32cc53e16f35813704076f284365d6e038f/171_147_5445_3267/5445.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3267,"width":5445,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Those who promoted laissez-faire economics required an explanation when the markets failed to deliver.

In a survey of 251 employees – roughly one-sixth of Zara’s New York workforce – black employees in particular reported mistreatment from management, and many workers said they were ordered to racially profile customers.</p> \n<p>In the survey, conducted by pro-worker advocacy group the Center for Popular Democracy, employees recalled being instructed to flag certain shoppers as “special orders” over their radio headsets – a code signalling that the customer was a likely shoplifter and should be followed and watched. According to survey respondents, signs that a customer might qualify as a special order included being African American, being a black person and “dressing a certain way” (ie, I guess, wearing any clothes that don’t completely obscure your black skin). In a particularly egregious anecdote, “One black employee claimed that when he had come in to pick up a cheque one day wearing a hooded jacket he was identified as a special order and prevented from entering a back office.” Ah, well, an unfortunate series of misunderstandings, perhaps.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, the report alleges, “Lighter-skinned employees of colour and white employees experienced better treatment within the company, with higher-status assignments, more work hours and a stronger likelihood of being promoted.”</p> \n<p>Whoopsy-daisy! Bygones, at this point, I’m sure. Not to mention that Zara is currently being sued by its former lawyer, who alleges homophobic and antisemitic treatment in the company’s corporate offices.</p> \n<p>It could happen to anyone! Lawyers, am I right?!</p> \n<p>Zara has also been accused of using racist imagery in its products: once for selling a bag emblazoned with swastikas; once for selling a pendant shaped like a person in blackface; once for selling a shirt featuring the slogan “White is the new black”; and once for selling a shirt styled to look like a concentration camp uniform.</p> \n<p>Uh, ha. HA HA. Probably just a clerical error. I’m sure we’ll all laugh about this later.</p> \n<p>Zara’s canny corporate spokesperson – seeing right through this long list of totally unrelated innocent coincidences that by pure accident all happen to look like racist garbage behaviour, probably because a butterfly flapped its wings in Johannesburg or something – responded to the allegations of racial discrimination with sputtering denial: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The baseless report was prepared with ulterior motives and not because of any actual discrimination or mistreatment. It makes assertions that cannot be supported and do not reflect Zara’s diverse workforce. Zara USA believes that the report is completely inconsistent with the company’s true culture and the experiences of the over 1,500 Zara employees in New York City. We are an equal-opportunity employer, and if there are individuals who are not satisfied with any aspect of their employment we have multiple avenues for them to raise issues that we would immediately investigate and address.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Referring to the claims about black customers being disproportionately identified with the code words “special orders”, it said: “We are a global, multicultural company serving valued customers across 88 countries, and do not tolerate discrimination of any form.”</p> \n<p>Yes. Of course you don’t.</p> \n<p>As we all know from the anguished howls of quivering white people that erupt any time a person of colour expresses any dissatisfaction about being murdered by police, disenfranchised by voter suppression, trapped in cycles of systemic poverty and/or treated like a criminal when they’re just trying to buy a horrible, $49 mauve bodysack, nobody in the world is ever racist, except for actual KKK members and the ghost of George Wallace. As Martin Luther King said in his famous speech Hey, Don’t Criticise White People, ahem: “Criticising white people is mean because they don’t like it. Instead, be nice to them no matter what they do. It’s racist for white guys NOT to use the N-word, if you think about it. PS Elvis invented rock and roll.”</p> \n<p>Therefore – even though the accusations levelled by the Zara employees are so common and predictable that I would believe them even from employees of a store that <em>didn’t</em> traffic in concentration camp cosplay – the Zara corporation must, surely, be innocent. There must be something else afoot. Like, say, a bunch of random retail employees all over New York City either colluding in massive secret meetings or coincidentally inventing exactly the same very specific lies about experiencing racist abuse from their totally non-racist employer. Even though the racist policies that Zara supposedly enforced – both subtle and overt – are so ubiquitous in American labour history that we have had to pass many federal and state laws to prohibit them – and establish numerous non-profit organizations to fight them full-time when those laws fail. Even though black people are absolutely, definitely, incessantly followed around in stores. Even though black children are followed around in stores.</p> \n<p>At what point can we stop denying and debating simple truths? At what point can we start acknowledging that the simplest explanation is probably the correct one?</p> \n<p>The US, my country, is a racist country. It’s a country built on white supremacy and the lie of freedom and opportunity – a place where white people live measurably safer, freer, more validated and prosperous lives, where the dehumanisation of black people was literally written into the constitution by slave-owners we are expected to worship, yet where even saying the words “white supremacy” is taboo. Why? Why can’t we just speak the truth?</p> \n<p>It’s not a coincidence that today I came across two stories of white women who pretended to be robbed and assaulted so they could blame groups of fictional black men. It’s not a coincidence that the police bought white mass murderer and terrorist Dylann Roof a burger on his way to jail, but shot dead 12-year-old black child Tamir Rice for playing in a park. The familiar silhouette of Roof’s crime – a deadly attack by a white racist on a southern black church – is not just a quirk of history, and neither is the fact that several major GOP politicians, whose candidacies rest on leveraging white bigotry and fear, took money from a white nationalist group that may have helped crystallise Roof’s hate. It’s not an anomaly that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/04/07/white-millennials-are-just-about-as-racist-as-their-parents/\">data indicates millennials are almost as racist as their parents</a>. It’s not an accident that a cheap-clothing company encourages its employees to assume most black people are thieves. And on and on and on.</p> \n<p>What if the Zara spokesperson had just said, “We’re sorry. We hear you. We’ll do better,” instead of bending over backwards to to deny any possible shred of culpability? You know what not-racist companies and people do? Acknowledge racism. Pay attention. Work. Change.</p> \n<p>The simplest explanation is true. Endlessly contorting yourself to deny the mechanics of the world around you doesn’t trick people into thinking you’re not racist. It reveals you as a twisted fool.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435076766147/5157620c-737e-4cc3-8105-7355fc569943-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Philip Weiss/AP","altText":"A memorial to Confederate soldiers daubed with the slogan 'Black Lives Matter'","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Philip Weiss/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T19:00:02Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T23:01:04Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":474,"contributors":[{"name":"Lindy West","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/west-lindy"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Race issues","US news","Charleston shooting","Zara","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/race","webTitle":"Race issues"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"us-news/charleston-shooting","webTitle":"Charleston shooting"},{"id":"fashion/zara","webTitle":"Zara"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Lindy West","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/west-lindy"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/23/lindy-west-racism-america-us-white-supremacy","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3mb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/23/lindy-west-racism-america-us-white-supremacy","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/23/lindy-west-racism-america-us-white-supremacy"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435076655351/fed7f7ac-f7ac-4f01-a655-b94212e43df7-2060x1445.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1445,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Following the Dylann Roof attack, a memorial to Confederate soldiers in Charleston has been daubed with the message ‘Black Lives Matter’.

After the election, a new cohort turns up with crusading zeal in its heart, impatient for change. They are soon captured by the institution. Their ambition is poured into the&nbsp;unbreakable mould where it congeals and sets. Older residents welcome them&nbsp;in as a breath of fresh air&nbsp;but then close the windows for fear&nbsp;of catching their death.</p> \n<p>Still, there are grounds for thinking that the 2015 cohort will succeed in shaking things up a bit. For a start, there are scores of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/scottish-independence\" title=\"\">Scottish nationalists</a> with an explicit mandate to do just that. Many have no experience of Westminster and little motive to treat its vellum-inscribed protocols with deference. Their main point of political reference and primary allegiance is Edinburgh. The SNP influx also brings the average age down. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/08/snp-mhairi-black-20-labour-student-mp\" title=\"\">Mhairi&nbsp;Black</a>, MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-32638268\" title=\"\">scalper of Douglas Alexander</a>, was born in 1994.</p> \n<p>The new Labour intake is also relatively young and female, with women outnumbering men 34 to 19. (The new Conservative MPs are split 47 to 27 the other way.) That doesn’t guarantee culture change, but it might nudge the Commons away from its default tone of macho pontification – what one former minister describes as “all the tedious willy-waving”.</p> \n<p>I detected a whiff of generational change when I heard about the Labour class of 2015’s night out to celebrate their arrival in parliament: a slap-up Chinese meal and karaoke; honourable members belting out Nirvana’s Smells like Teen Spirit and Blur’s Parklife; a spot of amateur breakdancing. It could be written up as carousal unbefitting serious legislators but to me it sounded reassuringly human.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Conservatives are starting to confound their <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2015/05/camerons-children-the-2015-generation-of-conservative-mps.html\" title=\"\">stale-male-pale stereotype</a>. Parliament as a whole is still some way off a fair reflection of the country in terms of ethnicity and gender and the Tories are hardly pioneers. But David Cameron has presided over some party diversification, much to the consternation of traditionalists who feel their promotion prospects have been sacrificed on an altar of political correctness. The more observant Labour MPs have clocked the arrival of Tories born to immigrant and working-class families and realised the shrinking potency of campaigns against Conservatism as the political wing of old-school privilege.</p> \n<p>Alongside demographic change is a trend away from party discipline. Measured in numbers of backbenchers voting against whips’ orders, the last parliament was <a href=\"http://www.psa.ac.uk/insight-plus/blog/most-rebellious-parliament-post-war-era\" title=\"\">the most rebellious of the postwar era</a>. The 2005-10 parliament had held the same title and the current session looks set to continue the pattern. Less than two months into his second term, Cameron has already been defied once by Eurosceptics over the terms of his referendum bill and been forced to retreat over plans to rewrite human rights law. The certainty of a Tory leadership contest before the next election lowers the potential cost of disloyalty to the incumbent and could encourage ever more ostentatious displays of dissent.</p> \n<p>Something similar may also happen on the Labour side. MPs who suspected early on that Ed Miliband was leading them to disaster now look back on the years of dutiful silence with remorse. They vow to be more ruthless with any substandard successor. That applies to the new intake, too, many of whom feel their seats were won with customised local campaigns, building up a personal following and running a mile from Miliband and his manifesto. Their priority is now securing hard-won majorities, not scrambling up&nbsp;the shadow ministerial ladder. They&nbsp;are in no hurry to swap the freedom to express an independent personality for some obscure portfolio, a “line to take” and guaranteed anonymity as the author of unread press releases. Some see their first rebellion as&nbsp;a rite of passage equivalent in status to their maiden speech.</p> \n<p>Parties must learn to be tolerant of this political teen spirit since it is, in all likelihood, uncrushable by conventional whipping. Besides, the cult of the monolithic message has suffocated Westminster for long enough. The only aspect of parliamentary business less edifying than the aggressive heckling is the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10617436/David-Camerons-attempts-to-stage-manage-Prime-Ministers-Questions.html\" title=\"\">sycophantic question</a> planted in the hands of an obedient backbencher. These fawning requests – will the minister please confirm for the house that his triumphant policies are the envy of all civilisation? – have spread like a fungus in the under-illuminated crevices of democratic debate.</p> \n<p>Media must share the blame. Too much political broadcasting is assembled to a formula of antithetical opinions crashing head-on. To concede a point is defeat; to agree with a member&nbsp;of another party is heresy; to&nbsp;disagree with a member of one’s own&nbsp;party is fatal division. The same applies in punditry. I get calls from the 24-hour news channels when they have&nbsp;a guest booked with an extreme partisan view. The researcher asks if I might be prevailed upon to believe the opposite and is audibly disappointed when I say there are merits to both sides of the argument. This betrays a neurotic fear of putting people with common ground on air in case it is dull. It doesn’t help that social media frenzy has become a metric of audience impact. Outrage is a more reliable driver of web traffic than compromise.</p> \n<p>But democratic politics cannot function without compromise. When MPs can’t be honest about agreement with their enemies or disagreement with their friends the result is an artificial polarisation and wilful manipulation or rejection of evidence that confounds official lines. This runs alongside the institutionalised hypocrisy of politicians from different tribes getting along and understanding one another’s positions better in private than they dare say in public. That feeds the perception of Westminster as a theatre of deception, with pantomime conflict on stage and establishment conspiracy in the wings.</p> \n<p>I am not wholly pessimistic. Each successive generation of MPs seems more frustrated by the artifice than the last. Some of the 2015 cohort will go down the familiar route and be co-opted by the whips, but some will retain their own voices and their own styles. I hope they will also vote more promiscuously across party lines. It seems paradoxical but if MPs could be a bit straighter about what they have in common, they might sound more credible in rebutting the charge of all being the same.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435080117598/Eva-Bees-illustration-on--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘To concede a point is defeat; to agree with a member of another party is heresy; to disagree with a member of one’s own party is fatal division.'

Prisons are, of course, closed institutions, but the shut-out extends beyond the bolts and bars – the prison service operates under a closed mentality. Unless you are a prisoner, a friend or relative of one, or a member of staff, you are unlikely ever to see inside any of the 136 prisons in England and Wales.</p> \n<p>And I was right not to be optimistic. I contacted the governor of a state-run prison and the director of a privately run jail. Both progressive people, who feel they have nothing to hide. Both said they would welcome the US journalists, only for the Ministy of Justice (MoJ) to step in and exercise its veto.</p> \n<p>The ban was ironic because, as bloated and repressive as the US penal system is, media access is a given, even on death row.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/24/rise-proportion-black-ethnic-minority-young-prisoners-stop-and-search\">Sharp rise in the proportion of black and ethnic minority young prisoners | Alastair Sloan and Eric Allison</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>More recently, while researching the story of the increase in black and ethnic minority young people in prison, Alastair Sloan was invited by the <a href=\"http://www.thezmt.org/\">Zahid Mubarek Trust </a>to visit Feltham young offender institution (YOI).

The MoJ has not said that Alastair can’t visit.

We know what goes on in schools, hospitals and many more public institutions. Why should we be barred from knowing what goes on in prisons?

In 2012, a 30-year-old Special Olympics athlete from Virginia who has Down’s Syndrome, <a href=\"https://specialolympicsblog.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/an-open-letter-to-ann-coulter/#https://specialolympicsblog.wordpress.com/2012/10/23/an-open-letter-to-ann-coulter/\" title=\"\">John Franklin Stephens, wrote an open letter on a blog </a>(it went viral) to the rightwing pundit Ann Coulter after she used the word in a tweet in reference to the president.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This is a global campaign. Every country has its own R-word</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Christy White, media director, Special Olympics</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In the letter Stevens wrote: “Come on Ms Coulter, you aren’t dumb and you aren’t shallow. So why are you continually using a word like the R-word as an insult? After I saw your tweet, I realised you just wanted to belittle the president by linking him to people like me. You assumed that people would understand and accept that being linked to someone like me is an insult and you assumed you would get away with it and still appear on TV. Well, Ms Coulter, you, and society, need to learn that being compared to people like me should be considered a badge of honour.”</p> \n<p>Efforts to eliminate the R-word will once again be in the spotlight next month when the <a href=\"http://www.specialolympics.org/los-angeles-2015.aspx#http://www.specialolympics.org/los-angeles-2015.aspx\" title=\"\">Special Olympics World Games return to the US and Los Angeles hosts the biannual event</a>. Over nine days, from 25 July, the games will involve more than 7,000 athletes with learning disabilities from 170 countries competing in 25 “Olympic-type” sports ranging from aquatics to track and field.</p> \n<p>For the organisers, athletes and supporters it represents another opportunity to “shift” the culture as Christy White, director of global media and public relations at the Special Olympics puts it. “This is a global campaign,” she says. “Every country has its own R-word.”</p> \n<p>It’s not about policing language, White insists, but having “a call to action” that will make people think twice about using a term that can hurt and exclude so many people. “It’s all about changing perceptions,” she adds.</p> \n<p>Nicole Maddox, director of communications at <a href=\"http://www.bestbuddies.org/#http://www.bestbuddies.org\" title=\"\">Best Buddies</a>, a charity partner of the Special Olympics on the campaign, says strides are being made year-round to raise the issue. A new momentum is discernible, she believes. “We know that eliminating old prejudicial and other hurtful words moves us in a new, progressive direction that respects and recognises people for their abilities, and not their disabilities,” she says.</p> \n<p>“Most people don’t think of the R-word as hate speech, but that’s exactly what it feels like to millions of people with learning disabilities, their families and friends. The R-word is just as cruel and offensive as any other slur and so it is incredibly important that we work to eliminate this word from society altogether.”</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434723451185/Special-Olympics-R-word-c-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Young people sign up to the Special Olympics R-word call to action   Photograph: Will Schermerhorn/Special Olympics ","credit":"Will Schermerhorn/Special Olympics","altText":"Special Olympics R-word campaign","cleanCaption":"Young people sign up to the Special Olympics R-word call to action   Photograph: Will Schermerhorn/Special Olympics "}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T13:00:05Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T23:10:06Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":440,"contributors":[{"name":"Mary O'Hara","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/5/1423130557559/Mary-O-Hara-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/maryohara"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Learning disability","Disability","Society","US news","World news","Down's syndrome","Health"],"tags":[{"id":"society/learningdisability","webTitle":"Learning disability"},{"id":"society/disability","webTitle":"Disability"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"society/downs-syndrome","webTitle":"Down's syndrome"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Mary O'Hara","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/maryohara"}}],"series":{"title":"Mary O'Hara: Lesson from America","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/society/series/mary-o-hara-lesson-from-america"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/23/r-word-retard-become-redundant-campaign-us","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ax7g","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jun/23/r-word-retard-become-redundant-campaign-us","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/23/r-word-retard-become-redundant-campaign-us"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434723451185/Special-Olympics-R-word-c-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Young people sign up to the Special Olympics R-word call to action.
