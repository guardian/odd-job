Today, what is the best size and shape of the state for the 21st century?","byline":"Rafael Behr","body":"<p>The Hungarian mathematician <a href=\"http://cmc-math.org/members/infinity/polya.html\" title=\"\">George Polya</a> had a rule for dealing with anything that looks intractable: “If you can’t solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it.” This applies in politics too. One of the hardest problems Labour faces is how to rebuild a reputation for economic competence when the Conservatives have successfully painted the opposition as unrepentant budget wastrels. To concede the point feels like surrender on enemy terms: accepting a mendacious account of what caused the financial crisis; signing up to cruel cuts. Yet to dispute the point looks like denial of political reality – blaming the voters instead of listening to them.</p> \n<p>So, following Polya’s maxim, how does Labour find a solvable problem within the unsolvable one? The trick is to take the Tories (momentarily) out of the equation. Posit super-benign circumstances in which there is no blame for the great crash and even George Osborne says all fiscal paths are equally valid. In this fantasy land the left would still have to confront failings of the Labour state that cannot simply be cast as inadequate funding or corruption by private enterprise.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There is a vast political space between monolithic state control and a privatised market free-for-all</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The period 1997-2010 saw much-needed investment in public services, but the social and economic return on that capital dwindled over time. When the question of whether Labour spent too much is removed, the question of how effectively the money was being spent remains.</p> \n<p>Tony Blair and Gordon Brown fostered a culture in which the obvious political remedy to every social ill was a task-force in the cabinet office, a tsar and a juicy budget. Some of that money was wisely used but inevitably some was misspent. Ministers rarely displayed indignation, or even curiosity, on the public’s behalf about the portion that might be wasted.</p> \n<p>This was bad for the left because it eroded confidence in centrally administered tax-and-spend as a natural expression of solidarity in the collective national interest. It fertilised soil in which the right could later sow suspicion of public spending as confiscation from the virtuous for handouts to the indolent.</p> \n<p>Labour’s tendency to measure social improvement in money allocations was also intellectually stultifying. Cash is a palliative treatment for the symptoms of social dysfunction, and compensation for people who find themselves on the losing side of globalisation. It doesn’t always equip them to cope without ongoing state support, which might not be doing them as many favours as ministers hope. Housing benefit, for example, became a Treasury subsidy to landlords, supporting high rents and passing only notionally through the hands of tenants in need of better homes. Tax credits as consolation for low pay became an anaesthetic that numbed the Treasury where it should have felt the need to do something about stagnating incomes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/13/labour-party-2020-movement\">Who should Labour speak for now? | John Harris</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Such questions are lost in debates about the size of the state measured by public spending as a proportion of national income. Osborne’s plans close in on 36%, a postwar low, and the shrinkage will feel more severe in many areas because expensive items such as pensions and health are protected. But Labour cannot simply campaign for a higher number. Its task is to describe something better, not always bigger. It must advertise a state that pays for itself by preventing costly social problems down the road and by nurturing a happier, more secure, healthier society that yields a more productive economy.</p> \n<p>Some thought has already gone into what this might entail, much of it by New Labour types. It is a myth on the left that “Blairites” are wedded to neoliberal dogmas and laissez-faire economics. It was Peter Mandelson in 2008 who called for a new “industrial activism” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2008/dec/04/peter-mandelson-economic-globalisation-markets\" title=\"\">led by a “more capable, strategic state”</a> in response to the financial crisis. That analysis evolved into a <a href=\"http://www.yourbritain.org.uk/agenda-2015/policy-review/adonis-review\" title=\"\">growth strategy developed by Andrew Adonis</a>. His work was studied in Osborne’s Treasury but neglected in Ed Miliband’s election campaign.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/societyofequals\" title=\"\">In 2010 James Purnell was arguing</a> that New Labour had been “too hands-off with the market and too hands-on with the state” and that the two elements were linked. Market failure creates social breakdown that drives demand for public spending. Miliband embraced only the first half of Purnell’s argument; he was never excited by state reform that would have balanced the message. That expressed a failure of imagination, not a lack of resources.</p> \n<p>Jon Cruddas, who led Miliband’s policy review, was not squeamish when <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2012/12/jon-cruddass-lecture-role-state-good-society\" title=\"\">talking about dysfunction in the centralised model of public services</a>. He consistently talked about relationships, community, sharing and reciprocity as the basis for a more effective social policy. In June 2014, the IPPR thinktank published <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/read/the-condition-of-britain-strategies-for-social-renewal#\" title=\"\">The Condition of Britain</a> – a 280-page tome packed with policy ideas for a more equal and prosperous society, based on the premise that taxpayers’ money is a finite resource best spent in ways that sustain public consent: a more contributory element to the welfare system; preferring investment in social infrastructure (such as Sure Start centres) to cash benefits; trusting local authorities to choose their priorities.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/13/britain-economy-labour\">Britain won’t recover while its economy is dominated by magical thinking | Aditya Chakrabortty</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>To develop that line of thinking, Labour has to rediscover two concepts that some on the left find challenging. First, differential regional outcomes needn’t be denounced as wicked “postcode lotteries”. They might reflect the discovery of a practice that works and can be shared. Second, government doesn’t have to own the whole supply chain of social intervention. It can commission charities, co-operatives, social enterprises and, yes, the private sector to find solutions to public policy problems. There is a vast political space between the poles of monolithic state control and a privatised, outsourced market free-for-all.</p> \n<p>From that place Labour then challenges the Tories. The opposition must sound confident that it has a recipe for delivering better services, consistent with the left’s historic ambitions for equality and social justice, yet baked in with an understanding that budgets are limited and public consent is fragile. The contest is then no longer framed in terms of a wasteful Labour state against a thrifty Tory one, but as a modern, innovative, inclusive Labour state, supporting a resilient and productive society, as opposed to a divisive, neglected, mean Tory one that ends up costing us all more in the long run.</p> \n<p>Imagining the smarter state is not hard. It is, in Polya’s method, the problem Labour can solve. Fed back into&nbsp;the current political equation it then also helps solve the harder problem&nbsp;of regaining public trust as a potential government.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436888892312/Tony-Blair-and-Gordon-Bro-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Tony Blair and Gordon Brown fostered a culture in which the obvious political remedy to every social ill was a task-force in the cabinet office, a tsar and a juicy budget.'

After churning through virtually all the mainstream feminist blogs and websites (there weren’t many in 2006), I learned that the most interesting and radical writing was generally done by people that the white, liberal feminist establishment considered crazy. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2015/jul/15/lena-dunham-to-launch-lenny-email-newsletter-for-young-women\">Lena Dunham to launch Lenny email newsletter for 'like-minded' women</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It’s not that separatist black womanists, the small and besieged contingent of trans activist bloggers, or the female feral communist contingent were always right about everything, although they were (and are) right about a lot of things.

So they must have been delighted when one of their own, Ashley Highfield, the Johnston Press chief executive who has asked the BBC to close local websites and work with the industry, was chosen to be on the expert panel to decide the corporation’s future.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/12/bbc-charter-review-what-the-panel-members-have-said-in-the-past\">BBC charter review: what the panel members have said in the past</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As we await the government’s green paper, due to be published on Thursday, the speculation and briefing against the BBC’s website has reached fever pitch.</p> \n<p>The BBC has its own view on local news. In its<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30999914\">Future of News report</a> it said “one of the biggest market failures in news in the last decade is local journalism” with more than 5,000 editorial jobs cut across the regional and national press in the UK in a decade.</p> \n<p>It added: “In December 2014, Trinity Mirror <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2014/nov/14/trinity-mirror-close-local-newspapers-job-losees\">closed seven local titles including the Reading Post, Surrey Herald and Surrey Times</a> – replacing them with an online-only service and cutting 50 jobs across its operation. In 2012, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2012/apr/16/johnston-press-dailies-go-weekly\">Johnston Press announced it was stopping daily publication</a> of the Halifax Courier, Northampton Chronicle and Echo, Peterborough Evening Telegraph, Northamptonshire Evening Telegraph and Scarborough Evening News, a newspaper which started its daily reporting in 1882.” </p> \n<p>The BBC claimed was the only news organisation committed to reporting the whole of the UK, community by community, region by region, nation by nation.</p> \n<p>The truth is that when the going was good, newspaper group managements milked the profits for their shareholders and executives, made unwise acquisitions and failed to invest in journalism. By the late 1990s, profit margins ranged from a minimum of 20% to 35% and more. Between the start of 2003 and the end of 2007, Media Wales’s profit margins averaged 34%, peaking at 38% for the 12 months to the end of 2005.</p> \n<p>When the recession came, advertising dried up and then failed to migrate to newspaper websites, the newspaper groups continued to award their executives fat pay cheques and payoffs and cut their staff to the bone. </p> \n<p>It’s not that they aren’t making money. While Newsquest staff had to go on a 10-day strike to discuss getting their trainees paid the London living wage, US parent company Gannett reported a 2013 profit of &pound;52.8m and was able to pay chief executive Gracia Martore more than &pound;7.5m.</p> \n<p>It is completely disingenuous for these self-interested entities, who have been the masters of their own decline, to point to the BBC’s website as the culprit.</p> \n<p>That said, the BBC needs to work in partnership with local media. It has earned a reputation for ripping off local newspaper stories without crediting them. That must stop – the BBC should link to any story it takes from local news outlets. </p> \n<p>It must hasten its rollout of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/nov/27/bbc-and-local-newspapers-are-moving-closer-togetherhttp://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/nov/27/bbc-and-local-newspapers-are-moving-closer-together\">Local Live pilots</a>, which aim to provide original stories, updates and take readers on to external media. The plan is to extend it across the country by mid-2016 and to include hyperlocals. But it must brought forward, otherwise the corporation risks being accused of doing too little too late.</p> \n<p>The BBC’s website has been at the forefront of many innovations later copied by other news groups. It is where people go for news they can trust. It would be a piece of monumental spite if the enemies and rivals of the corporation succeeded in killing or hobbling the BBC website.</p> \n<p><em>Michelle Stanistreet is general secretary of the National Union of Journalists</em></p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436884987383/f33f5eb7-f2e3-48a5-9c16-9ad778220e6b-1020x612.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Screengrab","altText":"BBC website: no real threat to local newspapers?","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Screengrab"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-15T07:00:02Z","lastModified":"2015-07-15T07:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":7,"contributors":[{"name":"Michelle Stanistreet","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/michelle-stanistreet"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["BBC","Regional & local newspapers","Newspapers","Newspapers & magazines","Digital media","Media"],"tags":[{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC"},{"id":"media/local-newspapers","webTitle":"Regional & local newspapers"},{"id":"media/newspapers","webTitle":"Newspapers"},{"id":"media/pressandpublishing","webTitle":"Newspapers & magazines"},{"id":"media/digital-media","webTitle":"Digital media"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"}],"section":{"id":"media"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Michelle Stanistreet","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/michelle-stanistreet"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"media"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","navigationButtonColour":"#ffffff","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/15/bbc-local-press-newspapers","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ajm8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/media/2015/jul/15/bbc-local-press-newspapers","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/15/bbc-local-press-newspapers"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436884987383/f33f5eb7-f2e3-48a5-9c16-9ad778220e6b-1020x612.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"BBC website: not to blame for the decline in local newspapers","credit":"Screengrab","altText":"BBC website: not to blame for the decline in local newspapers","cleanCaption":"BBC website: not to blame for the decline in local newspapers"}},"importance":4,"byline":{"title":"Michelle Stanistreet"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436884987383/f33f5eb7-f2e3-48a5-9c16-9ad778220e6b-1020x612.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Screengrab","altText":"BBC website: no real threat to local newspapers?","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Screengrab"}}]},{"title":"Owen Jones / The left must put Britain's EU withdrawal on the agenda","rawTitle":"The left must put Britain's EU withdrawal on the agenda","item":{"type":"comment","id":"commentisfree/2015/jul/14/left-reject-eu-greece-eurosceptic","title":"The left must put Britain's EU withdrawal on the agenda","trailText":"Progressives should be appalled by European Union’s ruination of Greece.

The more leftwing opponents of the EU come out, the more momentum will gather pace and gain critical mass. For <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2011/dec/13/left-right-challenge-eu\">those of us on the left who have always been critical of the EU</a>, it has felt like a lonely crusade. But left support for withdrawal – “Lexit”, if you like – is not new. If anything, this new wave of left Euroscepticism represents a reawakening. Much of the left campaigned against entering the European Economic Community when Margaret Thatcher and the like campaigned for membership.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It was German and French banks who benefited from the bailouts, not the Greek economy</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It would threaten the ability of leftwing governments to implement policies, people like my parents thought, and would forbid the sort of industrial activism needed to protect domestic industries. But then Thatcherism happened, and an increasingly battered and demoralised left began to believe that the only hope of progressive legislation was via Brussels. The misery of the left was, in the 1980s, matched by the triumphalism of the free marketeers, who had transformed Britain beyond many of their wildest ambitions, and began to balk at the restraints put on their dreams by the European project.</p> \n<p>The left’s pessimism about the possibility of implementing social reform at home without the help of the EU fused with a progressive vision of internationalism and unity, one that had emerged from the rubble of fascism and genocidal war. It is perhaps this feelgood halo that has been extinguished by a country the EU has driven into an economic collapse unseen since America’s great depression. It was German and French banks who recklessly lent to Greece that have benefited from bailouts, not the Greek economy. The destruction of Greece’s national sovereignty was achieved by economic strangulation, and treatment dealt out to Alexis Tsipras likened to “extensive mental waterboarding”. Slovakia’s deputy prime minister, Peter Kažim&iacute;r, may have deleted his tweet calling this modern-day Versailles “the results of their ‘Greek Spring’”, but he is right: this was all about crushing a rebellion.</p> \n<p>Ugly indeed. As the former European commission adviser <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/07/13/the-berlin-bulldozer-and-the-sack-of-athens-greece-eurozone/\">Philippe Legrain puts it</a>, “Germany is proving to be a calamitous hegemon,” overruling even France’s objections.</p> \n<p>The euro suits Germany, of course, as a weak euro is good for its exports and prevents poorer EU countries getting a competitive edge. But look at how the EU has operated. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/may/15/europeans-blackmailed-betrayed-angry-eurozone-germany\">It has driven elected governments – however unsavoury, like Silvio Berlusconi’s – from office</a>. Ireland and Portugal were also blackmailed.

Even more ominously, it would give large corporations the ability to sue elected governments to try to stop them introducing policies that supposedly hit their profit margins, whatever their democratic mandate. It would clear the way to not only expand the privatisation of our NHS, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/sep/14/ttip-deal-british-sovereignty-cameron-ukip-treaty\">but make it irreversible too</a>. Royal Mail may have been privatised by the Tories, but it was the EU that began the process by enforcing the <a href=\"http://postandparcel.info/59547/news/regulation/eu-postal-liberalisation-has-led-to-declining-services-increasing-prices/\">liberalisation</a> of the natural monopoly of postal services. Want to nationalise the railways?

Yet he depends on the left to campaign for and support his new package, which will be to stay in an increasingly pro-corporate EU shorn of pro-worker trappings. Can we honestly endorse that?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/07/greece-financial-elite-democracy-liassez-faire-neoliberalism\">Greece is the latest battleground in the financial elite’s war on democracy | George Monbiot</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Let’s just be honest about our fears. We fear that we will inadvertently line up with the xenophobes and the immigrant-bashing nationalists, and a “no” result will be seen as their vindication, unleashing a carnival of Ukippery. Hostility to the EU is seen as the preserve of the hard right, and not the sort of thing progressives should entertain. And that is why – if indeed much of the left decides on Lexit – it must run its own separate campaign and try and win ownership of the issue.</p> \n<p>Such a campaign would focus on building a new Britain, one of workers’ rights, a genuine living wage, public ownership, industrial activism and tax justice. Such a populist campaign could help the left reconnect with working-class communities it lost touch with long ago. My fear otherwise is a repetition of the Scottish referendum: but this time, instead of the progressive SNP as the beneficiaries, with Ukip mopping up in working-class communities as big businesses issue chilling threats about the risks of voting the wrong way. Without a prominent Left Out campaign, Ukip could displace Labour right across northern England. That would be the real vindication of Ukippery.</p> \n<p>Lexit may be seen as a betrayal of solidarity with the left in the EU: Syriza and Podemos in Spain are trying to change the institution, after all, not leave it. Syriza’s experience illustrates just how forlorn that cause is. But in any case, the threat of Brexit would help them. Germany has little incentive to change tack: it benefits enormously from the current arrangements. If its behaviour is seen to be causing the break-up of the EU, it will strengthen the hand of those opposing the status quo. The case for Lexit grows ever stronger, and – at the very least – more of us need to start dipping our toes in the water.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436901435667/David-Cameron-talks-with--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"David Cameron with Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel.

By reinforcing and promoting inclusive partnerships, they can “revolutionise” the multilateral system, making it stronger and more effective.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Jon Lom&oslash;y</em><em> is director of the </em><em><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/dac/directorofthedevelopmentco-operationdirectorate.htm\">OECD’s Development Co-operation Directorate</a></em><br /></li> \n</ul>","section":"Development","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436882428760/b65ab63a-173d-4111-bfc8-3e66ccbf649a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Russia's President Vladimir Putin (L), Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (3rd L), Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff (4th L), China's President Xi Jinping (6th L) and South Africa's President Jacob Zuma (R) walk after a welcome ceremony in Ufa on July 9, 2015 at the start of the 7th BRICS summit.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alexander Nemenov/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-15T06:00:04Z","lastModified":"2015-07-15T06:00:04Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":3,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Aid","Global development","China","India","Brazil","World news","United Arab Emirates","Saudi Arabia","Turkey","South Africa"],"tags":[{"id":"global-development/aid","webTitle":"Aid"},{"id":"global-development/global-development","webTitle":"Global development"},{"id":"world/china","webTitle":"China"},{"id":"world/india","webTitle":"India"},{"id":"world/brazil","webTitle":"Brazil"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/united-arab-emirates","webTitle":"United Arab Emirates"},{"id":"world/saudiarabia","webTitle":"Saudi Arabia"},{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey"},{"id":"world/southafrica","webTitle":"South Africa"}],"section":{"id":"global-development"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"global-development"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","navigationButtonColour":"#ffffff","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/jul/15/china-india-brazil-could-revolutionise-multilateral-aid","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4atph","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/global-development/2015/jul/15/china-india-brazil-could-revolutionise-multilateral-aid","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jul/15/china-india-brazil-could-revolutionise-multilateral-aid"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436882428760/b65ab63a-173d-4111-bfc8-3e66ccbf649a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Russia’s President Putin (left), Indian Prime Minister Modi (third left), Brazil’s President Rousseff (fourth left), China’s President Xi Jinping (sixth left) and South Africa’s President Zuma (right) at the start of the 7th BRICS summit, 9 July 2015.

Labour must strive to ensure this benefits everyone","byline":"Tom Watson","body":"<p>It’s safe to say that Hillary Clinton is no luddite. But the 2016 US presidential hopeful acknowledged this week that new technology is transforming the world of work and warned that we need to wake up to the consequences. She was right to do so.</p> \n<p>In a major speech on the economy, Clinton talked about the threat to middle-class jobs posed by the so-called “gig economy”. The internet has enabled <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/small-business-network/2015/apr/08/sharing-economy-startups-airbnb-business\" title=\"\">millions of people to make money by renting out a room</a> or using their own cars to become part-time minicab drivers. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sustainable-business/2015/jul/14/hillary-clinton-criticises-the-uber-business-model-for-exploiting-workers\" title=\"\">That, said Hillary, is</a> “creating exciting opportunities and unleashing innovation but it’s also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Technology will become as potent a force as globalisation in the coming decades</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The digital and technological revolution that created companies like Amazon and Facebook is making life easier, more entertaining and cheaper for many of us. But it also places secure jobs at risk and threatens to lay entire industries to waste. A Labour party whose founding mission was to make sure work pays needs to find its own answers to some of the hard questions Clinton identified.</p> \n<p>Ask any taxi driver, self-employed accountant or small hotelier and they will tell you the disruptive force of new technology is turning their world upside down. The arrival of Uber in the UK has reduced the cost of taxi fares for consumers, for example. But cabbies who are more heavily regulated in our cities see their incomes plummet as a result.</p> \n<p>Tourists and travellers pay less for accommodation by using <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/21/airbnb-uber-sharing-economy-dotcommunism-economy\" title=\"\">websites like Airbnb</a>; but hotels suffer – along with their employees – because they have to pay business taxes that Airbnb is exempt from. New accountancy software makes it easier for people to do their own finances (and enriches its inventors) but threatens the employment prospects of accountants – a white-collar profession traditionally regarded as one of the most secure.</p> \n<p>As someone who loves new technical innovation – whether it’s a new game, a new phone or new music service – I think we should do more to celebrate technical innovation in Britain. But we also need to ensure the wealth created by the digital revolution doesn’t produce a “winner takes all” economy in which a tiny number of dotcom billionaires displace millions of workers in formerly secure jobs. We need to protect the interests of professionals and blue-collar workers even as we seek to reap the rewards generated by the new digital economy.</p> \n<p>It is a difficult balance to strike. I don’t have all the answers. But I do know that technology will become as potent a force as globalisation in the coming decades. In fact, most economists already agree that it is technological change, rather than globalisation, that does most to explain wage stagnation and rising inequality in advanced democracies.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/21/airbnb-uber-sharing-economy-dotcommunism-economy\">Airbnb and Uber’s sharing economy is one route to dotcommunism</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It took Labour too long to acknowledge that many voters felt immigration, one of the defining features of globalisation, was the most important issue facing the country. It would be wrong to make the same mistake twice by underestimating the impact the digital revolution will have on wages and jobs.</p> \n<p>I am a huge enthusiast for new technology. I served as the country’s first digital minister under Gordon Brown. I even review video games for the New Statesman. Over time, technology could mean we all spend less on everything from the weekly shop to cars, clothing end energy. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/21/airbnb-uber-sharing-economy-dotcommunism-economy\" title=\"\">It will give millions of people the chance to do more creative and fulfilling work</a>. But the effect the digital revolution could have on middle-class jobs could be as dramatic as that experienced by the working classes in the industrial age, as machines began to take on the jobs they’d done for centuries.</p> \n<p>Reforming socialists have always believed change can be harnessed so that it produces better outcomes for everyone. So it is absolutely crucial that we continue to close the digital divide, so that all our workforce has the skills and training it needs so to claim a share of the enormous wealth the digital age is creating. It is too easy to pretend everyone has superfast broadband or a laptop. They don’t. We need to ensure everyone benefits – whether they’re from a country estate, or a council estate.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436902104211/London-black-cab-drivers--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"London black cab drivers protest over Uber.
