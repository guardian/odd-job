On that basis, Britain is truly degenerate. Just look at how it trashes its children and teenagers.</p> \n<p>Our young are the very people on whom the rest of us will one day come to depend – to care for us, and to earn the country’s income. Rather than mere lifestyle accessories, to be slotted in alongside handbags and cars, they represent our best hope. This human truth has sustained societies around the world and down the ages. Yet in austerity Britain, children have been chucked to the bottom of the pile. They have been robbed of their rightful benefits. And the support they could once draw upon – everything from Sure Start centres to youth clubs to mental-health workers – has been hacked back.</p> \n<p>Hyperbole? I really wish it were. Instead, I am merely repeating what professionals in field after field, from social care to mental health, are saying – and what the expert analysis shows.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/case/spcc/WP12_SUMMARY.pdf\">landmark study of the social effects of David Cameron’s austerity</a> was produced at the start of this year by a team of academics led by Professor John Hills at the London School of Economics. They found that the biggest victims of the spending cuts made since 2010 were children, and their parents: “Tax-benefit reforms hit families with children under five harder than any other household type. Those with a baby were especially affected.”</p> \n<p>None of this was accidental. Treasury officials stick each prospective change in tax and benefits under a Whitehall microscope – which is why so few budgets are an omnishambles. When making their cuts, Cameron and George Osborne would have known that children and babies would suffer most – and proceeded regardless. Remember that next time you catch some commentator talking with great gravitas but little policy detail about the new compassionate Conservatism.</p> \n<p>Two things stand out in Cameron’s assault on children: it is precisely the opposite of what he promised, and exactly the reverse of what he himself knows any prime minister should be doing.</p> \n<p>Before coming to office, the Conservative leader unveiled <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2009/jan/13/tories-debt\">a poster of a handsome tot</a>: “Dad’s nose, mum’s eyes, Gordon Brown’s debt.” The whole point of cuts was “because we believe children like this deserve better”. One parliament later, the Trussell Trust reports that more than a third of the one million food parcels it gave out last year were for children.</p> \n<p>The great irony is that Cameron understands the long-term damage inflicted on young people brought up in poverty. He and his lieutenants can quote you chapter and verse on the need for “early-years intervention”. They’ll point to the odd good deed, such as giving free part-time education for the most deprived two-year-olds. So far, they’ve been able to duck the flak on the damage they’ve done to children because the official statistics are more than two years out of date.</p> \n<p>That all changes at the end of next month, when we get the official figures on child poverty in the year from April 2013. That year saw the launch of the bedroom tax, the welfare cap and the holding down of child benefit and child tax credit below the rate of inflation. And it’s likely to show a huge surge in child poverty – the first of many that we’ll get for the rest of this parliament. The Institute for Fiscal Studies is predicting an 80s-style explosion in the number of children living in poverty by 2020 – and every other serious organisation I’ve come across agrees. And this will have happened under a prime minister who took leadership of his party proclaiming, “I believe that poverty is an economic waste, a moral disgrace.” And all of this will have been deliberate. Those children and their families have been plunged into poverty, and had their lifelines cut off not to pay back the deficit but to make the rich richer.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/wintour-and-watt/2013/jan/08/davidmiliband-edmiliband\">David Miliband said as much in 2013</a> when he attacked the coalition’s “rancid” plan to hold benefit rises below the rate of inflation, and observed that the same savings could be made simply by not giving tax relief on millionaires’ pension savings. In its summary of the harm caused by the government’s austerity programme, <a href=\"http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/case/spcc/rr04.pdf\">the LSE team judged</a>: “Almost all of the savings achieved by cutting benefits were offset by gains for richer groups.” Because the poor must always pay for the rich.</p> \n<p>Look at the Cameron-Osborne economic model and the society it gives rise to. In their system, the past – as represented by the elderly and the asset owners – is prized more than the future. And growth becomes meaningless – because what is the point of growth if it doesn’t give young people a stake in the system?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/may/25/no-more-cuts-to-adventure-playgrounds-and-youth-centres-we-will-defend-them\">No more cuts to adventure playgrounds and youth centres – we will defend them | Letter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Plenty of experts have good suggestions for turning this around. The Child Poverty Action Group rightly calls for the introduction of a triple lock on child benefit and tax credit – just as pensioners enjoy. Little of that will be heeded by this lot. Meanwhile, more and more services for the young will be whittled back to almost nothing. Just in time for half term, youth workers in London tomorrow <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/may/25/no-more-cuts-to-adventure-playgrounds-and-youth-centres-we-will-defend-them\">launch a campaign to save playgrounds and youth clubs from closure</a>. Good for them, but they have a hell of a battle ahead, as local councils up and down the country are forced by Westminster into another five years of budget-slashing. Warwickshire more than halved its youth services in one year; Carlisle has <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2581455/How-council-kept-bill-playgrounds-spent-10k-closing-them.html\">closed 21 playgrounds</a>. When a rich country can no longer be bothered to provide play spaces for its kids, you have to ask what the point of all that wealth is.</p> \n<p>Although of course, there will always be playgrounds and school trips for the wealthy. In Battersea, the Conservative council shut down a supervised children’s adventure playground, only to reopen an unstaffed public space and hand over the other half to a private company called Go Ape offering treetop adventures. “I suspect it will be the first thing that many children ask to do when they’re thinking about how to celebrate their birthdays,” is how one local councillor sells the idea. Go Ape typically charges about &pound;25 per child ticket.</p> \n<p>Within a generation, Britain will have bred a large wave of children who have been deprived of decent meals and housing. As a result they will come out of school with fewer qualifications. They will take up worse jobs and suffer health problems – thus depriving the Treasury of tax revenues and costing the NHS more. We are breeding a demographic disaster. And we won’t be able to say we weren’t warned.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432575258229/Matt-Kenyon-illustration--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Cameron-Osborne economic model favours current asset owners and is prized more than the future Illustration: Matt Kenyon","credit":"Matt Kenyon","altText":"Matt Kenyon illustration to go with Aditya Chakrabortty piece on child poverty","cleanCaption":"The Cameron-Osborne economic model favours current asset owners and is prized more than the future Illustration: Matt Kenyon"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-25T18:48:42Z","lastModified":"2015-05-25T23:00:40Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1425,"contributors":[{"name":"Aditya Chakrabortty","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/24/1411565194870/Aditya-Chakrabortty-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/adityachakrabortty"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Social mobility","David Cameron","Politics","UK news","Society","Conservatives","Child benefit","Communities","Children","Benefits","Child rights","Social care"],"tags":[{"id":"society/socialmobility","webTitle":"Social mobility"},{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"society/child-benefit","webTitle":"Child benefit"},{"id":"society/communities","webTitle":"Communities"},{"id":"society/children","webTitle":"Children"},{"id":"society/benefits","webTitle":"Benefits"},{"id":"society/child-rights","webTitle":"Child rights"},{"id":"society/social-care","webTitle":"Social care"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Aditya Chakrabortty","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/adityachakrabortty"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/25/children-austerity-david-cameron-cuts-young-people","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/497zc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/may/25/children-austerity-david-cameron-cuts-young-people","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/25/children-austerity-david-cameron-cuts-young-people"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432575258229/Matt-Kenyon-illustration--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘The biggest victims of the spending cuts made since 2010 were children, and their parents.’ Illustration: Matt Kenyon","credit":"Matt Kenyon","altText":"Matt Kenyon illustration to go with Aditya Chakrabortty piece on child poverty","cleanCaption":"‘The biggest victims of the spending cuts made since 2010 were children, and their parents.’ Illustration: Matt Kenyon"}},"importance":7,"byline":{"title":"Aditya Chakrabortty"},"showQuotedHeadline":true},{"title":"Why are TV writers fawning over royalty?","rawTitle":"Why are TV writers fawning over royalty?","item":{"type":"comment","id":"commentisfree/2015/may/26/tv-writers-fawning-royalty-dramas-monarchs","title":"Why are TV writers fawning over royalty?","trailText":"A slew of upcoming dramas on monarchs past and present all steer clear of controversy and complexity","standFirst":"A slew of upcoming dramas on monarchs past and present all steer clear of controversy and complexity","byline":"Mark Lawson","body":"<p>By tradition, the British royal family is guaranteed 15 minutes of TV exposure each year through the monarch’s Christmas Day address. However, the Windsors and their Germanic ancestors are currently establishing a much more impressive broadcasting empire.</p> \n<p>ITV has just announced an eight-part drama series about <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32781964\" title=\"\">Queen Victoria</a>, while Netflix is making <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2014/nov/13/netflix-crown-drama-buckingham-palace\" title=\"\">The Crown</a>, which, if successful, may stretch to 70 hours of television, dedicating one season to each decade of Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II’s reign. Though created separately, these series may be part of the same zeitgeist, as by the time they appear next year, the modern protagonist should have replaced the historical one as Britain’s longest-serving ruler.</p> \n<p>Although seemingly intensifying, British TV’s fever for royal fiction is longstanding. The Crown comes only six years after Channel 4’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/gallery/2009/nov/20/television-queen\" title=\"\">The Queen</a>, in which five actresses played the current monarch at different ages. And, looking back into the TV archive, every UK head of state since Victoria has been the subject of at least one major TV drama. In the 70s, ITV peak time featured Edward&nbsp;VII, rapidly followed by the next brief bearer of that regal name in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/gallery/2009/nov/20/television-queen\" title=\"\">Edward &amp; Mrs Simpson</a>. More distant relatives, Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, have had almost as many shows as Clare Balding. The serial-marrying Henry can expect to be a strong contender at next year’s Baftas for the BBC’s Wolf Hall, one of several recent series featuring the Tudors.</p> \n<p>The forthcoming dramas about Victoria and Elizabeth II are partly an offshoot of televisual Tudor-mania, focusing on two of the very few royals who rival the founder of the Church of England for name recognition and biographical&nbsp;incident. Such franchises also satisfy a more general appetite for depictions of the operation of dynastic power. The success of the TV mega-hit Game of Thrones will not have been harmed by that resonant third word.</p> \n<p>Victoria seems most likely to be shown in the Sunday night slot currently owned by Downton Abbey, and another advantage of royal dramas is that they fulfil the apparently high demand for costume drama about posh people.ITV has billed Victoria as the story of “the first woman to have it all”, even if someone who spent 40 years in mourning for her husband might be seen as a questionable feminist role model. It must be hoped that both Victoria and The Crown will not merely be glossy adverts for the constancy of constitutional monarchy, because our TV has an ominous history, when dealing with wearers of the crown or those close to them, of breaking the usual dramatic rule that bad behaviour is more interesting than goodness.</p> \n<p>After 500 years, the statute of sycophantic limitations is up on <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2009/feb/04/henry-viii-leader\" title=\"\">Henry VIII</a>, but with more recent branches of the family tree, television drama tends towards conservatism and reverence. The main UK networks, for example, have refrained from dramatising the life of Diana, the Princess of Wales, even though her story has become as significant a myth in British culture as the Kennedy assassinations have in America. Yet, although US and German productions have told the Diana story, the closest that TV here has so far felt able to go was When She Died,<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2002/mar/03/monarchy.johnarlidge\" title=\"\"> Jonathan Dove’s 2002 opera</a> for Channel 4. Such discretion may result from understandable sensitivity towards the princess’s sons, but it is hard to imagine broadcasters observing this self-denying ordinance if Diana had been a politician&nbsp;or movie star.</p> \n<p>Revealingly, it was also Channel 4 – the only major British network that doesn’t screen the Queen’s speech – that made The Queen’s Sister, a relatively frank biopic about the troubled life of Princess Margaret. The network’s E4 channel also screens here the American comedy, The Royals, in which Liz Hurley plays a character so far from reality – a young Queen of England ruling now – as&nbsp;to be harmless.</p> \n<p>Yet Princes Philip, Andrew and Edward – real royals of interesting complexities and controversies – have escaped dramatisation in a way that would surely not have been the case if they had achieved equal fame in another field. Royalty is a fascinating subject on which the industry remains too much a subject of the crown. Strikingly, it was left to theatre to imagine the reign of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2014/apr/11/king-charles-3-flawed-premise-royally-entertaining\" title=\"\">King Charles III</a>, in Mike Bartlett’s brilliant mock-Shakespearean what-if, and the BBC seems unlikely to be fighting for the TV rights.</p> \n<p>Apart from When She Died, the only Windsor fictions that might not actually have been commissioned by the Buckingham Palace PR team are <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2011/nov/04/your-next-box-set-edward-and-mrs-simpson\" title=\"\">Edward &amp; Mrs Simpson</a> – a brave retelling of the abdication crisis at a time when leading players remained alive – and Stephen Poliakoff’s magnificent BBC piece <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2003/jan/16/broadcasting.arts\" title=\"\">The Lost Prince</a>, which explored the neglect of the sickly young son of George V.</p> \n<p>One royal TV show not yet seen in the UK, although showing in Ireland, is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_%28TV_series%29\" title=\"\">Reign</a>, an American romp about the years that Mary, Queen of Scots spent in exile in France. At a time of escalating uncertainty about how long the House of Windsor might rule over the Scots, a series about Mary and Elizabeth I would be a really interesting commission. Televisual history, though, suggests that producers and audiences will be happier with the monarchistically positive stories of Victoria, and the second Elizabeth.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432565487424/Damian-Lewis-as-Henry-VII-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'After 500 years, the statute of sycophantic limitations is up on Henry VIII.'

Same secretary of state, same ministers and nothing so far to indicate that it won’t be the same agenda. Nicky Morgan may surprise us now that she can move on from just “not being Michael Gove”, and the absence of David Laws will be noticed. His was a voice of reason and I’ve no doubt that he protected education from some frightening outcomes in the last regime.</p> \n<p>Of course, the Labour party is also back to where it was before the election. Starting the process of soul searching is never easy. But this time we need a different approach from 2010. Labour can afford to be more objective about the record of the last Labour education team, and it has the space and time for medium- and long-term thinking.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It’s time to face up to the unintended consequences of the accountability framework. Labour should take the lead</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It’s worth remembering that the ideas it eventually puts forward for universities will have an impact not only on people now in secondary and primary school, but also on those not yet born. So good advice might be: revisit some of the big questions that too often go unchallenged and make these the basis of a new approach. I suggest three key themes that Labour could address.</p> \n<p>First, rethink the relationship between politics and education. Some would like to take politics out of education completely: that’s neither possible nor desirable. But the boundary between the two is certainly in the wrong place. Every school reform of the last 30 years has extended the influence of politicians further into the classroom and blurred the boundary between them&nbsp;and the education profession. Perhaps the most striking example is the manifesto pledges on the type of phonics teachers should use and how children should be grouped in classrooms.</p> \n<p>Politicians have a responsibility to make sure education standards improve but that shouldn’t include telling teachers how to teach. The role politics plays and what is the proper preserve of teachers needs to be made clear – Labour could do this.</p> \n<p>Second, set out how education policy and practice can become evidence-based. This revolution has already started. Teachers are thirsty for knowledge of what works and there are some promising partnerships between researchers and practitioners. However, it needs someone to articulate the argument, lead the debate and do some serious thinking about what needs to change if evidence rather than intuition – and prejudice – is to underpin the decisions we make.</p> \n<p>Third, rebuild the relationship between politicians and the education profession. No one can question the need to act when teachers, heads, or schools fail children, or deny the importance of constantly demanding higher ambition and standards. Most teachers share this view, but successive governments have managed to make enemies of the profession when they should be allies in this task.</p> \n<p>Some examples of where a change of approach would reap rewards: understanding the complexity and time-scale of turning round failing schools; acknowledging progress in schools even if that does mean political opponents can bask in reflected glory; explaining that floor targets are raised because schools have achieved the previous ones – not because governments are getting tougher; showing the value the nation places on teachers by investing more in their professional development.</p> \n<p>Most of all, the school accountability system needs a thorough review – not to make it weaker but so that it reflects the changes in schools as we move to a school-led system where the quality of partnerships is crucial to success. It’s also time to face up to the unintended consequences of the present accountability framework. We’ve side-stepped them for far too long. Looking afresh at how we do this would be a sign of political strength, not weakness, and Labour should take the lead.</p> \n<p>Education was largely absent from the general election; there was little to inspire, engage or excite in any of the manifestos. Labour will need to be a strong and effective opposition but it must resist being captured by the inevitable need to deal with the present, and find space to develop its thoughts about what education might look like at the start of the third decade of this century.</p>","section":"Education","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Education/Pix/columnists/2015/5/22/1432294057216/Tristram-Hunt-shadow-educ-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tristram Hunt, shadow education secretary.

More than five miles of pristine&nbsp;coastline were being lost each year – to caravan parks, oil refineries and nuclear power stations. The wild coastline that remained was usually fenced off or overgrown.</p> \n<p>Strolling the <a href=\"http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/\" title=\"\">south-west coast path</a>, or the new 870-mile <a href=\"http://www.walescoastpath.gov.uk/?lang=en\" title=\"\">Wales coast path</a> today, it is easy to forget the amazing efforts to prevent unspoilt cliffs and coves resembling the high-rise tourist traps of the Mediterranean or the suburban sprawl of much of the Sussex coast. Social and economic trends have helped – the decline of the domestic seaside holiday with the rise of cheap flights reduced pressure on the British seaside – but, mostly, the coast has been protected by local action and charity.</p> \n<p>In 1965, the National Trust launched <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/what-we-do/what-we-protect/coast-and-countryside/neptune-coastline-campaign/\" title=\"\">Enterprise Neptune</a>, a fundraising campaign to save the seaside from development. It caught the popular imagination of the day – even featuring on The Archers – and has continued, quietly, to protect the coast. Supported by local residents and small donations from people who often live as far away as possible from the sea (only 70 miles, in our uniquely coastal nation), the National Trust has become Britain’s biggest coastal landowner, safeguarding more than 775 miles of the coast of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. (The National Trust for Scotland is a separate&nbsp;organisation.)</p> \n<p>For all its associations with stately homes, the National Trust grew out of the Victorian movement to protect the commons of London. The seaside is now a contemporary commons – freely accessible and preserved for everyone, for ever. Many of these miles are as beautiful as might be expected – a third of the Cornish coast is owned by the Trust – but many are less celebrated: the charity helped rehabilitate Durham’s coal-wrecked coastline and has taken on badly contaminated military sites such as <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/orford-ness/\" title=\"\">Orford Ness</a> in Suffolk, allowing its cold war ruins to gently decay rather than tidying them up.</p> \n<p>The Trust has not single-handedly saved the coast. Other charities, including the Wildlife Trusts and the RSPB have also acquired many important estuaries and marshes. Tighter planning regulations, and government-led initiatives such as national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty have helped hugely.</p> \n<p>But it is striking how much has been achieved by the big society, to use language calibrated to attract this government’s attention. And attracting the attention of David Cameron’s administration will be important because the coast will change perhaps more dramatically than ever in the coming century.</p> \n<p>While the battle against intrusive coastal housing has largely been won, marine conservation is still in its infancy. Our hunger for energy will see empty horizons filled with offshore wind farms, new nuclear power stations and tidal barrages. Tidal could provide positive opportunities to reshape our coast in a way that augments wildlife and recreation but other developments will industrialise once wild landscapes.</p> \n<p>Climate change, rising seas and increasingly fierce storms also threaten to redraw the coastline and throw at least 7,000 homes into the sea this century. Because British governments still cling to an archaic law which absolves them of ever compensating people who lose homes to the waves, this erosion could accelerate the decline of coastal communities impoverished by the loss of fishing and domestic tourism.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Open space by the sea brings health benefits, solace, artistic inspiration and exhilaration to every generation</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>There are no easy answers to these big&nbsp;questions but a simple footpath could help. In announcing its acquisition&nbsp;on the Great Orme, the National Trust signalled its determination to hold the government to its commitment to create <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/england-coast-path-improving-public-access-to-the-coast\" title=\"\">a coast path for England by 2020</a>. Conservationists fear this will become another promise broken by austerity, but the government would be foolish to abandon such a popular policy. A coast path is a far more inspiring piece of infrastructure than HS2, with real economic heft: the <a href=\"http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/\" title=\"\">south-west coast path</a> generates <a href=\"http://www.southwestcoastpath.com/media/uploads/devoncc-14005_swcp_final_report_spreads.pdf\" title=\"\">&pound;436m for the&nbsp;regional economy</a> each year, supporting 10,000 jobs.</p> \n<p>A pathway around England is far more than an economic prop, however. The Trust’s former director-general, Fiona Reynolds, recently argued that it could be the first step in the creation of a new coastal zone, a kind of decentralised national park in which local people have a real say in how their coast is developed and cared for. As well as a footpath, a government with real vision could create a coastal national park which harnessed the economic regeneration of impoverished areas with environmental protection, recreation and a sensible discussion of how best to adapt to rising seas.</p> \n<p>I can’t think of many finer legacies for any politician. Perhaps the National Trust could be more radical too, and use Neptune funds to preserve more unusual coastal treasures – how about preserving a pier or some of the unique, threatened plotlands coast such as Jaywick Sands?</p> \n<p>Open space by the sea brings immeasurable health benefits, solace, artistic inspiration and exhilaration to every generation. We must summon every piece of our passion for the coast in the coming century to maintain this rich resource for everybody.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f74ff0d496fd2551063754b948f92686bc89e81c/0_0_5120_3073/5120.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3073,"width":5120,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"The Great Orme headland in north Wales","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-25T16:56:14Z","lastModified":"2015-05-25T23:01:08Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":126,"contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Barkham","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/27/1422359699578/Patrick-Barkham-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patrickbarkham"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Coastlines","The National Trust","Conservation","Environment","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"environment/coastlines","webTitle":"Coastlines"},{"id":"uk/national-trust","webTitle":"The National Trust"},{"id":"environment/conservation","webTitle":"Conservation"},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Patrick Barkham","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/patrickbarkham"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/25/hs2-renewal-coastline-coastal-pathway","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/497mn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/may/25/hs2-renewal-coastline-coastal-pathway","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/25/hs2-renewal-coastline-coastal-pathway"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f74ff0d496fd2551063754b948f92686bc89e81c/0_0_5120_3073/5120.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3073,"width":5120,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The National Trust has acquired a 140-acre farm on the Great Orme headland in north Wales.

But they can also be uncomfortably revealing, and one of the media tycoon’s latest postings to Instagram has a doleful air that is strikingly at odds with the others.</p> \n<p>In one image, a wonky camera angle relegates the great man to a corner of the frame where he sits at a table resting his chin on his hand on a Saturday night watching … <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/3Cq1rqtQNt/?taken-by=silvioberlusconi2015\" title=\"\">the Eurovision song contest</a> on the telly.

On the table, there are some half-drunk glasses of wine. But you sense a cup of Ovaltine would not look out of place.</p> \n<p>If, over the past few years, the 78-year-old former prime minister has lost momentum, then so too has his party. Currently, Forza Italia is polling on average less than 12%. Renzi’s Democratic party (PD) is averaging more than three times that figure. Yet at the last general election in 2013 – bunga bunga and the economic crisis not withstanding – Forza Italia’s precursor party won 22% of the vote. And in 2008 it stormed back to power with 37%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Silvio Berlusconi on Instagram watching Eurovision\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned=&quot;&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; \n  &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; \n   &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt; \n  &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/3Cq1rqtQNt/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;#forzaitalia #escita #ilvolo #eurovision @ilvolomusic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n  &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Silvio Berlusconi (@silvioberlusconi2015) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2015-05-23T22:46:31+00:00&quot;&gt;May 23, 2015 at 3:46pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>As the leader of a movement with an ever-shrinking consensus, Berlusconi is becoming the Nick Clegg of Italian politics, and for a not dissimilar reason.

The BBC’s new docu-drama series, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/may/25/armada-12-days-save-england-demolition-tv-review\" title=\"\">Armada, opened last night</a> with visual reenactments of all the hoary tropes of Elizabethan storytelling: a beleaguered isle, led by a vacillating queen; plucky English sailors knocking together a flotilla from the few planks of driftwood and some Vaseline; wordless, faceless Spaniards, bearing down with dark crucifixes upon their captives as instruments of torture.</p> \n<p>Presiding over all of this – though she never seemed to do much – was a figure few Elizabethans would have recognised. Streaked with white and red makeup, Anita Dobson resembled nothing so much as Heath Ledger’s Joker, or perhaps his copycat grandmother. This was what we’d been led to expect – Dobson, starring in the reconstructions, had been trailed as the mature foil to youthful presenter Dan Snow, who steered the documentary segments; much of Armada’s pre-publicity consisted of Dobson granting “exclusive” insights into the four hours she’d spent in makeup each day, layering on wrinkles, “leather-spots” and blackened teeth.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Why does Elizabeth’s pancake-face still haunt us, her aged body the focus of our horror?</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Fair enough – if I were a youthful-looking 66-year-old, like Dobson, I’d want to stress that uglification on screen was purely prosthetic. But Armada was obsessed with Elizabeth’s ageing body. From its first (counterfactual) scene of a shivering, balding Elizabeth thrust into a cell by Spanish victors, with but a blanket to warm her, Elizabeth was either putting on her wig or taking it off. You’d have little idea that in 1588, Elizabeth was but 54 and at the height of her powers – only 7 years after ending her last major courtship.</p> \n<p>Yet here too, Armada was following a well-trodden path. Ever since Sarah Bernhardt brought her limp to the first appearance of Elizabeth on screen in 1912, on a leg that would later be amputated, every film about Elizabeth has based its publicity campaign on the premise that an actor has suffered a deep degradation of the body (Flora Robson donned a fake nose, Bette Davis shaved her head). The price of success is to become undesirable, for actors as for the queen herself.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/gallery/2015/feb/03/elizabeth-i-in-tv-and-film-from-bernhardt-to-blanchett\" title=\"\">Glenda Jackson and Cate Blanchett</a>, perhaps the most accurate interpreters of Elizabeth’s character, started their series looking like nymphs, then ended, once their character had given up on all hope of a man, powerful but alone, caked in white oils, the harridan-harpy. Scholars have long discredited the myth that Elizabeth spent her life encased in lead-white makeup, and, contra Dobson, she survived smallpox without marks. So why does Elizabeth’s pancake-face still haunt us, her aged body the focus of our horror? The most powerful woman in our history remains, on our screens, the epitome of the female grotesque.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd038e5f3e9c9167f1a4d54f7c76014bd5da6210\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432571097921/eb8203b9-2b51-4d33-8164-41e413d5b4e1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bette Davis in a still from the film The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bette Davis in a still from the film The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Warner Bros</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And grotesque is the word. We’ve always been fascinated by aged bodies, particularly bodies, like those of Falstaff, Mr Burns, even Jimmy Savile, which seem to maintain charisma even as they repel us. Mikhail Bakhtin, in his landmark study of the French poet Rabelais, describes the grotesque as an aesthetic which constantly confronts us with the primary needs of the body – the body as an instrument for eating, drinking, urinating, defecating, reproducing at the most animal of levels. Elizabeth the grotesque is the old queen who still needs to shit, and, like a shiny barnacle, is encrusting herself with jewels to try to forget it. No wonder Flora Robson was ordered by her handlers to hint in interviews at the difficulty of going to the bathroom in her tightly sewn costumes, when filming Fire Over England in 1937. Then, as now, scatology sells.</p> \n<p>Elizabeth’s childlessness adds to her grotesquerie. She remains an image of sterility, just as she would become to the dissident poets and frustrated young men who peppered her court in the dying days of her reign, the Earl of Essex most prominent among them (the famous scene in which he did, indeed, discover she wore a wig occurred in 1599, over a decade after the Armada).</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/jul/30/decay-women-men-finding-out\">The decay of women is obsessively charted.

You could have called this show Toys for Boys – Snow went to visit a blast furnace, to get excited about cast iron cannon balls, while Elizabeth was depicted taking refuge at Richmond Palace, threatening her pet monkey with the Tower and channelling Queenie in Blackadder, complete with an even-more-aged Nursie.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, a bunch of male historians was asked to demonstrate the fleet’s formation using models, while a group of female historians – many of them excellent scholars – was asked almost exclusively about Elizabeth’s hair and makeup routine.</p> \n<p>There was plenty to admire about Snow’s vision of English history: the Armada was indeed defeated by English seamanship – and a spot of bad weather – and it was a delight to see a true sailor paying tribute to all-too-forgotten traditions. But this remained a documentary about an ageing woman’s body. We’re still frightened of being led by older women – if we can’t deny their political power, we’ll deny their erotic power instead.</p> \n<p>Just look at Silvio Berlusconi, allegedly lashing out at Angela Merkel <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/europes-berlusconi-problem\" title=\"\">by calling her an “unfuckable lardass”</a> when forced to confront the fact she had the survival of his nation’s economy in her hand. During Hillary Clinton’s last run for the US presidency, a run of Hillary nut-crackers – pun intended – sold out several times over. We can’t castrate our powerful women, even when we’re anxious they’re castrating us. So we make them grotesque instead.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432569973130/Anita-Dobson-as-Queen-Eli-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Streaked with white and red makeup, Anita Dobson resembled nothing so much as Heath Ledger’s Joker.'
