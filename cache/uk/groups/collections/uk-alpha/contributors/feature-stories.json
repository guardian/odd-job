Here’s an idea: stop trying to fix the world with high explosives","byline":"Frankie Boyle","body":"<p>I suppose that whether this article prompted by the Charleston shootings feels topical enough will depend on whether America has another mass shooting before it goes to print. If you’re in the US, there’s a fair chance it will seem dated because you are actually being gunned down as you read it, so I’ll try to get straight to the point. It’s surely worth wondering whether it’s time to retire the flag that has for so long been a rallying point for racists and murderers, the stars and stripes. There’s a genuine question to be asked here: what responsibility does the US state bear for the Charleston shootings when racist murder seems to be part of its policing strategy and most of its foreign policy?</p> \n<p>Occasionally I wonder whether at some point in the past 100 years the US gave the rest of the world a safe word and we’ve simply forgotten it. Or maybe we’re just saying it wrong (Aluminium? I’m sure you said it was aluminium ...) Hillary Clinton has been speaking out against <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/23/hillary-clinton-charleston-shooting-racist-terrorism-ferguson\" title=\"\">the “racist terrorism” of Dylann Roof</a> despite being the architect of the US military intervention in Libya. The US’s record of invasions, assassinations and government overthrows is racist, I think. Imagining that you can kill people and seize control of their resources without believing them to be inferior requires a certain amount of intellectual flexibility. The same sort of intellectual flexibility that allows people to express grief for the migrants who drown in the Mediterranean and hatred for the ones who survive.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/29/confederate-flag-pride-flag-fix-racism\">To replace the Confederate flag with a Pride flag won't fix American racism | Linda Chavers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Part of the American mindset comes from the fact that the US was formed through the racist murder of indigenous people. The reason that whole country is such a horror story is that the entire thing is built on an Old Indian Graveyard. I worry that perhaps white America wants to believe that its racial fault lines only run as deep as the Confederate flag. Hence the current uproar at names of southern civil-war generals being on street signs while the faces of slave owners are still on the currency.</p> \n<p>Of course not everybody gets behind the US’s view of itself, which is why it is the world’s largest producer of propaganda. Last year’s biggest movie, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/american-sniper\" title=\"\">American Sniper</a>, was billed as the story of the US army’s deadliest soldier, which must have felt pretty galling for the guy who dropped the bomb on Hiroshima. It was basically Star Wars from the point of view of one of the stormtroopers, and the director (Clint Eastwood – I’m not even joking) encouraged us to get behind the idea that you should take moral decisions when women and children are in your crosshairs, rather than long, long before. You got the feeling that the clunky scene explaining that sniper Chris Kyle’s unit painted skulls on their gear as a tribute to the Punisher was necessary in case viewers made the more logical supposition that it was a tribute to the Waffen-SS.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/29/hundreds-honour-charleston-church-shooting-victim-myra-thompson\">Hundreds honour Charleston church shooting victim Myra Thompson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There are many indicators of advanced civilisations, but unthinking hero worship of the military isn’t one of them. The US, like the UK, has been forced to move away from a conscription army and now has a mercenary army. It’s the reason you don’t get war poets any more.</p> \n<p>Indeed, before Britain feels too superior, we should perhaps remember that Roof’s main problem here would have been feeling torn between quite a few of the main parties at the last election. We live in a country where posting “Let’s riot or something bruv!” on Facebook will get you a couple of years in prison, while writing a column saying we should bomb Syria is practically an entrance exam for public intellectuals. Of course, it’s never phrased as a plea to kill shepherds in pursuit of our geopolitical interests. By the time it hits the broadsheets, it’s a plea to arm moderate rebels (they’ve got a moderate vision of the country’s future and they’re going to kill until they get it!). It’s a humanitarian intervention. We’re not fighting wars for control of resources. We’re not the aggressor in countries such as Iraq, we’re actually defending Iraq. From the Iraqis. The most obvious anti-war argument that none of this has ever worked just doesn’t seem to come up.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/28/gun-control-wont-prevent-another-charleston-style-shooting-says-jeb-bush\">Gun control won't prevent another Charleston-style shooting, says Jeb Bush</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Of course our governments are just trying to protect us from terror. In the same way that someone banging a hornets’ nest with a stick is trying to protect us from hornets. Maybe I’ll even give them the benefit of the doubt and concede that they are just naive do-gooders trying to bring the world peace and stability through the medium of high explosives. What gets me is that the new dirty word in the west is “radicalisation”, as if radical change wasn’t obviously needed; as if the status quo has any decency, or is even survivable. It’s not actually difficult to see solutions to the US’s problems: children can do it, until we educate them out of it. Internationally, I propose the radical step of not trying to solve complex political problems with 1,000lb bombs; domestically, I propose they start addressing inequality by paying reparations for slavery. I’m well aware that in a society where war and discrimination are now almost entirely normalised, both options sound like madness.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435669504240/Celebrated-for-killing-do-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Celebrated for killing dozens of Iraqis … Bradley Cooper as Chris Kyle in American Sniper.

(It’s hard to&nbsp;tell which comes first as the ownership of many estates has been kept secret.) One estimate suggests that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/dec/03/landowners-scotland-britain-feudal-highland-spring\" title=\"\">432 people own half the country’s private rural land</a>.

That’s all. Not exactly prison camps and mass murder.</p> \n<p>To his credit – unlike columnists in the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/11314336/England-must-be-resolute-and-save-the-Scots-from-self-destruction.html\" title=\"\">Telegraph</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2943915/The-Tartan-Stalinists-Forced-sales-country-estates-Snooping-state-guardians-child-Contempt-wealthy-Britain-Fantasy-No-s-stark-reality-SNP-landslide.html\" title=\"\">Mail</a> – David Cameron’s stepfather-in-law, Lord Astor, managed to write an entire article for the Spectator without once mentioning Hitler or Stalin. Instead he described Scotland’s proposals as “<a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9534022/should-we-fear-a-mugabe-style-land-grab-in-rural-scotland/\" title=\"\">a Mugabe-style landgrab</a>”.

While there are new opportunities for families and communities, there is no designation of land for the nation as a whole. There is also little that will alter the ownership pattern where it is most extreme: in the rocky Highland cores, which are likely to be unsuitable for community buyouts. As the Scottish minister Aileen McLeod concedes, “<a href=\"https://www.holyrood.com/articles/comment/land-reform-about-more-just-ownership\" title=\"\">community ownership may not be appropriate for all land: it’s not a panacea</a>”. But perhaps there’s a way in which both issues could be addressed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/25/scottish-land-reform-bill\">Scottish land reform is on the agenda.

Is there a more powerful sign of intent to make this a nation for all its people, or a better way of restoring income and employment in places where there is little of either?</p> \n<p>With the possible exception of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairngorms\" title=\"\">western side of the Cairngorms</a>, there are no national parks in Britain that meet the <a href=\"http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/gpap_home/gpap_quality/gpap_pacategories/gpap_pacategory2/\" title=\"\">international definition</a>: places protected mainly for their wildlife and habitats. When the <a href=\"http://www.iucn.org/\" title=\"\">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> sought to classify Britain’s national parks, of which there are 15, it had to <a href=\"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=314306\" title=\"\">invent a new category</a>. Ours are neither owned by the nation nor set aside for nature. They are, strictly speaking, neither national nor parks.</p> \n<p>There are good reasons for this and bad ones. When the parks were designated, many people were living within their boundaries. It’s essential that they can make a living and keep their communities alive. (Unfortunately the industries covering most of the land offer neither possibility: though lavishly subsidised, they still bleed jobs and money.) But on the rare occasions when the private owners are not wrecking the land with sheep, overstocked deer and scorched-earth grouse shoots, the park authorities step in to finish the job.</p> \n<p>A representative of the Exmoor National Park Authority recently told me: “We don’t do enough burning on Exmoor.” “Why do you want to burn the land?” I asked. “To keep the heather looking nice.” The authority’s website offered the following justification for this annual act of vandalism: it provides “<a href=\"http://www.exmoor-nationalpark.gov.uk/living-and-working/info-for-farmers-and-land-managers/swaling\" title=\"\">habitats for wildlife</a>”. For the tiny proportion that can survive such treatment, perhaps, but not for the great majority of species that could live there.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I propose a national parks agency that would own land, and invites enlightened owners to donate their estates</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>With a few exceptions the ecological management of our existing national parks is irrational, anally retentive and scientifically illiterate. They remain subject to a 19th-century worldview in which the natural world is seen as a garden to be pruned and trimmed rather than as a thriving, living system in which we could escape from the management and control that surrounds&nbsp;us everywhere else.</p> \n<p>Scotland, thanks in part to its dismal&nbsp;feudal legacy, has only two national parks, and <a href=\"http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/learningabout/whatisanationalpark/factsandfigures\" title=\"\">less land designated</a>&nbsp;than in the other parts of Britain – 7%, while England has 9% and Wales 20%. Is it not time to augment those with new parks, with a different philosophy, whose purpose is to mark the recovery of the nation?</p> \n<p>Hidden behind the Astorian dinosaurs, I’ve recently met a number of Scottish estate owners who appear to have accepted the public mood for change: what’s missing is a vehicle that allows them to alter their relationship with the country. What I propose is that the Scottish government sets up a national parks agency that would own land and invite enlightened owners to donate their estates. Their act of generosity would be recognised in perpetuity: no other legacy would last like this. I believe, surprising as this sounds, that quite a few would come forward.</p> \n<p>There are good examples elsewhere, such as the land in Wyoming bought by John D Rockefeller Jr and bequeathed to the nation as the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/grte/index.htm\" title=\"\">Grand Teton</a> national park, and the extraordinary programme of <a href=\"http://www.tompkinsconservation.org/park_creation.htm\" title=\"\">park creation in Chile and Argentina</a> by the clothing magnates Kris and Doug Tompkins, and the network of wealthy people they have recruited.</p> \n<p>Where Scotland’s deer stalking and grouse shooting provide possibly the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/mar/02/deer-study-highlands-scottish\" title=\"\">lowest level of employment per square mile</a> to be found in any temperate region in Europe, national parks could generate new jobs within an economy built on wildlife and tourism.

The real challenge is to make the cruelty on stage spark meaningful emotions","byline":"Deborah Orr","body":"<p>The first time I went to the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, about 200 years ago, the audience booed at the end of the production. I say 200 years ago; it was actually 1991, and a not overly admired revival of Meyerbeer’s Les Huguenots.</p> \n<p>At the time, I knew no different, and just thought this was how grand opera audiences behaved – like hooligans. The next day, however, the scandal was on the front page of the Daily Telegraph. It’s a big deal when the members of a Covent Garden audience start behaving as though they’re still members of the Bullingdon club.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/30/william-tell-nudity-and-scene-greeted-with-boos-at-royal-opera-house\" title=\"\">On Monday night, Covent Garden booed again</a>, this time in response to a staging of Rossini’s William Tell. I’m very sorry to have missed it – the booing as much as the full-fig Covent Garden opera. Both are quite the spectacle. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/30/guillame-tell-review-royal-opera-house-sex-violence-and-protacted-booing\" title=\"\">The audience was upset because a rape scene</a>, in which a young woman was stripped naked and sexually attacked by army officers, had been included in the production. The audience considered it to be offensive and gratuitous. The Guardian’s critic Tim Ashley called the whole production “wretched”, and the rape episode “pruriently voyeuristic”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I can’t defend the opera itself. But I do defend the idea that this rarefied art form should challenge its audience</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Maybe the scene <em>was</em> offensive and gratuitous. As I say, I go to the opera just a few times a year, and I wasn’t there. I don’t know. But I do know one thing: I have seen many operas in which tragic women come to sticky ends, and it’s pretty much always sad but beautiful stuff – moving and touching in the way opera is, and real life very often isn’t. But there’s no beauty in rape. That, says the director, Italian Damiano Michieletto, was the whole point: he wanted to show the ugliness of rape in war, a subject that is talked about more than it is tackled. But his audience didn’t want to see it.</p> \n<p>Maybe the audience is right. Maybe it’s good that grand opera hasn’t gone the way of film and telly, where graphic sex and violence are too commonplace to be shocking. Or maybe it’s right for the audience at London’s grandest theatre to be confronted with such stuff, and to find it disturbing. Maybe that audience was simply asked to think about something that it would rather not think about – the reality of abused women – rather than the pitiful romance of abused, ill and unfortunate women, which opera adores.</p> \n<p>I can’t defend the opera itself. But I do defend the idea that this rarefied art form should challenge its audience, afflicting the comfortable and comforting the afflicted. Even if I never go to Covent Garden again – it is awfully expensive, after all – I wouldn’t like to think that it was shying away from making harsh and difficult points about the horrors of this world, just for fear of&nbsp;booing.</p> \n<p>Opera generates controversy far beyond its immediate audience because it’s such an important means not just of expressing complex emotion and feeling but of invoking complex emotion and feeling in its audience.</p> \n<p>Opera is about as civilised as humans get. War, and the maiming of innocents in war, conversely, is about as uncivilised as humans get. It seems wrong for a room&nbsp;full of people to be angry that they have been subjected to the sight of a staged war rape when, as they watched, this was no doubt happening, for real, to real women.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/30/guillame-tell-review-royal-opera-house-sex-violence-and-protacted-booing\">Guillaume Tell review - sex, violence and protracted booing</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Most of us are guilty of preferring not to dwell too much on the unspeakable horrors that humans are inflicting on other humans, right now, in the world today. We want to escape from terrible, shocking headlines, and from terrible, shocking thoughts. People also can’t be blamed for not expecting opera to traumatise them. But if they want to be completely sure of it, they need to go to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/apr/20/mike-leigh-pirates-of-penzance-gilbert-and-sullivan-eno-interview\" title=\"\">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>.</p> \n<p>Likewise, however, when an opera director does decide that an audience is going to be discomfited and confronted by their production, they are under an extremely solemn obligation to make sure they really do have something meaningful and important to impart to the audience, and the ability to ensure that it is imparted well.</p> \n<p>Those who have seen this William Tell seem entirely unconvinced that Michieletto came anywhere near achieving that. It is easy to disgust an audience by showing it something disgusting. It’s harder to show an audience something disgusting and to move the people in it to pity and sadness for a world that lets such cruelty occur.</p> \n<p>Covent Garden has apologised to those who saw the opera. But I hope there will be a next time for this subject, and that the next time the audience will weep, not boo.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435682291000/The-production-of-William-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Maybe the audience is right.

But, unlike that vote and the one that will face the UK as a whole some time in the next 18 months, the vote to be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/29/referendum-greeks-europe-capitalism-greece-eurozone-economic-system\">held in Greece this Sunday</a> is a snap plebiscite which doesn’t allow for much campaigning or time for the repercussions of yes or no to be fully understood.</p> \n<p>Sunday’s vote is also far more than a national question. The effects of this referendum may well be profound and long-lasting, not just for the Greek people, but for the whole European continent.</p> \n<p>As things stand, the referendum is being framed as a de facto vote on Greece’s membership of the single currency. That is not, nominally, what will be on the ballot paper and it is not what the Greek government proposes, but the rhetoric on all sides suggests that a no vote, rejecting the latest austerity package would in all likelihood presage Greece’s departure from the euro.</p> \n<p>Make no mistake, a “Grexit” would have consequences that would potentially be felt by all of us. It would undermine the credibility and integrity of the single currency, even in countries with much stronger economies than Greece, and could also weaken the European Union as a whole.</p> \n<p>These are just some of the reasons – over and above the biggest reason of all, which surely must be to avoid plunging the Greek people even deeper into crisis – that a sensible compromise should be found, even at this late stage, to keep Greece in the euro. After all, preventing a Grexit doesn’t just come down to how the people of Greece vote; it comes down to how the international institutions and eurozone members react to Greece’s democratic wishes.</p> \n<p>What is needed is an eleventh-hour deal that gives greater priority to the interests of the Greek people, keeps the country in the single currency but also, and crucially, allows it to create the conditions for economic recovery.</p> \n<p>The deadline for payment to the IMF may have passed but the IMF has the option of not reporting that default for 30 days. That time and space should be used to the full.</p> \n<p>In practical terms, such a deal should mean a reform package which prioritises growth – because that is the only way that Greece can hope to climb out of the pit of near economic collapse and despair that it has fallen into since the start of the global financial crisis and its initial bailout.</p> \n<p>To put it bluntly, crude austerity hasn’t worked in the intervening years. The Greek economy has contracted massively, unemployment has risen – youth unemployment is at an eye-watering 60% – and, despite most of the bailout money going to banks, the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio has grown.</p> \n<p>And all the while it is the ordinary people of Greece, those who will be voting on Sunday, who have been suffering the effects of austerity on a scale that few people in the rest of Europe can properly understand.</p> \n<p>So surely it must be time for an alternative to simply piling austerity on top of austerity. Surely Greece needs the leeway to focus on the kind of reforms that will boost productivity and competitiveness – the approach suggested by Prof <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/27/greek-bailout-extension-refused-panel-leading-economists-give-their-verdict\">Mariana Mazzucato</a> in the Guardian last week. And while Greece can’t simply be allowed to walk away from its obligations to creditors, surely it’s also time for some form of debt relief to be on the table.</p> \n<p>If a deal along these lines can be done before Sunday, it would give people something positive to vote yes to. But even if not, and Greece votes no, a package like this should still form the basis of what happens next. Then we would be demonstrating that people and democracy matter.</p> \n<p>Any credible recovery package for Greece surely must strike a sensible balance between some form of debt relief – or debt swap arrangement – a programme of investment and reform of the kind Greece’s leaders say they are committed to, and which they should be held to, but which they need economic and political leeway to implement. The interests of the Greek people must count as much as the interests of Greece’s creditors.</p> \n<p>The proposals currently tabled look and feel too much like the straightforward imposition of more of the austerity economics which have so palpably failed to solve the country’s problems, and which do not provide that leeway for long-lasting reform.</p> \n<p>There is substantial support for such an alternative approach, including from a group of notable economists, led by Nobel laureate Prof <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/29/joseph-stiglitz-how-i-would-vote-in-the-greek-referendum\">Joseph Stiglitz</a>, who have together warned EU leaders against what they call “creating bad history”.</p> \n<p>I began by alluding to the UK’s recent experience of referendums, one held in May and the other now looming. One lesson above all that emerges from those campaigns, which I think European leaders would do well to heed in their dealings with Greece, is that ordinary people generally do not react well to what is or can be perceived as threats.</p> \n<p>In warning that a no vote on Sunday would probably end Greece’s euro membership, EU leaders are raising the stakes, but may also risk hardening support for the outcome they say they want to avoid.</p> \n<p>And “bad history” will indeed be what is created if Greece is effectively forced out of the euro, leading to consequences we do not yet know or understand.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435678758441/European-commission-presi-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has urged Greeks to vote yes.

For the hard&nbsp;left it is proof that big finance, acting as political puppet-master, will always try to crush radical dissent and impose state-shredding austerity, even where it has demonstrably failed to yield economic growth.</p> \n<p>These accounts share a readiness to&nbsp;cast “Europe” as a single coherent actor with malicious motives playing out a parable of universal significance. By extension, there is unwillingness to see the situation as an accident involving a range of actors, with mostly&nbsp;decent motives, failing to manage conflicting demands under highly specific circumstances. There are&nbsp;many difficult lessons for the European project here, but they do not&nbsp;invalidate it completely.</p> \n<p>There is blame enough for everyone. Alexis Tsipras’s promise to the Greek people of euro membership without austerity was dishonest. Other European leaders were constrained by their own democratic obligations. There are citizens from Ireland to Latvia who have already swallowed bitter reforming medicine and paid taxes that fund bailouts. They resent Athens threatening to destabilise their economies with demands for special treatment. This is not to say those views are fair, or have more weight than Greek suffering, only that a morality tale of wicked, bullying Europe and heroic Athenian resistance doesn’t illuminate&nbsp;what is going on.</p> \n<p>It is a thankless task defending EU processes when they have ballsed-up the&nbsp;Greek situation so badly.&nbsp;It would also be reckless to conclude that, since the crisis has revealed the limits of European institutions as a mechanism to express solidarity between nations, those institutions can never again aspire to that ideal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"243e44fe68040eccb4acd276a8d48e900aa35b82\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435686899571/34efe9f2-bde4-4a3a-88db-50c034a1c5a7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jean-Claude Juncker.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jean-Claude Juncker.

Part of that function is political mediation in the borderless realm of financial globalisation. This is one reason why the Eurosceptic right hates “Brussels”. It is the place where politicians – democratically elected heads of government – can organise with combined authority to moderate international capitalism. They may not apply the brakes with sufficient force to satisfy the radical left, but that is not a reason to cheer alongside Ukip as the coach veers towards a cliff.</p> \n<p>Having lost the battle against conservative economics at home, the&nbsp;activist left in Britain exports its surplus&nbsp;indignation to Greece. Anticapitalist voters may be in short supply here, but Syriza keeps the flag flying. The EU is then cast as a high temple of austerity, as if the whole project was cooked up by Angela Merkel and David Cameron in 2010. In this way, a theme that has dominated rightwing discourse on Europe – the faceless, unelected conspiracy against free citizens – is spreading on the left.</p> \n<p>In both camps the eurozone crisis is&nbsp;met with a hint of relish: the frisson of anticipation that massive upheaval is&nbsp;nigh, that a new order will rise from&nbsp;the ashes of calamity. It might. The EU could go the way of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations\" title=\"\">League of Nations</a>. An institution, conceived as the antidote to violent nationalism, where leaders gather to solve problems&nbsp;through negotiation and compromise, can fail. But there is no evidence that if it does the result is more democracy and better capitalism. The opposite seems more likely.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435685695298/Grafitti-in-Athens-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Grafitti in Athens. ‘The old 1970s-style Euro-suspicion never went away but it was dismissed as reactionary nostalgia; flared ideological trousers at the back of a wardrobe.

Previously, I’ve <a href=\"http://www.paulcoombs.co.uk/Gallery.htm\">attached dildos</a> onto postcards from each country where homosexuality is still illegal to point out that the laws of these places regards its gay residents as mere sex objects. <br /></p> \n<p>The decision to make the flag was a simple one: a sense of outrage at Isis’s brutal advance across North Africa, Libya, Syria and Iraq. Medieval ideologies and barbarism were being spread and recorded through that most modern of expressions, social media, with that flag ever-present. It has become a potent symbol of brutality, fear and sexual oppression. If I wanted to try and stimulate a dialogue about the ridiculousness of this ideology, the flag was key.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"80a16b8bdf06a7bb99b044fa9c5d16ddc27a47d9\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/80a16b8bdf06a7bb99b044fa9c5d16ddc27a47d9/131_67_1978_1610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"dildosis with fringe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"814\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Coombs dildosis flag</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Coombs</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was important that I didn’t try to replicate the writing on the flag, because <a href=\"http://www.pri.org/stories/2014-09-04/ever-wonder-what-black-and-white-isis-flag-means\">the words and their subject</a> – Islam – are not the target. But if I showed as little respect to this flag as Isis shows to the religion and people they claim to represent so that when people saw it they would think, “dildos”? Would that be a crazy idea?</p> \n<p>The Pride festival is a pure celebration of the finest aspects of humanity: of tolerance, togetherness, acceptance and liberation, the polar opposite of what Isis stands for. If there was anywhere where my flag had a voice, it was there. And I had an invitation to march in the parade with a friend involved with “Alien Sex Club”, an art project exploring the HIV syndemic by John Walter.</p> \n<p>We agreed we would gauge reaction to the flag from fellow marchers before we hit the main streets and the crowds, but the reaction was so good humored and understanding that any worries were dissipated in minutes. The tragedies in Tunisia, Kuwait and Lyon made the case for protesting against these murderers even stronger; defiance is the best form of remembrance. The flag was so clearly made of dildos that I never thought it could be mistaken for an actual Isis flag.</p> \n<p>But 1.5 miles (2.4km) into the march, a gust of wind suddenly snapped the flagpole in two. I was wrestling with it when three or four police officers calmly appeared beside me. </p> \n<p>Three policemen held out the flag and inspected it, grinning, acknowledging immediately that these were definitely dildos and butt plugs. They explained that they were getting reports that a man was carrying an Isis flag through the streets, a misconception that could easily put me in danger. They asked if I would keep the flag concealed. So I put it away. </p> \n<p>Several hours passed before I noticed spreading news that CNN reported on the flag <a href=\"http://gawker.com/cnn-mistakes-isis-style-dildo-flag-at-pride-parade-for-1714409153?rev=1435436550575&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow_gawker_facebook&amp;utm_source=gawker_facebook&amp;utm_medium=socialflow\">as though it was an actual Isis banner</a>, not a piece of cloth covered in sex toys. #DildoIsis quickly started trending online. People made tribute dildo flags. But how could a report so hysterical and so clearly false possibly get onto the air, discussed by a terrorism expert? CNN correspondent Lucy Pawle described my flag as a “very bad mimicry” but the only bad mimicry I could see was CNN’s impression of a reputable news organization. What does this say about every other report that they broadcast? And why have they not mentioned it since? They seem to think that if nobody says anything about it then it can’t have really happened. </p> \n<p>But oh, it did. On a message board someone posted: “Whenever I see the Isis flag anywhere, all I can see is dildos!” Mission accomplished.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b33f4ea27ad0271b498af7a89b8ef7aaa253988a/194_0_2910_1746/2910.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1746,"width":2910,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Paul Coombs","altText":"dildosis in context","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Paul Coombs"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/80a16b8bdf06a7bb99b044fa9c5d16ddc27a47d9/131_67_1978_1610/1978.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1610,"width":1978,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Paul Coombs dildosis flag Photograph: Paul Coombs","credit":"Paul Coombs","altText":"dildosis with fringe","cleanCaption":"Paul Coombs dildosis flag","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Paul Coombs"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T18:38:04Z","lastModified":"2015-07-01T07:49:37Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":80,"contributors":[{"name":"Paul Coombs","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/paul-coombs"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Art","Art and design","Islamic State","LGBT rights","Sexuality"],"tags":[{"id":"artanddesign/art","webTitle":"Art"},{"id":"artanddesign/artanddesign","webTitle":"Art and design"},{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State"},{"id":"world/lgbt-rights","webTitle":"LGBT rights"},{"id":"society/sexuality","webTitle":"Sexuality"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Paul Coombs","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/paul-coombs"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/30/isis-dildo-flag-london-pride-cnn","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a98j","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/30/isis-dildo-flag-london-pride-cnn","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/30/isis-dildo-flag-london-pride-cnn"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b33f4ea27ad0271b498af7a89b8ef7aaa253988a/194_0_2910_1746/2910.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1746,"width":2910,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Paul Coombs knew his “Dildosis” flag might inspire a little controversy at London Pride.
