the Greek PM now has to try and convince his government this Friday to back the €13 billion plan, one that seemingly flies in the face of the anti-austerity rhetoric that has been Syriza’s bread and butter since before the party was elected.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/statuses/619402943423479808\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Markets cheer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a>'s bailout plan: Germany's Dax jumps &gt;2% above 11k. <a href=\"http://t.co/1OwEJXtT75\">pic.twitter.com/1OwEJXtT75</a></p>— Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/619402943423479808\">July 10, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-559f71b9e4b05111b7559657","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-10T07:19:07Z","body":"<p>From VAT rises to defence spending cuts, here’s a breakdown of what Greece ahs submitted to:</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/10/greeces-proposals-to-help-end-talks-deadlock\">Key points: Greece's proposals to help end talks deadlock</a> </p> \n</aside>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-559f70a3e4b07fc6a121f638","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-10T07:17:21Z","body":"<p>Another sign of market confidence: Money is flowing out of German government bonds this morning and into Italian debt.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/statuses/619395929838383104\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SG: Mr Market assumes that Greek deal flies (for now). 10y Bund yields jump 8bps while 10y Italian ylds drop by 13bps <a href=\"http://t.co/8gWZEXNmKd\">pic.twitter.com/8gWZEXNmKd</a></p>— Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/619395929838383104\">July 10, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-559f7038e4b05111b7559652","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-10T07:13:25Z","body":"<p>The euro is rallying this morning too, up over half a cent against the US dollar in early trading.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/statuses/619387461618286592\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What difference a day makes: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Euro?src=hash\">#Euro</a> gains, briefly touches $1.1135, Highest since Jul1 as overnight Greek proposal has rekindled deal hope.</p>— Holger Zschaepitz (@Schuldensuehner) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/619387461618286592\">July 10, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-559f6e49e4b05111b755964d","title":"Markets jump","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-10T07:10:22Z","body":"<p><strong>European stock markets have jumped, as investors hail the news that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/10/greek-parliament-to-vote-on-new-cuts-for-cash-plan-to-break-deadlock\">Alexis Tsipras has submitted a new list of reforms to Greece’s creditors</a>.</strong></p> \n<p>The French CAC leapt by 2.4%, the German DAX gained 1.6%, and in London the FTSE 100 is up 70 points or 1%.</p> \n<p>Traders are still a little cautious, though, after the roller-coaster ride this year.</p> \n<p>As Chris Weston of IG explains:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The Greek public voted against austerity last Sunday, yet what we have seen is a giant step closer towards the Creditors’ prior proposal which was subsequently rejected, ironically by Tsipras.</p> \n <p>There will be factions within the Greek parliament that simply won’t know what Tsipras is playing at, so when the Greek parliament vote on these measures today it is by no means a done deal.</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-559f65cde4b07fc6a121f627","title":"Introduction: Deal hopes rise after Tsipras capitulates","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-10T07:02:41Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T07:54:04Z","body":"<p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek bailout crisis.</strong></p> \n<p>Leonardo Da Vinci once scribbled in his notebook:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p> It is easier to resist at the beginning than at the end.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>And Alexis Tsipras appears to have taken this to heart.

He knows firsthand the dangers of budget cuts. In 2011, at the height of the Greek financial crisis, he found a series of problems with the new cheaper umbilical cord clamps that were being used at the hospital, that cost 10 cents each less than the previous ones. </p> \n<p>“I researched several problems with them. One newborn had terrible bleeding as a result of it but fortunately we saved him after two weeks in neonatal intensive care.” When Adamidis blew the whistle on the problems, his job was threatened and he was sued by the state, a legal battle which he eventually won this year. “I’m not against cheap materials but they have to be absolutely safe,” he said.</p> \n<p> In a country which has seen a rise in diseases such as TB and malaria during the crisis years, children’s health has suffered. In Xanthi, Adamidis sees effects on those whose families sleep rough and has seen a rise in both child obesity, because families eat cheap junk-food, and the chronically underweight because there is little food to go round. Five years ago, there were five paediatricians on his unit. Now there are two.</p> \n<p>“There has been a tremendous effort to put the needs of patients first, but now there are signs of burnout in doctors,” he said. “I recently broke my leg and needed to be operated on. My surgeon, who was excellent, started his operating shift at 8am and continued through to 10pm.”</p> \n<p> Run-down state hospitals often make work even harder. A Greek lawyer who had recent abdominal surgery, said: “There were three beds in my room but they couldn’t have anyone in the middle bed because the ceiling was falling in over it, and yet the staff were amazing.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There has been a tremendous effort to put the needs of patients first, but now there are signs of burn​out in doctors</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Dr Dimitris Adamidis</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p> When he was elected in January, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, promised to hire 4,500 healthcare workers and fight what he called the “barbaric conditions” in public hospitals and corruption in the health sector. As Greece awaits the conditions of any new bailout deal, medical staff hope the extreme problems of the health sector will be addressed.</p> \n<p> Dr Pantelis Vakianis is a nephrologist who runs a private dialysis clinic in Thessaloniki which has contracts from the state. He said he had enough medical supplies and medicines for about two to three months, but the state was behind in payments for many doctors and staff salaries had been cut. </p> \n<p>Vakianis said he felt recent years had seen “the gradual destruction of the public health system”, followed by the private system. “We’ve been slowly heading towards a humanitarian crisis,” he warned.</p> \n<p> In a pharmacy on a quiet street in Thessaloniki a young chemist was trying to reassure his elderly customers as stress levels ran high. A pensioner on painkillers had run up credit as she did not have enough cash. Others, fearing the uncertainty of when a political deal could be done and when banks would reopen, wanted to buy extra of their prescription medicines ranging from diabetes drugs to antidepressants. After almost two weeks of a Greek bank freeze that has banned money from being transferred abroad, there has been concern that imported drugs – whose supply chain has already been badly disrupted during Greece’s five-year debt crisis – could be hit. Pharmacists have long been struggling with delays in reimbursements from the state, difficulties sourcing drugs and a lack of funds. </p> \n<p>“I’ve got enough medicines in stock for at least a couple of weeks and I’m trying to calm people down,” the pharmacist said. “Customers are worried that there might be shortages of things like insulin and painkillers, a lot of women have come in concerned they might not find enough of their birth-control pills and contraceptives. It’s very upsetting but my message to customers is: Don’t panic. We’ll get you your medicines. We’ll do everything we can. Right now my stocks are ok, but if this carries on, in a few weeks it will get difficult.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f525201ad9e94261f65e8fa1857ad790372a8ad6/0_102_3500_2101/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2101,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Stefanos Rapanis/REUTERS","altText":"A pharmacist searches for medicine for a client at a pharmacy at the city of Iraklio in the island of Crete<br>A pharmacist (R) searches for medicine for a client at a pharmacy at the city of Iraklio in the island of Crete, Greece July 7, 2015.

She is on her way back to her hometown of Maycomb from New York to see her father Atticus, the hero of Lee’s 1960 novel, now an ailing 72-year-old.</p> \n<p>The contents of the novel, which was written in the 1950s and then laid aside when Lee was asked by her editor to focus instead on its flashbacks to childhood, have been both a fiercely guarded secret and a hotly contested mystery since its existence was first revealed in February: was it an early version of Mockingbird? Was it deemed unpublishable when it was written in the 1950s? How was it found and why did Lee decide to publish now, at the age of 89, after decades of shunning any form of attention or publicity? </p> \n<p>The first chapter, published on Friday by the Guardian in advance of the novel’s release at midnight on 14 July in bookshops around the world, reveals a witty, dry voice immediately recognisable as that of the To Kill a Mockingbird author. Jean Louise is shown to be grappling with two things as she comes home. Atticus, an almost godlike figure to the Scout of Mockingbird, is now in constant pain. “She was too old to rail against the inequity of it, but too young to accept her father’s crippling disease without putting up some kind of fight … She wondered how she would behave when her time came to hurt day in and day out.”</p> \n<p>She is also pondering whether or not she should marry a childhood friend of her brother’s, who muses ruefully that “most women, before they’ve got ’em, present to their men smiling, agreeing faces. They hide their thoughts. You now, when you’re feeling hateful, honey, you are hateful.” </p> \n<p>Lee’s literary agent Andrew Nurnberg, who was contacted last autumn about the manuscript’s existence, said that when he first read it after flying to Lee’s hometown of Monroeville, “my heart almost leapt out of my throat”. It had been discovered by her lawyer Tonja Carter in what Lee’s publisher described as “a secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript” of Mockingbird.</p> \n<p>“You just pick it up, and you say, ‘oh my goodness, this is Nelle, here she is’. And of course it is so hilarious,” said Nurnberg. According to Lee’s publisher she was clear she wanted the novel published exactly as it was written, so it has only had a light copy edit. “What is so fine about this book is that it isn’t polished by any editor, but it absolutely comes from the heart,” said Nurnberg. </p> \n<p>As to how its depiction of racial issues would appear half a century after it was written, Nurmberg said: “It is dealing with a much more complicated issue, namely adult views of segregation in those days. It’s too easy for a child to see something either as good or as bad, but they don’t have those conflicts we grownups have, where we can see the grey areas.”</p> \n<p>There have been persistent questions around the discovery of the novel: the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jul/02/harper-lee-go-set-a-watchman-manuscript-discovery\">New York Times suggested last weekend </a>that the manuscript could have been discovered in 2011, with Carter aware of its existence at the time; there has been an investigation by the state of Alabama into allegations (<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/apr/03/alabama-harper-lee-elder-abuse-allegations-unfounded\">since declared unfounded</a>) that 89-year-old Lee was a victim of “elder abuse” over the novel’s publication. Nurnberg addressed these questions, saying: “The wonderful thing is that once this book is published, I very much hope all these naysayers are just going to disappear into the woodwork.”</p> \n<p>Watchman, he reiterated, was always intended to be published. He has seen correspondence, he said, which shows “the plan was, from early on, having submitted Watchman … to produce three books” – Mockingbird, then a short connecting novel, then Watchman.</p> \n<p>He quoted a letter from Lee’s agent at the time, in which the latter writes of Watchman, “Well, honey, you done got yoself a publisher”, the New York agent turning to typical Alabamese to inform his client of the deal.</p> \n<p>Nurnberg also defended Carter, who, he said, had been pilloried over her role. “She is a woman who is valiantly protecting her charge, whom she has been with for 25, 30 years,” he said. “She’s completely devoted, she goes [to Lee’s assisted-living home in Monroeville] twice a day and has been for years to see her … She’s not a sneaky schemer of any kind … When I got that call, she really was shocked that she’d found [the manuscript] … She had never seen it.”</p> \n<p>Nurnberg saw Lee last week, spending time with her before she was presented with the first copies of Watchman by her publishers. “She’s very deaf and you have to repeat things sometimes thrice or four times. She was in a good mood. She knew she was going to see these copies and was getting keen to see this book out there, finally,” he said. “When I told her how many copies they were printing [2m for the first US print run] she was completely shocked, because this is a book she had been advised to put on the back burner … I think she remembers so well the editor saying, ‘hang on, let’s do something else’, and that will have had, I think, a major impression on her life and her view of this specific book.”</p> \n<p>Filmmaker and author Mary McDonagh Murphy also saw Lee last week, filming her as she received copies of the book, as part of her<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/harper-lee/harper-lee-meeting-exclusive-report-from-filmmaker/3954/\"> updated documentary Hey Boo</a>, released in the US on Friday.</p> \n<p>“By her friends’ reckoning [including her old friend and benefactor Joy Brown, who has seen Lee “many times” since she decided to publish] she’s absolutely delighted [about publication]. And this is what her lawyer says, and this is what her agent says, and this is what her statements say,” said Murphy. “Last week she was grateful. They gave her the books, and she said thank you. It seems she’s ready for it to be published.”</p> \n<p>Murphy added that “certainly questions have been raised [about Lee’s decision to publish], but without asking Harper Lee directly and without Lee answering directly, it’s not easy to get to the bottom of things. But the people around her, and her friends, and her written statements, all attest to her intention to publish and her happiness about it.”</p> \n<p>Having read the novel, Murphy said “it’s amazing to be able to see Scout at 26, and Atticus at 72, and as a journalist who’s been chronicling this for a while, it’s also an incredible experience to see what came first, to read exactly what was in Harper Lee’s mind when she began to write To Kill a Mockingbird … It’s delightful to hear her voice again.” </p> \n<p>Lee herself has described the novel in a statement as “a pretty decent effort”.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Readers in the UK can buy the Guardian newspaper on Saturday for a 16-page souvenir Harper Lee supplement, free inside Weekend magazine.

In particular, changes to universal credit, cutting the amount workers are allowed to earn before their benefits start to be withdrawn, would cost 3 million families an average &pound;1,000 a year.</p> \n<p>Making work pay was meant to be a key motivation for the shift to universal credit, a radical redesign of the benefits system spearheaded by Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary.</p> \n<p>But Johnson said these latest changes would blunt the incentive for its recipients to take up employment. “Significant allowances were an integral part of the design of universal credit, intended to give claimants an incentive to move into work. This reform will cost about 3 million families an average of &pound;1,000 a year each. It will reduce the incentive for the first earner in the family to enter work.”</p> \n<p>The IFS also said Osborne’s biggest welfare cut – freezing working-age benefits, tax credits and local housing allowance until 2020 - would affect 13 million households, who will lose out by an average of &pound;260 a year.</p> \n<p>Duncan Smith – who greeted Osborne’s announcement of a large rise in the minimum wage with delight on Wednesday – rejected the IFS’s analysis. He said its calculations failed to take into account the pledge of 30 hours a week of free childcare for parents of young children, or the likelihood that higher wages would lead to a more productive and skilled worker who would then be paid still higher wages.</p> \n<p>He maintained: “A lone parent with two children who works 16 hours on the minimum wage when everything is included such as free childcare will actually be better off on the net figures after the budget.”</p> \n<p>Labour seized on the IFS analysis as undermining Osborne’s claim to be on the side of Britain’s workers. Andy Burnham, one of the party leadership contenders, called the thinktank’s verdict “devastating” and said it showed the “nasty party is well and truly back”.</p> \n<p>Chris Leslie, the shadow chancellor, said Labour was delighted that Osborne had “stolen” some of its manifesto policies, such as the increase in the minimum wage. But he added: “Do not underestimate how important those tax credits have been for many, many people who will be waking up this morning and I think left reeling by the massive reduction to their quality of life that will come because of the nature of this set of decisions. It will really hit working families hard.”</p> \n<p>Gareth Jenkins, director of UK poverty policy at Save the Children, said children in the families affected by the cuts could see their life chances diminished as a result. “Our biggest concern would be that increases in financial hardship for the poorest working families will only further worsen the chances of their children to do well at school and escape the circumstances they were born into – a key goal of the Conservative government.”</p> \n<p>Nick Bryer, head of UK policy and campaigns at Oxfam, said he was deeply concerned by the IFS analysis. “We know from our work with poor communities across the UK that people living close to the poverty line are ill-equipped to adapt to sudden drops in income.</p> \n<p>“In practical terms it means families forced to choose between paying the bills or missing meals.”</p> \n<p>The IFS said the chancellor had chosen a “gentler path” of public spending cuts than expected, allowing him to spread the welfare cuts over the next four years, instead of the two envisaged in March.</p> \n<p>His coffers will also be boosted by tax increases on targets including buy-to-let landlords, drivers of high-emission cars and recipients of share dividends. The IFS calculated that, in total, there were &pound;14bn of tax rises, only partly offset by &pound;8bn in cuts, including the increase in the tax-free personal allowance.</p> \n<p>Johnson said the budget would lead to a “lower welfare country”, as the chancellor promised, but “was not quite consistent with the boast that it was aimed at a lower tax country”.</p> \n<p>The IFS also stressed that Osborne’s plans still imply deep cuts to Whitehall departments, outside the protected areas of health, schools, overseas aid – and now defence, on which the chancellor promised to spend more.</p> \n<p>Spending in unprotected areas, which include the Home Office and the Department for Business, will have to be squeezed by &pound;19bn in real terms by 2020, according to the IFS – a total reduction of a third since 2010.</p> \n<p>Johnson described Osborne’s decision to increase the minimum wage for over-25s to &pound;9 an hour by 2020 as a gamble, saying that the only guaranteed way of securing higher wages was to boost productivity.</p> \n<p>“We still await details of how that is to be tackled. Simply forcing wage increases by government fiat, by hiking the minimum wage, is more of a gamble.”</p> \n<p>Jim O’Neill, the former Goldman Sachs economist recently appointed as a Treasury minister, is expected to outline how the government hopes to tackle Britain’s lacklustre productivity record today.</p> \n<p>Johnson also questioned Osborne’s credentials as a tax reformer, saying it was “a deeply disappointing budget for those of us who hoped the chancellor might take the chance to improve, simplify and reform our creaking tax system”.</p> \n<p>He added: “This was not the budget of a tax-reforming chancellor.”</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/44aa6f76b00abb157e9fea188a3c1ff7fb8e8d6f/0_33_3752_2254/3752.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2254,"width":3752,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Rupert Hartley/REX Shutterstock/Rupert Hartley/REX Shutterstock","altText":"George Osborne’s July budget 2015","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Rupert Hartley/REX Shutterstock/Rupert Hartley/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-10T06:41:20Z","lastModified":"2015-07-10T07:46:31Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Heather Stewart","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733738716/HeatherStewart.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/heatherstewart"},{"name":"Patrick Wintour","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/4/1423058528318/Patrick-Wintour-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patrickwintour"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Budget 2015 (July)","Institute for Fiscal Studies","Budget","UK news","Business","Living wage"],"tags":[{"id":"uk-news/budget-2015-july","webTitle":"Budget 2015 (July)"},{"id":"business/institute-for-fiscal-studies","webTitle":"Institute for Fiscal Studies"},{"id":"uk/budget","webTitle":"Budget"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"society/living-wage","webTitle":"Living wage"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/10/george-osborne-took-much-more-from-poor-budget-2015-ifs","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ah2q","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jul/10/george-osborne-took-much-more-from-poor-budget-2015-ifs","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/10/george-osborne-took-much-more-from-poor-budget-2015-ifs"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/44aa6f76b00abb157e9fea188a3c1ff7fb8e8d6f/0_33_3752_2254/3752.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2254,"width":3752,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The IFS said that overall George Osborne’s budget was regressive, taking ‘much more’ from the poor than the rich.

David Clohessy, the executive director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, believes the trial is a farce. “There are thousands of child-molesting priests, nuns, brothers, and yes, archbishops,” he said. “For the Vatican at this late stage to deem one of them guilty should not be considered earth-shattering by anyone.”</p> \n<p>Clohessy said the trial was another “attempt to handle crimes quietly and internally”. Instead, Vatican officials should have raced to the Dominican Republic and publicly declared their concerns as soon as the rumours about Wesołowski emerged.</p> \n<p>“It should have begged people who may have suffered to go to the police or prosecutors,” he said. “In Poland, a similar public plea should have been made. Had that happened, Wesołowski would likely be in prison now and more of his victims would have broken their silence.”</p> \n<p>Wesołowski could face 12 years in jail, a sentence that could be enforced in an Italian prison or the Vatican cells. If convicted, he will have the right of appeal. The tribunal will be headed by Giuseppe Dalla Torre, a lay jurist and professor at the University of Bologna. </p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b1a7e7787a544e2982b10a6a25c097acfb6c14c9/0_80_1735_1041/1735.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1041,"width":1735,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Erika Santelices/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Józef Wesołowski","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Erika Santelices/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-10T04:00:01Z","lastModified":"2015-07-10T04:45:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Stephanie Kirchgaessner","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stephanie-kirchgaessner"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Vatican","Catholicism","Pope Francis","Italy","World news","Dominican Republic","Child protection","Europe","Religion","Children","Christianity","Society","The papacy"],"tags":[{"id":"world/vatican","webTitle":"Vatican"},{"id":"world/catholicism","webTitle":"Catholicism"},{"id":"world/pope-francis","webTitle":"Pope Francis"},{"id":"world/italy","webTitle":"Italy"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/dominicanrepublic","webTitle":"Dominican Republic"},{"id":"society/childprotection","webTitle":"Child protection"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/religion","webTitle":"Religion"},{"id":"society/children","webTitle":"Children"},{"id":"world/christianity","webTitle":"Christianity"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"world/the-papacy","webTitle":"The papacy"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Stephanie Kirchgaessner","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stephanie-kirchgaessner"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/10/first-vatican-child-abuse-trial-former-nuncio-jozef-wesolowski-dock","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4afqk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/10/first-vatican-child-abuse-trial-former-nuncio-jozef-wesolowski-dock","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/10/first-vatican-child-abuse-trial-former-nuncio-jozef-wesolowski-dock"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b1a7e7787a544e2982b10a6a25c097acfb6c14c9/0_80_1735_1041/1735.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1041,"width":1735,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Józef Wesołowski also stands accused of possessing images of child abuse.

There were 20,000 British tourists in Tunisia at the time of the gun attack in Sousse last month, which claimed the lives of 38 holidaymakers, of whom 30 were British.</p> \n<p>The foreign secretary interrupted negotiations in Vienna on Iran’s nuclear programme on Thursday afternoon to telephone the Tunisian prime minister, Habib Essid, to inform him of what is being described as a serious upgrade of the UK’s travel advice. Essid warned on Wednesday of further attacks and Britain’s intelligence agencies are advising that such attacks are highly likely.</p> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/tunisia\">statement on its website</a>, the FCO said the British authorities have been working closely with the Tunisian authorities since the Sousse gun attack. But the FCO said it feared a further attack and had concerns about security measures in place to protect tourists.</p> \n<p>The travel advice says: “Since the attack in Sousse, we have been working closely with the Tunisian authorities to investigate the attack and the wider threat from terrorist groups in Tunisia. Although we have had good cooperation from the Tunisian government, including putting in place additional security measures, the intelligence and threat picture has developed considerably, reinforcing our view that a further terrorist attack is highly likely.</p> \n<p>“On balance, we do not believe the mitigation measures in place provide adequate protection for British tourists in Tunisia at the present time and we have therefore changed our travel advice accordingly.”</p> \n<p>The advice is against all but essential travel to the whole of the country, which means tourists should leave immediately and those with holidays booked should avoid Tunisia. The FCO said: “If you’re in Tunisia and you don’t have an essential need to remain you should leave by commercial means. Tour operators are arranging additional flights and will be organising departures for their customers. If you’re travelling with a tour operator, you should contact your tour operator’s representative in the first instance.</p> \n<p>“If you’re travelling independently, you should make your own arrangements to leave. Commercial airlines are operating.”</p> \n<p>Nikhil Patel, 18, from Luton, arrived in a seaside town to the south of the capital, Tunis, on Wednesday morning. He is staying in a hotel, along with a host of other British tourists, on a two-week holiday.</p> \n<p>He said: “Everything is fine so far because the security is very high. I spend all day on the beach and you see police officers walking around with guns, keeping an eye on everything. Even the locals are on full alert.”</p> \n<p>He said he had just seen the FCO advice on the news but he planned to stay until his travel firm advised him to leave. “I am making the most of it because I get the feeling we might be leaving.”</p> \n<p>At the British embassy in Tunis, a spokesman said that fewer than 3,000 British tourists are in Tunisia, “the vast majority of them” on holidays organised by Thomas Cook.</p> \n<p>The Imperial Marhaba hotel, scene of the attack last month, had as guests British visitors on packages booked with Tui’s Thomson and First Choice brands. These companies at present have no British customers in the country, the spokesman said.</p> \n<p>The change to the travel advice comes as the UK authorities now have better access to intelligence gathered by the Tunisian security services, he added.</p> \n<p>There has been a ramping up of security in Tunisia’s beach resorts over the past week. After criticism that security forces were slow to respond to the Sousse attack, troops and police have been employed throughout what is one of the country’s largest resorts. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Police road blocks stud the city with patrols of troops with machine guns cruising the highways in Humvee personnel carriers. On the beach outside the almost empty Imperial Marhaba hotel, police patrol on foot, horseback and by dune buggy, while the national guard has deployed a jet ski that cruises offshore.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>But analysts say resorts remain vulnerable. “The UK embassy has been studying the response to Sousse attack and it appears it doesn’t have confidence that Tunisian government security measures will be enough,” said Tunis-based North Africa analyst Monica Marks. “Securing tourist sites is a herculean task and Sousse was the definition of a soft-target attack, a gunman targeting people on their sun beds.”<br /></p> \n<p>Tourism accounts for 14% of the country’s economy, employing 400,000 people, and the exodus of holidaymakers will be a blow in an already depressed economy. Habib Daguib, who rents out quad bikes on the beach outside the Marhaba said many fear for their jobs in a city reliant on the tourist industry. “One terrorist has killed all the country.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Tunisia has already announced measures to combat extremism, saying it will close 80 unauthorised mosques and restrict flights abroad for the under 35s in an attempt to stem the flow of recruits to Isis. It has also confirmed its intention to construct a fence along the border with Libya, where it says many Tunisian extremists receive training.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>But some think strikes on tourism centres are now established policy for militants, with the government itself well protected from attack. “It is a new strategy (by the terrorists), they want to strike to undermine the economy, to undermine the democratic process,” said French terrorism expert David Thomson. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>The FCO said: “Further terrorist attacks are highly likely, including in tourist resorts, and by individuals unknown to the authorities whose actions may be inspired by terrorist groups via social media. You should be especially vigilant at this time and follow the advice of the Tunisian security authorities and your tour operator, if you have one.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/27/tunisia-beach-attack-the-victims\">Tunisia beach attack: the victims</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“There is a high threat from terrorism in Tunisia.

In his telephone conversation with Essid, Hammond praised Tunisia’s response to the Sousse attack, which involved a noticeable increase in security forces in popular tourist areas. But Britain believes that the Tunisian authorities have some way to go to provide security which would allow tourists to remain in the country in safety.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0ccaa4febb8dd4b4e59b3b0fa986fc17d17d9e7f/0_48_5616_3368/5616.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3368,"width":5616,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chedly Ben Ibrahim/Demotix/Corbis","altText":"Police at Sousse beach hotel, Tunisia","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Chedly Ben Ibrahim/Demotix/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T18:49:35Z","lastModified":"2015-07-10T06:49:36Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Nicholas Watt","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nicholaswatt"},{"name":"Kevin Rawlinson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/kevin-rawlinson"},{"name":"Chris Stephen","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/chris-stephen"},{"name":"Eileen Byrne","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/eileen-byrne"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Tunisia","Africa","Middle East and North Africa","World news","UK news","Counter-terrorism policy","UK security and counter-terrorism","Politics"],"tags":[{"id":"world/tunisia","webTitle":"Tunisia"},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/terrorism","webTitle":"Counter-terrorism policy"},{"id":"uk/uksecurity","webTitle":"UK security and counter-terrorism"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/09/foreign-office-warns-against-travel-to-tunisia-in-wake-of-attack","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agm6","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/09/foreign-office-warns-against-travel-to-tunisia-in-wake-of-attack","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/09/foreign-office-warns-against-travel-to-tunisia-in-wake-of-attack"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-457458730","source":"Reuters","durationInSeconds":106,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/09/150709Hammond.m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/09/150709Hammond_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/9/1436477131312/KP_348650_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Britons should leave Tunisia immediately, says Foreign office - video","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Britons should leave Tunisia immediately, says Foreign office - video","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Britons should leave Tunisia immediately, says Foreign office - video"}}},"importance":1,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"replace","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://media.guim.co.uk/bdc39c141b40f9dbabea4af0ef8f0bd5af36f9e1/0_242_5329_3199/1000.jpg","height":600,"width":999}}]}],"lastModified":"2015-07-10T07:35:15Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/uk-alpha/news/regular-stories","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/uk-alpha/news/regular-stories"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"uk-alpha/news/regular-stories/front"}
