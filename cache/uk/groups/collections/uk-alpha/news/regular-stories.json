I am sure the government will act with appropriate speed in developing the negotiations ... as soon as necessary.”</p> \n<p>Mark Carney said that companies were already expressing concerns over David Cameron’s promised referendum and a potential UK exit from the EU.</p> \n<p>“It’s in the interests of everybody that there is clarity about the process and the question and the decision,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.</p> \n<p>“[The EU] is the largest economy in the world. It’s our largest investment destination. It’s the largest investor in the United Kingdom.”</p> \n<p>The Bank’s top policymaker said that while businesses had already flagged up concerns over the poll, they were yet to act on them by delaying or cancelling spending plans.</p> \n<p>The prime minister has promised a vote on EU membership by the end of 2017.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in the BBC interview, Carney said he wanted to “really dampen down” the view that cheap foreign labour had stopped increases in productivity.</p> \n<p>He said: “The facts of this recovery have been there has been a huge growth in employment, one of the strongest job markets in the world, and we have seen a big increase in the willingness of the British people, British nationals, to work. </p> \n<p>“In the course of the last two years, the number of older workers – people in their 50s and 60s – who stayed in the labour market has been more than 300,000 more than we would have seen in previous times. In addition, people want to work more hours. That’s another 200,000 to 300,000 more workers, effectively more workers.”</p> \n<p>He added: “Compare that to the increase in net migration – the increase in the number of people coming to these shores – the first two numbers I just gave you total up to more than 500,000, the increase in net migration over that same period in the last two years is 50,000. </p> \n<p>“So the real story here is that British people have wanted to work more and what’s happened with the economy – and now I’ll get to productivity – is that jobs have been created, people are getting those jobs, now that spare capacity is being used up – as you saw yesterday the unemployment rate is down to 5.5%, we’ve created 200,000 jobs in the last three months alone – so that spare capacity is being used up and now for the economy to move forward it’s going to be a story of productivity.” <br /></p> \n<p>Carney said foreign workers tend to start in jobs for which they are over-qualified and then over time move up the skill chain to secure work more suited to their skills. </p> \n<p>He said: “They contribute to that increase in productivity. That is something we see across the economy.” </p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f8c0f53d63af72441f7c09a6ed864ce08145d89f/0_70_5184_3114/5184.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3114,"width":5184,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Matt Dunham/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Mark Carney","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Matt Dunham/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-14T08:32:12Z","lastModified":"2015-05-14T08:36:24Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Angela Monaghan","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/angela-monaghan"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Mark Carney","Bank of England","Business","Economics","Migration","Pay","Family finances","Interest rates","Money","Work & careers","European Union","Europe"],"tags":[{"id":"business/mark-carney","webTitle":"Mark Carney"},{"id":"business/bankofenglandgovernor","webTitle":"Bank of England"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"world/migration","webTitle":"Migration"},{"id":"money/pay","webTitle":"Pay"},{"id":"money/family-finances","webTitle":"Family finances"},{"id":"business/interest-rates","webTitle":"Interest rates"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"},{"id":"money/work-and-careers","webTitle":"Work & careers"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"}],"section":{"id":"business"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Angela Monaghan","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/angela-monaghan"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"business"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/may/14/eu-poll-should-take-place-as-soon-as-necessary-says-bank-of-england-chief","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48q94","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/business/2015/may/14/eu-poll-should-take-place-as-soon-as-necessary-says-bank-of-england-chief","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/14/eu-poll-should-take-place-as-soon-as-necessary-says-bank-of-england-chief"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f8c0f53d63af72441f7c09a6ed864ce08145d89f/0_70_5184_3114/5184.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3114,"width":5184,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mark Carney: ‘It’s in the interests of everybody that there is clarity about the process and the question and the decision.’ Photograph: Matt Dunham/AFP/Getty Images","credit":"Matt Dunham/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Mark Carney","cleanCaption":"Mark Carney: ‘It’s in the interests of everybody that there is clarity about the process and the question and the decision.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Matt Dunham/AFP/Getty Images"}},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"Bank of England chief"},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Live / Ukip in turmoil as campaign chief condemns Farage","rawTitle":"Ukip in turmoil as campaign chief condemns Farage","item":{"type":"liveBlog","id":"politics/blog/live/2015/may/14/ukip-in-turmoil-as-campaign-chief-condemns-farage-politics-live","title":"Ukip in turmoil as campaign chief condemns Farage - Politics live","trailText":"Andrew Sparrow’s rolling coverage of all today’s political developments as they happen, including turmoil in Ukip, the latest from the Labour leadership contest and George Osborne’s Northern Powerhouse speech","standFirst":"<p>Rolling coverage of all today’s political developments as they happen, including turmoil in Ukip and the latest from the Labour leadership contest </p>","byline":"Andrew Sparrow","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431590121304/1685c9cb-ce38-4afb-a3d4-ac7196aebcca-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-14T08:29:30Z","lastModified":"2015-05-14T08:37:42Z","latestBlock":{"id":"block-55545c89e4b0c5cab2456c62","publishedDateTime":"2015-05-14T08:29:30Z","body":"The Conservative MP Michael Fabricant thinks it’s time for a Ukip “Downfall” video.

offering the clearest picture yet of the breadth and depth of the heir to the throne’s lobbying at the highest level of politics.</p> \n<p>The 27 memos, sent in 2004 and 2005 and released only after the Guardian won its long freedom of information fight with the government, show the Prince of Wales making direct and persistent policy demands to the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/13/prince-charles-black-spider-memos-published-after-10-year-legal-battle\">then prime minister Tony Blair</a> and several key figures in his Labour government.</p> \n<p>From Blair, Charles demanded everything from urgent action to improve equipment for <a

Iraq 'without necessary resources'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In a single letter in February 2005, he <a

tuberculosis – damning its opponents as “intellectually dishonest”; lobbied for his preferred person to be appointed to crack down on the mistreatment of farmers by supermarkets; proposed his own aide to brief Downing Street on the design of new hospitals; and urged Blair to tackle a European Union directive limiting the use of herbal alternative medicines use in the UK.</p> \n<p>The government has spent more than &pound;400,000 on legal costs in its ultimately failed attempt to block the original <a

In 2012 the then attorney general, Dominic Grieve, warned they “would be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2013/jul/09/prince-charles-letters-mps-private-court\">seriously damaging to his role as future monarch</a> because, if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the throne, he cannot easily recover it when he is king”.</p> \n<p>But following the release of the “black spider” memos – so-called because of the prince’s scrawled handwriting – there were questions on Wednesday about whether it was worth the money to try to keep secret details of his lobbying, some of which reflects Charles’s very narrow personal interests. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/13/prince-charles-letter-tony-blair-postpone-herbal-medicines-restrictions\">Did Prince Charles's letter lead Tony Blair to postpone herbal medicines law?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For example, in October 2004 he told the environment minister Elliot Morley he hoped “illegal fishing of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/13/prince-charles-black-spider-memos-stranger-topics-badgers-patagonian-toothfish\">Patagonian toothfish</a> will be high up on your list of priorities because until that trade is stopped, there is little hope for the poor old albatross”.<br /></p> \n<p>But they also cover more controversial subjects. In one memo, Charles explicitly lobbied Tony Blair when he was prime minister to replace Lynx military helicopters.</p> \n<p>Charles complained that delays in their replacement was “one more example where our Armed forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources”. Blair responded that replacement would be a priority for spending.</p> \n<p>He directly urged the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/live/2015/may/13/publication-of-the-prince-charles-black-spider-letters-live#block-555386f5e4b03e21263ee65f\">health secretary, John Reid</a>, to accelerate redevelopment at a hospital site in Sunderland in which his own architecture charity was involved, warning bluntly that “chickens will come home to roost” in Reid’s government department if action was not taken.<br /></p> \n<p>The letters revealed not only that ministers often responded actively to his suggestions but they appeared to hold his interventions in high regard.</p> \n<p>Blair replied to him in one letter: “I always value and look forward to your views – but perhaps particularly on agricultural topics.”</p> \n<p>After Charles Clarke, then education secretary, responded to Charles’ complaint about the nutritional content of school meals, he signed off: “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/13/humble-and-obedient-how-ministers-defied-etiquette-in-replies-to-charles\">I have the honour to be, Sir, Your Royal Highness’s most humble and obedient servant</a>.”</p> \n<p>The memos also reveal how dogged Charles can be in demanding actions from ministers as it emerged that his engagement with key political players has not abated. Since the beginning of 2010, the prince held 87 meetings with ministers, opposition party leaders and top government officials, new figures release by the campaign group Republic showed. This year he has held meetings with, among others, David Cameron, the Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, and Alistair Carmichael, then Scotland secretary.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456719226__\n</div> \n<p>The letters emerged amid growing signs that Prince Charles is planning to rule in a far more outspoken way than the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/13/queen-meddling-monarchs-prince-charles\">taciturn Queen</a>. Allies told the Guardian last year he planned “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2014/nov/19/becoming-king-not-silence-prince-charles-allies\">heartfelt interventions</a>” in national life, while in 2013 his friend and biographer Jonathan Dimbleby said: “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2013/nov/13/prince-charles-65-heir-king-revolution\">A quiet constitutional revolution is afoot</a>.”</p> \n<p>But this is likely to be the only glimpse the British public gets of Charles’ correspondence with ministers. Since the original Guardian request to see the letters the government has tightened up the Freedom of Information Act to provide an <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/12/prince-charles-black-spider-memos-letters-published\">“absolute exemption” on all requests relating to the Queen</a> and the heir to the throne. </p> \n<p>Paul Flynn, a Labour MP and member of the political and constitutional reform committee, said the letters lifted the lid on the activity of the “the lobbyist supreme in the land”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/13/prince-keeps-his-fists-in-a-velvet-gloves-but-does-not-pull-his-punches\">Prince keeps his fists in velvet gloves – but does not pull his punches</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“They show he is putting forward a whole variety of views – including many bad science views and others that should have no more weight than the man down the pub,” he said. “We can see his views were given a seriousness and priority they did not deserve.”</p> \n<p>Prince Charles was said to be “disappointed” the principle of confidentiality had not been maintained, and his spokeswoman said publication “can only inhibit his ability to express the concerns and suggestions which have been put to him in the course of his travels and meetings”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/ng-interactive/2015/may/13/read-the-prince-charles-black-spider-memos-in-full\">Read the Prince Charles 'black spider' memos in full</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But aides argue the letters do not show the prince engaging in matters of party political contention, implying they do not breach the principle of political neutrality.</p> \n<p>“The letters published by the government show the Prince of Wales expressing concern about issues that he has raised in public,” his spokeswoman said. “In all these cases, the Prince of Wales is raising issues of public concern, and trying to find practical ways to address the issues.”</p> \n<p>But the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Alan Rusbridger, said: “We fought this case because we believed – and the most senior judges in the country agreed – that the royal family should operate to the same degrees of transparency as anyone else trying to make their influence felt in public life. The attorney general, in trying to block the letters, said their contents could ‘seriously damage’ perceptions of the prince’s political neutrality. </p> \n<p>“Whatever the rights and wrongs of that assessment, it is shocking that the government wasted hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money trying to prevent their publication. Now, after 10 years, we are pleased to be able to share the contents of his correspondence and let people draw their own conclusions.”</p> \n<p>Graham Smith, chief executive of Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, said: “These letters are only a small indication of widespread lobbying that’s been going on for years. We now need full disclosure and an assessment of his impact on government policy.”</p> \n<p>Maurice Frankel, director of the UK Campaign for Freedom of Information, said: “The release of the Charles memos represents a major victory for the freedom of information process, showing that ministers cannot block disclosure simply because they don’t like the result.”</p> \n<p>Michael Meacher, a former Labour environment secretary who received private letters from Charles about policy, called for a new system of transparency around his correspondence with ministers when he becomes king to “remove public suspicion from the process”.</p> \n<p>“A brief statement would be made when the king has written to a minister and the subject would be obvious,” he said. “At least we would know he has been giving his opinions and, some would say, lobbying ministers.”</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2b016f14d9786cd85b2ade2cb21ed234bf6b4dbc/0_0_4884_2928/4884.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2928,"width":4884,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"AFP/Getty/Guardian","altText":"Prince Charles Composite","cleanCredit":"Photograph: AFP/Getty/Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T19:27:17Z","lastModified":"2015-05-14T06:10:34Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Robert Booth","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/robertbooth"},{"name":"Matthew Taylor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/matthewtaylor"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Prince Charles letters","Prince Charles","Tony Blair","Alan Rusbridger","Monarchy","Politics","UK news","Freedom of information","Lobbying","Law","Badgers","Alternative medicine","Environment","Health & wellbeing","Life and style","Media","Wildlife","Animals"],"tags":[{"id":"uk-news/prince-charles-letters","webTitle":"Prince Charles letters"},{"id":"uk/prince-charles","webTitle":"Prince Charles"},{"id":"politics/tonyblair","webTitle":"Tony Blair"},{"id":"media/alanrusbridger","webTitle":"Alan Rusbridger"},{"id":"uk/monarchy","webTitle":"Monarchy"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/freedomofinformation","webTitle":"Freedom of information"},{"id":"politics/lobbying","webTitle":"Lobbying"},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law"},{"id":"environment/badgers","webTitle":"Badgers"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/alternative-medicine","webTitle":"Alternative medicine"},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"environment/wildlife","webTitle":"Wildlife"},{"id":"world/animals","webTitle":"Animals"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-456719226","source":"guardian.co.uk","durationInSeconds":107,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10361065&format=video/m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/05/13/150513SpiderMemos_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/5/13/1431538629563/KP_222581_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Black Spider memo release -

worry over education one of the leading causes of concern for children.</p> \n<p>The NSPCC said last year that its ChildLine service received record numbers of approaches from students worried about exams, with a tripling in the number of those receiving counselling over exam stress specifically.</p> \n<p>In 2013-14 ChildLine said it received more than 34,000 approaches from young people over school worries such as revision, workloads, problems with teachers and other issues, putting education into the top 10 of most frequent concerns among users for the first time.</p> \n<aside

\n</aside> \n<p>Where school and education was given as a young person’s main concern, more than half of subsequent counselling sessions dealt with exam stress specifically, a 200% increase compared with 2012-13.</p> \n<p>The NSPCC also said that there were also more than 87,500 visits to ChildLine’s website over the same issue.</p> \n<p>The charity said that one teenage boy told an adviser last year: “I am about to take my GCSEs and I am under so much pressure as my parents are expecting me to do really well. I am going to revision classes and trying really hard but I feel like it is not good enough for them.</p> \n<p>“My parents don’t allow me to do anything else apart from revision and if I try and talk to them it always ends up in an argument.”</p> \n<p>The figures came as hundreds of thousands of pupils prepare to sit GCSE exams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, followed by many thousands more sitting A-levels.</p> \n<p>Even at primary school, pupils in their final year are taking key stage two tests, followed by key stage one assessments for those in year two.</p> \n<p>“The exam period can be a very stressful and anxious time for young people. As these figures reveal, the pressure to do well is being felt by an increasing number of young people across the country,” Peter Wanless, the NSPCC’s chief executive, said.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Department for Education in England said schools have a duty to support their pupils during times of pressure, and that good schools have strong networks in place to do so.</p> \n<p>“Tests are a key part of ensuring young people master the key skills and knowledge that will prepare them for life in modern Britain. However, we have taken real steps to ensure pupils are not on a constant treadmill of revision and testing, including scrapping January modules, decoupling AS-levels and removing resits from league tables,” the DfE said.</p> \n<p>Overall, family relationships were the most common concern cited by young people using the service in 2013-14, while “depression and unhappiness” were the major worries for children in 2012-13.</p> \n<p>One reason for the rise in exam stress could be nervousness on the part of teachers who face being judged by Ofsted inspectors if results dip below government targets, according to the National Union of Teachers.</p> \n<p>“We must all listen to what the children calling ChildLine are saying about exam-related stress. NUT-commissioned research has revealed increases in anxiety, stress and disaffection among pupils as well as a negative impact on the quality of the teacher-pupil relationship because of the level of pressure on schools,” said Christine Blower, the NUT’s general secretary.</p> \n<p>“It is possible to draw a link between increased stress and exam reform and the accountability framework under which schools are ranked and measured. England’s children are some of the most tested in the world – and doctors, teachers and parents want change.”</p> \n<p>Schools are also testing pupils more frequently to prepare for exams. A survey last year – by a company that sells security seals used for exam papers – found that many secondary schools made pupils sit mock exams within a month of the summer holiday’s ending.</p>","section":"Education","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431541299848/29921ce8-acb9-483a-a4fe-94633dbeedda-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Davies/PA","altText":"Young people taxing exams","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Davies/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T23:05:06Z","lastModified":"2015-05-14T00:00:35Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":207,"contributors":[{"name":"Richard Adams","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/richardadams"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Exams","Education","Children","Schools","UK news","Child protection","GCSEs"],"tags":[{"id":"education/exams","webTitle":"Exams"},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education"},{"id":"society/children","webTitle":"Children"},{"id":"education/schools","webTitle":"Schools"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"society/childprotection","webTitle":"Child protection"},{"id":"education/gcses","webTitle":"GCSEs"}],"section":{"id":"education"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Richard Adams","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/richardadams"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"education"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/may/14/calls-to-childline-over-exam-stress-break-records","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48qx7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/education/2015/may/14/calls-to-childline-over-exam-stress-break-records","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/may/14/calls-to-childline-over-exam-stress-break-records"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431541299848/29921ce8-acb9-483a-a4fe-94633dbeedda-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"ChildLine said it received more than 34,000 approaches from young people in 2013-14 over school worries such as revision, workloads and problems with teachers.

Meanwhile independent broadcasters were hit by rocket and grenade attacks.</p> \n<p>Burundi had been a tinderbox since the sudden announcement by general Godefroid Niyombare, a former intelligence chief fired three months ago, that Nkurunziza had been ousted after weeks of deadly civil unrest sparked by the president’s bid to stand for a third term.</p> \n<p>Thousands of people took to the streets to celebrate but the military appears split between pro and anti-Nkurunziza factions. In the early hours of Thursday morning, armed forces chief general Prime Niyongabo, a supporter of the president, declared on state radio: “The coup attempt failed, loyal forces are still controlling all strategic points. The national defence force calls on the mutineers to give themselves up.”</p> \n<p>Then a spokesman for the anti-Nkurunziza camp, Burundi’s police commissioner Venon Ndabaneze, dismissed the claim and said Niyombare’s supporters were in control of many key points including Bujumbura’s international airport. “This message does not surprise us because the general has long been allied to the forces of evil and lies,” he told AFP.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78b2dc892f287374670ae1c0b05362ee6cfc4ef8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431592064062/345e85a1-949a-4566-b9e3-f8dc117996c7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A anti-Nkurunziza's protester gestures in front of a burning barricade in Bujumbura.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A anti-Nkurunziza’s protester gestures in front of a burning barricade in Bujumbura.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GORAN TOMASEVIC/REUTERS</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A journalist inside the state TV and radio building said it came under attack after the loyalist broadcast, and that heavy weapons including cannon and rockets were being used.</p> \n<p>Private media were also caught up in the violence. The influential African Public Radio station, which was shut down during the weeks of protests and reopened after the coup attempt, was hit by a rocket and was ablaze, witnesses said.</p> \n<p>A grenade attack seriously damaged the building of Renaissance TV, where Niyombare made his coup statement, according to the station’s director, Innocent Muhozi. One of his offices was also burned overnight, he told the Associated Press.</p> \n<p>Augustin Ndikuriyo, an entrepreneur based in Bujumbura, said: “Last night we heard some guns shooting all the night until morning. It was a mix of heavy guns and small weapons. Now we don’t know what’s happening because no one can go outside. People are staying in their homes.”</p> \n<p>He added: “I believe the situation will be calm in coming hours: I think those ones who kicked him away have plenty of reasons. I think they will be supported by the majority of the army.”</p> \n<p>The whereabouts of the 51-year-old president remain unclear. He attempted to fly back from a summit in Tanzania, where regional leaders were discussing the situation in Burundi, but the airport had been closed to stop him from landing. His plane reportedly returned to Tanzania.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"036797b362f43ff5a9db7bef3a67de82a3b40f46\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431592314559/d94ba2a1-d98a-41d9-b375-a5c24c156cce-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"People walk in a street in Bujumbura.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk in a street in Bujumbura.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GORAN TOMASEVIC/REUTERS</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The violence leaves Burundi facing its worst crisis since the end of a 12-year ethnically charged civil war in 2006 that left hundreds of thousands dead. The peace accord ensured that the future army would be split 50-50 between minority Tutsis and majority Hutus.</p> \n<p>The attempted coup has caused international alarm. East African leaders attending the summit in Tanzania said in a joint communique: “The region will not accept nor stand by if violence does not stop or escalates in Burundi.”</p> \n<p>Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, chairperson of the African Union commission, said: “The chairperson condemns in the strongest terms today’s coup attempt in Bujumbura, calls for the return to constitutional order and urges all stakeholders to exercise utmost restraint.”</p> \n<p>The US urged Burundians to “lay down arms, end the violence and show restraint”, while the European Union which warned it was “essential the situation does not spin out of control”.</p> \n<p>UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon also made an urgent appeal for calm, while the security council said it would hold an emergency meeting on the situation on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Nkurunziza, a former rebel leader from the Hutu majority and born-again Christian, believes he ascended to the presidency in 2005 with divine backing.</p> \n<p>Opposition and rights groups insist that it is unconstitutional for Nkurunziza to run for more than two terms. The president, however, argues his first term did not count as he was elected by parliament, not directly by the people. This was supported by the constitutional court, although one of the judges fled the country, claiming its members were subject to death threats.</p> \n<p>More than 22 people have been killed and scores wounded since late April, when Burundi’s ruling CNDD-FDD party nominated Nkurunziza to stand for re-election in elections due on 26 June.</p> \n<p>More than 50,000 Burundians have fled the violence to Rwanda and other neighbouring nations in recent weeks, with the UN preparing for thousands more refugees.</p> \n<p>Dr Robert Besseling, principal Africa analyst at the London-based risk consultancy IHS, said: “While it is too early to confirm that the coup attempt has been successful, factional fighting between rival ethnic groups in the military and police is likely to erupt and increase the probability of a civil war. The highest risk of ethnic fighting over the next few days will be in Bujumbura, overpopulated rural areas and internally displaced people’s camps along the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzanian borders.</p> \n<p>“The Imbonerakure, a youth militia affiliated to the CNDD-FDD, is likely to be deployed against ethnic Tutsi and to stage targeted political assassinations of Tutsi leaders and attacks on Tutsi groups. Retaliatory attacks by ethnic Tutsi are likely against government buildings and CNDD-FDD assets and supporters. Expatriates or foreign assets are less likely targets.”</p> \n<p><br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/00040bafb1fc3d398b0bc38fcb41857e3574b84f/0_85_2625_1576/2625.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1576,"width":2625,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Goran Tomasevic/Reuters","altText":"A detained protester cries in front of a burning barricade during a protest against President Pierre Nkurunziza's decision to run for a third term in Bujumbura, Burundi May 13, 2015.

We will consider these ideas, weighing them against the various constraints within which we have to work –operationally and from a data protection standpoint.”</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/17/1410953759538/abe43538-45f6-49d4-b035-15d27501e4ae-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"ANDREA COMAS/Reuters","altText":"Shadows of members of a panel are seen on a wall before a meeting about the \"right to be forgotten\"","cleanCredit":"Photograph: ANDREA COMAS/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-14T08:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-05-14T08:22:33Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2,"contributors":[{"name":"Jemima Kiss","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/24/1400942620317/Jemima-Kiss-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jemimakiss"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Right to be forgotten","Google","Technology","Search engines","Europe","Court of justice of the European Union","Internet","Law"],"tags":[{"id":"technology/right-to-be-forgotten","webTitle":"Right to be forgotten"},{"id":"technology/google","webTitle":"Google"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"},{"id":"technology/searchengines","webTitle":"Search engines"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"law/european-court-of-justice","webTitle":"Court of justice of the European Union"},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet"},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law"}],"section":{"id":"technology"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jemima Kiss","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jemimakiss"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"technology"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/14/google-right-to-be-forgotten-academics-letter","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48pav","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/technology/2015/may/14/google-right-to-be-forgotten-academics-letter","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/14/google-right-to-be-forgotten-academics-letter"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/17/1410953759538/abe43538-45f6-49d4-b035-15d27501e4ae-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Shadows of members of a panel are seen on a wall before a meeting about the ‘right to be forgotten’ Photograph: Andrea Comas/Reuters","credit":"Andrea Comas/Reuters","altText":"Shadows of members of a panel are seen on a wall before a meeting about the \"right to be forgotten\"","cleanCaption":"Shadows of members of a panel are seen on a wall before a meeting about the ‘right to be forgotten’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andrea Comas/Reuters"}},"importance":1,"showQuotedHeadline":false}],"lastModified":"2015-05-14T08:37:35Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/uk-alpha/news/regular-stories","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/uk-alpha/news/regular-stories"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"uk-alpha/news/regular-stories/front"}
