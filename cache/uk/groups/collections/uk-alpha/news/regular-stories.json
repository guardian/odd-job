weekend of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/12/greek-crisis-european-leaders-begin-talks-with-views-split-over-agreement\">high tension</a> that threatened to break Europe in two climaxed on Sunday at a summit of eurozone leaders in Brussels where the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, presented Tsipras with an ultimatum.</p> \n <p>The ultimatum - debated over more than 15 hours - entailed a series of draconian measures as the price of avoiding financial collapse and being ejected from the single currency bloc.</p> \n <p>Tsipras acquiesced in most of the fiscal rigour demanded of him in four pages of summary instructions drafted by eurozone finance ministers.</p> \n <p>But as Monday morning broke over Brussels, he was still resisting the creditors’ demands on two key points: on having the International Monetary Fund (IMF) involved in a proposed new three-year bailout, and on a controversial German demand for Greece to park €50bn (&pound;36bn) in assets outside Greece, probably in Luxembourg, to serve as collateral for fresh loans and to provide privatisation proceeds to be used for debt servicing.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/live/2015/jul/12/greek-debt-crisis-eu-leaders-meeting-cancelled-no-deal-live\"><br

Demands that the controversial reforms be approved by the Greek government and enacted into law by Wednesday were described as “utter blackmail” by leading party members and met with stunned disbelief. </p> \n<p>Although sources close to prime minister Alexis Tsipras said the leader was now determined to do whatever was needed to keep Grexit at bay, political tumult also beckoned. Insiders conceded that a cabinet reshuffle – removing those ministers who had refused to vote the austerity package through parliament early Saturday – could come as early as Monday.</p> \n<p><strong>“What is sure is that we are going to have dramatic political developments,” said Nikos Bistis, a veteran politician from the centre left. “Basically Syriza is now split in two.” </strong></p> \n<p>By late Sunday it had become clear Tsipras’ u-turn, accepting measures he had once furiously spurned, had produced a tectonic split with potentially far-reaching consequences. In addition to suffering an unexpected loss of support with 17 MPs breaking ranks at the weekend – defections that strip his government of a working majority – 15 other lawmakers also indicated that they would not approve the agreement in its entirety when it was brought to the 300-seat House.</p> \n<p>The MPs, who included two ministers, said they were radically opposed to endorsing an austerity programme that was not only ideologically at odds with their own beliefs but would exacerbate “the country’s agonising and tragic social economic problems.”</p> \n<p><strong>The resistance raises the spectre of Tsipras being forced to call fresh elections – a move described as potentially catastrophic for the country. </strong></p> \n<p>“Greece can bend up to a point,” said Aristides Hatzis, a prominent political commentator. “But after that there is no bending, only breaking. The breaking point may well come when Tsipras realises he has lost most of his parliamentary group.”</p> \n<p>The embattled prime minister will also face substantial resistance from the parliament’s speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou in getting the policies fast-tracked through the House. </p> \n<p>A Syriza hardliner, Kostantopoulou said at the weekend: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“the government is being blackmailed.

On Thursday, questions will be asked on the ECB’s next steps on intervention, including any role in transitioning to a separate currency.</p> \n <p>Perhaps more significant will be comments Mr Draghi will no doubt make on how ECB policy can limit Grexit contagion to financial markets and eurozone economies more generally. We should expect reassurances on the extent of the policy firewall in place, including the OMT program, the EFSF and QE. On the latter, Mr Draghi pointed out that if circumstances allow, the Governing Council would “reconsider the size, the timing, the design of the [QE] programme”.</p> \n <p>Contagion seems limited so far – for example, alongside encouraging eurozone-wide indicators, peripheral bond yields have not blown out (Spanish and Italian 10-year sovereign bond yields are both at 2.2%).

The funding gaps are way beyond anything we’ve seen so far,” he said.</p> \n <p>The hard line was echoed by Peter Kazimir, finance minister of Slovakia, who said that new austerity measures tabled by Athens were already past their sell-by date.</p> \n <p>The eurozone has been united for five months in the negotiations with Tsipras, but with the stakes rising greatly in the last 10 days, major divisions have surfaced, with the French working tirelessly to save Greece and the hardliners now pushing Greece’s expulsion for the first time openly.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/11/greece-euro-exit-bailout-alexis-tsipras\">Greece nears euro exit as bailout talks break up without agreement</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><em><strong>We’ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....</strong></em></p>","postType":"summary"},{"id":"block-55a22d46e4b05111b7559b75","title":"Tusk cancels EUCO summit","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-12T09:10:43Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T09:11:04Z","body":"<p><strong>European Council president Donald Tusk has cancelled tonight’s meeting of all 28 EU heads of state and government.</strong></p> \n<p>That meeting was meant to be THE decisive event, where leaders could potentially have planned for Greece’s exit from the single currency.</p> \n<p>However, eurozone leaders will still meet, from 3pm BST (5pm if you’re in Greece).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/statuses/620138459236311040\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I have cancelled <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EUCO?src=hash\">#EUCO</a> today. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EuroSummit?src=hash\">#EuroSummit</a> to start at 16h and last until we conclude talks on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a></p>— Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/620138459236311040\">July 12, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>It underlines just how bad yesterday’s Eurogroup meeting was.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/traynorbrussels/statuses/620149718006517760\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/greece?src=hash\">#greece</a> saturday was the ugliest, most depressing day in bxl for a v long time. sunday better or worse?</p>— Ian Traynor (@traynorbrussels) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/traynorbrussels/status/620149718006517760\">July 12, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-55a2303ee4b07fc6a121fb4c","title":"Italy blames lack of trust","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-12T09:17:53Z","body":"<p><strong>My colleague Jennifer Rankin is back outside the Eurogroup meeting, as ministers arrive.</strong></p> \n<p>Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy’s finance minister, has blamed the ‘lack of trust’ with Greece, she reports.</p> \n<p> He’d like to see Athens rebuilt it, by taking measures in the Greek parliament this week.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/statuses/620150060651642880\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Italy's fin min Padoan: main obstacle to moving forward is lack of trust, wants to see Gk gov rebuild trust. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a></p>— Jennifer Rankin (@JenniferMerode) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/status/620150060651642880\">July 12, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-55a23188e4b07fc6a121fb4e","title":"Slovakia: Not possible to reach a deal today","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-12T09:26:06Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T09:34:24Z","body":"<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KazimirPeter\">Peter Kažim&iacute;r</a>, Slovakia’s finance minister, has ruled out a Greek deal today.</strong></p> \n<p>It’s just not possible, he says, citing the “breach of trust” between the eurozone and the Greek government. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/statuses/620154513958137856\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Slovakia's fin min Peter Kazimir: &quot;it's not possible to reach a deal today.&quot;</p>— Jennifer Rankin (@JenniferMerode) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/status/620154513958137856\">July 12, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>But he also suggests that “front-loading” Greece’s reform package could help rebuild trust.

Demands that the controversial reforms be approved by the Greek government and enacted into law by Wednesday were described as “utter blackmail” by leading party members and met with stunned disbelief. </p> \n<p>Although sources close to prime minister Alexis Tsipras said the leader was now determined to do whatever was needed to keep Grexit at bay, political tumult also beckoned. Insiders conceded that a cabinet reshuffle – removing those ministers who had refused to vote the austerity package through parliament early Saturday – could come as early as Monday.</p> \n<p><strong>“What is sure is that we are going to have dramatic political developments,” said Nikos Bistis, a veteran politician from the centre left. “Basically Syriza is now split in two.” </strong></p> \n<p>By late Sunday it had become clear Tsipras’ u-turn, accepting measures he had once furiously spurned, had produced a tectonic split with potentially far-reaching consequences. In addition to suffering an unexpected loss of support with 17 MPs breaking ranks at the weekend – defections that strip his government of a working majority – 15 other lawmakers also indicated that they would not approve the agreement in its entirety when it was brought to the 300-seat House.</p> \n<p>The MPs, who included two ministers, said they were radically opposed to endorsing an austerity programme that was not only ideologically at odds with their own beliefs but would exacerbate “the country’s agonising and tragic social economic problems.”</p> \n<p><strong>The resistance raises the spectre of Tsipras being forced to call fresh elections – a move described as potentially catastrophic for the country. </strong></p> \n<p>“Greece can bend up to a point,” said Aristides Hatzis, a prominent political commentator. “But after that there is no bending, only breaking. The breaking point may well come when Tsipras realises he has lost most of his parliamentary group.”</p> \n<p>The embattled prime minister will also face substantial resistance from the parliament’s speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou in getting the policies fast-tracked through the House. </p> \n<p>A Syriza hardliner, Kostantopoulou said at the weekend: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“the government is being blackmailed.

emergency voting procedure potentially coming into play as eurozone splits widen, how do member states line up on the idea of expelling Greece?</p>","byline":"Jennifer Rankin in Brussels","body":"<p><br />As emergency talks drag on, the prospect of Greece tumbling out of the currency union is dividing Europe like never before.</p> \n<p>After five years of battling to keep Greece in the eurozone, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, is now warning that there cannot be a deal at any cost. A German government paper floated the idea of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/11/greece-euro-exit-bailout-alexis-tsipras\">expelling Greece from the eurozone for at least five years</a>. But France and Italy argue that Greece must be kept in the currency union, fearing Grexit would be a historic mistake that would damage the credibility of the entire European Union.</p> \n<p>Several countries that have recently emerged from their own painful austerity bailouts, such as Portugal and Ireland, want to ensure Greece signs up to credible reforms to get further help.</p> \n<p>Even if eurozone leaders agree on Sunday night to open talks on a €86bn (&pound;62bn)bailout for Greece, some national parliaments could still oppose the plan. Finland is certain to reject another bailout for Greece to avoid a schism that could topple its two-month-old government.</p> \n<p>Finland’s refusal could embolden other eurozone members to block a deal, especially those in central Europea and the Baltic, which are proving to be the fiercest critics of the Greek government. Lithuania has hit out at what the Lithuanian president, Dalia Grybauskaitė, called Greece’s “<em>ma&ntilde;ana</em>” approach to negotiations; Slovakia fears the eurozone could become a “zombie” area if Greece stays.</p> \n<p>Potentially, eurozone governments could override Finland, or another small country, by resorting to an <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2012/07/02/1067541/its-an-esmergency/\">emergency voting procedure </a>that requires only 85% of eurozone governments to support a bailout. But this could be politically explosive, as well as uncharted legal terrain. To use the special voting rule, eurozone leaders would have to agree that “the economic and financial sustainability” of the eurozone is at stake. But many governments have spent weeks arguing exactly the opposite.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/grexit_map-zip/giv-21277LGVnnLhbVHuV\" data-alt=\"grexit map\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/grexit_map-zip/giv-21277LGVnnLhbVHuV\">grexit map</a> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Open to Grexit</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Germany</strong>: Angela Merkel has long sought to avoid going down in history as the German chancellor who presided over the breakup of the eurozone.

But Ireland has swallowed its own bitter austerity medicine and is keen to ensure Greece does not get a no-strings bailout.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p><strong>Cyprus</strong>: With memories of its own chaotic €10bn bailout in 2013 still fresh, Cyprus hopes Greece will stay in the eurozone, but would like to see further reforms.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Slovenia</strong>: Slovenia would like Greece to remain in the eurozone, but would like to see Athens sign up to verifiable reform measures to regain trust.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Estonia</strong>: Along with its Baltic neighbours, Estonia has also taken a tough line with Greece.

She is due to address a meeting of Labour MPs on Monday night on the issue.

Harman’s aides said the issues had been discussed with the shadow cabinet and she had informed leadership candidates. The aides said votes were imminent on the budget this week and the new welfare bill before the summer recess so some decisions were inescapable.</p> \n<p>Burnham raised objections at the shadow cabinet, but Harman reminded the shadow health secretary that Labour had lost two elections.</p> \n<p>It now appears Labour’s shift on welfare will be more limited in the short term. Harman’s aides were forced to acknowledge that the key parliamentary vote on limiting tax credits to the first two children will not happen until a committee stage in the autumn after a new leader has been elected.</p> \n<p>Chris Leslie, the shadow chancellor, also said Labour would vote against the budget resolution on Tuesday due to the scale of the tax credits cuts announced. Labour is likely to abstain on the welfare bill and will press for changes on the household benefit cap so carers and the disabled are excluded. Labour will also oppose plans to cut the value of the employment support allowance.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Families are suffering enough.

Families are suffering enough. We shouldn’t play the government’s political games when the welfare of children is at stake.”</p> \n<p>The Burnham camp said: “Andy opposes cuts to child tax credits. These are paid to people who are doing the right thing and working hard to make ends meet. These tax credit changes are regressive, they are wrong, they hit families in work and Andy opposes them.”</p> \n<p>Cooper’s team said: “Yvette has made clear from the start that she does not believe the best way to reduce the deficit is to hit working families, reduce work incentives and push more children into poverty.

He will also warn that threats are likely to come from cyberspace.</p> \n<p>The prime minister discussed his views with the defence chiefs last week after the budget, and on Monday he will visit RAF Waddington, from where Reaper drone missions are flown over Iraq and Syria.</p> \n<p>On the visit, Cameron will say: “Now we know how much we will spend, what matters next is how we spend it. I have tasked the defence and security chiefs to look specifically at how we do more to counter the threat posed by Isil [Islamic State] and Islamist extremism.</p> \n<p>“This could include more spy planes, drones and special forces. In the last five years, I have seen just how vital these assets are in keeping us safe.” </p> \n<p>The visit will underline his determination to show that, although Britain is not yet involved in the air strikes under way in Syria due to the Commons vote to reject British involvement in 2013, the RAF is still active over the skies of Syria, providing air-to-air refuelling and surveillance assistance.</p> \n<p>Cameron has also signalled he is asking the interim Labour leader, Harriet Harman, and the shadow defence secretary, Vernon Coaker, to attend a meeting of the National Security Council to be briefed about the military position in Syria. </p> \n<p>The invitation is a further sign that Cameron wants to ask the Commons again to allow British air strikes in Syria. Labour, which already supports UK air strikes in Iraq, is shifting its thinking but is still doubtful that Cameron has a clear strategy. Britain opposes both chief protagonists in Syria – the president, Bashar al-Assad, and Isis, based in Raqqa. No government request to Labour will come at least until after the Labour leadership election is over in mid-September.</p> \n<p>Downing Street believes Russia is open to persuasion that Assad is no longer worth protecting, and could yet back a peaceful transition to a broad-based coalition. However, the UK has proved wrongly optimistic about Vladimir Putin’s willingness to abandon Assad in the past.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fc3d98869fec1e78785bfbb2c500d683aea66d43/0_96_5616_3366/5616.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3366,"width":5616,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Sillitoe for the Guardian","altText":"David Cameron will visit RAF Waddington, from where Reaper drone missions are flown over Iraq and Syria, on Monday.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-13T06:57:21Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T06:57:23Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":288,"contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Wintour","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/4/1423058528318/Patrick-Wintour-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patrickwintour"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["David Cameron","Defence policy","Syria","Islamic State","UK news","Politics"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"politics/defence","webTitle":"Defence policy"},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria"},{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Patrick Wintour","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/patrickwintour"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jul/13/david-cameron-drones-special-forces-top-defence-shopping-list","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4atb3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jul/13/david-cameron-drones-special-forces-top-defence-shopping-list","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/13/david-cameron-drones-special-forces-top-defence-shopping-list"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fc3d98869fec1e78785bfbb2c500d683aea66d43/0_96_5616_3366/5616.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3366,"width":5616,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"David Cameron will visit RAF Waddington, from where Reaper drone missions are flown over Iraq and Syria, on Monday.

Although it set at 10%, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/18/mexican-soda-tax-cuts-sales-first-year\">public health experts have recently reported that it is having an effect.</a> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2014/nov/15/berkeley-victory-soft-drinks-tax-obesity\">Berkeley in California also brought in a tax recently,</a> after a battle with food industry champions.</p> \n<p>“We know from experiences in other countries that taxation on unhealthy food and drinks can improve health outcomes, and the strongest evidence of effectiveness is for a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. If a tax of at least 20% is introduced, it could reduce the prevalence of obesity in the UK by around 180,000 people,” said Hollins.</p> \n<p>“We know that the majority of the UK population, particularly low-income households, are not consuming enough fruit and vegetables, so financial measures should also be considered to subsidise their price, which has risen by 30% since 2008. This is an important way to help redress the imbalance highlighted previously between the cost of healthy and unhealthy products, which particularly impacts on individuals and families affected by food poverty.”</p> \n<p>In 2011, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2011/oct/04/uk-obesity-tax-david-cameron\">David Cameron said the government was considering taxes on unhealthy foods</a>, which would include those high in sugars, salt and saturated fats,. But when the ife sciences minister George Freeman raised the issue recently, he was slapped down. Asked in May if a sugar tax was being considered, the prime minister’s spokesman said a definitive no. The government would be looking at other ways of tackling obesity, the spokesman said.</p> \n<p>The government has chosen to address obesity through the voluntary responsibility deal with the food industry, which asks companies to make pledges on measures such as labelling and cutting calories in their packaged food products.</p> \n<p>But the government’s scientific advisory committee on nutrition (SACN) will this week publish its final report on carbohydrates in the nation’s diet, including sugars . Its draft report a year ago, which went out to consultation, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2014/jun/26/limit-sugar-intake-one-can-soft-drink-advisers\">said the nation should halve its sugar intake</a>. Public Health England is now conducting a review into all the measures which might help, including fiscal measures. </p> \n<p>Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, confirmed taxation was part of the scope of their review in her response to the BMA report. “We have been reviewing the influences on peoples’ decisions to eat sugary food and drink, from marketing and promotions to reformulation and fiscal measures,” she said. “The government will consider our evidence over the coming months and we will publish it later this summer.”</p> \n<p>Hospital doctors who treat people with obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes, heart problems and cancer, supported the BMA’s call for tougher regulation. “The Royal College of Physicians agrees with the BMA that there needs to be a strong regulatory framework and concerted action across all government departments to work on the prevention of health harms arising from obesity and poor diets,” said Prof Jane Dacre, RCP president.</p> \n<p>“Although it is the NHS that is responsible for helping individual patients with the consequences of poor diets, the way to prevent this happening in the first place is to take action across the complex pattern of our lives – our environment, our transport, our leisure activities, our shopping and eating habits, and our education. Every government department should be not just passively aware of these issues, but actively producing policies to support the reduction in obesity and health harms.”</p> \n<p>The government confirmed it was not considering a sugar tax. “Tackling obesity is of great concern to this government, and we have already committed to producing a childhood obesity strategy,” said a spokesman for the Department of Health. “There is no silver bullet but we do want to see industry go further to cut the amount of sugar in food and drinks so that people can make healthier choices.</p> \n<p>“We have asked for expert advice about the amount of sugar we should be eating, which will be published soon, and this will be taken into account as we continue to work on our childhood obesity strategy.”</p> \n<p>The Food and Drink Federation said it shared the BMA’s concerns about the health of young people, who needed “better, more balanced diets and lifestyles”. But its director general, Ian Wright added: “Many foods and drinks are already taxed at 20%. Where additional taxes have been introduced they’ve not proven effective at driving long-term, lasting change to diets. We welcome Downing Street recently unequivocally ruling out a sugar tax and committing to a partnership approach to public health.”</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2cc40a4b2c453610660251a82865e452dae55478/0_0_3726_2232/3726.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2232,"width":3726,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Bobbie Lerryn / Alamy/Alamy","altText":"White sugar being sprinkled from a silver tea spoon<br>AXG36E White sugar being sprinkled from a silver tea spoon","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Bobbie Lerryn / Alamy/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-12T23:01:07Z","lastModified":"2015-07-12T23:05:11Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":422,"contributors":[{"name":"Sarah Boseley","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sarahboseley"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Obesity","Tax and spending","Food & drink industry","Health policy","Society","Business","Politics","Health","Public services policy","UK news","Health & wellbeing","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"society/obesity","webTitle":"Obesity"},{"id":"politics/taxandspending","webTitle":"Tax and spending"},{"id":"business/fooddrinks","webTitle":"Food & drink industry"},{"id":"politics/health","webTitle":"Health policy"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"society/policy","webTitle":"Public services policy"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sarah Boseley","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sarahboseley"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/13/doctors-tax-sugar-drinks-uk-obesity-bma-children","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ahgg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jul/13/doctors-tax-sugar-drinks-uk-obesity-bma-children","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/13/doctors-tax-sugar-drinks-uk-obesity-bma-children"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2cc40a4b2c453610660251a82865e452dae55478/0_0_3726_2232/3726.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2232,"width":3726,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Other countries have begun to experiment with sugar taxes, with Mexico’s the most far reaching.

He consulted lawyers before the meeting with army investigators.</p> \n<p>The footage – acquired by the Israeli human rights group B’Tselem – was recorded by a security camera on a nearby petrol station and, although it does not show the moment of the lethal shooting itself, shows the preceding seconds.</p> \n<p>In the grainy footage a figure believed to be Kasbeh can be seen among a group of youths running at the Israeli officer’s staff car as it passes and throwing a stone from close quarters.</p> \n<p>As the car brakes suddenly to a halt, the youths scatter out of camera shot and two soldiers at first exit the vehicle and give chase.</p> \n<p>The video appears to confirm multiple witness accounts supplied to investigating journalists and human rights works workers – including medical evidence – that Kasbeh, the third sibling in his family to be shot dead by the IDF in the past 15 years, was shot in the back.<br /></p> \n<p>Witnesses also claimed that after the shooting Shomer approached the dying teenager and kicked or pushed him with his foot. This is not apparent from the angle the video depicts.</p> \n<p>It appears to strongly contradict Shomer’s claims that the lives of himself and the soldiers with him in the car were in immediate danger, allowing him to respond with lethal force.</p> \n<p>In a statement released on Monday morning, B’Tselem said: “The claim that Kasbeh posed a mortal threat to the soldiers at the time of the shooting, having fled the scene, is unreasonable. </p> \n<p>“There is no doubt that the shattering of the jeep’s front window with a stone endangered the passengers when it happened. However, Kasbeh was shot in the back after the fact, when he was already running away and posing no ‘mortal threat’ to the soldiers. Feeling a sense of danger is not enough to justify any action.</p> \n<p>“The IDF … also noted that Col Shomer carried out suspect-arrest procedure. Yet this claim contradicts both the first claim, that Kasbeh posed an immediate threat, and the facts of the case: military open-fire regulations permit shooting at the legs of a suspect in order to facilitate his arrest. They do not permit killing him by firing three shots at his upper body.</p> \n<p>“The fact that the soldiers drove away without offering the injured youth any medical assistance runs counter to basic human morality. It is also a breach of military regulations, which require soldiers to ensure to the extent possible that persons injured by shooting receive medical assistance.”</p> \n<p>The shooting of Kasbeh took place early in the morning on 3 July at the Qalandiya checkpoint between Jerusalem and Ramallah after the teenager threw a stone at a military vehicle, breaking its windscreen but not injuring the occupants.</p> \n<p>According to the initial account by the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) – supported by several leading politicians who commended Shomer’s action – the soldiers driving the vehicle near the West Bank village of al-Ram, north of Jerusalem, came under attack from a hail of stones and boulders that shattered their windshield during a sustained attack.</p> \n<p>The case was unusual in that it involved such a senior officer and because political figures, including the rightwing education minister, Naftali Bennett, rushed to praise Shomer in the hours after the shooting.</p> \n<p>The emergence of the video came as it was announced that another Israeli brigade commander, Lt Col Neria Yeshurun, is under investigation by the country’s military advocate general for his actions during last summer’s Gaza war.</p> \n<p>Yeshurun – one of five senior officers reportedly under investigation from that conflict, according to Army Radio – ordered the shelling of a Palestinian medical centre allegedly in revenge for the killing of one of his officers by a sniper.<br /></p> \n<p>According to the Israeli media, he is expected to be questioned under caution by military police on Monday – becoming the first high-ranking IDF commander to undergo a serious criminal investigation for war crimes allegedly committed during the summer 2014 war.</p> \n<p> The Israeli military advocate-general decided to order a full criminal investigation after hearing an audio recording of internal army communication during the incident, which included an address delivered by Yeshurun in which he ordered his soldiers to shell the medical centre saying it was to avenge the dead officer’s death – in breach of the law of armed conflict.</p> \n<p>His lawyer has said it was a legitimate military target. </p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/59ae09c75f367690c7b696e708176c2f0ebee758/893_654_3319_1992/3319.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1992,"width":3319,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Emad Drimly/Xinhua Press/Corbis","altText":"MIDEAST-RAMALLAH-FUNERAL<br>03 Jul 2015 --- (150703) -- RAMALLAH, July 3, 2015 (Xinhua) -- Mourners carry the body of 17-year-old Palestinian Mohamed Hani al-Kasbeh during his funeral in the West Bank city of Ramallah on July 3, 2015.
