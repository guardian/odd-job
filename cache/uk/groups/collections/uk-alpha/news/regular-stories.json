Video of the aftermath showed medics using beach chairs as stretchers to carry away people in swimsuits.</p> \n<p>Chelli said of the gunman: “He had a parasol in his hand. He went down to put it in the sand and then he took out his Kalashnikov and began shooting wildly” </p> \n<p>He then entered the pool area of the Imperial Marhaba hotel before moving inside, killing people as he went.</p> \n<p>British tourist Gary Pine told AP he was on the beach with his wife around noon when heard the shooting. They shouted for their son to get out of the water, grabbed their bag and ran for the hotel. Their son told them he saw someone shot on the beach.</p> \n<p>There was “sheer panic” at the hotel, Pine said. “There were a lot of concerned people, a few people in tears with panic and a few people – older guests – they’d turned their ankles or there was a few little minor injuries and nicks and scrapes.”</p> \n<p>Elizabeth O’Brien, an Irish tourist who was with her two sons, told Irish Radio she was on the beach when the shooting began.</p> \n<p>“I thought, ‘Oh my God. It sounds like gunfire,’ so I just ran to the sea, to my children and grabbed our things” before fleeing to their hotel room, she said.</p> \n<p>The Health Ministry said the dead included Tunisians, British, Germans and Belgians, without giving a breakdown.</p> \n<p>The British foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said at least five Britons were killed but expected to toll to rise because a high proportion of the dead were believed to be British.</p> \n<p>Since overthrowing its secular dictator in 2011, Tunisia has been plagued by terrorist attacks, although only recently have they targeted the tourism sector, which makes up nearly 15% of GDP.</p> \n<p>Simon Calder, a London-based travel commentator, said: “The Foreign Office will declare the summer effectively over for Tunisia, and it will destroy – besides the lives taken – the tens of thousands of livelihoods who depend on tourism for a living.” Nearly half a million Britons visited Tunisia in 2014.</p> \n<p>Jonathan Hill, a professor of defence studies at King’s College in London, said the attacks were also a blow to Tunisia’s image as a stable, democratic nation emerging from its revolution in 2011.<br /></p> \n<p>“The terrorists are attacking Tunisia’s reputation,” he said. “Not just as a safe and welcoming destination for western holidaymakers, but as the one real success story to emerge out of the Arab spring.”</p> \n<p>Interpol offered investigative help in the wake of Friday’s violence. Its secretary-general, Juergen Stock, said the attacks “show the truly global dimension to current terrorist threats”.</p> \n<p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/df6317c15fda6126861ef57a9ca1bb46c589df66/0_85_672_404/672.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":404,"width":672,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Xinhua /Landov / Barcroft Media/Xinhua /Landov / Barcroft Media","altText":"Soldiers patrol around the attack site in Sousse, Tunisia, on Friday.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Xinhua /Landov / Barcroft Media/Xinhua /Landov / Barcroft Media"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-27T04:21:46Z","lastModified":"2015-06-27T07:42:40Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Tunisia","Tunisia","Islamic State","France","Middle East and North Africa","UK news","Wales","Ireland","Kuwait","Africa","Africa","Travel","Europe"],"tags":[{"id":"world/tunisia","webTitle":"Tunisia"},{"id":"travel/tunisia","webTitle":"Tunisia"},{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State"},{"id":"world/france","webTitle":"France"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk/wales","webTitle":"Wales"},{"id":"world/ireland","webTitle":"Ireland"},{"id":"world/kuwait","webTitle":"Kuwait"},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa"},{"id":"travel/africa","webTitle":"Africa"},{"id":"travel/travel","webTitle":"Travel"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-457285613","source":"Jawhara FM","durationInSeconds":36,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/26/150626tunisiabeach.m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/26/150626tunisiabeach_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/26/1435329749081/KP_326529_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Tunisia beach ","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Tunisia beach ","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Tunisia beach "}}],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/27/tunisia-prime-minister-to-shut-mosques-inciting-terrorism-as-isis-claims-attack","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a7vq","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/27/tunisia-prime-minister-to-shut-mosques-inciting-terrorism-as-isis-claims-attack","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/27/tunisia-prime-minister-to-shut-mosques-inciting-terrorism-as-isis-claims-attack"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/df6317c15fda6126861ef57a9ca1bb46c589df66/0_85_672_404/672.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":404,"width":672,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Soldiers patrol around the attack site in Sousse, Tunisia, on Friday.

The shots hit the marble floor, spraying Tom and his mother with shards of marble, wounding her in the ankle and catching Tom in the wrist.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know why he stopped. He could have killed everybody,” said Tom, from Cheshire. His mother spied a toilet door opposite them and threw herself in, with Tom following. Inside, they rushed to a cubicle and slammed the door. “It wasn’t much protection, the cubicle door wouldn’t have stopped him,” said Sam. Inside the cubicle, Tom unrolled toilet tissue to dress first his mother’s ankle wound, and then his wrist. </p> \n<p>Then they heard sobbing from the next cubicle. “There was a girl in there, maybe 25, she was badly wounded. She needed help, she was crying and she was all alone,” he said. He called for her to squeeze into their cubicle and she hobbled in, bleeding heavily from a marble fragment that was embedded in her thigh. </p> \n<p>Tom had no medical training, but decided it was vital to pull it out. “She had a big chunk of the [marble] tile in her leg.

Sam said: “People were out in the corridor, we could hear them, shouting ‘I’m dying’ but we couldn’t step out to see.” </p> \n<p>They stayed in the toilet for an hour, before soldiers arrived, led by an officer they described as “brilliant” for calming people down. “This army guy was brilliant, he put people at their ease,” said Tom. “Then there were just army people everywhere.”</p> \n<p>They were taken to hospital, and then reunited with Tom’s younger brother, Calum, who had been upstairs in his room watching TV when the shooting started. He went to the window, to see a gunman rushing into the hotel, but other tourists told him to stay on the upper floors. Amid praise for the staff, many were critical of the lack of security at the hotel, which had no armed officers on duty, despite the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/mar/18/eight-people-killed-in-attack-on-tunisia-bardo-museum\">massacre at the Bardot museum</a> in March and a string of battles between jihadists and security forces. “There was no security before,” said Sam. “I’ve been to Turkey, to Egypt, those countries have security,” she said. </p> \n<p>For Tunisia, the impact of the attack may be devastating. Fears were voiced after the Bardot attack that tourism, which employs 470,000 people, would be hit hard, but officials had hoped the museum attack would prove an isolated incident. </p> \n<p>More than 420,000 British tourists visited Tunisia last year, and with the economy depressed, the country had been hoping that numbers would continue this year. Now many fear there will be mass cancellations. </p> \n<p>Awaiting one of the evacuation flights due to leave for Manchester in the early hours of the morning, Tom said he is amazed he and his mother are still alive. “I just don’t know why he [the gunman] stopped, he could have killed everybody.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0138e6b80912c85955716954701dc84f9712e03a/197_520_3743_2246/3743.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2246,"width":3743,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chris Stephen/Chris Stephen","altText":"Sam Richards, left, and her son Tom Richards, from Cheshire.

Philip Hammond, the British foreign secretary, said the British death toll was likely to rise. </p> \n<p>James, a gas engineer from Trehafod, near Pontypridd, was hit in the shoulder, chest and hip as he put his body between Wilson and the gunman, and urged her to run for her life.</p> \n<p>“He took a bullet for me … I owe him my life because he threw himself in front of me when the shooting started,” she said.</p> \n<p>“We were just on the sunbeds, messing around and having a nice time when we heard these sounds. The shooting had started and there was a man with a gun opening fire all around. It is hard to remember just exactly what was going on. I only saw the one man in dark clothing but people were being shot.</p> \n<p>“Matthew put himself in front of me, then he was hit. He moved and the man shot him again. Again he tried to move and he was shot again. </p> \n<p>“He was shouting and blood was pouring out all over. I was screaming and it was chaos as more shots were coming out. We were down on the floor next to the sunbeds to shelter but the shots just kept on coming. He just told me to go, to look after our kids and that he loved me.</p> \n<p>“He was covered in blood from the shots, but he just told me to run away. I ran back, past bodies on the beach to reach our hotel. It was chaos – there was a body in the hotel pool and it was just full of blood.”</p> \n<p>After fleeing to the hotel, Wilson hid in a towel cupboard until it was safe to emerge. She then hunted for James on the beach for two hours until she learned he had been taken to hospital where he had life-saving surgery.</p> \n<p>“I was desperate to find out what had happened to Matthew but no one was around to help. It was so badly organised with no one to help and hardly anyone speaking English. I didn’t know if he was dead or alive. I was even looking under white sheets to see if it was his body.”</p> \n<p>James was being treated at a local hospital on Friday night.</p> \n<p>“I’ve been to the hospital intensive care and I’m just staying here on a chair now,” Wilson said. “His pelvis was shattered by the bullet and he also had a heart attack. But he is alive. I’m just praying we can get out of here as soon as we can. </p> \n<p>“There are bodies everywhere, some covered in blankets and some not. You can’t imagine how bad it is. I know just how lucky we are to be alive because I can see all the bodies of the people who are not.”</p> \n<p>The couple, who are planning to marry in 2017, had left their two children at home with their family when they set off to Sousse on 21 June for a two-week holiday.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/1239f8f294d2e038dad6d09424ebc39eb37effea/0_45_720_432/720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":432,"width":720,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Wales News Service/WALES NEWS SERVICE","altText":"Welsh holiday maker Matthew James who is in intensive care after being shot 3 times in the Tunisian beach massacre which left 27 dead.\r\rMatthew James was repeatedly shot as he used himself as a human shield to protect his fiancee Sarah.\r\rPictured here is Matthew and his partner Sarah Wilson.\r\r\r© WALES NEWS SERVICE","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Wales News Service/WALES NEWS SERVICE"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-26T22:41:05Z","lastModified":"2015-06-27T07:59:40Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Rebecca Ratcliffe","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rebecca-ratcliffe"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Tunisia","UK news","Africa","Middle East and North Africa","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/tunisia","webTitle":"Tunisia"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rebecca Ratcliffe","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rebecca-ratcliffe"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/26/tunisia-attack-british-man-has-surgery-after-shielding-fiancee-from-gunman","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a7v3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/26/tunisia-attack-british-man-has-surgery-after-shielding-fiancee-from-gunman","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/26/tunisia-attack-british-man-has-surgery-after-shielding-fiancee-from-gunman"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/1239f8f294d2e038dad6d09424ebc39eb37effea/0_45_720_432/720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":432,"width":720,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Matthew James, who is in intensive care after being shot three times, with his fiancee Saera Wilson.

Queues quickly formed outside banks around the capital.</p> \n<p>Prompted by the response, the government spokesman, Gavriel Sakellarides, insisted the plebiscite would not endanger Greece’s place in Europe. “The question is not whether we will remain in the eurozone. The Greek people should not be afraid,” he said in the early hours.</p> \n<p>But Tsipras, whose radical-left Syriza party was catapulted into power five months ago on a platform of eradicating austerity, did not hide his own feelings for the accord.</p> \n<p>Greeks, he said, were being subjected to “humiliation and blackmail”. “These proposals, which clearly violate the European rules and the basic rights to work, equality and dignity, show the purpose of some of the partners and institutions was not a viable agreement for all parties, but possibly the humiliation of an entire people,” he said.</p> \n<p> “But I personally pledge that I will respect the result of your democratic choice, whatever that may be.” The Greek parliament, in an emergency step, would convene on Saturday so that the referendum could be called in line with the constitution. Several ministers emerging from the cabinet session said they would not support the “barbaric measures” being demanded of Athens by foreign lenders.</p> \n<p>The energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, who heads Syriza’s militant wing known as the Left Platform, said he would support a no vote against measures that had resulted in the widespread “misery and pillaging” of the country since its debt crisis exploded five years ago. </p> \n<p>The recipient of €240bn in bailout funds – the biggest rescue programme in global financial history – Greece has seen its economy contract by more than a quarter, unemployment soar and poverty levels rise precipitously under the weight of draconian budget cuts and tax increased demanded by creditors. </p> \n<p>“It is a democratic decision and the Greek people are being called to give a democratic answer.

But there is one group that has historically felt unwelcome.</p> \n<p>Pride has had an uneasy relationship with the trans community. In 2008, trans participants were <a href=\"http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/07/06/review-trans-at-london-pride/\">denied access to toilets</a> by security staff. Some trans groups that marched last year turned their backs at the Stonewall delegation in protest at the group’s then refusal to advocate for trans rights.</p> \n<p>This year, animosity is healing and trans groups say for the first time they are starting to feel welcome at Pride.</p> \n<p>Trans rights are on the media agenda: reality TV’s Caitlyn Jenner was on the cover of Vanity Fair, Orange Is The New Black’s Laverne Cox has become a global superstar, and in the UK, boxing promoter Kellie Maloney is challenging perceptions about transition.

Our movement can't end | Chelsea Manning</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Most significantly for many, Stonewall’s new chief executive, Ruth Hunt, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/feb/16/stonewall-start-campaigning-trans-equality\">announced in February</a> that the charity would start working for trans equality, apologising for its past failure to do so.</p> \n<p>London-based group TransPals will be marching as an official participant for the first time this year with its sister organisation FTM London. “Pride has changed, this year does feel different,” said the group’s chair Patricia, who said she prefers to be referred to by her first name only.</p> \n<p>“I never wanted to go to Pride before last year, which was the first time we marched, and even then we didn’t have a group. We turned our backs on the Stonewall group as they passed, but this time we won’t have any of that.”</p> \n<p>This year the atmosphere around trans rights has changed “a heck of a lot”, she said, particularly within the LGBT community. “It feels now we are on the same level, we are working together because we all need the same thing, to live normal lives, to be happy, that’s our common goal.”</p> \n<p>Radio presenter Stephanie Hirst, one of the trans people honoured on the 2015 Pride Power list, said she would miss the parade but felt particularly “gutted” because it appears to be a momentous year for trans inclusion. She said: “There’s a real buzz that hasn’t been there in previous years. Trans isn’t a sexuality, I think that’s been a barrier in the past. But Pride is also about being yourself, celebrating who you are.”</p> \n<p>Stonewall said it was determined that this year it was not just making efforts to be inclusive at Pride London, but would also make sure it was represented at other upcoming trans-focused events. </p> \n<p>Ayaz Manji, the charity’s policy officer, said: “It’s great to see Pride events around the UK making a conscious effort to be more trans inclusive. However, the trans community lives through a number of struggles that lesbian, gay and bisexual people don’t face. </p> \n<p>“For this reason, it’s important for us to have trans specific Pride events like [Manchester march] Sparkle and Trans Pride in Brighton.” Stonewall plans to have a presence at both this year as part of its trans-inclusion efforts, he said. </p> \n<p>But there is still a lot of healing of the relationship between the gay community and trans people, said <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jane-fae\">Jane Fae</a>, a writer and campaigner on transgender equality. “We are moving at two different speeds, Pride feels like a celebration of rights than have been already won,” she said, describing the trans community as the “poor relation watching our gay cousins go to the ball”. </p> \n<p>“We have only been fighting the battle in public for a decade or so, where as the gay struggle has been for half a century. The gay community is now very respectable, there’s the pink pound, and all the big corporations want to be associated with Pride.</p> \n<p>“The reality is that we in the trans community have not won our battles yet, there’s a lot of fighting still to do on issues that do not affect the LGB part of the acronym – like medical ones, like unemployment.”</p> \n<p>Fae, who has been to several Pride marches in the past, said anger about incidents such as “toiletgate” in 2008 was still raw, and the relationship with Stonewall would take time to rebuild. She said: “I am not entirely positive. I think things will get better, or we may eventually take the decision that we can’t trust the relationship we have with the gay community, and we have to fight our battles alone.”</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/321ba78aab98ceb12839f4ddb653d69ae33a1097/0_0_3000_1799/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1799,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images","altText":"People march at Pride London in 2008","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-27T05:00:07Z","lastModified":"2015-06-27T05:33:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Jessica Elgot","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/6/26/1435313719448/Jessica-Elgot-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jessica-elgot"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Transgender","Society","UK news","Gender","London","LGBT rights"],"tags":[{"id":"society/transgender","webTitle":"Transgender"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/gender","webTitle":"Gender"},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London"},{"id":"world/lgbt-rights","webTitle":"LGBT rights"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jessica Elgot","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jessica-elgot"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/27/pride-london-2015-trans-community-stonewall-equality","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a6yz","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jun/27/pride-london-2015-trans-community-stonewall-equality","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/27/pride-london-2015-trans-community-stonewall-equality"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/321ba78aab98ceb12839f4ddb653d69ae33a1097/0_0_3000_1799/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1799,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Some trans groups turned their backs on the delegation from charity Stonewall at Pride London last year.

Forty-six years ago, almost to the day, a police raid here against public homosexuality – illegal in New York at the time – proved to be the last straw for a community all too used to oppression.</p> \n<p>This was their stand. Thousands took to the streets for days of unrest. Scores were arrested. Stonewall galvanised the community.

By noon, everyone was dancing. Love Generation played. Later, the streets were to be closed for a parade. This weekend is New York Pride, the festival of gay rights founded by members of the same movement that took their stand in 1969.</p> \n<p>Stacy Lentz is one of Stonewall’s owners. “People are going to party in the streets,” she told the Guardian. “It’s an incredible day for us and for LGBT people around the world. America finally has marriage equality!”</p> \n<p>Lentz said she cried “tears of joy” when she heard the news. </p> \n<p>“It lifts a stigma when the federal government recognises you as a full citizen,” she said. “I was elated.”</p> \n<p>Karen Schmiege had come to New York for Pride from Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Police brought floodlights into a heavily wooded area in Malone where they believed he was hiding and where Matt was killed.</p> \n<p>The shooting of the camper led officers to a cabin on Friday afternoon in Malone, where they discovered the smell of gunpowder, said Joseph D’Amico, superintendent of New York State Police. There were indications someone had recently been there and fled out the back door, he said.</p> \n<p>While searching the property, officers heard coughs and detected movement, and tactical teams came upon Matt in the woods. “They verbally challenged him, told him to put up his hands. And at that time, he was shot when he didn’t comply,” D’Amico said. A 20-gauge shotgun was found on Matt, who didn’t fire the weapon, D’Amico said. </p> \n<p>It wasn’t clear if Matt and Sweat were together at the time of the shooting, authorities said</p> \n<p>Malone is about 35 miles from the town of Dannemora, where the prison is located. As the search for Sweat continued, dozens of law enforcement vehicles converged on an area south of the town, 27 miles north-west of the prison.</p> \n<p>Matt was serving 25 years to life for the killing and dismembering of his former boss. Sweat was serving a sentence of life without parole in the killing of a sheriff’s deputy in Broome County in 2002. <br /></p> \n<p>A manhunt involving hundreds of state and federal law enforcement investigators has pursued Matt and Sweat since their elaborate escape from prison, pursuing more than 2,000 leads, mostly in vain. The two men used power tools to cut their way out of their cell and through heating pipes before emerging into a Dannemora street through a manhole cover.<br /></p> \n<p>Last week, searchers discovered <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/22/dna-trace-new-york-prison-escapees\">DNA matching one of the convicts in a burglarized cabin</a>, the first “confirmed lead” in the chase. Most of the search efforts have concentrated in the vicinity of the prison although last weekend searchers rushed to an area on the New York Pennsylvania border, after what was reported as a possible sighting of the men.</p> \n<p>Two people have been arrested and charged for actions related to the escape: civilian Joyce Mitchell and prison worker Gene Palmer. </p> \n<p>Palmer has been suspended without pay and is due to be arraigned in court on Monday, accused of bringing hacksaw blades and a screwdriver bit to Matt and Sweat. The blades and bit are alleged to have been hidden in frozen hamburger meat supplied by Mitchell, who faces criminal charges.</p> \n<p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f8a38b93e27b39a0b14a3c1164f0f4eca2eb28e5/0_0_963_578/963.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":578,"width":963,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"HANDOUT/Reuters","altText":"Escaped convict Richard Matt, 48, is pictured in this undated handout photo obtained released by the New York State Police.
