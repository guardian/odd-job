It is urgent to have these proposals so we can find a way out of this situation,” said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, after talks with her counterpart, the French president, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, on Monday night.</p> \n<p>Greek banks will stay shut on Tuesday and Wednesday, although it is far from clear they will be able to reopen on Thursday, as money drains out of the financial system.</p> \n<p>The European Central Bank raised the pressure on Greek banks on Monday night, by tightening access to emergency credit.</p> \n<p>The Frankfurt-based institution has pumped €89bn (&pound;63bn) into the Greek financial system in recent months, but Greek banks can only tap this emergency aid by putting up collateral, such as Greek government bonds.</p> \n<p>The bank said on Monday it was “adjust[ing] the haircuts accepted on collateral”, meaning that Greek assets are now deemed more risky, to secure smaller amounts of emergency funds. </p> \n<p>The level of emergency funding remains unchanged at €89bn, despite a plea from the central bank in Athens for an extra €3bn. The request was first reported by Bloomberg.</p> \n<p>The ECB said its governing council is “closely monitoring the situation in financial markets and the potential implications for the monetary policy stance and for the balance of risks to price stability in the euro area”.</p> \n<p>The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, pressed for capital controls to be lifted, when he spoke to the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, on Monday. After a hectic day of meetings with Greek party leaders, Tsipras also spoke to Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund. She told him the IMF was no longer able to provide money to Greece until it clears its arrears, following last week’s default on a €1.6bn loan repayment.</p> \n<p>Tsipras is expected to table new proposals to the eurozone summit to secure desperately needed financial aid. These “new” proposals are likely to be based on a plan he submitted last week, when he called for a €29bn two-year loan from the eurozone’s permanent bailout fund and promised to sign up to economic reforms that would bring further austerity to Greece.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Despite the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/06/yanis-varoufakis-why-greek-finance-minister-had-to-go\">departure of Greece’s outspoken finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis</a>, reaching a deal will not be easy. Germany’s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, who clashed often with Varoufakis, indicated the path ahead would be no easier for his successor.</p> \n<p>Euclid Tsakalotos, an Oxford-educated economics professor, was sworn in as Greek finance minister on Monday night, having already served as chief negotiator on the debt crisis for the Syriza-led government.</p> \n<p>The 19 finance ministers of the eurozone meet in Brussels at 1pm (noon BST) to prepare the way for the gathering of EU leaders scheduled for 6pm.<br /></p> \n<p>Hopes of a breakthrough are not high. Most bank analysts see a Greek exit from the eurozone as the most likely scenario.<br /></p> \n<p>The Fitch rating agency is not even expecting a deal by 20 July when Greece must make a €3.5bn debt repayment to the ECB. If Greece misses this payment, the ECB would most likely declare its banks insolvent, cut off all emergency aid, triggering a swift euro exit.</p> \n<p>Analysts at the Standard and Poor’s think the referendum result raised the chances that Greece will leave the eurozone, although the rating agency thinks the negative impact on other vulnerable economies in southern Europe would be limited.<br /></p> \n<p>“We think it’s more likely than not now that ‘Grexit’ would happen because it’s just so difficult for Tsipras to row back after such a victory to what was on the table before,” S&amp;P’s senior European sovereign analyst Moritz Kraemer told Reuters.</p> \n<p>However, he did not expect to be downgrading the credit ratings of other high-debt eurozone countries. <br /></p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/50293aeb29ba24c0a564556f2ed7e91b8ad2743f/0_182_5472_3283/5472.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3283,"width":5472,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Panayiotis Tzamaros/NurPhoto/Corbis","altText":"Newly appointed finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos (right) with outgoing Yanis Varoufakis.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Panayiotis Tzamaros/NurPhoto/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T06:58:20Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T08:15:38Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":378,"contributors":[{"name":"Jennifer Rankin","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jennifer-rankin"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Eurozone crisis","Greece","Angela Merkel","Banking","Business","Economics","Euro","Currencies","Europe","European Central Bank","European Union","European banks","Financial crisis","European monetary union","Financial sector","World news","International Monetary Fund (IMF)"],"tags":[{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis"},{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"},{"id":"world/angela-merkel","webTitle":"Angela Merkel"},{"id":"business/banking","webTitle":"Banking"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"business/euro","webTitle":"Euro"},{"id":"business/currencies","webTitle":"Currencies"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"business/european-central-bank","webTitle":"European Central Bank"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"business/europeanbanks","webTitle":"European banks"},{"id":"business/financial-crisis","webTitle":"Financial crisis"},{"id":"business/emu","webTitle":"European monetary union"},{"id":"business/financial-sector","webTitle":"Financial sector"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"business/imf","webTitle":"International Monetary Fund (IMF)"}],"section":{"id":"business"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jennifer Rankin","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jennifer-rankin"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"business"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/07/eurozone-calls-on-athens-to-get-serious-over-greece-debt-crisis","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ae3q","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/business/2015/jul/07/eurozone-calls-on-athens-to-get-serious-over-greece-debt-crisis","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/07/eurozone-calls-on-athens-to-get-serious-over-greece-debt-crisis"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/50293aeb29ba24c0a564556f2ed7e91b8ad2743f/0_182_5472_3283/5472.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3283,"width":5472,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Newly appointed finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos (right) with outgoing Yanis Varoufakis.

The European Central Bank put more pressure on the Greek system by tightening the rules for giving emergency funding. Michael Hewson at CMC Markets said:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>[The ECB move} is likely to<strong> </strong>increase criticism that the central bank is getting involved in exerting political pressure and acting beyond its mandate of price stability, and as lender of last resort, which any credible central bank should do as a matter of course. </p> \n <p> All the ECB has done is make it more likely that Greek banks will run out of money in a matter of days. Furthermore it remains highly unlikely that the Greek government will be able to make it to the next key payment deadline of 20<sup>th</sup> July when a €3.5bn bond to the ECB becomes repayable.</p> \n <p> While the departure of the polarising Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis is likely to mean that relations between the creditors and the Greek government are likely to improve, in reality the move changes nothing, particularly since attitudes in some parts of Europe appear to have hardened. </p> \n <p> The players may have changed but the problems remain the same and while European finance ministers have agreed to meet today to consider some new Greek proposals, the likelihood is that they are unlikely to be any more acceptable now than they would have been last week, particularly given that debt relief is likely to be one of the key demands from the Greece side.</p> \n <p> This would suggest that any new agreement remains unlikely which means that Greece may well be forced to issue its own currency in a matter of days. </p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"summary"},"blocks":[{"id":"block-559b85a4e4b00bdd277082f9","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-07T07:59:15Z","body":"<p>Greece’s stock market will remain closed until Wednesday according to <a href=\"http://www.hcmc.gr/en_US/web/portal/home\"><strong>the Greek Capital Markets Commission</strong></a>, in line with the extended bank holiday.</p>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-559b834ce4b00bdd277082f1","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-07T07:46:31Z","body":"<p>Twitter (Varoufakis quits announcement), Facebook (Italian prime minister’s latest view on what must be done), and now texting.

Now Europe’s surplus countries are trying to prop up its corpse</p>","byline":"Yanis Varoufakis","body":"<p>Bankruptocracy is as much a European predicament as it is an American “invention”. The difference between the experience of the two continents is that at least Americans did not have to labour under the enormous design faults of the eurozone. Imagine their chagrin if the citizens of hard-hit states (eg Nevada or Ohio) had to worry about a death embrace between the debt of their state and the losses of the banks who happened to operate within the state.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Europe's architecture was not sound enough to sustain the shock waves from the death throes of neoliberal capitalism</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Additionally, Americans were spared the need to contend with a central bank utterly shackled by inner divisions and the German central bank’s penchant for treating the worst-hit parts of the union (the eurozone, that is) as alien lands that had to be fiscally waterboarded until they ceased to obey the laws of macroeconomics.</p> \n<p>In the past two years, the debate in Europe has focused exclusively on issues that sound technical and minor: will there be “<a href=\"http://www.e-ir.info/2013/11/01/eu-conditionality-an-effective-means-for-policy-reform/\" title=\"\">conditionality</a>” attached to the purchases of Italian and Spanish bonds by the European Central Bank? Will the ECB supervise all of Europe’s banks, or just the “<a href=\"http://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/global-systemically-important-institutions\" title=\"\">systemic</a>” ones?</p> \n<p>These are questions that ought to be of no genuine interest to anyone other than those with a morbid interest in the interface between public finance and monetary policy. And yet these questions (and the manner in which they will be answered) will probably prove as important for the future of Europe as the treaties of <a href=\"http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/treaty-westphalia\" title=\"\">Westphalia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.history.co.uk/study-topics/history-of-ww2/treaty-of-versailles\" title=\"\">Versailles</a> or even <a href=\"http://www.civitas.org.uk/eufacts/FSTREAT/TR1.php\" title=\"\">Rome</a>. For these are the issues that will determine whether Europe holds together or succumbs to the vicious centrifugal forces that were unleashed by the crash of 2008.</p> \n<p>Even so, they are not issues that are worth expounding upon here. All they do is to reflect a tragic, underlying reality that can be described in simple lay terms without the use of any jargon whatsoever: Europe is disintegrating because its architecture was simply not sound enough to sustain the shockwaves caused by the death throes of what I call the Global Minotaur: the system of neoliberal capitalism centred on Wall Street, extracting tribute from the world after 1971.</p> \n<p>It is quite obvious that the insolvency of Madrid and Rome had nothing to do with fiscal profligacy (recall that Spain had a lower debt than Germany in 2008 and Italy has consistently smaller budget deficits) and everything to do with the way in which the eurozone’s macroeconomy relied significantly for the demand of its net exports on the Global Minotaur. Once the latter keeled over in 2008, and Wall Street’s private cash disappeared, two effects brought Europe to its knees.</p> \n<p>One was the sequential death-embrace of bankrupt banks and insolvent states (beginning with Greece, moving to Ireland, to Portugal and continuing until Italy and Spain were torn asunder). The other was the Minotaur’s simulacrum and its determination to hang on to its option of exiting the eurozone at will, therefore denying each and every rational plan for mending the currency union in a sustainable manner.</p> \n<p>The telling question thus becomes: why such resistance, particularly from Germany, to every idea that would end the euro crisis? The standard answer is that Germany does not wish to pay for the debts of the periphery and will resist all federal-like moves (eg a banking or a fiscal union) until it is convinced that its partners will behave responsibly with their German-backed finances. While this captures well the mindset of many northern Europeans, it is beside the point. Consider the following mental experiment, which, I believe, helps us unveil a deeper motive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59a5a0bafe62f78e9b14b60ce82392f00d4d9e0d\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/59a5a0bafe62f78e9b14b60ce82392f00d4d9e0d/0_0_3765_2258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Merkel and Sigmar Gabriel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Merkel and the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Kumm/dpa/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Picture the scene when a sheepish finance minister enters the chancellor’s Berlin office bearing a control panel featuring one yellow and one red button, and telling her that she must choose to press one or the other. This is how he explains what each button will do:</p> \n<h2>The red button<br /></h2> \n<p>If you press it, chancellor, the euro crisis ends immediately, with a general rise in growth throughout Europe, a <a href=\"https://www.bundesbank.de/Navigation/EN/Statistics/Public_finances/Maastricht_deficit_and_debt_level/maastricht_deficit_and_debt_level.html\" title=\"\">sudden collapse of debt for each member state to below its Maastricht limit</a>, no pain for Greek citizens (or for the Italians, Portuguese, etc), no guarantees for the periphery’s debts (states or banks) to be provided by German and Dutch taxpayers, interest rate spreads below 3% throughout the eurozone, a diminution in the eurozone’s internal imbalances, and a wholesale rise in aggregate investment.</p> \n<h2>The yellow button</h2> \n<p>If you press it, chancellor, the situation in the eurozone remains more or less as it is for a decade. The euro crisis continues to bubble along, albeit in a controlled fashion. While the probability of a break-up, which will be a calamity for Germany, remains non-trivial, the chances are that, if you push the yellow button, the eurozone will not break up (with a little help from the European Central Bank), German interest rates will remain extremely low, the euro will be nicely depressed (‘nicely’ from the perspective of German exporters), the periphery’s spreads will be sky-high (but not explosive), Italy and Spain will enter deeper into a debt-deflationary spiral that sees to a reduction of their national income by 15% over the next three years, France shall slip steadily into quasi-insolvency, GDP per capita will rise slowly in the surplus countries and fall precipitously in the periphery. As for the first “fallen” nations (Greece, Ireland and Portugal), they shall become little Latvias, or indeed Kosovos: devastated lands (after the loss of between 25% and 40% of national income, a massive exodus of their skilled labour) on which our people will holiday and buy cheap real estate. In aggregate, if you choose the yellow button, chancellor, eurozone unemployment will remain well above UK and US levels, investment will be anaemic, growth negative and poverty on the up and up.</p> \n<p>Which button do you think, dear reader, the chancellor would want to push?</p> \n<p>Whereas the yellow button would hold no attraction for the American president or the British prime minister, for the German chancellor the yellow button is a far more powerful option. Even if the chancellor wanted to opt for the red button, she would be terrorised by the reaction of the German electorate were she to do so. Letting the Greeks and the Italians, the Spaniards and the Portuguese, off the hook of their Great Depression so “easily” would be unlikely to win many votes east of the Rhine and north of the Alps.</p> \n<p>For two years now, the German public has become convinced that Germany has escaped the worst of the crisis because of its people’s virtuous embracing of thriftiness and hard work; in contrast to the spendthrift southerners, who, like the fickle grasshopper, made no provision for when the winds of finance would turn cold and nasty.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The Minotaur’s surplus recycling was essential to the maintenance of the eurozone’s faulty edifice</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>This mindset goes hand in hand with a moral righteousness which implants into good people’s hearts and minds a penchant for exacting punishment on the grasshoppers – even if punishing them also punishes themselves (to some extent). It also goes hand in hand with a radical misunderstanding of what kept the eurozone healthy and Germany in surplus prior to 2008: that is, the Global Minotaur whose demand-generation antics were for decades allowing countries like Germany and the Netherlands to remain net exporters of capital and consumer goods within and without the eurozone (while importing US-sourced demand for their goods from the eurozone’s periphery).</p> \n<p>Interestingly, one of the great secrets of the post-2008 period is that the Minotaur’s death adversely affected aggregate demand in the eurozone’s surplus countries (Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland) more than it did the deficit member states (like Italy, Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece). While the sudden withdrawal of capital from the deficit countries brought about their insolvency, countries like Germany saw their “fundamentals” more grievously affected by the crash of 2008. This fact, in conjunction with the terrible squeeze on German wages, explains the deeper causes of the animosity in places like Germany that so very easily translates into anger against the Greeks and assorted Mediterraneans – feelings that are then reciprocated, thus giving the wheel of intra-European animosities another spin, favouring the rise of xenophobia, even Nazism (in countries like Greece, quite incredibly), and thus leading to a wholesale readiness to push all the yellow, as opposed to the red, buttons in sight.</p> \n<p>To recap, the Minotaur’s surplus recycling was essential to the maintenance of the eurozone’s faulty edifice. Once it vanished from the scene, the European common currency area would either be redesigned or it would enter a long, painful period of disintegration. An unwillingness by the surplus countries to accept that, in the post-Minotaur world, some other form of surplus recycling is necessary (and that some of their own surpluses must also be subject to such recycling) is the reason why Europe is looking like a case of alchemy-in-reverse: for whereas the alchemist strove to turn lead into gold, Europe’s reverse alchemists began with gold (an integration project that was the pride of its elites) but will soon end up with the institutional equivalent of lead.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>This is an extract from Yanis Varoufakis’s book </em><a href=\"http://www.zedbooks.co.uk/paperback/the-global-minotaur-0\" title=\"\"><em>The Global Minotaur: America, Europe and the Future of the Global Economy</em></a><em>, published by Zed Books</em></p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436202066668/Greeks-celebrate-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Greeks celebrate as early opinion polls predict a referendum win for the no campaign.

But while Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias was quick to praise Syriza and Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras, his overriding message was a simple one – Spain is not Greece.</p> \n<p>With a general election due in Spain by the end of the year, Iglesias, whose party made substantial gains in local elections earlier this year, was careful to mark the differences between the two countries, worried, analysts said, that any worsening of the situation in Greece could drive crucial middle-class voters away from his party. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/live/2015/jul/06/greek-referendum-eu-leaders-call-crisis-meeting-as-bailout-rejected-live-updates\">Greece debt crisis: Banks to stay closed on Tuesday and Wednesday - live updates</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“We have a great friendship with Syriza, but luckily, Spain is not Greece,” Iglesias told radio Cadena Ser. “We’re an economy with much more weight in the eurozone, we’re a country with a stronger administration and with a better economic situation. The circumstance are different and I think it makes no sense to draw parallels.”<br /></p> \n<p>Instead, Iglesias framed the referendum as a step forward for democracy in that the Greek people had finally been handed the power to decide on austerity measures. “It’s good news for Europeans and Greek citizens,” said Iglesias. “The people of Greece have said they want change, they support a government who says that things can be done in a different way.”</p> \n<p>The referendum was a clear success for Tsipras, said political scientist Fernando Vallesp&iacute;n from Madrid’s Autonomous University. “The automatic assumption is that what is good for Tsipras is good for Podemos,” he said, but he feels it is too early to say whether that is the case, pointing to the efforts made by Iglesias to distance Spain from Greece. “I think Podemos is worried that the situation in Greece won’t get better.” <br /></p> \n<p>Reinforcing the differences between the countries dampens the idea of contagion, he said, and maintains the party’s appeal to moderate voters. The latest polls show Podemos is in a virtual tie with the governing People’s party and opposition Socialists.</p> \n<p>Podemos must walk a fine line when it comes to Greece, said Jos&eacute; Ignacio Torreblanca, the author of Asaltar Los Cielos, or Storm the Heavens, which explores the rise of Podemos. “On one hand it’s good news for them, because the message of the people having voted against austerity strengthens their message. The frame for them is fantastic because its the people against the troika, David against Goliath and the weak against the powerful,” he said.</p> \n<p>The challenge, however, is then to distance themselves from any bad news emerging from Greece. “This is where the space opens for the People’s party and others to point to issues such as the queues for cash machine withdrawals. All of the parties have been trying to use Greece to their advantage.”</p> \n<p>On Monday, the governing People’s party pointed to the referendum to justify their decision to impose austerity measures during the height of the economic crisis. “Fortunately Spain has a prime minister who said no to the bailout and instead undertook reforms,” PP vice-president Fernando Mart&iacute;nez-Maillo told broadcaster Radio Nacional de Espa&ntilde;a. The alternative, he said, would look like Greece does today. “Thanks to those reforms … we’re in a situation of economic growth and job creation.”</p> \n<p>While Greece was forced to accept a series of bailouts amounting to €240bn, Spain drew on €41bn-worth of EU funds to rescue its banking sector and exited from the programme last year. The Spanish economy has seen seven quarters of economic growth, but inequality is rampant and the country’s unemployment rate remains stubbornly high, at 23.8%, the highest in the EU after Greece.</p> \n<p>Spain’s finance minister, Luis de Guindos, said that although the no vote made the situation more complex, Spain was “absolutely not contemplating a Greek exit from the euro”.</p> \n<p>Greece’s creditors had not handled the crisis perfectly, he said, but the onus was now on Greece to enact reforms. “I think there were mistakes on the part of the troika, but it is inevitable that Greece implements reforms because there have been nations that have done them and they are emerging from the crisis.”</p> \n<p>The Spanish government is open to negotiations for a third rescue package, he said. “Given the circumstances, from the point of view of the markets, it is absolutely necessary.”</p> \n<p>His remarks were a backing down from the hardline position taken by Mariano Rajoy, Spain’s prime minister, who last week said that it would be good for Greece if Tsipras lost the referendum. “If he wins the referendum, Greece has no other alternative other than to leave the euro,” Rajoy told Cope radio station on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>How the Greek situation will play out in Spain hinges on what happens in the coming days, said Torreblanca. “If Tsipras manages to sit down with creditors and obtain an additional packages of concessions, then its great for Podemos,” he said. “It’s a bit early to say because right now we don’t know what the final act of all this will be – whether its a drama, tragedy or something else.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436202917741/b60302f8-e84d-4eab-8d8a-c57cc08a3949-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andrea

George Osborne will hand responsibility for Sunday trading laws to Britain’s towns and cities, allowing them to decide how long shops can stay open, in a move that will put an end to the national ban on large stores staying open for more than six hours.<br /></p> \n<p>The six-hour rule was relaxed for six weeks in July 2012 during the Olympics, resulting in a relatively significant surge in sales. The Liberal Democrats, then part of the coalition government, opposed a permanent relaxation at the time, insisting that Sunday should remain special and that the compromise between consumers, traders, shopworkers and the religious should be retained.</p> \n<p>Osborne has decided that verdicts on similar relaxations of the law should in future be taken at a local level, so that areas that think longer opening hours would boost economic activity would be free to do so. The supermarkets are divided over the wisdom of opening hours for longer on Sunday.</p> \n<p>The budget is expected to announce a consultation on two proposals: devolving power over Sunday trading law to elected mayors, and also to local authorities. If the reform was only handed to elected mayors, it would have a much slower impact since the number of mayors is going to be limited for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p>Osborne said: “Even two decades on from the introduction of the Sunday Trading Act, it is clear that there is still a growing appetite for shopping on a Sunday. There is some evidence that transactions for Sunday shopping are actually growing faster than those for Saturday.</p> \n<p>“The rise of online shopping, which people can do round the clock, also means more retailers want to be able to compete by opening for longer at the weekend. But this won’t be right for every area, so I want to devolve the power to make this decision to mayors and local authorities.</p> \n<p>“This will be another part of my plan to ensure a truly national recovery, with our great towns and cities able to determine their own futures.”</p> \n<p>Sunday trading laws allow all stores to open for six hours between 10am and 6pm, while small shops covering less than 3,000 sq ft, or less than 280 square metres, can open all day.</p> \n<p>The lobby group Open Sundays claims the reform would bring in &pound;20.3bn over 20 years to the British economy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/06/guardian-view-on-benefit-cap-disgraceful-policy-george-osborne-budget\">The Guardian view on the benefit cap: a disgraceful policy that’s about to get worse | Editorial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At the time of the temporary exemption for the Olympics, John Hannett, general secretary of the shopworkers’ union, Usdaw, said: “Usdaw remains vehemently opposed to the deregulation of Sunday trading and we expect the government to abide by its commitment that this summer’s temporary suspension will not lead to any further attempts to extend Sunday opening hours.</p> \n<p>“The government failed to make a coherent business case for the suspension and there is no evidence that it will boost the economy or tourism.”</p> \n<p>Under existing laws, shopworkers have a right to opt out of Sunday working but, in practice, that right can be reduced if employers put pressure on their staff.</p> \n<p>Research by the New West End Company, the London business voice for the West End, has shown that extending Sunday trading by two hours in London alone would create nearly 3,000 jobs, and generate more than &pound;200m a year in extra income.

For many, most clearly for those who survived the terrorist attack or lost loved ones, the coordinated suicide bombings remain as vivid now as if they happened yesterday.<br /></p> \n<p>London and the UK would never be quite the same again after the explosions that ripped through through three tube trains and a bus, bringing a cruel end to London’s celebratory mood - the previous day the nation was awarded the 2012 Olympics.</p> \n<p>With a significant terrorist assault in London four years after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in the US, Britain was embedded even deeper into the so-called war on terror. Community tensions ramped up, anti-terror laws became increasingly archaic, police and security services’ powers more sweeping.</p> \n<p>Today, the country has been asked to observe a minute’s silence at 11.30am in memory of the victims of the atrocity as a service at St Paul’s Cathedral attended by David Cameron and the Duke of York takes place.</p> \n<p>Across London’s public transport network, announcements will be halted and bus drivers asked to bring vehicles to a stop if they can do so safely. Tube services would run as normal but passengers would be asked to observe the silence and platform and other announcements would be paused.</p> \n<p>Wreaths will be laid beforehand at the permanent Hyde Park memorial to the tragedy, where a second service, to be attended by the Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, will take place later, featuring music, a series of readings and the laying of flowers.</p> \n<p>As 7 July 2005 dawned, Prime minister Tony Blair and the Queen were among those leading celebrations after London’s Olympic bid emerged victorious.</p> \n<p>But Mohammed Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, Hasib Hussain, 18, and Jermaine Lindsay, 19, had already set in motion devastating plans that bring the jubilant atmosphere to an end. </p> \n<p>The four men met at Luton station that morning where they took a train to King’s Cross in London. They embraced and separated to carry out their deadly missions.</p> \n<p>Within three minutes of 8.50am, Tanweer detonated his bomb at Aldgate, Khan set his device off at Edgware Road and Lindsay blew himself up between King’s Cross and Russell Square.</p> \n<p>Hussain detonated his device on board the number 30 bus at Tavistock Square at 9.47am.</p> \n<p>Twenty-six died in the bombing at Russell Square on the Piccadilly line, six in the bombing at Edgware Road on the Circle Line, seven in the bombing at Aldgate on the Circle Line and 13 in the bombing on the number 30 bus at Tavistock Square.

I was attending the careers fair and we’re using the offices here as a command centre … ” “Then you’ve got better things to do than talk to me then!” I blurted out, or something like that. To his credit he continued to reassure me before I hung up. I may even have wished him “have a good day” or something similar.<br /></p> \n<p>As it is, my girlfriend had made it to the Ex Cel centre without incident and was able to find out what was going on by hanging around with the people on the BBC stand at the careers fair. She travelled back a day later than planned.</p> \n<p>I recall feeling really uneasy about her being on the tube, as did she, but we both agreed London was probably the safest city in the world at that point and she was more likely to be killed crossing the road to get to the DLR in the first place.</p> \n<p>We later found out that one of our friends, a police officer, was one of the first on the scene at the Tavistock Square bus bomb. Clearly she had a much worse day than us. I still wonder what the head of the bomb squad thought of my panicked phone call though. <strong><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5593ddb2e4b03edf9cb7bca0/1599670\">Craig Murdie</a></strong></p> \n<h2><strong>‘I can still hear the sound of the bus exploding’</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fb9194b78e683476230047ea5aad8d8cc8e9e9ce\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/fb9194b78e683476230047ea5aad8d8cc8e9e9ce/0_0_425_755/281.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Pavitt\" width=\"281\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Pavitt </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen Pavitt</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I was working at Great Ormond Street hospital (GOSH) the day the bus blew up. I remember hearing the sound. I queried with colleagues whether it was thunder, but the sky was blue. We found out very quickly what had happened and our hospital’s major incident plan kicked in. </p> \n<p>Being non-clinical, we were allocated to “police” the streets surrounding the hospital and look after pedestrians and car drivers, making sure they had an exit route through closed streets. I accompanied a woman to the neurology hospital in Queen Square to visit her son who was in a coma and had to insist very strongly that the staff let her in; she was so upset at being told that no one could enter. We had been given orders not to let any one through, but I talked them round. </p> \n<p>We were out on the streets all day and I was worried about my kids at school as I couldn’t get through on the phone because the networks were down. It was a horrific day but all the staff at GOSH pulled together. Our canteen turned into a makeshift A&amp;E in about 30 seconds flat, it was unbelievable how people pulled together that day. We lost colleagues on that dreadful day. I can still hear the sound of the bus exploding. <strong><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5593ddb2e4b03edf9cb7bca0/1600989\">Helen Pavitt</a></strong></p> \n<h2><strong><br /></strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>‘I move on and feel the first twinge of doubt as mounted police appear’</strong></h2> \n<p>Commuting into Liverpool Street, late again. I run to the tube steps, then join the chorus of tutting as the fire gate descends.

Others have the same idea, we share shrugs when we find those doors closed as well.</p> \n<p>More walking, more closed stations, more confused people. I join a crowd watching a store TV through a window, news ticker tells us there’s been an electrical surge. I move on and feel the first twinge of doubt as mounted police appear.

We all know what’s happened now, people are quietly friendly, we ask each other whether we’re OK. Busy tones on the mobile, I keep walking, stupid high heels. The Nokia trills, my boyfriend tells me to get out of London. “I’m bloody trying!” I try for hours then give up, buy a packet of Marlborough Lights and find myself by the Tower of London. “South of the river” I think, “that’ll be safe.” I head over the bridge, find a cafe and sit smoking outside. People walk by “Alright?” “Yeah, you?”</p> \n<p>Eventually I hear rumours that overland trains are running again. Get turned away from more stations, finally squeeze on a train to Lakeside. I get off, buy some plimsolls and socks to replace my wet high heels – it must have rained, but I don’t remember now. My boyfriend picks me up at some point. I’m tired and numb, and sick from smoking so much.</p> \n<p>My ex came to woo me back later that year. We live back in New Zealand now. I still have the high heels, and the daps. I don’t wear either of them any more, but I can’t throw them away for some reason. <strong><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5593ddb2e4b03edf9cb7bca0/1600436\">Fleur Herscott</a></strong></p> \n<h2><strong>‘It took me many years to get back on to a tube train’</strong></h2> \n<p>I remember thinking it as I stepped on the train.

I remember the looks on people’s faces as I came out of the station, and my colleague almost not recognising me. I remember my mum saying she would come and get me and it then becoming obvious that that wouldn’t be possible. I remember hearing the bus bomb explode and wondering what the hell was happening in London. I remember the kindness of people, lending me clothes, finding a shower so I could wash the glass, dirt, blackness off, and making sure I was never alone. I remember finally managing to meet my brother near Warren Street station, even though he worked minutes away from where I was, and us walking the route of the Northern line up past Camden Town before being met by my parents. I remember confusion, disbelief and fear.</p> \n<p>I have so many memories of that day, and many memories that are linked to that day that came in the days, weeks and years following, memories that are both good and bad. It took me many years to get back on to a tube train and I’m still not completely comfortable in busy, confined spaces. I was born and bred in London but the city will never be the same for me again. <strong><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5593ddb2e4b03edf9cb7bca0/1600743\">Arianne Janssen</a></strong></p> \n<h2><strong>‘We all just sat there in the dark’</strong></h2> \n<p>I would normally change trains at King’s Cross tube station just before 9am. That morning I was running late and when the bomb went off at 8:47am my train was only a few trains behind the explosion. </p> \n<p>“We sat in a dark tunnel for about half an hour. It was hot and stuffy and we could smell burning. I remember thinking this was highly unusual but no one was panicking. We all just sat there in the dark. The driver told us we were being diverted north and we were finally let out at Kentish Town station. It was a strange sight above ground. Thousands of people walking in the streets. No cars, buses or taxis. No one knew what was happening and it was hard to make phone calls. I started walking back into the city centre using my A-Z guide.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a730c25b65de65e73dd11c2e3090305db03d6366\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a730c25b65de65e73dd11c2e3090305db03d6366/0_47_743_446/500.jpg\" alt=\"Anusha Bradley\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anusha Bradley</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I first heard of the attack when my mother called me from New Zealand and said: “There’s been a bomb. I’m watching it on the BBC,” she said. When I finally got to work in Farringdon, everyone just sat by the TV and radio listening to what was happening. We all felt so shocked. </p> \n<p>Transport home that afternoon was crazy. There were only a few buses and all were packed. I’ll always remember, there was a Muslim man on the bus with a large suitcase, obviously just from the airport. He was sweating and nervous, but a passenger gave up his seat for him and he sat down. The next morning I took the tube to work. I had the whole carriage to myself. <strong><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5593ddb2e4b03edf9cb7bca0/1601302\">Anusha Bradley</a></strong></p> \n<h2><strong>‘There was hope and love and compassion and beauty still left in our city’</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"39b3cb182c14b90b753d88112a2501283b660544\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436202985445/4979f6fe-8ffa-46f5-998d-40664694dba8-385x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Rebecca Dodgson\" width=\"385\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Dodgson </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I can’t remember what we had been doing on the evening of 6 July (though it was not celebrating that day’s announcement that London had been awarded the Olympics), but for some reason the morning of 7 Julywas one of those days that when our alarm clock sounded, we simply turned it off and rolled over back to sleep for another half an hour. That moment of tiredness, or laziness, potentially saved my life.</p> \n<p>Back then I was working for a company in Holborn, and normally took the Piccadilly line every day through Russell Square at pretty much the time the bomb went off. But that day, from sleeping in, I did not, and I was spared. Instead, by the time I reached Finsbury Park, the entire tube network had been shut down. There was chaos, hundreds of people locked outside the station, and no explanation or information about what was going on, just vague mutterings about a “power surge” that made me wonder how on earth London thought it was in a fit state to host 2012. So I just walked back to our flat in Crouch End, thinking I would catch a bus in later (a bus that would have gone right through Tavistock Square, incidentally). But once home, I switched on the news. I didn’t leave the sofa for the rest of the day.</p> \n<p>It was a strange time for me, as my mother had died of cancer three months previously. I grieved for her once again that day, as I knew she would have been straight on the phone in panic when she heard the news, desperate to check I was OK. And no phone call came. </p> \n<p>Friends of mine lost friends that day. I cannot imagine the horrors the people on those packed underground trains and that bus faced. It was the ultimate nightmare. And the bombers came from my mother’s home city, Leeds.</p> \n<p>What was genuinely amazing, though, was how London picked itself up and came together after the 7/7 attacks. I had always thought that a terrorist atrocity like that would make me want to leave, but instead it made me love the city more passionately than ever before. The beautiful messages on the bouquets of flowers left in Russell Square from every community in London made me weep. The two minutes silence a week later, on what would have been my mother’s 59th birthday, when the traffic stopped and the whole city fell quiet, was one of the most moving and empowering moments of my life. The terrorists had destroyed too many lives, lives in their prime, but still they had not won. There was hope and love, compassion and beauty still left in our city. <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/5593ddb2e4b03edf9cb7bca0/1605286\"><strong>Rebecca Dodgson</strong></a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"673088eb719e095ea46126c48337a38f21af7cdc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436203133464/c4b55a48-9801-4166-a997-0c0aa34c32f8-460x322.jpeg\" alt=\"The wreckage of a bus is seen near Russell Square \" width=\"460\" height=\"322\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The wreckage of a bus is seen near Russell Square</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Finn-Kelcey/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>‘I told them to text their parents – a flurry of movement to school bags’</strong></h2> \n<p>On 7 July I was busy, teaching an ICT class to 14-year-old boys at a school in Dartford. My partner, as far as I was aware, was at his desk in an office building on Tavistock Square, next to the BMA building. At about half past nine, one of the boys chirped up: “Miss, there’s been some explosions on the tube in London; it says, on the BBC.” “Oh, right,” I said, concealing my initial gut-twist, “well, keep an eye on the news for me, will you, but get on with your work too.” </p> \n<p>The news started to become more solid – stations were mentioned and, to my relief, none of them tallied with my partner’s commute. Relief, then, for me. Some of the boys were concerned, though – middle-class kids with parents working “in town”, as they were. I told them to text their parents – a flurry of movement to school bags.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/07/london-bombings-new-era-terror-uk-did-not-materialise-mi5-mi6-gchq\">7/7 seemed to herald a new era of terror on UK soil – one that did not materialise</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Just after 10 (I remember the time because, by this stage, we’d abandoned the coursework and were trolling every online news source we could find and had just seen a 10am update): “Miss, there’s a bus been blown up!”. “Oh god, where?” “They’re saying Tavistock Square … ”</p> \n<p>I ran. I arrived at the staff room as they wheeled in the TV on a trolley (the last time this had happened was 9/11). Scrambled for my phone. Colleagues with partners and loved ones in London that day started to appear, one by one, extracting mobile phones from handbags and teacher satchels. No one could get an answer. Break time came and went. We took it in turns to use the school landline so that our mobile handsets were free for incoming calls. The TV remained on, with staff gathered around. One by one my colleagues got their calls and texts.</p> \n<p>11.30. My mobile rang. By this time there was just the two of us awaiting news and our phones rang at the same time. My partner’s dad. He’d just called. He was fine. Sat in the pub, having a beer while he waited to use the landline. Hadn’t walked along Tavistock Square because his tube had shot through Euston and continued to Camden, from whence he’d walked, past people with blackened faces (but hadn’t thought anything of it). Had bumped into some colleagues, who’d just been evacuated from the building after the bus explosion.

8.49am on London Underground trains. A fourth was detonated on the top deck of a No 30 bus at Tavistock Square almost one hour later. Many who died there had already been evacuated from tube stations, some even calling their families to let them know they were safe. </p> \n<p>The four suicide bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, Hasib Hussain, 18, and Jermaine Lindsay, 19, met at Luton and had travelled to King’s Cross station where, at 8.30am, they were seen hugging before splitting up. </p> \n<p>On the eastbound Circle line train at Aldgate, seven people died and 171 were injured. At Edgware Road, a bomb was detonated on the westbound Circle line train, killing seven, including the bomber, and injuring 163. Between King’s Cross and Russell Square, 26 victims were killed while more than 340 were injured. </p> \n<p> At 9.47am, Hussain, who had walked out of King’s Cross underground station and tried unsuccessfully to contact the other three, detonated his bomb on board the bus. Fourteen people, including Hussain himself, died and more than 110 were injured. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ca40cd924ee2a4f4957a56be0b0545eafff5eab8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436210700501/50994e30-0462-439d-8469-e41d993b49b7-460x249.jpeg\" alt=\"The 7/7 memorial in Hyde Park.\" width=\"460\" height=\"249\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 7/7 memorial in Hyde Park. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niklas Halle'n/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The attacks came the day after a buoyant London had been successful in its bid for the 2012 Olympics.

And when four more young men tried to repeat the act two weeks later, the feeling that no one was safe intensified. Further attacks, it would seem, were just a question of when, not if. </p> \n<p>A decade later, many Britons have indeed died at the hands of terrorists overseas, from the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/oct/04/alan-henning-hostage-killing-harsh-price-isis-syria\">two aid workers beheaded by Islamic State in 2014</a> to the 30 who were killed in the Tunisian beach massacre.

Last year, the home secretary, Theresa May, put the figure at 40. Some of these plots have been crude, small-scale ones involving one or two individuals. Others have been sophisticated, linked to overseas groups aimed at inflicting mass casualties. David Cameron said in June there had been four or five plots over the last few months.</p> \n<p>Why have the UK security services been able to foil plot after plot? Simple luck? That has played a part, such as when detonators failed to go off in a bomb plot in London two weeks after 7/7. But it is about more than just luck. It is primarily about a massive shakeup of the security services that took place in the months and years that followed.</p> \n<p>The London bombings came as a shock and surprise to the security services. The day before, Eliza Manningham-Buller, the head of the domestic intelligence-gathering service MI5, had told a group of Labour whips that there was no reason to believe that an attack was imminent. A few minutes before the first bomb was detonated, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, told a radio interviewer that Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism unit was “the envy of the policing world”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/07/77-bombs-london-memorial-10-years\">7/7: London comes together to remember and reflect 10 years on</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Almost as big a shock came two weeks later. Although that attack failed, it aroused fears that 7/7 might not be a one-off and the UK could be facing one devastating al-Qaida-inspired mass-casualty assault after another.</p> \n<p>Within weeks, the government and the security services began to introduce a wide-ranging series of reforms. In tandem, Labour ministers proposed measures they believed could mark a turning point in post-war liberalism and civil rights, including plans to deport foreign clerics, shut down mosques, extend the control order regime to British nationals and amend the Human Rights Act.</p> \n<p>“Let no one be in doubt,” Tony Blair said during a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2005/aug/06/terrorism.july7\">press conference on 5 August 2005</a>. “The rules of the game have changed.”</p> \n<p>One of the biggest reforms was structural, breaking down the long-standing barriers between the security agencies. The overseas intelligence agency the Secret Intelligence Service, also known as MI6, was viewed as the posh service – the glamorous profession of Oxbridge recruits with language skills lured by the prospect of overseas travel. By contrast, their “friends across the river” at MI5 were viewed as the rougher side of the trade, their jobs closer to police work than spying. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed21023f6b97be07cc7ca572c6e8dc977c80a8e6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436205766804/6cbafef6-ca53-43b7-945e-683807e9111e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Secret Intelligence Service building\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Secret Intelligence Service building in Vauxhall, London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Ireland/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The ultra-secret surveillance agency GCHQ had little to do with either of them, notorious for turning down requests from its sister agencies. But that was all to change. </p> \n<p> Asked why the security agencies had been successful in battling terrorism in the UK, Chris Mackmurdo, who served as the Foreign Office’s senior counter-terrorism specialist from 2005 to 2014, said: “Luck comes into it but it is largely down to changes in working practices between the police, security and intelligence agencies that have helped the UK in identifying and disrupting these networks.”</p> \n<p>MI5’s London headquarters at Thames House today has officials from MI6, GCHQ and the police permanently embedded there.</p> \n<p>There were other changes, such as increased budgets, improved technology, especially in IT, and increases in staff. MI5 staffing levels jumped from 2,000 before the London bombings to 4,000 today. Instead of being primarily based in London, more regional offices were created which infiltrated Muslim communities, establishing an extensive network of agents and informers, officially known as covert human intelligence sources, some of them extremely well paid for their information.</p> \n<p>The main threat in the aftermath of the London bombings was from al-Qaida bases in the tribal areas of Pakistan, and MI6 shifted more of its resources to targeting the terror group’s leadership, working closely with its Pakistan counterpart, the ISI, as well as with the Americans and other European agencies.</p> \n<p>The core al-Qaida leadership has gradually been killed, mainly by drones. But some of their affiliates, such as al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, remain a potent threat – especially its chief bombmaker Ibrahim al-Asiri – with its aim of mass casualties, such as by bringing down aircraft. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/21/life-after-7-july-attacks-london-survivors-stories\">Life after 7 July attacks: survivors tell their stories</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Mackmurdo, who is now the founding director of the strategic intelligence consultancy Contest Global, said that while the threat from al-Qaida in Pakistan had decreased, it had been offset by increased exposure to attacks from capable and low-visibility networks linked to Islamic State (Isis) in Syria and Iraq. “The sheer scale and reach of the foreign fighter networks poses a massive challenge,” he said. That threat is compounded by a decrease in capabilities in countries affected by the Arab Spring which has impacted the west’s ability to detect and tackle terrorist networks with an international focus, according to Mackmurdo. </p> \n<p>He added: “Isil (Isis) is not prioritising mass attack against the west as al-Qaida did and continues to do so. They are much more interested in state-building in the region. They have learned from the mistakes that al-Qaida has made. But it would be a real mistake to ignore the potential of Isil to look outward in the medium to long term.”</p> \n<p>Two years after the London bombings, the security services put the number of Britons classified as extremists at around 2,000. Today, it stands at 3,000. The security agencies were criticised after the London bombings and after the Rigby killing for failing to keep tabs on the killers. But it takes an estimated 30 people to maintain 24-hour surveillance so judgments have to be made about prioritising. There are an estimated 700 Britons who have gone to join Isis, or, to a lesser extent, one of the smaller groups, of whom about half have returned.</p> \n<p>Sir David Omand, former UK security and intelligence coordinator at the Cabinet Office and former head of GCHQ, attributes the success of the security services to deep cooperation between the police and national intelligence, information frequently volunteered from the community, a specialist team within the Crown Prosecution Service and US-led attacks on al-Qaida.</p> \n<p>“But perhaps most important of all, the UK has benefitted from having good – but of course never perfect – pre-emptive intelligence,” Omand said, citing the role of GCHQ in surveillance.

As Jack Straw, who was foreign secretary at the time, observed in a speech that he gave last month to mark the 800th anniversary of the signing of Magna Carta: “When fear becomes the dominant emotion, national security and not individual rights become the dominant imperative on government.”</p> \n<p>While a number of the new proposals never came to fruition, a number of organisations were proscribed, and the following year a new Terrorism Act introduced a series of measures which were already under consideration before 7/7, including the new offences of preparing acts of terrorism, undergoing terrorism training and encouraging terrorism.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, a number of controversial counter-terrorism measures of questionable legality were also adopted, unannounced and unseen by most members of the public.</p> \n<p>In July 2006 the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/law/interactive/2011/aug/04/mi6-torture-interrogation-policy-document\">guidance issued to MI5 and MI6 officers when seeking information from terrorism suspects</a> held in countries where torture was known to be used was updated. It instructed senior officers to weigh the importance of the information that was sought against “the level of mistreatment anticipated” at the point at which the information was being extracted. It also warned that the policy must be kept a carefully guarded secret, for fear that it could in itself provoke terrorist attacks.</p> \n<p>A number of British Muslims who were detained overseas after the policy was redrafted and distributed say they suffered appalling torture. One man lost three fingernails after being detained in Pakistan at the suggestion of MI6 and interrogated on the basis of questions supplied by MI5 and Greater Manchester Police. The policy was eventually rewritten and made public after the 2010 general election.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/06/7-7-bombings-isis-terrorist-threat-uk-evolved\">From 7/7 to Isis: how the terrorist threat to the UK has evolved</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While ministers of the coalition were determined to avoid being implicated in the abusive interrogation of terrorism suspects, they did make increased use of another measure: citizenship deprivation.</p> \n<p>Young British jihadis who were dual nationals would find that they had been stripped of their British citizenship after leaving the UK.</p> \n<p>Two of these men – a British-Lebanese national and a man born in London to Egyptian parents – lost their UK citizenship in 2011 after travelling to Somalia to fight with al-Shabaab. Shortly afterwards their names were added to the Obama administration’s so-called kill list. In early 2012, both were killed in drone strikes.</p> \n<p>A number of other British nationals have been killed in drone strikes: the UK government refuses to disclose anything about the intelligence it shares with the US in advance of these operations.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the formation of the coalition, David Cameron made a public commitment to hold a judge-led inquiry into the human rights abuses in which the previous government had become embroiled. The inquiry was scrapped in 2012.</p> \n<p>The coalition did make good on another pledge, however. With lawyers chalking up a series of successful claims for damages brought on behalf of victims of rendition and torture, the government introduced a new law, the Justice and Security Act, to ensure that key parts of future cases would be heard in secret.</p> \n<p>“Intelligence work is a jigsaw puzzle, or rather several jigsaw puzzles, with the pieces all mixed up and no picture on the lid to guide the analyst,” says Omond. “Very rarely is there one piece that completes the puzzle and stops an attack; it is a team effort involving a lot of experience in putting the picture together using all the information that could bear on the problem. All that said, there can be no certainty of success. I am very confident the team will do their utmost, but we cannot expect every match can be won.”</p> \n<p>Are we safer now? Few currently serving in the intelligence agencies are rash enough to comment publicly or privately. It is equally unlikely that any of them will be celebrating today that remarkable statistic of confining Islamist-related terrorism in the UK to one dead since 7/7. They know that there could be an attack at any time – one they fail to stop. </p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fcb25000de418a8570cd7c3db1e9fe1bd19fa334/110_95_1335_801/1335.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":801,"width":1335,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chris Jackson/Getty Images","altText":"Tony Blair and Charles Clarke","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436205768193/6cbafef6-ca53-43b7-945e-683807e9111e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Secret Intelligence Service building in Vauxhall, London.

Andrea Constand claimed that she had been drugged and molested by Cosby at his home in January 2005, but following a private settlement in the case, all documents relating to it were sealed, casting the whole matter under a deep layer of secrecy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/06/bill-cosby-admitted-sedative-women-sex-2005-court-documents\">Bill Cosby admitted obtaining sedative to use on women, documents show</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Constand herself has never spoken directly about the case since the settlement was reached in 2006.</p> \n<p>Now, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/06/bill-cosby-admitted-sedative-women-sex-2005-court-documents\">with the opening of the files</a> following a federal court case brought by Associated Press, a window has been opened into Cosby’s behaviour under his own admission. It marks the first time that the actor has been heard, in his own words, directly referring to purchasing drugs for use in a sexual context.</p> \n<p>The court documents include transcripts of the deposition of Cosby on 27 and 28 September 2005. In the course of the depositions, the comic was asked several questions about his purchasing of drugs, leading to tense exchanges between his lawyer Patrick O’Connor and a lawyer for Constand, Dolores Troiani.</p> \n<p>During the deposition, Cosby said that he had obtained seven prescriptions for the sedative quaalude.</p> \n<p>“You gave them to other people?” he was asked.</p> \n<p>“Yes,” he replied.</p> \n<p>When Troiani tried to elicit from Cosby whether he had given the drug to other people knowing that to be illegal, O’Connor intervened, instructing his client not to answer.</p> \n<p>“When you got the quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women you wanted to have sex with?” asked Troiani.</p> \n<p>“Yes,” replied Cosby.</p> \n<p>Asked whether he had given young women the drug without their knowledge, the lawyer again intervened, advising him not to answer.</p> \n<p>Cosby told the deposition that he got the quaaludes prescriptions in the 1970s and then kept them for several years.</p> \n<p>The documents also include details of questions Cosby was asked under deposition about another woman, one of the so-called “Jane Does” who were called anonymously to give evidence in the Constand case. The woman told lawyers that at the age of 19 she met with Cosby and had sex with him after he gave her quaaludes.</p> \n<p>In his deposition, Cosby said he met the witness in Las Vegas: “She meets me backstage. I give her quaaludes. We then have sex.” Cosby then goes on to say: “I can’t judge at this time what she knows about herself for 19 years, a passive personality.”</p> \n<p>Cosby adds that the witness was “sweet in her personality. As far as I was concerned was well-mannered, didn’t demand or give a feeling that she was above anyone. If anything, I think she may very well have been very happy to be around the showbusiness surroundings.”</p> \n<p>“Starstruck?” he was asked.</p> \n<p>“You’ll have to ask her,” Cosby replied.</p> \n<p>The public opening of the documents comes at the end of a tough legal struggle for the Associated Press. On 17 June, lawyers representing the news agency delivered a motion to the federal courthouse for the eastern district of Pennsylvania requesting that they be included as an interested party for the unsealing of the court documents, including Cosby’s testimony.</p> \n<p>Cosby’s lawyers argued that the unsealing of the documents would be “terribly embarrassing” for their client, the AP reported in June. But, on Monday, their request was granted by judge Eduardo Robreno.</p> \n<p>Explaining his decision to release the papers, Robreno is scathing about Cosby’s claim that he had a right to privacy. He said that Cosby had “donned the mantle of public moralist and mounted the proverbial electronic or print soap box to volunteer his views on, among other things, childrearing, family life, education, and crime. To the extent that Defendant has freely entered the public square and thrust himself into the vortex of th[ese] public issues he has voluntarily narrowed the zone of privacy that he is entitled to claim.”</p> \n<p>Robreno said the public had a “significant interest” in the “stark contrast between Bill Cosby, the public moralist and Bill Cosby, the subject of serious allegations concerning improper (and perhaps criminal) conduct”.</p> \n<p>The judge concludes: “The nature of the allegations – sex, drugs, seduction, etc – do not cloak this case, including the depositions of one of the parties, with an automatic, or per se, seal of silence.”</p> \n<p>Since the allegations of sexual misconduct resurfaced last year, the comic has faced renewed legal actions against him. But so far all of them have floundered on the rock of time – the statute of limitations that restricts the period after an alleged crime in which prosecutions can be brought.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436226471159/2adfbc9d-eeae-4d17-99bb-0719691fc48e-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Al Pereira","altText":"Bill Cosby.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Al Pereira"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T07:32:21Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T07:32:24Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ed Pilkington","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/edpilkington"},{"name":"Nicky Woolf","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nicky-woolf"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Bill Cosby","US news","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/bill-cosby","webTitle":"Bill Cosby"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#005689","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#005689","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#63717a","colourPalette":"analysis"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/07/bill-cosby-court-documents-legal-problems","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aexv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/07/bill-cosby-court-documents-legal-problems","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/bill-cosby-court-documents-legal-problems"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436226471159/2adfbc9d-eeae-4d17-99bb-0719691fc48e-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bill Cosby has continued to perform even as more and more allegations against him have been made.

He told the Guardian: “There is absolutely no need for this level of intrusive and painful questioning by DWP officials. If I have had two such cases in my constituency in recent weeks; I dread to think how often this is happening around the country.”</p> \n<p>The Labour MP for Birkenhead said one of the complaints had come to him from a vicar on behalf of his sister. </p> \n<p> The two individuals were claiming for a personal independence payment (PIP) under the “special rules terminally ill” procedure. Both had submitted DS 1500 forms signed by their doctor – forms that need to be signed if the patient is regarded as suffering from a terminal illness.</p> \n<p> The DS 1500 asks for factual information and does not require the doctor to give a prognosis. It should contain details of the diagnosis, including whether the patient is aware of their condition and, if unaware, the name and address of the patient’s representative. </p> \n<p>It should also set out the current and proposed treatment, and brief details of clinical findings. A doctor is expected to believe that the patient is likely to die within six months, but once the form is submitted the Department for Work and Pensions decision-makers are not expected to challenge a patient about the expected date of of death, or question a patient who is not aware the doctor has declared their illness to be terminal. </p> \n<p>The claimant, once found by the doctor to be terminally ill, is not supposed to meet any qualifying period for a claim, and should get the highest rate of claim. </p> \n<p>In a letter sent to Duncan Smith on 30 June, Field writes: “My constituents tell me that despite submitting a DS 1500 form drawing attention to a terminal illness, they have been asked directly to their face whether they think they will soon die and by what date they expect to be dead. In one case my constituent’s mother was asked by when she expected her daughter to die and in front of her daughter.”</p> \n<p>He continued: “This has left my constituents feeling understandably very upset. They tell me they are appalled by the hardness of the questioning and its intrusiveness.”</p> \n<p>Field said he had asked to see the guidance, either national or local, that could have led PIP assessors to think this line of questioning was legitimate. He had also asked for Duncan Smith to review the policy at a national level. </p> \n<p>PIP is replacing the disability living allowance, and has been dogged by delays.
