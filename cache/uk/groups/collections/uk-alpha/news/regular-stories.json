The CBI’s director general, John Cridland, said the jury was out on the big rise in the minimum wage, but warned jobs might be lost in restaurants, hotels and the social care sector. </p> \n<p>He said there had been no consultation over the proposals, and feared the independent Low Pay Commission had been politicised since it was being directed to raise the minimum wage to two-thirds of the median earnings, regardless of the impact on the labour market.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Minimum wage graphic\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1436381484929/Minimum_Wage.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There was also concern that the rise in the minimum wage would encourage EU migration to the UK and undermine the purpose of David Cameron’s key EU renegotiation objective – giving Britain the right to bar EU migrants from receiving tax credits for four years.</p> \n<p>Leslie welcomed the principle of increasing pay as the best way of dealing with rising welfare. “We are delighted if he wants to steal some of the policies in our manifesto,” he said. <br /></p> \n<p>But he said the cuts to welfare were being introduced before the rise in minimum wage, and were so large many people would be worse off. “The figures do not add up,” he said. He pointed out that the new living wage was a rebranding exercise, arguing it applied to workers over 25 and working 35 hours a week.</p> \n<p>He claimed a couple with two children, with one adult on full-time average earnings, would lose &pound;2,000 a year in tax credits. For every &pound;1 they gained with the minimum wage increase, they could lose &pound;2 in tax credits. </p> \n<p>Leslie said Labour planned to be a more intelligent opposition, and would accept the principle of an overall annual cap on welfare benefits. But he said Labour would not “meekly accept” whatever the government proposed.</p> \n<p>Labour is nevertheless privately struggling to calibrate a response that accepts the principle of the reforms but opposes the way in which they are being implemented.</p> \n<p>Some Labour leadership candidates are urging the party also to look at the overall macroeconomic decisions and the extent to which the chancellor has moved on to Labour ground by delaying the speed with which the deficit will be cut, pointing out that the new timetable is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/apr/13/ed-balls-labour-will-eliminate-budget-deficit-by-2020\">not sharply different from what Ed Balls had proposed</a> in the general election. Labour is also pointing to the huge tax rises in the budget, as well as extra public spending.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/expend_receipts-zip/giv-21277b3MBdyyIKJDo/\" data-alt=\"Whitehall cash flow graphic\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/expend_receipts-zip/giv-21277b3MBdyyIKJDo/\">Whitehall cash flow graphic</a> \n</figure>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/8/1436366269906/KP_346052_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for George Osbornes 2015 budget speech: key moments -

The improvement in public finances will come partly through a tougher tax regime for buy-to-let landlords, restricting non-dom tax status and by increased dividend taxation. </p> \n<p>Declaring “Britain needs a pay rise” – once the campaign slogan of the TUC – Osborne said he was directly boosting the national minimum wage of 2.7 million workers aged over 25. The increase, accompanied by substantial welfare cuts over three years, was designed to engineer a rebalancing between the individual and the state – a political intervention to shift responsibility for low incomes from the state to employers. </p> \n<p>“Let me be clear: Britain deserves a pay rise and Britain is getting a pay rise,” Osborne said, adding that 6 million people would see their pay increase as a result of what he dubbed the creation of a national living wage.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457440437__\n</div> \n<p>The announcement was greeted by the work and pensions secretary, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jul/08/fist-pumping-iain-duncan-smith-george-osborne-living-wage-budget\">Iain Duncan Smith</a>, punching the air in triumph, but the shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, said: “This minimum wage increase is just a rebrand of the minimum wage – trying to call it something different. It doesn’t actually compensate in any way for this massive take away from tax credits. The changes amount to a work penalty that he has introduced into the tax credit system. It hit very, very hard.”</p> \n<p>Osborne had considered a rise in the minimum wage in 2013 but could not win the support of the Liberal Democrats for the welfare cuts, or a further cut in corporation tax, an essential part of Wednesday’s package designed to ease employers’ resistance to the reforms.</p> \n<p>But despite being given the sweetener of a cut in corporation tax from 20% to 18% by 2020, the CBI said the increases would prove “challenging” for its members working in the hospitality and retail sector.</p> \n<p>Charities said that for many families the impact of the national living wage would be swamped by the changes to tax credits and housing benefit, warning that there would be a rise in poverty and inequality over the coming years.</p> \n<p>The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimated that although some middle-earners would be net gainers, the changes would leave low-earners – typically on &pound;9.35 an hour – worse off by between &pound;850 and &pound;1,000 a year.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457442013__\n</div> \n<p>Resolution chief executive Gavin Kelly said: “By concentrating &pound;12bn of cuts from a limited range of working-age benefits, the chancellor has focused a disproportionate part of that pain on the working poor. </p> \n<p>“We shouldn’t think that a higher minimum wage will compensate all low-income working families for their losses – many working households will be left significantly worse off.”</p> \n<p>Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “The chancellor is giving with one hand and taking away with the other. Massive cuts in support for working people will hit families with children hardest.</p> \n<p>“The chancellor has finally woken up to the fact that Britain needs a pay rise. The TUC has long campaigned for the minimum wage to rise faster and the chancellor has listened to us at last.”</p> \n<p>The budget announced an increase in the personal allowance to &pound;11,000 and a small rise in the 40% tax threshold from 2016, but the independent Office for Budget Responsibility said tax increases, including a jump in insurance premium tax and less generous tax relief on pension contributions, would raise twice as much as the chancellor gave away.<br /></p> \n<p>Stressing that it was a budget for working people, Osborne wooed motorists by freezing fuel duty and by cutting <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-2015-osborne-unveils-green-car-tax-overhaul-to-fund-roadbuilding\">vehicle excise duty on most cars</a>.</p> \n<p>The overall scale of the budget, which ringfenced defence spending, announced a training levy and gave more powers to elected mayors, left Osborne as the leading intellectual force in the cabinet and in prime position to succeed David Cameron later in the parliament.</p> \n<p>The chancellor drew jeers from largely shell-shocked Labour MPs when he warned “the benefits system should not support lifestyles and rents that are not available to the taxpayers who pay for that system”.</p> \n<p>The big cuts to welfare come from:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>freezing working age benefits and tax credits for four years as opposed to the two set out ahead of the election.<br /></li> \n <li>limiting the child element of tax credits to the first two children for new claimants.

A senior executive at one large retailer said that every penny on wages would slice &pound;2m off his firm’s bottom line. </p> \n<p> </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"minimum v living wage\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1436381484929/Minimum_Wage.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Bruno Monteyne, a retail analyst at research firm Bernstein, said: “Retailers are not magic machines that eat up inflation. Ultimately the consumer will pay for the increase in wages.”</p> \n<p>He added that the wage rise would be a new boost to the discount grocers, which employ relatively few staff in relation to the amount of goods they sell.</p> \n<p>However, the pay increases are a victory for campaigners who have been challenging big businesses including <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/may/14/living-wage-campaigners-ask-tough-questions-britains-big-retailers-next\">Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Marks &amp; Spencer, Next and Morrisons at their annual shareholder meetings over low wages</a>. </p> \n<p>Last month, Tesco boss Dave Lewis told campaigners that the retailer was in detailed talks with the trade union Usdaw about restructuring pay packages to increase basic salary. But he <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/26/tesco-sales-drop-13-but-outperform-market-expectations\">insisted the total amount available for workers could not be increased this year.</a><br /></p> \n<p>On Wednesday , Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said he could not commit to paying the living wage as calculated by the independent Living Wage Foundation – &pound;9.15 in London and an average &pound;7.85 across the rest of the UK – within the next year.</p> \n<p>He explained one way of moving closer to paying the living wage would be to cut back on staff benefits such as a discount card or annual bonus. But he said more than 90% of staff would opt to keep their discount card rather than a rise in pay. “If we take away benefits to improve the base rate I don’t think that would be popular,” he told campaigners.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>However, the boss of another major retailer pointed out that most employers campaigned against the original minimum wage, introduced in 1999, insisting it would be disastrous. Those warnings proved unfounded.</p> \n<p>He said: “Making sure hard-working staff are getting paid well is never a bad thing. They are also customers and many of our other customers might see their pay rise. On balance it will be OK.”</p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/6af9677be24e36a0574a096673a3e7412b0a9edb/0_119_3368_2021/3368.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2021,"width":3368,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Gary Calton for the Observer","altText":"Independent retailers in York.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T06:00:07Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T06:22:20Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Sarah Butler","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sarahbutler"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Retail industry","Budget 2015 (July)","Budget","Business","UK news","Living wage","Minimum wage"],"tags":[{"id":"business/retail","webTitle":"Retail industry"},{"id":"uk-news/budget-2015-july","webTitle":"Budget 2015 (July)"},{"id":"uk/budget","webTitle":"Budget"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"society/living-wage","webTitle":"Living wage"},{"id":"society/minimum-wage","webTitle":"Minimum wage"}],"section":{"id":"business"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sarah Butler","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sarahbutler"}}],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-457442013","source":"ITN","durationInSeconds":252,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/08/150708budgetspeech_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/08/150708budgetspeech.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/8/1436366269906/KP_346052_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for George Osbornes 2015 budget speech: key moments - videos","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for George Osbornes 2015 budget speech: key moments - videos","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for George Osbornes 2015 budget speech: key moments - videos"}}],"adTargetingPath":"business"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/09/fears-living-wage-devastate-small-retailers-budget-push-up-prices","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4afhp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/business/2015/jul/09/fears-living-wage-devastate-small-retailers-budget-push-up-prices","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/09/fears-living-wage-devastate-small-retailers-budget-push-up-prices"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/6af9677be24e36a0574a096673a3e7412b0a9edb/0_119_3368_2021/3368.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2021,"width":3368,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Independent retailers in York, northern England.

But the grim realities include a new two-child policy for the poor","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>During financial year 2015/16 thus far, budgets are a quarterly rather than an annual event. Wednesday’s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chancellor-george-osbornes-summer-budget-2015-speech\" title=\"\">set-piece in the Commons</a> was not in any respect an economic necessity. The same chancellor had, after all, delivered another budget less than four months before, and Britain’s financial circumstances have barely altered since. For all the salutations paid to Britain’s recovery, a relatively modest rebound after a great recession plods on: the GDP growth forecasts George Osborne read out were a string of 2.4%s all the way to the end of the decade. None of this has changed materially since the spring; what&nbsp;has is a shock election result.</p> \n<p>Mr Osborne did the traditional chancellor thing, by making a post-election move to jack up taxes, concentrating on obscure levies that no one had thought to ask him to rule out raising before Britain voted. Less conventionally, there was a little post-election softening on borrowing and spending. The experts had warned that his wildly austere pre-election promises would not be delivered without a collapse in services, from colleges to care homes. Until polling day these fantasy plans made for an arresting contrast with the caricature of a spendthrift Labour party; with the election out of the way, Mr Osborne allowed the day the books will be balanced to slip by another year, creating room for somewhat smaller cuts. One immediate consequence – and a first shot in the Osborne campaign to lead the Tory party – came when the chancellor tickled the tummies of his backbenchers, and committed to keep defence spending at or above 2% of GDP, a commitment he has doggedly resisted making until now.</p> \n<p>So Mr Osborne has got a little harder on taxes, a little softer on services, but there is a third field in which he has been true to his pre-election word. Notoriously, he had refused to share with the electors exactly which social security benefits he planned to cut while he was asking them to return him to the Treasury, but he did vow to earmark reductions of &pound;12bn, and when he finally got specific on Wednesday that is exactly what he did. These are savage cuts, which will greatly impoverish many low-paid workers and disabled people, and most particularly poor children. But the nation and much of the media was distracted by the inevitable budget surprise. To persuade the house and the country to avert their eyes from this raid on the vulnerable he needed some serious shock and awe. And he shrewdly calculated that for a Tory chancellor to commit to what he described as “a national living wage” would be every bit as ear-catching as hearing the late Mary Whitehouse coming out with a&nbsp;run of sexual expletives.</p> \n<p>The substance is a real, if unspectacular, rise in the minimum wage for workers aged over 25. Such is the concentration of young workers on poverty pay, that this age limit dilutes the effect quite a bit, but – considered in isolation – this move would be worthwhile. That is so, even though this isn’t a <a href=\"http://www.livingwage.org.uk/news/living-wage-foundation-response-budget-2015\" title=\"\">living wage</a> in the real sense of a pay rate carefully calculated in line with what workers need to live on. Mr Osborne’s proposal is instead for a rebranded minimum wage, starting at &pound;7.20 an hour next year, less than the real living wage of &pound;9.65 in London and &pound;7.85 elsewhere. Crucially, these numbers are calculated on the assumption that families can access the very tax credits that were being butchered while all attention was on Mr Osborne’s “living wage”. Before the budget, <a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/media/blog/will-wages-fill-the-tax-credit-gap-dont-budget-for-it/\" title=\"\">the Resolution Foundation had warned</a> that deep cuts in tax credits would push the London living wage up to well above &pound;11.</p> \n<p>Minimum wage workers married to spouses on decent pay will have reason to thank Mr Osborne for a rise. But for poorly paid grafters in more penurious families, cuts to benefits and tax credits will overwhelm the gain: the net losses will frequently reach the high hundreds of pounds a year, and occasionally the low thousands. For all the talk of rewarding hard work, the government is going to start snatching tax credits back at lower levels of earnings than presently, and will also snatch them away faster too, deepening the poverty trap. Workers who fall sufficiently sick to satisfy an increasingly harsh bureaucracy that it simply isn’t feasible to class them as jobseekers are facing a benefit cut of around 30%, the sort of retrenchment more often associated with Greece. And where China once operated a one-child policy, Mr Osborne is now imposing a two-child rule on the poor. Tax credits will no longer be paid for third and fourth children, dismissing them as a luxury indulgence on the part of the parents, as opposed to young human beings with their own material needs and their own rights.</p> \n<p>Put this together with a hideously complex new rule to ensure that those who come from &pound;1m homes can inherit them tax-free, and instead of an agenda for social mobility, you have an agenda to bring to mind the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Things_Bright_and_Beautiful\" title=\"\">words of a Victorian hymn</a>: “The rich man in his castle/The poor man at his gate/God made them high and lowly, and ordered their estate.” Though welcome, a higher minimum wage will not create sufficient opportunity to compensate for the collateral damage done in the chancellor’s war in the welfare state. It&nbsp;provides unusually cunning political cover,&nbsp;but this will eventually be blown away by the experience of the cuts. Because, in the end, the truth has power.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/745c701345477ec4fcc6e2c4a449355964a8b90c/3_376_2610_1568/2610.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1568,"width":2610,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Reuters

It will make life easier for everyone, cut journey times, create jobs and boost the economy. We want to reward our staff for its delivery and have been open and transparent in our negotiations with the trade unions – but unfortunately they have failed to engage. We have put forward a very, very fair offer, which consists of an average salary increase of 2%, 1% or RPI (whichever is greater) for next year and the one after, plus a &pound;500 night tube launch bonus and an additional &pound;2,000 bonus for night tube train drivers. No one will have to work more hours than they do now, and we have a longer term plan, which will mean no one will need to work nights if they don’t want to. Given these commitments, the key question Londoners will rightly be asking, is why the unions have refused to put this new pay deal to their memberships and instead opted to push on with completely unnecessary strike action, which is inflicting major disruption on Londoners and businesses today.</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-559e1c8fe4b0c514f96c67ed","title":"RMT claims 'rock solid' strike","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-09T07:05:44Z","body":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"caabaef0c129f862e564df5a8717e33e21742fd3\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/caabaef0c129f862e564df5a8717e33e21742fd3/2871_780_762_1145/666.jpg\" alt=\"Mick Cash\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mick Cash</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner. for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The RMT union says the support for the strike has been rock solid.</p> \n<p>General Secretary Mick Cash issued this statement” <br /></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The strike action on London Underground is rock solid across all lines, all grades and all depots and the unity and solidarity of the entire workforce, which has now brought London to a standstill, must force the tube bosses back to the negotiating table to address the issues at the heart of this dispute.</p> \n <p>That means an end to the attempt to bulldoze through new working patterns that would wreck work/life balance and leave staff in safety critical jobs burnt out and stressed out at a time when tube services are facing unprecedented demand.

He added in his report that the excuse they had given for failing to surrender the recording was “patently dishonest”.</p> \n<p>Sampson reported that he had gathered sufficient evidence to justify the prosecution of three MI5 officers for their roles in the conspiracy. However, he recommended that the most junior officer, who had carried out the act of destruction, be granted immunity in return for giving evidence against the two high-ranking MI5 officers.</p> \n<p>He also recommended that three senior police officers be prosecuted for conspiring to pervert the course of justice.</p> \n<p>In the event, none were prosecuted after the then attorney general, Sir Patrick Mayhew, said the government did not believe it to be in the interests of national security to bring them to trial.

His best friend was killed. The RUC has always denied that it had a shoot to kill policy, but now fresh evidence is emerging</p>","byline":"Ian Cobain","body":"<p>Martin McCauley and Michael Tighe were country boys. They grew up a stone’s throw from each other, on smallholdings that sat on opposite sides of a narrow, hedge-lined lane. Derrymacash, the Northern Irish village where they went to school and played Gaelic football, was a mile away. Beyond that lay the expansive waters of Lough Neagh. The boys helped out on each other’s family farms: in the summer they cut and baled hay together; in the winter they rode tractors. In the summer of 1982 they had bought a motorbike, a scrambler, to tear across the bogs of north Antrim and perform wheelies along the local boreens.</p> \n<p>On 24 November that year, a Wednesday, Tighe spent most of the day on his parents’ smallholding, looking after the pigs. At the end of the afternoon, as the light was about to fade, McCauley kickstarted their bike and they rode it to an empty redbrick bungalow about half a mile away. They parked up and went into a ramshackle hayshed at the back of the house.</p> \n<p>The first two bullets came through the window. The boys had heard no sound, no hint whatsoever that anyone had crept up to the front of the hayshed; just two very loud bangs. Tighe, who was sitting on a stack of hay bales, toppled backwards. McCauley, standing next to the window, froze. “Next thing, the whole of the wooden doors to the barn exploded inwards,” he recalled. “They just machine-gunned it. I was standing up and trying to press myself against a hay bale, but I couldn’t get any cover. So I crouched down and tried to move backwards across the doorway. I was trying to get out of the way like this,” he said, shuffling backwards to demonstrate. “It was like everything had slowed down. I don’t know where I was hit first. One of the shots hit me in the back of my left shoulder and exited through my throat. Look: you can still see where it came out. Another hit me around the top of my spine and exited through my right armpit. The third hit me in my right thigh near the groin and came out of the outside of my thigh.</p> \n<p>“Someone came into the hayshed and hit me on the back of my head, and I was dragged through what was left of the doors. The pain was just excruciating. The best way that I can describe being shot is that it’s like someone walked up to you and hit you with a red-hot sledgehammer. I was just lying there. And with every heartbeat the blood was pumping up in the air from my thigh.” A man pointed a rifle at his head and threatened to finish him off. He thought he was going to die. Tighe was out of sight, behind the hay bales. “I didn’t know it then, but Mickey was dead. He’d been shot twice in the heart.”</p> \n<p>McCauley was 19, an alleged IRA volunteer and bomb-maker: a suspected killer. Tighe, one of six children, was “a fresh-faced lad of simple needs”, with no involvement in the conflict, according to the subsequent assessment of a senior policeman. He was 17. His killing brought <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/datablog/2010/jun/10/deaths-in-northern-ireland-conflict-data\">Northern Ireland’s death toll</a> to 2,487. But Michael Tighe’s death was different, because the shots that killed him, and the subsequent cover‑up, were part of a dark episode in the undeclared war in the north, in which it was possible to glimpse the British state fighting terror with terror.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50e43a90f3dd5085d4001d9823b6c7e03e108b2b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436362365695/563dc2c2-9152-49fc-b107-1b27b15615f0-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"The old barn in Derrymacash, County Armagh, where the shooting took place.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The old barn in Derrymacash, County Armagh, where the shooting took place.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul McErlane</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The battle to establish the truth about what happened in the hayshed has dragged on for three decades – a subplot in the wider tragedy of the Troubles. But some of the details of that afternoon are only now starting to emerge. Two highly classified reports by senior policemen, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2007/jul/20/northernireland.northernireland\">John Stalker</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10171908\">Colin Sampson</a> – which have never been released to the public – concluded that senior Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) detectives and MI5 officers were involved in a conspiracy to suppress the truth about Tighe’s killing. Sampson’s report, portions of which the Guardian has seen, is particularly critical of MI5, describing the agency’s conduct as “reprehensible” and “patently dishonest”.</p> \n<p>Next year, after 34 years, inquests will finally be held into the deaths of Tighe and five other men, all of whom were killed within a few weeks not far from the hayshed. Northern Ireland may have been largely at peace for almost two decades, but it is a peace that remains haunted; even the dead, it seems, cannot lie down to sleep.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>One afternoon in late October 1982,</strong> four weeks before the shootings at the hayshed, the police received a call, claiming that someone had been prowling around the farms that line the southern shore of the lough and had stolen a battery from a tractor; three officers were despatched to make inquiries. Travelling in an armoured Ford Cortina, they made their way along a route leading to the M1 motorway, a straight stretch of road known locally as Kinnego embankment. The IRA had built an enormous bomb inside a culvert under the road, and when it was detonated by a control wire, the Cortina was hurled 70ft in the air. All three officers were killed instantly. One was 26 and had been married for a month; the other two had five children between them.</p> \n<p>Jack Hermon, the chief constable of the RUC, was driving nearby with his wife. “We stopped momentarily at a roundabout,” he wrote in his memoirs. “As we did so, we heard the explosion, and our driver pointed to the smoke and debris erupting on the skyline.” The blast left a crater 15ft deep and 40ft wide. The killing of the three policemen was not merely distressing for their fellow officers – it was maddening. The home-made explosives used in the bomb were supposed to have been under surveillance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b3a6df83420f2852846b60aeeaf88b66b084da7b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436362183467/1b11f56c-d843-413d-b7bb-a728b8efdac8-250x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Michael Tighe\" width=\"250\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Tighe was shot dead at the age of 17. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Bolger</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Several weeks earlier, an informer within the ranks of the local IRA had contacted his handlers from special branch, the intelligence-gathering unit of the RUC, and told them that around 1,000lb of explosives had been smuggled across the border from the Irish Republic. It was being stored in a hayshed near Derrymacash, 10 minutes’ drive from Kinnego. The informer identified three local men as members of an IRA unit that was planning to carry out a bomb attack. Two of them, Eugene Toman and Sean Burns, were 21 and from the nearby town of Lurgan. The third, the informer said, was Martin McCauley.</p> \n<p>The farmland in that corner of north Armagh is relentlessly flat, and there was not much woodland cover nearby, so a decision was taken that the hayshed should not be watched. Instead, an MI5 technician, accompanied by a British special forces soldier, broke in and wired a microphone into the rafters, and installed a movement sensor beneath the black plastic bags containing the explosives. The devices were monitored by both British soldiers and RUC officers, at an army post a few miles away, and the transmissions were tape recorded.</p> \n<p>Somehow, the IRA had managed to remove the explosives from the hayshed without the army monitors hearing anything, and had used them to construct the bomb that killed the three police officers at Kinnego.</p> \n<p>Fifteen days later, Toman and Burns were dead, along with a third local IRA member, Toman’s cousin Gervaise McKerr, a 31-year-old joiner and father of two small boys. All three were shot by an RUC squad called the Headquarters Mobile Support Unit (HMSU), which had been trained by the SAS regiment in what subsequent court evidence would describe as “firepower, speed and aggression”, and operated under the control of special branch. The RUC issued a press statement, saying that the three men had been travelling in a car that tried to run over a policeman at a roadblock on the outskirts of Lurgan. “As he attempted to throw himself out of its path, he was struck by the car and injured,” the statement said. “Other police opened fire on the vehicle which drove on in an attempt to escape.” All three men were killed. The policemen who was struck by the car was not seriously hurt.</p> \n<p>The shooting happened so close to McKerr’s home that his family could hear it while watching Top of the Pops on television. Eddy Grant was singing I Don’t Wanna Dance, while outside the sound of the shooting went on and on. None of the three men who died had been armed. McKerr and his wife Eleanor had been considering emigrating to Canada. “How different life would have been,” she later wrote. McCauley heard the news at his parents’ home. It was not long before local musicians were singing a rebel song: “The three lie in a soldiers’ grave in a churchyard near the town …”</p> \n<p>Thirteen days after that, Tighe and McCauley were shot in the hayshed by members of the same small police unit. The RUC press release said that a patrol had noticed an armed man enter the shed and decided to investigate. “They were confronted by two men armed with rifles. Police opened fire and the two gunmen were hit. One man died at the scene and the other, who was seriously injured, was taken to Craigavon hospital.” The statement added that three rifles were found at the scene and the search was continuing. No mention was made of any listening devices or movement sensors, nor of the soldiers who were monitoring the shed from the listening post.</p> \n<p>At Craigavon hospital, McCauley underwent emergency surgery. After being wheeled out of theatre he was arrested and charged with possession of three rifles that were recovered from the hayshed. He was also told that his friend was dead. McCauley watched news coverage of the funeral on television in an intensive care ward. “It was a massive funeral. It seemed unreal, watching the family and our friends and neighbours walk behind Mickey’s coffin.” Then he was transferred to a secure unit at a hospital in Belfast, where doctors decided he needed nerve grafts to repair damage to his right arm.</p> \n<p>Eighteen days after the shooting at the hayshed, two more men were shot dead by officers of the HMSU, this time in Armagh, south-west of Belfast. Like the men shot dead in Lurgan, Seamus Grew, 30, and Roddy Carroll, 21, were terrorists: members of the Irish National Liberation Army. They were also unarmed. The subsequent RUC press statement was unusually detailed. It said that the two men had been in a car that had driven through a police checkpoint, and that the vehicle had been chased “at speed’’ before being forced to a halt. “The driver jumped out of the vehicle and the police, believing they were about to be fired on, themselves opened fire. Both occupants were shot.”</p> \n<p>There were a number of problems with the police statements about these three incidents – the principal one being that they were untrue.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>In both London and Dublin,</strong> ministers and officials had hoped that 1982 would offer some respite after the turmoil that followed the hunger strikes of the previous year; a year in which some political progress might be made in the north. Unemployment was rising sharply, however, and by the end of the year more than one in four men were out of work. And the bombings and shootings continued.</p> \n<p>By the time of the deaths of Carroll and Grew, many nationalists in Northern Ireland were enraged by the killings, and senior members of the Roman Catholic clergy were demanding an independent inquiry. Sinn Fein accused the police of carrying out summary executions. The suspicion grew that the RUC was running some sort of a death squad. Few people were prepared to use such a term, however: instead, someone coined the ambiguous phrase “shoot-to-kill”. Northern Ireland secretary Jim Prior immediately denied there was any “shoot-to-kill policy”. There was, he said, “a policy of capturing and dealing with terrorists”, but he added that if people who were suspected of being armed broke through a roadblock, “they must accept the security forces have to take the necessary action”.</p> \n<p>In June the following year, as a result of pressure from the director of public prosecutions for Northern Ireland, the RUC conducted fresh investigations into the two shootings. Eventually three members of the HMSU were charged with the murder of Eugene Toman, who had been shot by a constable named David Brannigan.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4bc2815ec81a323815da66785f15570b4d38659b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436370814784/db6ba4f0-09de-4a06-9633-244958f62059-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The hayshed in Derrymacash where MIchael Tighe was shot dead in 1982\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bullet holes in the window of the hayshed in Derrymacash where Martin McCauley and Michael Tighe were shot.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul McErlane</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When they went on trial in May 1984, the three men insisted that they had believed their lives to be in danger when they opened fire. The judge, Lord Justice Gibson, sitting with no jury, accepted their defence. Announcing his verdict, Gibson said he believed the officers to be “absolutely blameless”, adding: “That finding should be put on their record along with my own commendation as to their courage and determination for bringing the three deceased men to justice, in this case, to the final court of justice.”</p> \n<p>A fourth police officer, Constable John Robinson, was charged with the murder of Grew. Like a number of other members of the HMSU, Robinson was English and a former soldier. The prosecution case was that he had emptied his pistol into Carroll from a few feet, reloaded, walked around the car to where Grew was climbing out, and shot him from a distance of a few inches. It emerged during the trial that Grew and Carroll were thought to have been in contact with the INLA leader Dominic McGlinchey – who was believed to have ordered the bombing of a disco in a pub near Derry a few days earlier, in which 11 soldiers and six civilians had died. The police had information that McGlinchey, the man the popular press dubbed “Mad Dog”, would be in that car with Grew and Carroll.</p> \n<p>Although Robinson was cleared on the same grounds as his colleagues – that he believed his life to be in danger – his trial did not run smoothly. He admitted in court that he had not told the truth when interviewed by detectives investigating the shooting. He told the judge that senior officers had ordered him to give a false account in order to conceal that the dead men had been under surveillance by an army unit, and also to hide the fact that intelligence about them had been supplied by a special branch informer. Furthermore, Robinson said, there had been no roadblock, and no high-speed chase.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>As a consequence of Robinson’s admissions,</strong> the RUC was compelled to request an investigation by an outside force. John Stalker, the deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester police, agreed at the end of May 1984 to examine all six deaths. Nobody at special branch said a word to Stalker about the Kinnego embankment bombing, informers, or electronic surveillance. But he and his team soon began to work it out. He established that Toman, Burns and McKerr, like Grew and Carroll, had been followed before they died. He realised that no attempt had been made to halt the green Ford Escort in which the first three men were travelling, and no policeman had been struck by it. The officers of the HMSU had chased the car for 500 yards while firing 108 shots at its occupants. They had then been ordered to leave the scene while special branch detectives removed many of the cartridge cases. When investigators from the police Criminal Investigation Department arrived, they examined the wrong location.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Stalker found that the headquarters mobile support unit had been told to give false accounts to investigating detectives</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Stalker also found that the members of the headquarters mobile support unit had been told to give false accounts to investigating detectives – based on press releases that had been prepared before the shootings, in order to provide a response to the inevitable questions from journalists. These accounts were then slightly tweaked to fit in with the events as they had unfolded. The same measures had been taken before Grew and Carroll were shot dead.</p> \n<p>When McCauley went on trial in early February 1985, charged with possessing the three rifles found at the hayshed, Stalker sat in on the proceedings. Between hearings he chatted with McCauley’s solicitor, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/uk/pat-finucane\">Pat Finucane</a>, much to the anger of watching RUC officers, who told Stalker that they regarded Finucane, who had represented many people accused of being republican terrorists, as being “worse than an IRA man”. McCauley told the court he had been looking after the property for the elderly woman who owned it, and had climbed through an open window when he saw the rifles inside. They were heavily rusted Mausers of pre-second world war vintage. There was no ammunition. When the police who shot the two teenagers gave evidence, they admitted their superiors had presented them with a false story to explain why they had gone to the building (they had not seen an armed man in the vicinity), but insisted they had opened fire after shouting two warnings – “Police, throw out your weapons!” – and only when the pair pointed the rifles in their direction. The trial judge decided the police officers’ evidence was so unreliable that he would need to discount it completely. But he concluded that McCauley was also lying, and gave him a two-year prison sentence, suspended for three years.</p> \n<p>In his report on the affair, which has remained secret for 30 years, Stalker described how the regional head of the CID, the police department that investigates serious crime, had arrived at the hayshed after the shooting only to be told by a more junior special branch officer that “the scene of the incident was out of bounds” to CID. “Resignedly, he had a meal at Lurgan police station before arriving at the scene about one and a half hours after the incident had occurred,” Stalker reported. The senior detective could see special branch were busy at the hayshed, but chose not to question their presence as he knew he would not be enlightened. “If this were an isolated instance I might accept it as partly understandable,” Stalker wrote in his report, “but the same thread of special branch paramountcy runs through all the incidents. Such a situation does not develop overnight and must, it seems to me, have high-level endorsement.”</p> \n<p>Stalker discovered that the informant who had told special branch about the explosives at the hayshed had also provided information about Toman, Burns, McKerr and McCauley. He suspected that this man was not only an informer, but an agent provocateur, who had planted the old rifles at the hayshed. The surveillance was being maintained, and anyone who went to take the weapons was liable to be attacked. Stalker also found out how much money was being paid to this spy inside the IRA: it amounted to many thousands of pounds. But he never discovered the informer’s identity, and nor did anyone else outside a tight group of special branch detectives and MI5 officers. In Derrymacash, suspicion fixed upon an individual close to young Michael Tighe’s family, a man who vanished around the time Stalker began making his inquiries, and who has never been seen since.</p> \n<p>Stalker began to think that special branch, supported by MI5, might be using informants to lure terrorism suspects into pre-planned ambushes, mounted by police officers who were indeed shooting to kill.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Stalker had been on the case about six months</strong> before he learned that the events at the hayshed in October 1982 had been recorded. There was a sequence of tapes from the listening device, and the key tape – which captured the moment when the police opened fire – was known as Tape 042. There could be no better piece of evidence in the quest to establish whether or not some sort of shoot-to-kill policy had been operating: if a warning had been shouted it would have been audible on the tape; if not, it would be possible that the two young men had been ambushed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This is the act of a police force out of control</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>John Stalker</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In the book about the affair that he later published, Stalker wrote: “I passionately believe that if a police force of the United Kingdom could, in cold blood, kill a 17-year-old youth with no terrorist or criminal convictions, and then plot to hide the evidence from a senior policeman deputed to investigate it, then the shame belonged to us all. This is the act of a police force out of control.” Stalker was wrong, in this respect. The RUC and its HMSU were not out of control: far from it.</p> \n<p>Stalker was aware, when he arrived in Northern Ireland, that he was investigating members of a police force that faced unique challenges. By the time of the Kinnego embankment bombing, 168 RUC officers had lost their lives. He also appreciated that the intelligence-gathering activities of special branch played an indispensable role in the RUC’s operations. What he had not been told was that a strategy – devised by MI5 and adopted by the RUC in complete secrecy – had prioritised the acquisition of intelligence over the solving of crime and the prosecution of offenders, in a way that utterly transformed policing tactics in Northern Ireland.</p> \n<p>Stalker had not been informed that, within days of being appointed chief constable of the RUC in January 1980, Jack Hermon had asked MI5 to examine the role of intelligence-gathering in police operations. The study was conducted by Patrick Walker, a senior MI5 officer in Northern Ireland, who would go on to become director general of the agency in 1987. Today, the Walker report remains a state secret, but the <a href=\"http://www.patfinucanecentre.org/policing/walker1.html\">confidential police instruction</a> that was issued to senior CID officers, ordering them to implement its key recommendations, has surfaced. Dated 23 February 1981, this document makes clear that Hermon had accepted that the recruitment of agents from within the ranks of the paramilitary organisations <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2001/jun/14/northernireland.richardnortontaylor\">should take priority over the solving of individual crimes</a>; that CID should arrest no one without first consulting special branch, in order to avoid the inadvertent detention of such agents; and that the requirements of special branch and MI5 should take precedence over the work of the CID.</p> \n<p>Knowing nothing of the existence of the Walker report, and the way in which it was guiding counter-terrorism tactics, Stalker decided that he should pursue the recording from the hayshed. And having made his decision, Tape 042 became an obsession.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>In 1989 McCauley’s solicitor, Pat Finucane, was shot dead in front of his wife and children</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Martin McCauley, meanwhile, was still making</strong> sense of the extensive covert surveillance operation that had been disclosed at his trial. “It never occurred to us at that time that they could bug buildings,” he said earlier this year. “We were country people: we didn’t even have a telephone.” People in north Armagh began to speculate that there could be dozens of such listening devices in place, in the Lurgan area alone. They may well have been correct. But McCauley was not surprised that Tape 042 was not played in court. “If they had been telling the truth about the shooting they could have just played the tape straight away in court. But they couldn’t do that because they would have been up for murder.” Returning to Derrymacash, he was repeatedly stopped and questioned by police, and followed, he said, by men he recognised to be off-duty members of the Ulster Defence Regiment, the locally recruited British army unit. He found work as an engineer, married his girlfriend, Crist&iacute;n, and the first of their three children was born. But facing what he describes as harassment, the couple moved south of the border, to what they call the Free State. They settled first in Kildare – “we chose it with a pin in a map” – and then Monaghan.</p> \n<p>Life was not so very different down south. The special branch of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na were frequent visitors to the McCauleys’ home. “The guards were even worse than the RUC,” McCauley said. On one occasion an officer pointed a handgun at his head. On another, the couple were shocked – as Irish republicans residing in the Irish Republic – by a guard detective’s brusque suggestion: “Why don’t you fuck off back to Thatcherland?” Crist&iacute;n laughs and shakes her head. “That was so insulting on so many levels.”</p> \n<p>The war in the north dragged on. Lord Justice Gibson, the judge who had commended the men of the HMSU for having brought Toman, Burns and McKerr to “the final court of justice”, was murdered in April 1987. The IRA concealed a 500lb bomb inside a car and detonated it as Gibson drove past, then issued a statement in which they condemned the judge for supporting “RUC executioners” and said that he too had been brought to the “final court of justice”. His wife Cecily died alongside him. Two years later, McCauley’s solicitor, Pat Finucane, was shot dead in front of his wife and children. Four years after that, David Brannigan, the police officer who had shot dead Eugene Toman – and who believed he had been hung out to dry by his superiors – shot himself.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Over the years, McCauley continued to be arrested and questioned on both sides of the border</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Over the years, McCauley continued to be arrested and questioned on both sides of the border. He believes that this happened four or five times, but he can no longer recall for certain. Crist&iacute;n was arrested once. The authorities in both countries had come to the conclusion that her husband was an expert in the construction of home-made mortars as well as bombs. In February 1991, at the height of the Gulf war, the IRA attempted to assassinate prime minister John Major and his war cabinet as it met in Downing Street, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/08/world/ira-attacks-10-downing-street-with-mortar-fire-as-cabinet-meets.html\">firing three home-made mortars</a> from a van parked a few hundred yards away in Whitehall. One shell exploded in the rear garden of Number 10, injuring four people. McCauley, who was in Ireland at the time, was immediately picked up for questioning. The following month the family moved back north, to Lurgan, where McCauley engaged another well-known lawyer, Rosemary Nelson. They stayed in the town for seven years, until April 1998, when someone left a pipe bomb outside their front door. They packed their bags again and moved back to Kildare. The following week the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/jun/07/guardian190-good-friday-agreement-1998\">Good Friday agreement</a> brought the conflict largely, but not completely, to an end: the following year, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2009/jul/04/rosemary-nelson-murder-public-inquiry\">Rosemary Nelson was killed by a car bomb</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Stalker, meanwhile, having made his decision,</strong> pursued Tape 042 with the utmost vigour. He wanted not only the transcript of the recording, but the tape itself, and the logbooks that recorded where it had been stored and who had listened to it. The RUC refused to hand over this material, and after much stalling, Hermon told Stalker it belonged to MI5. Stalker later recounted that MI5 had agreed that he should be given the tape, but Chief Constable Hermon still refused. Hermon began avoiding Stalker and failed to return his calls.</p> \n<p>After eight months of this, at a meeting at MI5 headquarters in June 1985, Stalker had been told by the head of the agency’s operations in Northern Ireland that MI5 would never stand in the way of a murder investigation and that it would hand over all the information in its possession. No material was produced, then or later.</p> \n<p>Stalker submitted an interim report in September 1985, in which he said there was enough evidence to indicate that the five men shot dead in their cars were unlawfully killed by police officers. He also made clear that he was going to continue his search for evidence of a shoot-to-kill policy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09dedd85613202989915cf9804bfed6eb861f715\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436362532991/d782b946-dbed-457d-a5c9-bdbcf03ed112-460x335.jpeg\" alt=\"John Stalker\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Following a police investigation, John Stalker was suspended from duty and accused of consorting with criminals. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Smart/ANL/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Later that month, police in the north-west of England opened a criminal inquiry into one of his friends, Kevin Taylor, a successful Manchester businessman. Shortly after that, Stalker too came under investigation. In a widely publicised scandal, Stalker was suspended from duty and accused of consorting with criminals. The allegation was that Taylor had links with gangsters, known locally as the Quality Street gang, and that Stalker had attended social events with a number of them. Stalker was adamant that this was a pretext to remove him from the shoot-to-kill inquiry. It was not until August 1986 that <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/22/newsid_2535000/2535029.stm\">Stalker was fully exonerated</a> and returned to work. When it emerged that his efforts to defend himself had resulted in a &pound;22,000 legal bill – and that the police were expecting him to pay it himself – donations from the public began to arrive at his office. Stalker left the police service for good in 1987. He had devoted two years of his life to his inquiry, and concluded that he had failed.</p> \n<p>Stalker’s friend Taylor was subjected to a four-year police investigation which resulted in him being charged with fraud, but when the case came to trial, the prosecution withdrew. When he sued Manchester police, alleging it had been guilty of malicious prosecution, the force settled out of court for a sum in excess of &pound;1m.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, Colin Sampson, the chief constable of West Yorkshire, had agreed to take over the shoot-to-kill inquiry. He produced three reports, all of which were classified and not one of which led to any prosecutions. In January 1988 the attorney general, <a href=\"http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1988/jan/25/royal-ulster-constabulary-stalker\">Sir Patrick Mayhew, told the House of Commons</a> that the director of public prosecutions for Northern Ireland had concluded that there was no new evidence to warrant further prosecutions. Seamus Mallon, the Social Democratic and Labour party MP for Newry and Armagh, pointed out that no inquests had been held, and added: “Make no mistake about it, justice has been dispensed with in this statement to cover up the murky and illegal methods of MI5 and MI6, and the darker elements within the RUC.” Mayhew responded that “inquests will, of course, be held in due course”.</p> \n<p>That was more than 27 years ago, and the shoot-to-kill inquests have not been held. They were opened and adjourned in 1983, and reopened after Sampson submitted his reports in 1987. Eventually, the local coroner, who was charged with examining the deaths, gave up. As recently as last December, the coroner – the fifth to attempt to preside over the hearings – <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/legacy-inquests-need-resources-30857061.html\">was complaining furiously</a> that police had still not handed over relevant material.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>During all those years,</strong> while English detectives were struggling to make sense of the dirty war, Martin McCauley had not been idle. In the summer of 2001 he turned up in Colombia. He was arrested at Bogot&aacute; airport as he attempted to leave the country on a false passport. With him were Niall Connolly, a Sinn Fein official who lived in Cuba – the republican movement’s man in Havana – and James Monaghan, an alleged leader of the IRA’s engineering department. “Monaghan is to the Provisional IRA,” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2001/aug/19/northernireland.ireland\">the Guardian reported</a>, “what the fictional ‘Q’ was to James Bond and the British Secret Service – an improvisational genius in the technology of killing”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2004/dec/19/colombia.ireland\">Fugitive IRA man 'aided Colombia escape'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Colombian government said it had evidence that the three men had trained the Marxist Farc guerrilla army in the construction and use of home-made mortars that fired gas cylinder bombs. They were the sort of weapon the IRA had been developing in Northern Ireland since the early 70s, and had deployed in the attack on Downing Street. McCauley was said to have been travelling to and from Colombia since 1998. The following year Farc used a number of the weapons during <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1966616.stm\">fighting in the town of Bojay&aacute; </a>in the west of the country. One mortar bomb crashed through the roof of a church where hundreds of civilians were sheltering. At least 79 people were killed, around a third of them children.</p> \n<p>The exposure of the links between the Provisionals and a militia denounced in Washington DC as a gang of “narco-terrorists”, three years after the Good Friday agreement, was deeply embarrassing for the IRA. The three Irishmen denied the allegations against them. After a trial that dragged on for eight months they were convicted of passport offences but cleared of training the Farc, and set free. They went into hiding, with the result that when the prosecution appealed and a judge overturned the acquittals and sentenced all three to 17 years in jail, he was obliged to do so in their absence. Eight months later, in August 2005, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2005/aug/06/colombia.northernireland\">the three men resurfaced in Ireland</a>. Today McCauley is reluctant to say anything whatsoever about his South American adventure, at one point joking that he was never in Colombia. “I was!” Crist&iacute;n piped up.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>The McCauleys have settled down</strong> in a terraced house on the edge of Naas, the county town of Kildare. Now 52, McCauley works as a mechanic. He rises at five each morning and spends most of his working day outdoors. He will not admit that he was a member of the IRA – to do so would be to invite prosecution – but some parts of his history are an open book. There is no extradition arrangement between Colombia and the Republic of Ireland, but the British government has made clear that he will be arrested and extradited if he crosses the border to the north.</p> \n<p>McCauley, who is now a grandfather, looked worn-out when I met with him. Crist&iacute;n said this is because he works so hard. Asked whether he supported the peace process, his response – “Yes!” – was delivered before the question is finished. Peace could not have come a moment too soon for McCauley. When he talked about the shooting at the hayshed he became visibly agitated. His speech was rapid, he grimaced slightly and he began to squirm; he could not sit still. He has never sought counselling – not because he did not believe he needed it, but because he could never trust a counsellor. “That’s the way it was, you could never trust anyone.” He talked about placing memories to one side; putting things behind him. “That’s it: you have to close doors.”</p> \n<p>One matter that McCauley did not put behind him was his conviction for possession of the rusted Mauser rifles that were recovered from the hayshed. In late 2005, after his return from Colombia, he asked the Criminal Cases Review Commission, the UK body responsible for the examination of alleged miscarriages of justice, to look again at the case. The commission examined the evidence and <a href=\"http://www.ccrc.gov.uk/commission-refers-the-1985-conviction-of-martin-mccauley-to-the-northern-ireland-court-of-appeal/\">referred McCauley’s firearms conviction</a> to the Northern Ireland court of appeal.</p> \n<p>The current DPP of Northern Ireland decided that McCauley’s appeal should not be opposed. Stalker and Sampson’s reports remain unpublished, but key sections emerged in McCauley’s case and they make sober reading, even three decades after they were written. Stalker’s report concluded that there was “ample evidence” that three senior special branch officers – whose names have been redacted in the copy of the report seen by the Guardian – had conspired to pervert the course of justice and should be prosecuted.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2014/sep/22/northern-ireland-police-apologise-delay-secret-shoot-to-kill-files\">Northern Ireland police apologise for delay in disclosing ‘shoot-to-kill’ files</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Sampson – who faced accusations that he had been brought in to preside over a whitewash – wrote a report that was even more forceful. He had discovered that at the very moment MI5 had been telling Stalker that it would never stand in the way of a murder investigation, and as he struggled to get hold of a copy of Tape 042, the agency was in possession of its own bootleg copy of the recording. The language of Sampson’s report betrays the anger and contempt that he clearly felt on making this discovery. “The fact that the security service was in possession of and retained the copy tape until the early summer of 1985 and did not bring it to the attention of Mr Stalker is wholly reprehensible,” he wrote. “There can be no doubt that the unauthorised copy tape held by the security service was of great significance to the Stalker enquiry. A number of senior Security Service Officers, each with a varying degree of knowledge of the tape, had more than one meeting with Mr Stalker when he was persistently endeavouring to acquire information which he considered crucial to his enquiry. These efforts to obtain the type of evidence they possessed were perfectly obvious.”</p> \n<p>MI5 had told Sampson that the reason it did not hand over the tape to Stalker is that he did not ask them for it. “To defend their decision not to disclose this information on the grounds that he did not ask them directly for it is patently dishonest,” Sampson wrote. “Mr Stalker could not possibly have known that they possessed the very evidence he was seeking and to have frustrated his efforts in this way is nothing less than a grave abuse of their unique position.”</p> \n<p>MI5 eventually destroyed its copy of Tape 042. Sampson recommended that the junior officer who had carried out the destruction be granted immunity from prosecution in return for giving evidence against the MI5 chief and his deputy, whom he believed should be prosecuted for “doing an act with intent and tending to pervert the course of public justice”.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7ee071a977c038b545555c60601ab58a5ce7366\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436363024527/6e499dbe-889d-424c-958e-2cec16b632ff-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Today the barn is being used to store a number of life-size figures of cowboys and Indians, from a travelling wild west show.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The hayshed is now a store for lifesize, painted wooden figures of cowboys and Indians. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul McErlane</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Handing down <a href=\"http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2014/%5B2014%5D%20NICA%2060/j_j_MOR9377Final.htm\">his judgment</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2014/%5B2014%5D%20NICA%2060/j_j_MOR9377Final.htm\"> in McCauley’s appeal</a> last September, Sir Declan Morgan, the lord chief justice of Northern Ireland, was in agreement with Sampson: “The failure of the security service to disclose the tape to Mr Stalker and to provide it to the prosecution was reprehensible.” Furthermore, the deputy head of special branch had initially misled the director of public prosecutions by leading him to believe that there was no listening device in the hayshed. “These matters amounted cumulatively to grave misconduct,” Morgan said; McCauley’s conviction was quashed.</p> \n<p>In January, as a consequence of the Criminal Cases Review Commission investigation and the appeal court’s judgment, <a href=\"http://www.ppsni.gov.uk/Branches/PPSNI/PPSNI/Files/Documents/PPS%20Press%20Office/DPP%20REQUESTS%20INVESTIGATION%20INTO%20DESTRUCTION%20OF%20EVIDENCE%20BY%20SECURITY%20FORCES%20PRESS%20RELEASE.pdf\">the director of public prosecutions announced</a> that he was requesting an investigation into the concealment and destruction of the tape.

Its corrugated roof was in need of repair and the breeze-block wall to the left of the wooden double door was scarred and pockmarked. On either side of the door were grimy windows, which failed to let in more than a glimmer of light.

I’m sure that it would still be the largest point source of CO2, but since CO2 emissions have grown faster than projected in 1989, it would probably account for a smaller fraction of global CO2 emissions,” Bernstein wrote.</p> \n<p>The email was written in response to an inquiry on business ethics from the Institute for Applied and Professional Ethics at Ohio University.</p> \n<p>“What it shows is that Exxon knew years earlier than James Hansen’s testimony to Congress that climate change was a reality; that it accepted the reality, instead of denying the reality as they have done publicly, and to such an extent that it took it into account in their decision making, in making their economic calculation,” the director of the Institute, Alyssa Bernstein (no relation), told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>“One thing that occurs to me is the behavior of the tobacco companies denying the connection between smoking and lung cancer for the sake of profits, but this is an order of magnitude greater moral offence, in my opinion, because what is at stake is the fate of the planet, humanity, and the future of civilisation, not to be melodramatic.”</p> \n<p>Bernstein’s response, first posted on the Institute’s website last October, was released by the Union of Concerned Scientists on Wednesday as part of a report on climate disinformation promoted by companies such as ExxonMobil, BP, Shell and Peabody Energy, <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ucs-documents/global-warming/Climate-Deception-Dossiers_All.pdf\">called the Climate Deception Dossiers</a>.</p> \n<p>Asked about Bernstein’s comments, Exxon said climate science in the early 1980s was at a preliminary stage, but the company now saw climate change as a risk.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The science in 1981 on this subject was in the very, very early days and there was considerable division of opinion</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Richard Keil, Exxon spokesman</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“The science in 1981 on this subject was in the very, very early days and there was considerable division of opinion,” Richard Keil, an Exxon spokesman, said. “There was nobody you could have gone to in 1981 or 1984 who would have said whether it was real or not. Nobody could provide a definitive answer.”</p> \n<p>He rejected the idea that Exxon had funded groups promoting climate denial. “I am here to talk to you about the present,” he said. “We have been factoring the likelihood of some kind of carbon tax into our business planning since 2007. We do not fund or support those who deny the reality of climate change.”</p> \n<p>Exxon, unlike other companies and the public at large in the early 1980s, was already aware of climate change – and the prospect of regulations to limit the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, according to Bernstein’s account.<br /></p> \n<p>“In the 1980s, Exxon needed to understand the potential for concerns about climate change to lead to regulation that would affect Natuna and other potential projects. They were well ahead of the rest of industry in this awareness. Other companies, such as Mobil, only became aware of the issue in 1988, when it first became a political issue,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>“Natural resource companies – oil, coal, minerals – have to make investments that have lifetimes of 50-100 years. Whatever their public stance, internally they make very careful assessments of the potential for regulation, including the scientific basis for those regulations,” Bernstein wrote in the email.<br /></p> \n<p>Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard University professor who researches the history of climate science, said it was unsurprising Exxon would have factored climate change in its plans in the early 1980s – but she disputed Bernstein’s suggestion that other companies were not.

Feel free to share this e-mail with her. Corporations are interested in environmental impacts only to the extent that they affect profits, either current or future. They may take what appears to be altruistic positions to improve their public image, but the assumption underlying those actions is that they will increase future profits. ExxonMobil is an interesting case in point.</p> \n <p>Exxon first got interested in climate change in 1981 because it was seeking to develop the Natuna gas field off Indonesia. This is an immense reserve of natural gas, but it is 70% CO2. That CO2 would have to be separated to make the natural gas usable. Natural gas often contains CO2 and the technology for removing CO2 is well known. In 1981 (and now) the usual practice was to vent the CO2 to the atmosphere. When I first learned about the project in 1989, the projections were that if Natuna were developed and its CO2 vented to the atmosphere, it would be the largest point source of CO2 in the world and account for about 1% of projected global CO2 emissions. I’m sure that it would still be the largest point source of CO2, but since CO2 emissions have grown faster than projected in 1989, it would probably account for a smaller fraction of global CO2 emissions.</p> \n <p>The alternative to venting CO2 to the atmosphere is to inject it into ground. This technology was also well known, since the oil industry had been injecting limited quantities of CO2 to enhance oil recovery. There were many questions about whether the CO2 would remain in the ground, some of which have been answered by Statoil’s now almost 20 years of experience injecting CO2 in the North Sea. Statoil did this because the Norwegian government placed a tax on vented CO2. It was cheaper for Statoil to inject CO2 than pay the tax. Of course, Statoil has touted how much CO2 it has prevented from being emitted.</p> \n <p>In the 1980s, Exxon needed to understand the potential for concerns about climate change to lead to regulation that would affect Natuna and other potential projects. They were well ahead of the rest of industry in this awareness. Other companies, such as Mobil, only became aware of the issue in 1988, when it first became a political issue. Natural resource companies – oil, coal, minerals – have to make investments that have lifetimes of 50-100 years. Whatever their public stance, internally they make very careful assessments of the potential for regulation, including the scientific basis for those regulations. Exxon NEVER denied the potential for humans to impact the climate system. It did question – legitimately, in my opinion – the validity of some of the science.</p> \n <p>Political battles need to personify the enemy. This is why liberals spend so much time vilifying the Koch brothers – who are hardly the only big money supporters of conservative ideas. In climate change, the first villain was a man named Donald Pearlman, who was a lobbyist for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. (In another life, he was instrumental in getting the US Holocaust Museum funded and built.) Pearlman’s usefulness as a villain ended when he died of lung cancer – he was a heavy smoker to the end.</p> \n <p>Then the villain was the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a trade organization of energy producers and large energy users. I was involved in GCC for a while, unsuccessfully trying to get them to recognize scientific reality. (That effort got me on to the front page of the New York Times, but that’s another story.) Environmental group pressure was successful in putting GCC out of business, but they also lost their villain. They needed one which wouldn’t die and wouldn’t go out of business. Exxon, and after its merger with Mobil ExxonMobil, fit the bill, especially under its former CEO, Lee Raymond, who was vocally opposed to climate change regulation. ExxonMobil’s current CEO, Rex Tillerson, has taken a much softer line, but ExxonMobil has not lost its position as the personification of corporate, and especially climate change, evil. It is the only company mentioned in Alyssa’s e-mail, even though, in my opinion, it is far more ethical that many other large corporations.</p> \n <p>Having spent twenty years working for Exxon and ten working for Mobil, I know that much of that ethical behavior comes from a business calculation that it is cheaper in the long run to be ethical than unethical. Safety is the clearest example of this. ExxonMobil knows all too well the cost of poor safety practices. The Exxon Valdez is the most public, but far from the only, example of the high cost of unsafe operations. The value of good environmental practices are more subtle, but a facility that does a good job of controlling emission and waste is a well run facility, that is probably maximizing profit. All major companies will tell you that they are trying to minimize their internal CO2 emissions. Mostly, they are doing this by improving energy efficiency and reducing cost. The same is true for internal recycling, again a practice most companies follow. Its [sic] just good engineering.</p> \n <p>I could go on, but this e-mail is long enough.</p> \n</blockquote>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/98b31bae98b5704f48366673cebdd422d1b47684/0_338_2400_1440/2400.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1440,"width":2400,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chris Wilkins/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Tugboats tow the oil tanker Exxon Valdez off Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound 05 April 1989","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Chris Wilkins/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-08T20:41:43Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T02:16:36Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":482,"contributors":[{"name":"Suzanne Goldenberg","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/suzannegoldenberg"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Climate change","Exxon Mobil","Oil and gas companies","Climate change scepticism","US news","World news","Environment","Climate change","Oil","Energy industry"],"tags":[{"id":"environment/climate-change","webTitle":"Climate change"},{"id":"business/exxonmobil","webTitle":"Exxon Mobil"},{"id":"business/oilandgascompanies","webTitle":"Oil and gas companies"},{"id":"environment/climate-change-scepticism","webTitle":"Climate change scepticism"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment"},{"id":"science/scienceofclimatechange","webTitle":"Climate change"},{"id":"business/oil","webTitle":"Oil"},{"id":"business/energy-industry","webTitle":"Energy industry"}],"section":{"id":"environment"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Suzanne Goldenberg","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/suzannegoldenberg"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"environment"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-climate-change-1981-climate-denier-funding","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4afpk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-climate-change-1981-climate-denier-funding","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-climate-change-1981-climate-denier-funding"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/98b31bae98b5704f48366673cebdd422d1b47684/0_338_2400_1440/2400.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1440,"width":2400,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tugboats tow the oil tanker Exxon Valdez off Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound 05 April 1989.

She has written to Sir Jeremy Heywood, the head of the civil service and cabinet secretary, warning that there must be no “premature destruction of files or records that later become required as evidence”.</p> \n<p>Goddard has issued similar warnings to religious leaders, chief constables, the NHS and local authority leaders and listed the types of documents she will be seeking as the inquiry continues.</p> \n<p>These include reports, reviews, briefings, minutes and notes of correspondence relating to allegations about individuals, institutions, organisations and public bodies who may have been involved in or had knowledge of child sexual abuse. </p> \n<p>After Goddard opens the inquiry on Thursday at the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre in London, thousands of victims of child sexual abuse in the past, who have been waiting to give evidence of their experiences, will be able to start giving testimony. Phone lines will be opened and regional centres identified for victims to disclose their experiences in private, if they wish.</p> \n<p>Goddard will reveal on Thursday how the inquiry is going to be run, the timescales of the hearings, both public and private, how evidence will be gathered and which institutions and areas of public life will be examined. The inquiry has been set up to consider the extent to which state and non-state institutions have failed in their duty of care to protect children from sexual abuse and exploitation, to consider whether these failings have been addressed and to identify what steps need to be taken to protect children in future.</p> \n<p> Her opening statement is also expected to announce which victims representatives have been chosen to become part of the victims and survivors consultative panel – which has been set up by the inquiry – after a huge number of applications to take part. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/06/simon-danczuk-steps-back-campaigning-against-child-abuse\">Simon Danczuk steps back from campaigning against child abuse</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Lucy Duckworth, chair of victim support group Minister and Clergy Sexual Abuse Survivors (Macsas), welcomed the opening of the inquiry: “It is a momentous day now that the inquiry is finally opening and evidence can finally be taken. We are all looking forward to drawing a line under all the false starts in the past.”</p> \n<p>But controversy continues over Goddard’s comments that survivors lacked the objectivity required to be full quasi-judicial members of the inquiry.</p> \n<p>One group of victims, known as the White Flowers campaign group, demanded Goddard withdraw her comment, saying it stigmatised victims of child abuse. They are being represented by Michael Mansfield QC, and are now seeking core participant status in the process. </p> \n<p>Phil Frampton, of the White Flowers group, said of the inquiry’s opening: “This is the beginning of the beginning of the beginning. </p> \n<p>“There is a long way to go. We will do everything to ensure that victims and survivors have a strong voice throughout.”</p> \n<p>A team of specialist police officers who are part of Operation Hydrant, the overarching police inquiry into child sexual abuse in the past by prominent individuals, will be liaising with the Goddard inquiry. Allegations of abuse made by individuals will be passed to the police team. The scale of abuse being reported to the police nationally is unprecedented, and the inquiry process is likely only to increase the workload for the police service.<br /></p> \n<p>Simon Bailey, the national police lead on child abuse, said last month that by the end of this year officers anticipate they will be investigating more than 70,000 cases of child sexual abuse; an increase of 88% from 2012. </p> \n<p>Bailey revealed that police across the country were <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/20/1400-suspects-operation-hydrant-politician-and-celebrity-child-sex-abuse-inquiry\">investigating</a> 1,433 men, including 261 high-profile individuals, over allegations they abused children in the past. </p> \n<p>The independent inquiry was set up by the home secretary Theresa May a year ago, but has been plagued by delays and controversy. Its first chair Lady Butler-Sloss <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2014/jul/14/lady-butler-sloss-stands-down-child-abuse-inquiry\">stood down </a>in July last year amid questions over the fact her late brother, Lord Havers, was attorney general in the 1980s.</p> \n<p> Her replacement, Dame Fiona Woolf, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/oct/31/fiona-woolf-resigns-chairman-child-abuse-inquiry\">resigned</a> following criticism over her “establishment links”, most notably in relation to the former home secretary Leon Brittan, who died in January. </p> \n<p> After pressure from some victims, the panel set up to run the inquiry was disbanded in March, and the inquiry was reformed and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/mar/12/child-abuse-inquiry-gets-statutory-footing-as-new-panel-members-named\">given statutory powers</a> to compel witnesses to testify. </p> \n<p> The home secretary also extended the period of time covered by the wide-ranging inquiry, which will examine the extent to which state and non-state institutions failed in their duty of care to protect children from abuse and exploitation.</p> \n<p> May said she had listened to demands from the survivors and there would be no cutoff point for investigations. She also said no individual or institution should be able to fall through the gaps because of “geographical boundaries”.</p> \n<p> Tom Watson, the Labour MP who has campaigned to shed light on child abuse, said: “It is a year since the home secretary announced there would be an independent inquiry into child sexual abuse. </p> \n<p> “This inquiry must meticulously track down and analyse the evidence of failures not just within public services, and the child protection system but across all institutions whose failings contributed directly to what we can now see is an epidemic of abuse. </p> \n<p> “To make improvements in how we keep children safe requires effective answers as the failings and weaknesses in institutions become clearer. Nothing should wait if it does not need to; the inquiry must never be an excuse for inaction among policymakers or police.”</p> \n<p>Recent figures released by the inquiry show that between July 2014 and the end of March this year, &pound;1,261,316 has been spent on staffing, office accommodation, IT services, legal costs, travel and training.</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/578a1de1c22ee5d506ecc9c6f2cbf865cbb56289/0_86_4102_2461/4102.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2461,"width":4102,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jack Taylor/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Justice Lowell Goddard, who is chairing the inquiry.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jack Taylor/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T06:00:06Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T06:56:11Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Sandra Laville","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sandralaville"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Child protection","UK news","Crime"],"tags":[{"id":"society/childprotection","webTitle":"Child protection"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk/ukcrime","webTitle":"Crime"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sandra Laville","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sandralaville"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/09/child-abuse-inquiry","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aff9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jul/09/child-abuse-inquiry","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/09/child-abuse-inquiry"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/578a1de1c22ee5d506ecc9c6f2cbf865cbb56289/0_86_4102_2461/4102.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2461,"width":4102,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Justice Lowell Goddard, who is chairing the inquiry, will open proceedings with an hour-long statement outlining the work ahead.
