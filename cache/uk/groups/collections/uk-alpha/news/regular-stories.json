Across the country as a whole, the government believes tthe move will affect 90,000 households. It will exempt those on disability benefits such as disability living allowance, personal independence payment and employment and support allowance.</p> \n<p>Osborne made clear that he would also be looking to make significant savings to the system of tax credits brought in under the previous Labour government to top up the incomes of low-paid working families. </p> \n<p>“It has become a very, very expensive system. When it was introduced, we were told by Gordon Brown it was going to cost a couple of billion pounds,” he said. <br />“It now costs &pound;30bn. That is a huge sum of money. That’s three times the Home Office budget, so we have to make savings.”</p> \n<p>Osborne confirmed reports that he wishes to transfer the annual &pound;650m cost of providing free television licences for the over-75s from the Treasury to the BBC. <br /></p> \n<p>“The BBC is also a publicly funded institution, and so it does need to make savings and contribute to what we need to do as a country to get our house in order. So we are in discussion with the BBC,” he said.</p> \n<p>He reserved his most outspoken criticism of the BBC for its website, and claimed that it had effectively become “the national newspaper as well as the national broadcaster”. <br /></p> \n<p>“You wouldn’t want the BBC to completely crowd out national newspapers. If you look at the BBC website it is a good product but it is becoming a bit more imperial in its ambitions,” he said. <br /></p> \n<p>The planned cuts and his harsh language have confirmed suspicions among some BBC executives that the Tories wish to move against the corporation. The former BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland accused Osborne of “shoddy” accounting practices. </p> \n<p>“It is the worst form of dodgy Whitehall accounting. It is transferring social policy on to the licence fee,” he told BBC Radio 4’s The World this Weekend. </p> \n<p> Labour indicated that it might support the plan. The shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, told Sky News’s Murnaghan programme: “We have always said sensible savings at this time are really important and I don’t think the BBC can be excluded from that.”</p> \n<p> Osborne said that further savings of &pound;250m would be achieved by ending “taxpayer-funded subsidies” for 340,000 higher earners living in social housing. </p> \n<p>Local authority and housing association tenants on incomes of &pound;40,000 or more in London and &pound;30,000 in the rest of England will be told that from 2017/18 they will have to pay a market or near-market rent.</p> \n<p>Osborne is yet to confirm whether he is still considering a plan, leaked to the BBC, to make cuts to some disability benefits. The document, written before the election, suggests some claimants of sickness benefit could be instead shifted to jobseekers’ allowance – a cut of &pound;30 a week.</p> \n<p>In March, the supreme court found that<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/mar/18/uk-benefit-cap-is-lawful-supreme-court-rules\"> the government’s current benefit cap </a>had left claimants at risk of being unable to house, feed or clothe their families, putting it in breach of the UK’s obligations under the UN convention on the rights of the child.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436117937663/cd5491d8-e4e2-4ea9-978c-fbf2f60cc8eb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Reuters","altText":"George Osborne Andrew Marr show","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-05T17:48:54Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T23:00:45Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2612,"contributors":[{"name":"Rajeev Syal","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rajeev-syal"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Welfare","George Osborne","BBC","Iain Duncan Smith","Media","Politics","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/welfare","webTitle":"Welfare"},{"id":"politics/georgeosborne","webTitle":"George Osborne"},{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC"},{"id":"politics/iain-duncan-smith","webTitle":"Iain Duncan Smith"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rajeev Syal","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rajeev-syal"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jul/05/george-osborne-cut-benefits-cap-20000-year-outside-london","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4acqb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jul/05/george-osborne-cut-benefits-cap-20000-year-outside-london","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/05/george-osborne-cut-benefits-cap-20000-year-outside-london"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436117937663/cd5491d8-e4e2-4ea9-978c-fbf2f60cc8eb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"George Osborne on the Andrew Marr Show, where he said he would be further cutting the benefits cap to £20,000 a year per household outside London.

It does need to make savings as we get our house in order. We are in discussions with the BBC … and I am absolutely sure that they can make a contribution,” he said.</p> \n<p>The Sunday Times reported that the chancellor could also announce measures that would see the BBC take on the cost of free television licences for the over-75s, which amount to 4.5m licences at a total cost of more than &pound;650m. <br /></p> \n<p>In return, the BBC would be able to charge for the use of its iPlayer service to recoup some of the revenue lost by a decline in live TV viewers, the paper said. </p> \n<p>The corporation announced last week it was cutting more than 1,000 jobs because of a &pound;150m shortfall in its licence fee income as more people watch programmes online.</p> \n<p>Osborne added that the BBC’s website and its role should be scrutinised further to ensure it does not crowd out newspapers and their websites. </p> \n<p>“What is the Times, the Telegraph, the Daily Mail or the Sun or the Daily Mirror going to look like in 10 years’ time? It is going to be an online paper probably. <br /></p> \n<p>“If you’ve got a website that’s got features and cooking recipes – effectively the BBC website becomes the national newspaper as well as the national broadcaster. There are those sorts of issues we need to look at very carefully,” he said. <br /></p> \n<p>“You wouldn’t want the BBC to completely crowd out national newspapers. If you look at the BBC website it is a good product but it is becoming a bit more imperial in its ambitions.” <br /></p> \n<p>Labour MP Paul Farrelly, a member of the culture select committee in the last parliament said: “Before the election, when the select committee reported on the future of the BBC, the chair - who is now the new secretary of state - was adamant that the BBC should not pick up the tab for free TV licences, as this was social policy. This is an early test of whether he is strong enough to stick to his guns, or whether it is the treasury that calls all the shots.”</p> \n<p>In the interview, Osborne dismissed calls from the Conservative right to cut the highest rate of income tax from 45p to 40p, saying that the government must first stick to its election promises. </p> \n<p>He added that he was also planning in the budget to cut the benefits cap for those outside London to below &pound;23,000 a year. <br /></p> \n<p>“It is not fair that people out of work can earn more than people in work so we are going to cut the benefit cap, as we said in our manifesto, to &pound;23,000 in London – it will be lower in the rest of the country,” he said. </p> \n<p>In May, the reduction in the upper limit of what families will be able to claim annually from &pound;26,000 to &pound;23,000 was announced in the Queen’s speech.</p> \n<p>The chancellor also confirmed reports that he plans to increase the annual charges paid by those domiciled outside Britain for the purposes of tax. The loophole is one of the few issues that Ed Miliband was able to use to damage the Tories during the election campaign. <br /></p> \n<p>“With non-doms, I have jacked up the amount of money they pay every year for that non-dom status,” Osborne said. </p> \n<p>Since its introduction in 2008, the annual charge has increased from &pound;30,000 to up to &pound;90,000 for non-doms who have lived in Britain for 17 years or longer. </p> \n<p>The chancellor will also formally announce in the budget that people on higher earnings will have to pay up to the market rate for their council houses which is expected to raise to &pound;250m a year. <br /></p> \n<p>Local authority and housing association tenants on incomes of &pound;40,000 or more in London and &pound;30,000 in the rest of England will have to pay a market, or near market, rent from 2017/18. </p> \n<p>In the case of those living in local authority properties, the extra cash raised will go straight to the exchequer and help towards reducing the country’s debt burden.</p> \n<p>Writing in the Sun on Sunday, Osborne said: “Those earning &pound;40,000 a year in London and &pound;30,000 a year in other parts of the country will have to pay the market rent or at least something close to it, if they want to stay in their homes. It’s a simple matter of fairness.</p> \n<p>“The welfare system I want to see is one that helps people to get good jobs instead of giving them handouts.”</p> \n<p>On Monday, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, will meet with David Cameron and Osborne to discuss any fallout from the Greek referendum. </p> \n<p>“The Greek situation has an impact on the European economy, which has an impact on us,” said Osborne. </p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436094490519/fe6159c3-b39f-46ce-b42c-53aebe89ea36-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jeff Overs/BBC/PA","altText":"Andrew Marrand Chancellor George Osborne appearing on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-05T11:17:52Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T14:37:21Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Rajeev Syal","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rajeev-syal"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Budget","George Osborne","Politics","UK news","BBC","Media","Benefits","Society"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/budget","webTitle":"Budget"},{"id":"politics/georgeosborne","webTitle":"George Osborne"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"society/benefits","webTitle":"Benefits"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rajeev Syal","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rajeev-syal"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/05/osborne-accuses-bbc-of-imperial-ambitions-and-calls-for-savings","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4acn6","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jul/05/osborne-accuses-bbc-of-imperial-ambitions-and-calls-for-savings","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/05/osborne-accuses-bbc-of-imperial-ambitions-and-calls-for-savings"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436094490519/fe6159c3-b39f-46ce-b42c-53aebe89ea36-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The chancellor, George Osborne, appearing on BBC One’s The Andrew Marr Show.

They have not yet had to resort to food banks to feed their three children but know many who have.<br /></p> \n<p>The couple, from Port Glasgow, Inverclyde, work for a major supermarket and have lost out under cuts to tax credits from the last government. They have also been hit by the two-year freeze on in-work benefits and expect to lose out further on future tax credit changes.<br /></p> \n<p> “Things are really bad,” said Payne, 43, an Usdaw union official. “I’m working full time, my partner is working, we are doing everything we can, but sadly we are not paid enough. They keep cutting and freezing [tax credits] and are pushing hardworking families into poverty.”</p> \n<p>There are more than 5 million people like Mark and Agnes in the UK who work full time but still do not earn enough to live on, according to David Cameron’s former adviser and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/03/working-poor-minimum-wage\">new champion of the poorly paid</a>, Steve Hilton.<br /></p> \n<p>He and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/04/david-cameron-ally-rohan-silva-firms-must-be-forced-raise-low-pay\">Rohan Silva, who worked with Cameron at No 10 from 2010-13</a>, have called for companies to be forced to pay <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/society/living-wage\">the living wage</a> – an hourly rate well above the national minimum wage.</p> \n<p>As the government looks set to cut <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/jul/04/tax-credits-cuts-budget\">in-work benefits</a>, potentially including child tax credits and housing benefits, Hilton’s conversion from fighting against the minimum wage to clobbering big companies over low pay is timely for his old boss.</p> \n<p>The government is hoping to sweeten the pill of welfare cuts by offering help to low earners through the tax system, and by pressuring or incentivising employers to pay higher wages. <br /></p> \n<p>Retailers have been particularly targeted by Hilton. Citizens UK, the campaign group lobbying for workers to be paid at least the living wage, calculates that staff at the big four supermarkets alone collect &pound;956m in government support. This year, they have led <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/may/14/living-wage-campaigners-ask-tough-questions-britains-big-retailers-next\">a high-profile campaign to highlight low pay at major retailers’ annual shareholder meetings</a>.</p> \n<p>The big retailers who have spoken to the Guardian say the government and its backers are trying to hijack that campaign to divert attention away from the planned benefit cuts. <br /></p> \n<p>They say calculations of the amount their staff collect in benefits are likely to be inaccurate as not even they know how many of their workers are claiming such payments. <br /></p> \n<p>“The government is putting the blame, and raising pressure, on everybody else to do something [about low pay],” said one executive at a major retailer.</p> \n<p>“In effect, it is a trial by media, and not a constructive way of moving things forward,” said another retail boss. “Broadly speaking, our objectives are the same – to create aspiration, improve employment and help business drive scale so they can employ more people and pay more money. If it becomes about beating people up on paying the living wage without addressing other things, it becomes one-dimensional grandstanding.”</p> \n<p>The removal of child tax credits would particularly affect women, who make up 60% of the retail workforce. “We encourage the government to take care with any policy that makes a disproportionate impact on working women,” said John Munro, of the British Retail Consortium (BRC).</p> \n<p>“We don’t have detail on the number of people affected by changes such as cutting child tax credit, but I can imagine it will impact a good number of employees … We implore the government to think beyond [budget cuts] to the consequences for the individual.”</p> \n<p>According to a recent survey for trade union Usdaw, which represents many shop staff, 19% of workers are claiming some form of in-work tax credit.</p> \n<p>Citizens UK, which has led the campaign on the living wage, also says simply cutting tax credits is not the answer. It says its position differs from the likes of Hilton and Silva because it is advocating a strong national minimum wage with a voluntary living wage.<br /></p> \n<p> “We want to see how government and businesses can work together to increase the number of people receiving at least the living wage. We believe work should be the surest way out of poverty,” said Gillian Owen at the campaign group.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><br /></p> \n<p><br /></p> \n<p><br /></p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4e37af605df525a833d374071f791913dd1e8fc1/0_503_3921_2359/3921.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2359,"width":3921,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sarah Lee","altText":"Former Conservative spin guru Steve Hilton.

This will set neighbour against neighbour","standFirst":"Subsidised homes are being rebranded as not for decent people. This will set neighbour against neighbour","byline":"Zoe Williams","body":"<p>High earners will no longer be eligible for “subsidised” social housing, and will instead have to pay “market rates”, the chancellor has announced. <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/6529669/George-Osborne-I-have-to-get-tough-on-welfare.html\" title=\"\">George Osborne speaks directly to the nation from the pages of the Sun on Sunday</a> in a column that doesn’t actually use the words “clampdown” or “crackdown”, but those are the terms that crop up in all the reports, so we can assume a briefing note somewhere, in which the jargon of tackling crime is deployed to describe people who have the brass neck to rent social housing and have jobs.</p> \n<p>This is the first strand of the narrative: that social housing is for the vulnerable, and anybody not vulnerable has no business with it. It follows that aspirational people, hard-working families, strivers – real people – wouldn’t ever want to be socially housed, because they would know it wasn’t intended for them.</p> \n<p>The language is all about support (“<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/paying-to-stay-in-taxpayer-funded-housing\" title=\"\">In times of economic hardship it is more important than ever that social housing helps the most vulnerable in society,” began the consultation paper in 2012</a>), but the underpinning principle is that the state has no business being a provider of ordinary, decent housing to ordinary, decent people. It should instead be thought of as the houser of last resort.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This is an apparently serious attempt to persuade the nation that a little money is actually a lot of money</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>That’s a pretty standard Thatcherite line, but there’s more: what counts as “high income” is a <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/update/2015-07-04/osborne-looks-set-to-cut-social-housing-cash/\" title=\"\">household wage of &pound;40,000</a> (in London) or &pound;30,000 (elsewhere). The <a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/minimum-income-standard-uk-2015\" title=\"\">Joseph Rowntree Foundation last week released their minimum income standard figures</a> for 2015: the MIS is reached in a citizen’s jury style: a sequence of small groups are asked to figure out the least a person would need to live an acceptable life. It’s not intended as a poverty threshold, and it’s not as basic as food, clothes and shelter (it includes the category, “social and cultural participation”), but there’s also no frivolity on it.</p> \n<p>The most recent calculation was that a couple with two children would need to be earning &pound;20,024 each in order to reach the minimum. In other words, what Osborne calls a high-earning household is actually, in London, one that is only just managing to get by – and outside London, &pound;10,000 per annum shy of an acceptable life. This is a pretty extraordinary manoeuvre, an apparently serious attempt to persuade the nation that a little money is actually a lot of money.</p> \n<p>A rather pompous idea in the consultation document is that servicemen and women should take priority on social housing lists; but anybody above the rank of level-three private would, if married to someone on the same salary, immediately be “clamped down upon” and required to pay “market rent”.</p> \n<p>The third element of Osborne’s story is this “market” of his: social housing is subsidised, while the price of private rental stock is the true price, the natural one, reached by the irresistible logic of the market. Of course, social housing is only subsidised in the cost of its creation: it then pays for itself in two or three decades of rents. It only looks cheap in comparison with private rents,&nbsp;which themselves aren’t arrived at by market imperatives at all, but are the result of three decades of governments subsidising landlords with housing benefit.</p> \n<p>The chancellor’s tableaux, in which high-earning chancers, who shouldn’t be in social housing in the first place, must have their rents brought into line with the private rents around them – otherwise, and this is the best bit, it is not fair on those hardworking private tenants – is wrong, in all the usual, useful ways. The message is to forget the state (unless you are a loser); resent your neighbour (he is probably a high earner masquerading as a low earner, to get that social flat you’re subsidising with your taxes); and trust the market (where prices are created elegantly, neutrally, perfectly, like physics).</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/30/tory-housing-policy-no-redeeming-features\">The Tory housing policy with no redeeming features | Rowan Moore</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Like so many of these measures – the closure of the independent living fund, even the bedroom tax – I sincerely doubt that this will save the money they claim it will, and sometimes doubt that it will save any money at all. Rather, it’s about changing the atmosphere, the commonly held assumptions: life is hard and you’re on your own.</p> \n<p>I spent the entire coalition complaining about things on practical and/or human terms: whatever they say they’ll save, they won’t, and this hits the wrong people, and that is inhumane, and what are we punishing disabled people for anyway, and how much is this parsimony going to cost when it explodes down the line? All of that served, by some strange jiu jitsu, to reinforce the Conservatives’ opening proposition, that the country had been mired in a project of human kindness for far too long, which the state could no longer afford.</p> \n<p>So while it is useful to critique the bones of this plan, in the way a crossword is useful to pass the time, the vital bit is to refute the underlying principles: the state isn’t over; your neighbour isn’t a crook; the market isn’t magic; life doesn’t have to be hard; we’re not on our own.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436118352995/I-sincerely-doubt-that-Ge-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'I sincerely doubt that George Osborne's measure will save the money they claim it will.'

Zalkalns then took his own life.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>He had been allowed into Britain in 2007 despite a previous conviction in Latvia for murdering his wife and concealing her body.</p> \n<p>Alice’s family will ask a coroner on Monday to set up a wider inquiry into whether British authorities ever knew about Zalkalns’s homicidal past. A pre-inquest hearing is due at West London coroner’s court, where the scope of the inquiry into the death of the gifted teenager may be decided.<br /></p> \n<p>Alice’s family want an investigation into whether British authorities breached their obligations under the European convention on human rights and whether European Union countries shared information on highly dangerous offenders. Article 2 of the ECHR protects the right to life.</p> \n<p>In 2009, Zalkalns was arrested by the Metropolitan police over an alleged indecent assault of a 14-year-old girl in west London. It is not known whether British police knew of his murder conviction during that investigation. That case was dropped, police say, after the girl declined to make a statement.</p> \n<p>In a statement, Alice’s family said: “Losing Alice has left a hole in our lives that can never be filled. But our questions about why the authorities knew nothing about her murderer, despite his previous conviction and arrest, can and should be answered. We hope the coroner will agree.”</p> \n<p>Coroner Chinyere Inyama will make the decision. If he rejects the family’s plea then the inquest would be a relatively narrow one. Coroners have the power to turn their inquest into a wider inquiry and to make recommendations to prevent further deaths.<br /></p> \n<p>The Gross family are being supported by the civil rights group Liberty. Emma Norton, a solicitor for Liberty, said: “This government wants to monitor all emails or mobile phones, but does not want to know if someone has a murder conviction. A murder conviction is something the authorities ought to know about.</p> \n<p>“The state has a positive obligation to protect people from a known risk, in this case someone who was a violent offender.”</p> \n<p>Norton added: “What happened to Alice appears to have come about, in part, because the authorities knew nothing about this man. Alice’s family want to know why this was the case. Did an information-sharing system break down? Does it even exist? Whatever the answer, they want to do something about it.”</p> \n<p>Alice’s family say they do not want their daughter’s death exploited by anti-immigration groups: “We believe in freedom of movement and human rights, as did Alice, and we repeat our request that her death not be appropriated by those with an anti-immigration agenda.</p> \n<p>“We live in a multicultural and multifaith area, and our community has been extraordinary in its unity, sympathy, compassion and support for our family since our daughter was taken from us in this brutal and senseless way.”</p> \n<p>Zalkalns avoided facing justice for Alice’s death by killing himself and his body was found by police days after they had recovered the girl’s body following a wide-ranging search lasting weeks.</p> \n<p>Scotland Yard has said there was enough evidence to have charged Zalkalns had he lived and the probable motive for his crime was sexual.</p> \n<p>Alice was last seen on 28 August 2014 after going for a walk. Police believe Zalkalns came across Alice during her final walk along a canal towpath.</p> \n<p>One week later, Zalkalns, 41, was reported missing from his west London home.</p> \n<p>After a month of searches, Alice’s body was recovered from the Brent river on 30 September, after it had been deliberately weighed down by parts of a tree trunk.</p> \n<p>On 4 October, Zalkalns’s body was found hanging from a tree in dense woodland in Boston Manor park, west London.</p> \n<p>A music fund has been set up in Alice’s name, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://alice.poppymadeleine.gross.muchloved.com/\">Alice’s Youth Music Memorial Fund.</a></p>","section":"Law","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0a32b129df3915e51bed8a1c642b6dafcc0d8999/0_528_1764_1059/1764.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1059,"width":1764,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Metropolitan Police/PA","altText":"Alice Gross missing<br>Undated handout file photo issued by the Metropolitan Police of missing 14-year-old Alice Gross as detectives investigating the disappearance of the schoolgirl are treating 41-year-old Arnis Zalkalns as a suspect in her disappearance.

He was a good boy. He was a good student who liked football and followed Barcelona. He was religious, like his brothers. This year he was supposed to have been in the twelfth grade. I wanted him to go to university and become a teacher.”</p> \n<p>Gaza’s youngest residents still appear to be bearing the heaviest and most lasting consequences of last summer’s war. A report published on Monday by Save the Children, entitled A Living Nightmare: Gaza One Year On, says 551 children were killed and 3,436 were injured, of whom 10% suffered permanent disability. One Israeli child was killed during the war, and 270 injured.</p> \n<p>Three-quarters of Gaza’s children experience unusual bedwetting regularly, the report says, while 89% of parents report that their children suffer constant feelings of fear, and more than 70% of children say they are worried about another war. Seven out of 10 children interviewed now suffer regular nightmares.</p> \n<p>What is also clear is that the loss of older teenagers – such as the six Doha pupils on the brink of adulthood – has affected younger siblings and parents, compounding a deepening sense of fatalism and hopelessness in a Gaza where the promised reconstruction has barely happened and whose outlook, Palestinians say, seems bleaker than at any time in recent memory.</p> \n<p>A green Hamas flag flies above the family compound where Muhammad Behabsa, 17, died, off a sandy lane in the Salaam district of Rafah. There seems little question that the house and five others beside it, occupied by relatives, were the intended Israeli target.<br /></p> \n<p>Like many living in areas heavily hit by military strikes during the war, the Behabsa family still live next to the ruins where their family members died. The main house was hit in an air strike that left a crater still visible in the dusty yard. A little later several smaller houses belonging to family members behind the compound were reduced to rubble in a second set of strikes, apparently by artillery fire.</p> \n<p>“It happened at three o’clock in the morning on 2 August,” recalls Muhammad’s father, Shiab Hussein Behabsa, 52. “He was on his own, sleeping in the diwan of one of the houses behind this one. An F-16 hit this house with a bomb at first and then three artillery shells hit the five houses behind.</p> \n<p>“He was cut to pieces.. Five of his cousins were killed in the same incident.” <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8110ef67103c4a8229a0babab7ef8d3ab6e939b5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435825743254/fdd71ce2-0e53-4eab-8b9d-d4e2ed3216cf-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Naim Qishta holds a picture of his son Abdullah, a pupil at Doha school, killed during last summer’s war in Gaza during an Israeli attack.

His friends from school still come to visit. He was my second son but he was the dynamo of the family. He liked to joke but he would also help. If I needed anything it would be him who went to fetch it from outside.”</p> \n<p>Abdullah Qishta, 17, also from the Doha school, died on the same day while returning from a summer job he had found at a dairy farm.</p> \n<p>“When the war started, he continued working,” his father, Naim, says. “We moved to a house belonging to a relative of my wife when the ground invasion started. On 2 August the owner called and asked him if he would go and feed the animals. He said the situation near the farm was fine. But it wasn’t. When he got there the Israelis were close so the owner said he should sleep there.</p> \n<p>“He wanted to come home and get some clothes and take a shower. He was calling every 10 minutes. Then the calls stopped. He had been walking back with another worker from the farm when he was hit by a drone missile near the house.”</p> \n<p>Back at the school, now closed for the summer holidays, Salim Abu Rous describes the aftermath of losing so many of his pupils. “In the beginning the education ministry sent people to support the school. We had a mental health programme with plays and films and activities supported by Unicef. </p> \n<p>“We had a football team named after the boys. Some of their friends still talk about them. </p> \n<p>“The ministry never told us we had lost the most pupils of all the schools in Gaza. I have no explanation of why we suffered the worst. But the war took place during the school holidays. The boys were with the families. Perhaps that is why so many children died.”</p> \n<p>Hasan Zeyada, a community psychologist in Gaza, believes that children and young people have been the most affected group, both because of the last war and in the wider context of blockade and conflict that means children over the age of nine will have lived through three wars and continuous economic siege.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ddf2fa027c54b811df616c68270684edc7b77b2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435825986437/dd4a31f9-f1af-4ea4-afaf-5b3162b83e1a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Suleiman Loulahi holds up a picture of his son Bilel, aged 17, a pupil at the Doha school in Rafah who was killed in an Israeli strike on 2 August last year.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suleiman Loulahi holds up a picture of his son Bilel, 17, a pupil at the Doha school in Rafah who was killed in an Israeli strike on 2 August last year.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Beaumont for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Children present problems you would expect. Hyper-vigilance, nightmares, cognitive problems. Teachers complain about falling performance in the classroom. In communication they become aggressive verbally and physically. </p> \n<p>“A yardstick is the feelings of hopelessness and powerlessness here in Gaza. It affects motivation and depresses the emotions.”</p> \n<p>Back in Rafah, Suleiman Loulahi, a Bedouin agricultural worker who lost his son Bilel, 17, a pupil at Doha, also on 2 August, reflects the new fatalism that has crept into Gaza.<br /></p> \n<p>He has named a new baby after the brother he never knew, killed by a missile while he was returning to his house from a relative’s where they were feeding his pigeons. </p> \n<p>Loulahi says: “I look at my other children, and these days I wonder what the point is encouraging them to go to school, to better themselves and get on, when there will only be another war in a few years. When I’ll risk losing them again.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435933805108/f017ead1-51e3-4f6b-ab4e-442850177801-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/REX/Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/REX","altText":"Bullet and shell holes on a house in Gaza","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/REX/Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/REX"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435934413435/a310b960-0a91-4551-8936-439e68338fa4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A sandstorm over ruined buildings in Gaza.

One is former Green party deputy mayor of London, Jenny Jones, and the other three defected from the Conservative party to Ukip in January 2007. </p> \n<p>“There’s no doubt that the House of Lords is in desperate need of a radical overhaul, but until the upper chamber is elected it should at least see appointment according to national vote share,” said Bennett, who added that “no matter how deeply we disagree with Ukip’s politics, they should also be far better represented in the House of Lords”.</p> \n<p>“If the Lords is to retain legitimacy, then it has to have at least a pretence of some sort of proportionality,” said Carswell, the MP for Clacton. “The total number of people who voted Green or Ukip in the general election is greater than the total number of people who voted Liberal Democrat by a long chalk and yet there is a vast number of Lib Dem peers.”</p> \n<p>Despite only winning eight seats and 7.9% of the vote in May’s general election, the Liberal Democrats have 102 peers, making up 21% of the party-affiliated membership of the House of Lords. 93% of the Lib Dem parliamentary party is currently made up of peers.</p> \n<p>The leader of the House of Lords, Lady Stowell, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/25/house-of-lords-to-see-increase-in-liberal-democrats\">admitted last month</a> that the Lib Dems could expect to see their numbers in the Lords swell when the new list of peers is published in the coming weeks, saying it would reflect the fact that it was one of two parties to make up the last government. </p> \n<p>The dissolution honours list is usually published in the months following a general election and compiled by the prime minister in the last parliament. It often includes peerages for former MPs who retired or failed to get re-elected.</p> \n<p>Carswell said that awarding the Lib Dems more peers would be the Westminster system rewarding rejection at the ballot box. “Don’t get me wrong, I happen to like quite a lot of ex-Lib Dem MPs,” he said. “They’re thoroughly nice people, many of them. But the voters said no to them.”</p> \n<p>“The Green party has only one peer, though a proportional system would give us 21,” said Bennett. “The Liberal Democrats, by contrast, would be entitled to 44, rather than their 102 and rising. Appointing yet more Lib Dem lords, and ignoring the Greens, would be deeply undemocratic.”</p> \n<p>Since the general election, in which the Greens won 3.8% of the vote and Ukip 12.6%, the two parties have <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/18/green-party-ukip-electoral-reform-first-past-post-elections\">shared a platform</a> on a number of occasions to campaign for constitutional reform and both have been outspoken about what they see as the injustices of the first-past-the-post electoral system.</p> \n<p>According to analysis from <a href=\"http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/blog/system-crisis\">the Electoral Reform Society</a>, had the election been conducted with a system of proportional representation, Ukip might have won 80 seats in the Commons and the Greens 20. The Liberal Democrats would have won around 47 MPs, compared with their current eight, and the SNP would have picked up only about 30 seats, compared with their current 56.</p> \n<p>It is the first time in modern political history that a Conservative government has not also dominated the second chamber, as the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the majority of hereditary peers, many of whom were Conservative supporters.</p> \n<p>The Lords is therefore likely to be a battleground for the government as Conservative peers are heavily reliant on the support of crossbenchers to outnumber the opposition. The Conservative party has 228 members, Labour has 212 and there are 178 crossbenchers. </p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/069095409848b8b90c50653f970fabd952d2fac3/0_13_3500_2101/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2101,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Oli Scarff/Getty Images","altText":"Queen Elizabeth II Attends The State Opening Of Parliament<br>LONDON, ENGLAND - MAY 09:  Peers leave the House of Lords following the State Opening of Parliament on May 9, 2012 in London, England.

Since then, the lander has undergone a period of hibernation from which it <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/jun/14/rosetta-mission-hibernating-philae-lander-spacecraft-wakes-up\">awoke in June</a>, having recharged its solar panels.</p> \n<p>Neither Rosetta nor Philae are equipped to search for direct evidence of life after a proposal to include this in the mission was allegedly laughed out of court. Astronomer and astrobiologist Prof Chandra Wickramasinghe, who was involved in the mission planning 15 years ago, believes people should be more open to the possibility of alien life.</p> \n<p>Wickramasinghe said: “Five hundred years ago it was a struggle to have people accept that the Earth was not the centre of the universe. After that revolution our thinking has remained Earth-centred in relation to life and biology. It’s deeply ingrained in our scientific culture and it will take a lot of evidence to kick it over.” </p> \n<p>He and colleague Dr Max Wallis, from the University of Cardiff, believe 67P and other comets like it could provide homes for living microbes similar to the “extremophiles” that inhabit the most inhospitable regions of the Earth. </p> \n<p>Comets may have helped to sow the seeds of life on Earth and possibly other planets such as Mars, they argue. </p> \n<p>The scientists have carried out computer simulations that suggest microbes could inhabit watery regions of the comet. Organisms containing anti-freeze salts could be active at temperatures as low as -40C, their research shows. <br /></p> \n<p>The comet has a black hydrocarbon crust overlaying ice, smooth icy “seas” and flat-bottomed craters containing lakes of re-frozen water overlain with organic debris. <br />Wickramasinghe said data coming from the comet seems to point to “micro-organisms being involved in the formation of the icy structures, the preponderance of aromatic hydrocarbons, and the very dark surface”.<br /></p> \n<p>“These are not easily explained in terms of prebiotic chemistry. The dark material is being constantly replenished as it is boiled off by heat from the sun. Something must be doing that at a fairly prolific rate.” </p> \n<p>The astronomers present their case for life on 67P at the Royal Astronomical Society’s National Astronomy Meeting in Llandudno, Wales. </p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/850ae57f218d3313969c316a0c1f319bcf49d4b1/0_167_2192_1315/2192.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1315,"width":2192,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"ESA/PA","altText":"Rosetta project<br>Embargoed to 0001 Monday July 6\r\rUndated handout photo issued by the European Space Agency of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko at a distance of 285 km, as comet lander Philae may be sitting on an object teeming with alien microbial life, according to two leading astronomers.
