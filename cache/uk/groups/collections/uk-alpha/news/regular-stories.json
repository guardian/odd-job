The leeway provides the director, who has never in the agency’s history been a medical doctor, with significant influence over limitations the US government sets to preserve safe, humane and ethical procedures on people.</p> \n<p>CIA director George Tenet approved abusive interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, designed by CIA contractor psychologists. He further instructed the agency’s health personnel to oversee the brutal interrogations – the beginning of years of controversy, still ongoing, about US torture as a violation of medical ethics.</p> \n<p>But the revelation of the guidelines has prompted critics of CIA torture to question how the agency could have ever implemented what it calls “enhanced interrogation techniques” – despite apparently having rules against “research on human subjects” without their informed consent.</p> \n<p>Indeed, despite the lurid name, doctors, human-rights workers and intelligence experts consulted by the Guardian said the agency’s human-experimentation rules were consistent with responsible medical practices. The CIA, however, redacted one of the four subsections on human experimentation.</p> \n<p>“The more words you have, the more you can twist them, but it’s not a bad definition,” said Scott Allen, an internist and medical adviser to Physicians for Human Rights.</p> \n<p>The agency confirmed to the Guardian that the document was still in effect during the lifespan of the controversial rendition, detention and interrogation program.</p> \n<p>After reviewing the document, one watchdog said the timeline suggested the CIA manipulated basic definitions of human experimentation to ensure the torture program proceeded.</p> \n<p>“Crime one was torture. The second crime was research without consent in order to say it wasn’t torture,” said Nathaniel Raymond, a former war-crimes investigator with Physicians for Human Rights and now a researcher with Harvard University’s Humanitarian Initiative.</p> \n<h2><strong>Informed consent, the director and his ‘human subject research’ panel</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b667e2e3c12242de17d8cef4b64bdd1fdfd494b2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434334724727/14c06666-aa9e-499b-9514-77cadfe5682d-460x144.jpeg\" alt=\"cia human experimentation\" width=\"460\" height=\"144\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The CIA’s internal guidelines for human experimentation, published here for the first time</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Guardian / via ACLU</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e064911311d6c38792d286cf603a37f5aa6af24c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434334990954/55e2ee2c-bd92-4bf6-99ae-88de75040926-211x420.jpeg\" alt=\"cia director human experimentation\" width=\"211\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The CIA director’s powers over ‘human subject research’ have not been previously disclosed.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian / via ACLU</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The document containing the guidelines, dated 1987 but updated over the years and still in effect at the CIA, was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the ACLU and shared with the Guardian, which is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/law/ng-interactive/2015/jun/15/human-experimentation-cia-document\">publishing it for the first time</a>.</p> \n<p>The relevant section of the CIA document, “Law and Policy Governing the Conduct of Intelligence Agencies”, instructs that the agency “shall not sponsor, contract for, or conduct research on human subjects” outside of <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/\">instructions on responsible and humane medical practices</a> set for the entire US government by its Department of Health and Human Services.</p> \n<p>A keystone of those instructions, the document notes, is the “subject’s informed consent”.</p> \n<p>That language echoes the public, if obscure, language of Executive Order 12333 – the seminal, Reagan-era document spelling out the powers and limitations of the intelligence agencies, including rules <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jul/23/nsa-surveillance-reform-reagan-order\">governing surveillance by the National Security Agency</a>.

They advised interrogators on the physical and psychological administration of what the agency called “enhanced interrogation techniques”. After observation, the doctors offered perspectives on calibrating them to specific detainees’ resilience.</p> \n<p>OMS staff assigned to the agency’s black sites wrote emails with subject lines like: “Re: acceptable lower ambient temperatures”.</p> \n<p>The CIA, which does not formally concede that it tortured people, insists that the presence of medical personnel ensured its torture techniques were conducted according to medical rigor. Several instances in the Senate torture report, partially declassified six months ago, record unease among OMS staff with their role in interrogations.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There is a disconnect between the requirement of this regulation and the conduct of the interrogation program</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Steven Aftergood, Federation of American Scientists</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But other physicians and human rights experts who have long criticized the role of medical staff in torture said the extensive notes from CIA doctors on the interrogations – as they unfolded – brought OMS into the realm of human experimentation, particularly as they helped blur the lines between providing medical aid to detainees and keeping them capable of enduring further abusive interrogations.</p> \n<p>Doctors take oaths to guarantee they inflict no harm on their patients.</p> \n<p>Zubaydah “seems very resistant to the water board”, an OMS official emailed in August 2002. “No useful information so far ... He did vomit a couple of times during the water board with some beans and rice. It’s been 10 hours since he ate so this is surprising and disturbing. We plan to only feed Ensure for a while now. I’m head[ing] back for another water board session.”</p> \n<p>Doctors and intelligence experts said they could imagine legitimate, non-abusive CIA uses for human experimentation.</p> \n<p>Steven Aftergood, a scholar of the intelligence agencies with the Federation of American Scientists, suggested that the agency might need to study polygraph effects on its agents; evaluate their performance under conditions of stress; or study physiological indicators of deception.</p> \n<p>But all said that such examples of human experimentation would require something that the CIA never had during the interrogation program: the informed consent of its subjects.</p> \n<p>“There is a disconnect between the requirement of this regulation and the conduct of the interrogation program,” said Aftergood. “They do not represent consistent policy.”</p> \n<h2><strong>A director’s decision, oversight and an evolving rulebook</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f159858a811f35772e67ecd90be6799ca91b12c7\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f159858a811f35772e67ecd90be6799ca91b12c7/0_467_2190_1314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"george tenet george bush\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Tenet at the White House in 2003, after his historic approval of so-called ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Draper/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Months after Zubaydah’s interrogation, Tenet issued formal guidance approving brutal interrogation techniques, including waterboarding. Tenet explicitly ordered medical staff to be present – a decision carrying the effect of having them extensively document and evaluate the torture sessions.</p> \n<p>“[A]ppropriate medical or psychological personnel must be on site during all detainee interrogations employing Enhanced Techniques,” Tenet wrote in January 2003. “In each case, the medical and psychological staff shall suspend the interrogation if they determine that significant and prolonged physical or mental injury, pain or suffering is likely to result if the interrogation is not suspended.”</p> \n<p>In response to the Guardian’s questions about the newly disclosed document and its implications for the CIA’s post-9/11 torture program, CIA spokesperson Ryan Trapani provided the following statement:</p> \n<p>“CIA has had internal guidelines interpreting Executive Order 1233 in place continuously from 1987 to present. While some provisions in these guidelines have been amended since September 11, 2001, none of those amendments changed provisions governing human experimentation or were made in response to the detention and interrogation program.”</p> \n<p>Ironically, the only part of the CIA’s torture program in which agency officials claimed they were hamstrung by prohibitions on human experimentation is when they were asked by John Helgerson, their internal inspector general, if torture was effective.</p> \n<p>Their response was framed as an example of the agency respecting its own prohibition on human experimentation. In more recent days, the CIA has used it as a cudgel against the Senate report’s extensive conclusions that the torture was ultimately worthless.</p> \n<p>“[S]ystematic study over time of the effectiveness of the techniques would have been encumbered by a number of factors,” reads a CIA response given to Helgerson in June 2003, a point the agency <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/2014-press-releases-statements/cia-fact-sheet-ssci-study-on-detention-interrogation-program.html\">reiterated</a> in its formal response to the Senate intelligence committee.

Fifteeen minutes from the deadline he was three short, but he managed to get together enough last-minute names to make 35 exactly.</p> \n<p>It was not possible for MPs to switch nominations, unless the candidate drops out – as Mary Creagh did on Friday evening.</p> \n<p>Corbyn seemed more phlegmatic about his chances than some of his supporters who tried to bombard undecided MPs to pressure them into nominating him.</p> \n<p>He said it would be great to make the ballot paper but if he did not he was sure he had put the issues of austerity and nuclear weapons on the ballot paper.</p> \n<p>Corbyn also expressed his regret that Harriet Harman had not stayed on as interim leader for a year or two years to give the party time to have a policy debate and reflect on the election defeat rather than enter a leadership contest built round personalities.</p> \n<p>He said Labour needed to reflect on why the party lost votes to the Greens, and Ukip, as well as why so many younger people did not vote.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/51f5863d7e504f7edcf72c8e121ec9415e1038c3/0_0_3500_2101/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2101,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Niall Carson/PA","altText":"Jeremy Corbyn","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Niall Carson/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T11:27:49Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T11:51:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Wintour","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/4/1423058528318/Patrick-Wintour-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patrickwintour"},{"name":"Rowena Mason","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899403654/Rowena-Mason-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rowena-mason"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Labour party leadership","Andy Burnham","UK news","Yvette Cooper","Liz Kendall","Labour","Politics"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/labourleadership","webTitle":"Labour party leadership"},{"id":"politics/andyburnham","webTitle":"Andy Burnham"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/yvette-cooper","webTitle":"Yvette Cooper"},{"id":"politics/liz-kendall","webTitle":"Liz Kendall"},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/15/labour-leftwinger-jeremy-corbyn-wins-place-on-ballot-for-leadership","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49zva","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jun/15/labour-leftwinger-jeremy-corbyn-wins-place-on-ballot-for-leadership","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/15/labour-leftwinger-jeremy-corbyn-wins-place-on-ballot-for-leadership"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/51f5863d7e504f7edcf72c8e121ec9415e1038c3/0_0_3500_2101/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2101,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A late surge for Jeremy Corbyn saw him reach the required number needed to ensure his position in the contest.

The 4 theories","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-15T11:59:53Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T12:06:55Z","body":"No one expects Jeremy Corbyn to win the Labour leadership contest. (Paddy Power have him as the 50/1 outsider in odds they have released today.) But the fact that he is in the contest will make a difference to the way it is conducted. And who will benefit? There are at least four theories, two of which are very plausible, one of which is less credible, and one of which is more tentative. Let’s start with the iffy one. 1 - Yvette Cooper or Liz Kendall benefit - because Corbyn splits the leftwing vote. A version of this theory was floated in the Sun on Sunday just over a week ago, when it claimed that Blairites were helping Corbyn get on the ballot to handicap Andy Burnham (the current favourite) by splitting the leftwing vote. But this scenario does not really stack up, for various reasons. First, the Labour party uses a preferential voting system, and the votes of the candidates who comes last get redistributed. So, if Corbyn were to come last in the first round, and most of his supporters were to choose Burnham as the next-best choice for leftwingers, Burnham would not lose out anyway. Second, it may well be Kendall who comes last in the first ballot. And, third, although Burnham is seen in some quarters as more “leftwing” than Cooper, this is highly questionable. 2 - Andy Burnham benefits - because he is no longer seen as the leftwinger. Burnham and Cooper are broadly similar in their politics, and the leftwing/centrist labels applied to them are not particularly helpful. But many people still currently perceive the contest through this prism, and Cooper has actively tried to portray herself as the centrist candidate, with Burnham on the left and Kendall on the right. In the light of that, Corbyn’s presence on the ballot paper helps Burnham, because it stops him being perceived as the leftwinger in the race. In his perceptive book on Labour under Ed Miliband, Five Year Mission, Tim Bale says that in 2010 David Miliband did not realise until far too late how much having Diane Abbott on the ballot helped his brother. David Miliband’s team clearly recognised the obvious threat his brother’s positioning posed to their man, even if none of them realised till far too late that their champion’s politically correct gesture to “lend” some of his supporters to Diane Abbott in order to ensure she got nominated was an act of unthinking idiocy that made it much, much easier for Ed than it should have been to avoid being branded the stand-out leftwinger in the contest. 3 - Corbyn benefits - obviously - and the left too. Sometime the obvious answers are the right ones. Who benefits from Corbyn being on the ballot? Well, Corbyn. To be fair, he is not an enthusiastic campaigner - he only agreed to stand after being encouraged to do so by activists - and he said this morning he did not even think the leadership contest should be taking place now. (See 11.39am.) But, now he is on the ballot, he may do surprisingly well. (He came top in a LabourList readers’ survey a few days ago.) You would still be unwise to put money on him winning, even at Paddy Power’s 50/1. But a reasonably strong showing by Corbyn could make it harder for the new leader to marginalise the left. On that basis, you could argue that there is a fourth answer to the “who benefits?” question. 4 - The Tories - because having Corbyn on the ballot will keep Labour anchored to the left. It is probably too soon to assert this as a definite consequence. But on Twitter some Tories are already crossing their fingers. This is from Lord Ashcroft.

Because if we try and build a coalition of Labour, traditional Labour and disgruntled Liberals next time round, it will end the same way as it has done in May.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>He said that <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/jim-murphys-parting-plan-pledges-5876974\">the reforms he introduced to Scottish Labour (principally, a one member one vote system for leadership elections</a>) would end the “boss politics” that gave union leaders too much power.</strong><br /></li> \n</ul> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>As I left the leadership of the Labour party in Scotland, I wanted to make sure that we modernised the party and bring an end to the boss politics of the trade union leaderships who behaved, in the past, as though they owned the membership’s vote. </p> \n</blockquote> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>He said Labour suffered a “catastrophic defeat” in England and Scotland, and now needed a fundamental rethink.</strong> He said Labour lost two and a half elections.

The 4 theories","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-15T11:59:53Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T12:06:55Z","body":"<p>No one expects Jeremy Corbyn to win the Labour leadership contest. (Paddy Power have him as the 50/1 outsider in odds they have released today.) But the fact that he is in the contest will make a difference to the way it is conducted.</p> \n<p>And who will benefit? There are at least four theories, two of which are very plausible, one of which is less credible, and one of which is more tentative.</p> \n<p>Let’s start with the iffy one.</p> \n<p><strong>1 - Yvette Cooper or Liz Kendall benefit - because Corbyn splits the leftwing vote.</strong></p> \n<p>A version of this theory was floated <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/6490676/Worried-Labour-MPs-plot-to-halt-Andy-Burnham.html\">in the Sun on Sunday just over a week ago</a>, when it claimed that Blairites were helping Corbyn get on the ballot to handicap Andy Burnham (the current favourite) by splitting the leftwing vote. But this scenario does not really stack up, for various reasons. First, the Labour party uses a preferential voting system, and the votes of the candidates who comes last get redistributed. So, if Corbyn were to come last in the first round, and most of his supporters were to choose Burnham as the next-best choice for leftwingers, Burnham would not lose out anyway. Second, it may well be Kendall who comes last in the first ballot. And, third, although Burnham is seen in some quarters as more “leftwing” than Cooper, this is highly questionable.</p> \n<p><strong>2 - Andy Burnham benefits - because he is no longer seen as the leftwinger.</strong></p> \n<p>Burnham and Cooper are broadly similar in their politics, and the leftwing/centrist labels applied to them are not particularly helpful. But many people still currently perceive the contest through this prism, and Cooper has actively tried to portray herself as the centrist candidate, with Burnham on the left and Kendall on the right. In the light of that, Corbyn’s presence on the ballot paper helps Burnham, because it stops him being perceived as the leftwinger in the race. In his perceptive book on Labour under Ed Miliband,<a href=\"http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198702962.do\"> Five Year Mission</a>, <strong>Tim Bale </strong>says that in 2010 David Miliband did not realise until far too late how much having Diane Abbott on the ballot helped his brother.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>David Miliband’s team clearly recognised the obvious threat his brother’s positioning posed to their man, even if none of them realised till far too late that their champion’s politically correct gesture to “lend” some of his supporters to Diane Abbott in order to ensure she got nominated was an act of unthinking idiocy that made it much, much easier for Ed than it should have been to avoid being branded the stand-out leftwinger in the contest.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>3 - Corbyn benefits - obviously - and the left too. </strong></p> \n<p>Sometime the obvious answers are the right ones. Who benefits from Corbyn being on the ballot? Well, Corbyn. To be fair, he is not an enthusiastic campaigner - <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/04/labour-mp-jeremy-corbyn-leadership-anti-austerity-platform\">he only agreed to stand after being encouraged to do so by activists</a> - and he said this morning he did not even think the leadership contest should be taking place now. (See <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/blog/live/2015/jun/15/labour-leadership-nominations-close-at-noon-politics-live#block-557ea789e4b07c61f71d1eca\">11.39am.)</a> But, now he is on the ballot, he may do surprisingly well. <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2015/06/jeremy-corbyn-emerges-as-the-winner-in-labourlist-leadership-survey/\">(He came top in a LabourList readers’ survey a few days ago.) </a>You would still be unwise to put money on him winning, even at Paddy Power’s 50/1. But a reasonably strong showing by Corbyn could make it harder for the new leader to marginalise the left. </p> \n<p>On that basis, you could argue that there is a fourth answer to the “who benefits?” question.</p> \n<p><strong>4 - The Tories - because having Corbyn on the ballot will keep Labour anchored to the left.</strong></p> \n<p>It is probably too soon to assert this as a definite consequence.

It is our duty to safeguard the legacy, the idea, the momentous achievement of those barons. And there couldn’t be a better time to reaffirm that commitment than an anniversary like this.”<br /></p> \n<p>It took the Americans to erect the first memorial of stone pillars on the spot where King John was forced to acquiesce to the demands of his rebellious barons. Installed in 1957 by the American Bar Association and re-dedicated on Monday, the stone honours a document that travelled across the Atlantic with the Pilgrim Fathers and became the inspiration for the US constitution.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>[Magna Carta's] remaining copies may be faded but its principles shine brighter than ever</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>David Cameron</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The US attorney general, Loretta Lynch, joined the ABA president, William Hubbard, for the rededication. Lynch, fresh from her with battles with Fifa, told those gathered: “While the hands that wrote Magna Carta have long been stilled, the principles they carved out of the struggles of their day and the struggles of the human condition live on.”<br /></p> \n<p>That it had taken Americans to first honour Runnymede was understandable, said Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was among the guests. “Americans understand our history much better than we do ourselves because they see it from afar and see how important it is, while we’ve grown comfortable with it. It takes the outsider to see that this is really remarkable.”<br /></p> \n<p> Magna Carta was hugely important, he added. “The historians and the judges who say, ‘Oh Magna Carta, its not really a serious document and all it does is stop you from putting in weirs to catch eels’, I think they are wrong because they don’t see the bigger picture of how important it’s become in our national legend.”<br /></p> \n<p>Joining the ABA memorial was a new public artwork – 12 burnished bronze chairs by sculptor Hew Locke, entitled The Jurors – which was inaugurated by the Duke of Cambridge. “It is inspired by clause 39, giving rights to trial by jury,” Locke said of the work, which references Nelson Mandela, Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai’s fight for education, the gay rights campaigner Harvey Milk, and a boat carrying refugees among its global and historic themes.<br /></p> \n<p>Another addition of note is a four-metre bronze statue of the Queen in full garter attire, which was gifted by the company Magna Carta Legacy Ltd and unveiled on Sunday despite public objections that called the piece “utterly bizarre and ridiculous”.<br /></p> \n<p>Magna Carta – 3,500 words on calfskin parchment, first drafted by the archbishop of Canterbury – was extracted from King John, known as John Lackland after losing Normandy and Anjou to the French, at sword point by his frustrated noblemen, who captured London and held him to ransom. All involved on that historic day would be astonished to think of its resonance since. Indeed John never wanted it published and it was annulled by Pope Innocent III nine weeks later. The pontiff ruled the king had been forced to seal it under duress.<br /></p> \n<p>It was redrafted in 1216, 1217, and 1225, and confirmed in English law in 1297 – 81 years after John’s death rumoured from dysentery or a surfeit of peaches. Either way, it was an unfortunate end for a king described as “brimful of evil qualities” by one contemporary writer and whom history condemns as a cruel and lecherous tyrant.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0e19f9fd2dffb246cfd17d0bf2ca6faba73d7bf9\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0e19f9fd2dffb246cfd17d0bf2ca6faba73d7bf9/216_0_2469_1482/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, British prime minister David Cameron, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip and Prince William at the ceremony.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, British prime minister David Cameron, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip and Prince William at the ceremony.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most parts of Magna Carta have since been repealed, and it was originally an English document relevant only to rich, free, land-owning males.

Smith in Athens","body":"<p>Fears that Greece is close to defaulting on its debt swept European trading floors on Monday morning after talks between Athens and its creditors collapsed on Sunday.</p> \n<p>The Greek stock market slumped by almost 7% in early trading, as traders showed alarm that a deal will not be reached before the country’s bailout programme expires on 30 June. </p> \n<p>Despite growing pressure, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, is refusing to accept new spending cuts and tax rises to achieve the budget surpluses demanded by Greece’s lenders.</p> \n<p>“One can only see a political purposefulness in the insistence of creditors on new cuts in pensions after five years of looting under the bailouts,” Tsipras told Greek newspaper Efimerida Ton Syntakton on Monday morning.</p> \n<p>“We will wait patiently until the institutions accede to realism,” he said. “We do not have the right to bury European democracy at the place where it was born.”</p> \n<p>The war of words between the two sides continued, with Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany’s Bundesbank, saying time was running out for Greece.</p> \n<p>Greek financial shares were routed on Monday morning, with Piraeus Bank tumbling by 18% and Eurobanks down 15%, dragging the Athens market to its lowest point since mid-April.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\"

2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Analysts warned that the collapse of negotiations on Sunday, after just 45 minutes, has pushed Greece closer to default and a potential exit from the single currency.<br /></p> \n<p>“Even if the parties involved do reach a deal in the near future it will likely be a short-term one only,” said Gary Jenkins of LNG Capital. “Indeed the lack of trust suggests that funds will be drip-fed to Greece and that a longer-term agreement will be very difficult to reach.”</p> \n<p>According to local media Tsipras has called an emergency meeting with top ministers to discuss the situation, including chief negotiator Euclid Tsakalotos, the deputy prime minister, Yannis Dragasakis, and the state minister, Nikos Pappas.</p> \n<p>Talks are now in limbo until Thursday, when eurozone finance ministers meet for their scheduled Eurogroup meeting.<br /></p> \n<p>That is probably the last chance for Greece to negotiate a deal to unlock the €7.2bn (&pound;5.2bn) of bailout funds that have been frozen for months, says Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at online bank Swissquote.</p> \n<p>“We expect markets will feel the heat this week as the odds of a Greek default have increased considerably,” Rosenstreich added.</p> \n<p>All the main European markets fell on Monday morning, with Germany’s DAX index down 1.1%. In London, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares was down 37 points or 0.5% at 6746.</p> \n<h2>How the talks collapsed</h2> \n<p>On Sunday night, the European commission warned that: “While some progress was made, the talks did not succeed as there remains a significant gap between the plans of the Greek authorities and the joint requirements of the commission, European Central Bank and IMF.”</p> \n<p>In fiscal terms, the differences amounted to €2bn a year in permanent budget savings.<br /></p> \n<p>The gulf between the sides prompted a call from the IMF’s chief economist for both sides to compromise further. Olivier Blanchard said Brussels should be prepared to delay more of Greece’s debt repayments, accept only limited reforms and cut the interest applied to debt-relief loans, while Tsipras should offer further pension reforms and accept that some VAT exemptions must be dropped.<br /></p> \n<p>“On the one hand, the Greek government has to offer truly credible measures to reach the lower target budget surplus and it has to show its commitment to the more limited set of reforms,” Blanchard wrote in his economic blog. “On the other hand, the European creditors would have to agree to significant additional financing and to debt relief sufficient to maintain debt sustainability.”</p> \n<p>The intervention by Blanchard late on Sunday will be widely seen as supportive of the Greek position, though with the sting for Athens in his call for pension reform, which Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, repeated on Saturday was a dealbreaker.</p> \n<p>With the future of Greece in the eurozone on the line as never before – and time now of the essence if Athens is to honour a €1.6bn debt repayment to the IMF on 30 June – the magnitude of the moment was not lost on Greek officials or the prime minister’s radical-left Syriza party.</p> \n<p>Dragasakis, who flew to Brussels to head talks, said Athens remained ready to conclude negotiations “with a mutually beneficial agreement”, suggesting there was still room for compromise.</p> \n<p>Blaming foreign lenders for the breakdown in talks, he said the Greek government had submitted complementary proposals that “fully cover” the fiscal gap and the primary surplus – the two major sticking points between the two sides. </p> \n<p>Creditors, he said, had insisted on pension cuts and increases in VAT both worth 1% of GDP – or €3.6bn – to close the projected gap, measures that Athens regards as untenable for a population already pauperised by five years of biting austerity. It was the second economic reform package to be proposed by the Greek government and rejected by creditors in June.</p> \n<p>“Despite the presence of the Greek delegation in Brussels, there was no response on the part of the institutions [European commission, ECB and IMF] for discussions at the same [political] level or authorisations that would permit a solution to the issues that remain open,” Dragasakis said in a statement.</p> \n<p>Tsakalotos said it was clear “the opposite side did not have a mandate to negotiate”. He told the Guardian in a text message: “We made huge efforts to meet them halfway but they insisted on both pension cuts and the increase in VAT on restaurants and would not accept closing the gap even partially via administrative measures to reduce tax evasion, even though this was a central plank of our electoral programme. Moreover, they told us bluntly they had no mandate to discuss a compromise! So much for negotiating.”</p> \n<p>With developments taking such a dramatic turn, opposition parties urged Prokopis Pavlopoulos, the head of state, to call an emergency meeting of political leaders. “The country has to remain intact within <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> and this has to be understood by everyone,” said the centrist party, To Potami. “We await a responsible reaction from the political leadership of the country.”</p> \n<p>Failure to keep Greece in the euro, after years of arduous negotiations and two emergency bailouts totalling €240bn, would send it lurching into the unknown and mark a historic blow to the EU’s most ambitious project.</p> \n<p>Greek officials flew to Brussels after Tsipras signalled he would soften his stance and accept painful compromises in return for promises to alleviate the country’s staggering debt.</p> \n<p>Government sources had indicated that Athens was “very close” to sealing a deal that would release more than €7bn in bailout funds the country now desperately needs to avoid defaulting on loans to the IMF and ECB over the summer. Creditors have refused to disburse financial assistance since August as both sides have wrangled over reforms.</p> \n<p>A gesture on the ever-contentious issue of Greek debt would also allow Tsipras to sell a deal to hardliners in Syriza, which was catapulted into power in January on a pledge to end five gruelling years of “self-defeating” austerity, and to Greeks at large. </p> \n<p>At more than €320bn, the equivalent of 180% of the country’s entire economic output, Greece has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio in the EU with economists far and wide agreeing it is unsustainable. Following the breakdown in talks, leftwing militants implored the government not to concede on any measures that would entail “the extinction of the Greek people”.</p> \n<p>Fears now abound that Greece could be heading for a Cyprus-style denouement with the ECB pulling the plug on the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) it has been drip-feeding Greek banks. The Frankfurt-based institution has come under growing pressure to make such a move in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>Indicative of the growing tensions between Athens and Berlin, the biggest contributor of Greece’s bailout programme to date, Sigmar Gabriel, Germany’s vice-chancellor and head of the country’s Social Democratic party – who has long been seen as a friend of Greece – criticised the Greek government’s negotiating tactics in an article for Monday’s daily Bild newspaper.</p> \n<p>“The game theorists of the Greek government are in the process of gambling away the future of their country,” he wrote in an excoriating critique of Varoufakis, whose academic expertise includes game theory. “Europe and Germany will not let themselves be blackmailed. And we will not let the exaggerated electoral pledges of a partly communist government be paid for by German workers and their families.”</p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434360082572/645316b7-ca88-4013-b37d-91dbb6fc0f61-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters","altText":"Greek national flags and a European Union flag ion sale in central Athens over the weekend as bailout talks collapse.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434356986033/d2b14144-4c66-4461-a764-850a5279e7b2-620x270.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":270,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Athens stock market over the last three months.

Anderson was highly critical of the existing system of oversight of the surveillance agencies and set out a series of recommendations for reform.<br /></p> \n<p>A new surveillance bill, scheduled for the autumn, is expected to be the subject of fierce debate.<br /></p> \n<p>Responding to the Sunday Times, David Davis, the Conservative MP who is one of the leading campaigners for privacy, said: “We have to treat all of these things with a pinch of salt.” He said the use of an anonymous source to create scare stories was a typical tactic and the timing was comfortable for the government.<br /></p> \n<p>“You can see they have been made nervous by Anderson. We have not been given any facts, just assertions,” he said.<br /></p> \n<p>Anderson recommended that approval of surveillance warrants be shifted from the home and foreign secretaries to a new judicial body made up of serving and retired judges, which Davis supports but towards which the government appears to be lukewarm.<br /></p> \n<p>Davis said there was little point in raising the Sunday Times allegations in the Commons as the government would say it does not comment on intelligence matters. Davis’s prediction was prescient. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “We don’t comment on leaks.” The intelligence agencies said: “Our longstanding policy is not to comment on intelligence matters.”</p> \n<p>But Eric King, the deputy director of Privacy International, echoed Davis, saying: “Looking at the Sunday Times, it asks more questions than it answers.” He added that if Downing Street and the Home Office believed that Russia and China had gained access to the Snowden documents, then why was the government not putting this out through official channels.<br /></p> \n<p>He added: “Given Snowden is facing espionage charges in the US, you would have thought the British government would have provided them with this information.”<br /></p> \n<p>Snowden, a former NSA contractor, handed over tens of thousands of leaked documents to the Guardian in Hong Kong two years ago. He left Hong Kong with flights booked to Latin America but was stopped in Russia when the US revoked his passport, and has been living in Moscow in exile since.<br /></p> \n<p>He has repeatedly said he handed over all the documents to journalists in Hong Kong and no longer has access to them, making it impossible for either China or Russia to get to them through him. The Sunday Times and BBC do not say where China or Russia allegedly gained access to the files.<br /></p> \n<p>Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said: “Last week, David Anderson’s thoughtful report called for urgent reform of snooping laws. That would not have been possible without Snowden’s revelations. Days later, an ‘unnamed Home Office source’ is accusing him of having blood on his hands. The timing of this exclusive story from the securocrats seems extremely convenient.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/14/snoopers-charter-anderson-report-home-office\">There is no real case for a snooper’s charter – but that won’t stop it | Tim Colbourne</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Andrew Mitchell, a former cabinet minister, said he was sure the Sunday Times got story because of the Anderson report. He added: “I think we have to be very careful of the argument ‘listen sonny, we know what you don’t know and therefore you should do what we say’. That is not a good argument; we need to have a proper debate about all of this.” </p> \n<p>“I don’t approve of what Snowden did, but I have to say having been to Washington recently that there has been a massive change of view in the United States, not just people like Rand Paul and so on, there’s a massive change of view about the debate and that has resulted from Snowden, whether you like it or not.”</p> \n<p>The White House said it had no comment on the UK government claims.</p> \n<p>Since the initial revelations about the extent of the bulk collection of communications data and the relationship between the intelligence agencies and internet companies, the US and British governments – and their intelligence agencies – have made a series of assertions that have subsequently been retracted.<br /></p> \n<p>Snowden was initially said to be a Chinese or Russian spy, but the US has since said this is not true. The US has also backtracked on claims that surveillance helped stop 56 plots and that Snowden had “blood on his hands”. <br /></p> \n<p>The British government and intelligence agencies in both countries issued warnings as far back as at least 18 months ago that the Snowden disclosures had helped terrorists, costing GCHQ, the UK’s main surveillance agency, up to 30% of its capabilities and that agents had had to be moved.<br /></p> \n<p>But privacy campaigners countered that no evidence had ever been provided to back up these assertions and that Snowden had done a public service by revealing the extent of illegal mass surveillance.<br /></p> \n<p>The allegations being made 18 months ago have now resurfaced in the Sunday Times. The paper quoted a source saying: “Agents have had to be moved and that knowledge of how we operate has stopped us getting vital information.” The source said they had no evidence that anyone had been harmed.</p> \n<p>A “senior Home Office source” was also quoted by the newspaper, saying: “Putin didn’t give him asylum for nothing. His documents were encrypted but they weren’t completely secure and we have now seen our agents and assets being targeted.”<br /></p> \n<p>The Sunday Times also quoted a “British intelligence source” saying that Russian and Chinese officials would be examining Snowden’s material for “years to come”.</p> \n<p>“Snowden has done incalculable damage,” the intelligence source reportedly said. “In some cases the agencies have been forced to intervene and lift their agents from operations to prevent them from being identified and killed.”</p> \n<p><br /></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p></p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434240101610/e56fb8f5-2d87-4a23-8704-068fcf060b6b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Itar-Tass/Barcroft Media/Itar-Tass/Barcroft Media","altText":"Edward Snowden takes part in an online Q&A session from Moscow last year.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Itar-Tass/Barcroft Media/Itar-Tass/Barcroft Media"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-14T15:58:27Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T10:18:45Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ewen MacAskill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ewenmacaskill"},{"name":"Patrick Wintour","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/4/1423058528318/Patrick-Wintour-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patrickwintour"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Edward Snowden","Surveillance","US news","World news","Russia","China","Espionage","Encryption","MI6","NSA","The NSA files","Politics","UK security and counter-terrorism","Europe","Technology"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/edward-snowden","webTitle":"Edward Snowden"},{"id":"world/surveillance","webTitle":"Surveillance"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/russia","webTitle":"Russia"},{"id":"world/china","webTitle":"China"},{"id":"world/espionage","webTitle":"Espionage"},{"id":"technology/encryption","webTitle":"Encryption"},{"id":"uk/mi6","webTitle":"MI6"},{"id":"us-news/nsa","webTitle":"NSA"},{"id":"us-news/the-nsa-files","webTitle":"The NSA files"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uksecurity","webTitle":"UK security and counter-terrorism"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"}],"section":{"id":"us-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"us-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/14/russia-and-china-broke-into-snowden-files-to-identify-british-and-us-spies","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49n8j","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/us-news/2015/jun/14/russia-and-china-broke-into-snowden-files-to-identify-british-and-us-spies","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/14/russia-and-china-broke-into-snowden-files-to-identify-british-and-us-spies"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434240101610/e56fb8f5-2d87-4a23-8704-068fcf060b6b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Edward Snowden taking part in an online Q&amp;A session from Moscow last year.

The BBC said it had also also been briefed anonymously by a senior government official.</p> \n<p>Anonymous sources are an unavoidable part of reporting, but neither Downing Street nor the Home Office should be allowed to hide behind anonymity in this case. <br /></p> \n<h2><strong>1. Is it true that Russia and China have gained access to Snowden’s top-secret documents? If so, where is the evidence?</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>Which cache of documents is the UK government talking about? Snowden has said he handed tens of thousands of leaked documents over to journalists he met in Hong Kong, and that he has not had them in his possession since. Have Russia and China managed to access documents held by one of the journalists or their companies?</p> \n<p>In addition, if agents had to be moved, why? Which Snowden documents allegedly compromised them to the extent they had to be forcibly removed from post?<br /></p> \n<h2><strong>2. Why have the White House and the US intelligence agencies not raised this?</strong></h2> \n<p>Snowden is wanted by the US on charges under the Espionage Act. The White House, the US intelligence agencies and especially some members of Congress have been desperate to blacken Snowden’s reputation. They have gone through his personal life and failed to come up with a single damaging detail.<br /></p> \n<p>If the UK were to have evidence that Russia and China had managed to penetrate his document cache or that agents had been forced to move, London would have shared this with Washington. The White House would have happily briefed this openly, as would any number of Republican – and even Democratic – members of Congress close to the security services. They would not have stinted. It would have been a full-blown press conference.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/14/russia-and-china-broke-into-snowden-files-to-identify-british-and-us-spies\">UK under pressure to respond to latest Edward Snowden claims</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The debate in the US has become more grownup in recent months, with fewer scare stories and more interest in introducing reforms that will redress the balance between security and privacy, but there are still many in Congress and the intelligence agencies seeking vengeance.<br /></p> \n<h2><strong>3. Why have these claims emerged now?</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>Most the allegations have been made before in some form, only to fall apart when scrutinised. These include that Snowden was a Chinese spy and, when he ended up in Moscow, that he was a Russian spy or was at least cooperating with them. The US claimed 56 plots had been disrupted as a result of surveillance, but under pressure acknowledged this was untrue. </p> \n<p>The claim about agents being moved was first made in the UK 18 months ago, along with allegations that Snowden had helped terrorists evade surveillance and, as a result, had blood on his hands. Both the US and UK have since acknowledged no one has been harmed.<br /></p> \n<p>So why now? One explanation is that it is partly in response to Thursday’s publication of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/11/anderson-report-tests-surveillance-laws-judicial-warrant-analysis\">David Anderson’s 373-page report on surveillance</a>. David Cameron asked the QC to conduct an independent review and there is much in it for the government and intelligence services to like, primarily about retaining bulk data. </p> \n<p>Anderson is scathing, however, about the existing legal framework for surveillance, describing it as intolerable and undemocratic, and he has proposed that the authority to approve surveillance warrants be transferred from the foreign and home secretaries to the judiciary.<br /></p> \n<p>His proposal, along with another surveillance report out next month from the Royal United Services Institute, mean that there will be continued debate in the UK. There are also European court rulings pending. Web users’ increasing use of encryption is another live issue. Above all else though, there is the backlash by internet giants such as Google, which appear to be less prepared to cooperate with the intelligence agencies, at least not those in the UK.<br /></p> \n<p>The issue is not going away and the Sunday Times story may reflect a cack-handed attempt by some within the British security apparatus to try to take control of the narrative.</p> \n<h2><strong>4. Why is the Foreign Office not mentioned as a source?</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>It seems like a pedantic point, but one that could offer an insight into the manoeuvring inside the higher reaches of government. The Foreign Office is repsonsible for MI6, but the Home Office is quoted in the story. Is it that the Home Office and individuals within the department rather than the Foreign Office are most exercised about the potential transfer of surveillance warrant approval from the home secretary, the proposed scrapping of existing legislation covering surveillance and other potential reforms?<br /></p> \n<h2><strong>5. What about the debatable assertions and at least one totally inaccurate point in the Sunday Times piece?</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>The Sunday Times says Snowden “fled to seek protection from Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, after mounting one of the largest leaks in US history”. In fact he fled Hong Kong bound for Latin America, via Moscow and Cuba. The US revoked his passport, providing Russia with an excuse to hold him in transit.<br /></p> \n<p>The Sunday Times says it is not clear whether Russia and China stole Snowden’s data or “whether he voluntarily handed over his secret documents in order to remain at liberty in Hong Kong and Moscow”. The latter is not possible if, as Snowden says, he gave all the documents to journalists in Hong Kong in June 2013.<br /></p> \n<p>The Sunday Times also reports that “David Miranda, the boyfriend of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/nov/02/david-miranda-detained-political-causes\">seized at Heathrow in 2013</a> in possession of 58,000 ‘highly-classified’ intelligence documents after visiting Snowden in Moscow”.<br /></p> \n<p>This is inaccurate. Miranda had in fact been in Berlin seeing the film-maker Laura Poitras, not in Moscow visiting Snowden. It is not a small point.<br /></p> \n<p>The claim about Miranda having been in Moscow <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2768841/An-intelligence-expert-s-devastating-verdict-Leaks-Edward-Snowden-Guardian-British-hostages-greater-peril.html\">first appeared in the Daily Mail in September</a> under the headline “An intelligence expert’s devastating verdict: Leaks by Edward Snowden and the Guardian have put British hostages in even greater peril”. It was written by Professor Anthony Glees, the director of the centre for security and intelligence studies at the University of Buckingham, and has never been corrected. Maybe the Sunday Times can do better.</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f282058d7dd57425413c166023975b341a4e77a8/0_84_3000_1801/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1801,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Xinhua /Landov / Barcroft Media/Xinhua /Landov / Barcroft Media","altText":"Edward Snowden","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Xinhua /Landov / Barcroft Media/Xinhua /Landov / Barcroft Media"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-14T15:37:59Z","lastModified":"2015-06-14T23:15:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ewen MacAskill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ewenmacaskill"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Edward Snowden","Surveillance","MI6","Russia","China","UK security and counter-terrorism","UK news","World news","US news"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/edward-snowden","webTitle":"Edward Snowden"},{"id":"world/surveillance","webTitle":"Surveillance"},{"id":"uk/mi6","webTitle":"MI6"},{"id":"world/russia","webTitle":"Russia"},{"id":"world/china","webTitle":"China"},{"id":"uk/uksecurity","webTitle":"UK security and counter-terrorism"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"}],"section":{"id":"us-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ewen MacAskill","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ewenmacaskill"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"us-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#005689","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#005689","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#63717a","colourPalette":"analysis"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/14/snowden-files-read-by-russia-and-china-five-questions-for-uk-government","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ncz","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/us-news/2015/jun/14/snowden-files-read-by-russia-and-china-five-questions-for-uk-government","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/14/snowden-files-read-by-russia-and-china-five-questions-for-uk-government"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f282058d7dd57425413c166023975b341a4e77a8/0_84_3000_1801/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1801,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Edward Snowden is seen on the display of a camera during a live remote interview at CeBIT 2015.
