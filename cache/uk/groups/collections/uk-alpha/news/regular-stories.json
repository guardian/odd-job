The prime minister has agreed that the parliamentary bill paving the way for the referendum will be amended to exclude the date of 5 May 2016 for the poll, as he seeks to avoid his first parliamentary defeat since the election.</p> \n<p>A government source said: “We’ve listened to the views expressed from MPs across the House and agreed that we won’t hold the referendum on the same day as legislature elections.”</p> \n<p>The decision, which marks something of a personal U-turn for the prime minister, comes as ministers prepare to offer reassurances to Eurosceptic Tory MPs who fear a burst of government spending is planned in favour of a pro-EU vote. Ministers are prepared to make clear in the referendum bill that glossy publications paid from public funds will not be despatched to households in the final phase of the campaign, known as the “purdah” period.</p> \n<p>The government faces the prospect of a series of defeats on the timing and funding of the EU referendum as Eurosceptic Tories have found common cause with Labour and the SNP over the parliamentary bill.</p> \n<p>The decision to rule out 5 May 2016 also avoids a conflict with the Electoral Commission, which had said the poll should not be held on the same day as a series of devolved elections across the UK. The prime minister had dismissed these concerns last week when he told MPs: “It was possible to have the AV referendum and other elections on the same day. I think people are capable of making two decisions.”</p> \n<p>Government sources said they were still standing by their fundamental principle on the timing of the referendum: that it would be determined by the pace of the prime minister’s renegotiation of Britain’s EU membership terms. This means that if the negotiations conclude by next spring, the prime minister will simply delay the referendum to June or July next year.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/14/brexit-what-would-happen-if-britain-left-eu-european-union-referendum-uk\">Brexit – what would happen if Britain left the EU?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The government is prepared to reach out to Eurosceptics on another front by giving undertakings, possibly by amending the referendum bill, to guarantee a commitment made by Philip Hammond. The foreign secretary said last week that public funds would not be used to send out pro-EU leaflets in the final phase of the campaign. This is known as the 28-day “purdah” period.<br />Some Whitehall sources suggested that a vote on a rebel amendment could be avoided if the government signalled that it was prepared to amend the legislation to set Hammond’s commitment in stone. Labour will table an amendment calling on the government to specify in which areas public funds would be spent in the final phase of the campaign. Parliament would then have to authorise these items.<br />But ministers are adamant that they will seek to relax the purdah rules to allow the government machinery to play a role in the final phase of the campaign. Downing Street believes that section 125 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act of 2000, governing the purdah rules, are unworkable for two reasons.<br />In the first place, ministers say the government needs to be able to carry on its normal business. There are fears that a failure to amend the 2000 act would mean that ministers could be severely restrained from speaking at EU meetings or responding to judgments from the European court of justice during the purdah period. There is a suggestion that civil service press officers would be barred from distributing remarks by the prime minister at EU summits.<br />In the second place, the government is clear that it will not be neutral during the referendum campaign. The prime minister hopes to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s EU membership and then to campaign for a yes vote to stay in the EU.<br />Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, who is the SNP’s foreign affairs spokesman at Westminster, said of the U-turn on the referendum date: “The government faced retreat or defeat on this issue. It was clear that the Tories were angling to hijack Scottish elections with the EU referendum, and the united opposition have blown them off course.</p> \n<p>“This is very much the shape of things to come, and has hopefully taught this arrogant Tory government to cease their disrespect towards the nations of Scotland and Wales and the people of Northern Ireland. There will be more Tory retreats and defeats before this bill is through.”</p> \n<p></p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d92c9cf7c72cd1afc9a13500f7dbc09c9796680d/0_106_3500_2099/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2099,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Toby Melville/Reuters","altText":"Union flag and EU flag","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T19:33:31Z","lastModified":"2015-06-16T05:39:32Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":425,"contributors":[{"name":"Nicholas Watt","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nicholaswatt"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["EU referendum","Conservatives","David Cameron","Scotland","European Union","Europe","Foreign policy","Politics","UK news","World news","AV referendum","Alternative vote","Electoral reform","Proportional representation"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/eu-referendum","webTitle":"EU referendum"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"politics/foreignpolicy","webTitle":"Foreign policy"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"politics/av-referendum","webTitle":"AV referendum"},{"id":"politics/av","webTitle":"Alternative vote"},{"id":"politics/electoralreform","webTitle":"Electoral reform"},{"id":"politics/pr","webTitle":"Proportional representation"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Nicholas Watt","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/nicholaswatt"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/15/no-10-will-pledge-no-eu-referendum-spending-if-it-averts-eurosceptic-revolt","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49zdn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jun/15/no-10-will-pledge-no-eu-referendum-spending-if-it-averts-eurosceptic-revolt","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/15/no-10-will-pledge-no-eu-referendum-spending-if-it-averts-eurosceptic-revolt"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d92c9cf7c72cd1afc9a13500f7dbc09c9796680d/0_106_3500_2099/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2099,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Philip Hammond, the foreign secretary, said public funds would not be used to send out pro-EU leaflets before a referendum.

Chi Onwurah, who worked for 20 years in a male-dominated sector as a chartered electrical engineer, said the mayor of London may be in breach of discrimination laws by defending comments made by Professor Tim Hunt. </p> \n<p> In a newspaper column, Johnson said it is a scientific fact that women cry more readily than men, and maintained that it should not be an offence to point out a “gender difference”. Hunt, a Nobel laureate and senior scientific adviser, was forced to stand down last week after claiming that women colleagues cry when criticised. </p> \n<p> Onwurah, who was head of technology at Ofcom before becoming an MP, said that while it was reasonable to argue that Hunt had been treated unfairly, Johnson’s comments were irresponsible because he sought to excuse views that are unacceptable in the workplace. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/jun/13/tim-hunt-hung-out-to-dry-interview-mary-collins\">Tim Hunt: ‘I’ve been hung out to dry. They haven’t even bothered to ask for my side of affairs’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> “As the mayor of London, he is effectively managing many women. If Boris is treating women differently from men by not giving them honest feedback on their performance because they might burst into tears, he is certainly failing in his duty of care and could be in breach of the sex discrimination act. </p> \n<p> “I think women employees could rightly argue that they have not had proper feedback from Johnson because of his views on women and their propensity to weep in the workplace. It could have prevented women from being promoted. </p> \n<p> “I have found in my career in industry that constructive criticism can really improve opportunities at work. Johnson could be holding women back by not giving them honest feedback,” she said. </p> \n<p> Hunt resigned from both the Royal Society and University College London after his remarks sparked a backlash online. The renowned scientist reportedly described himself as a “chauvinist pig” at the World Conference of Science Journalists in Seoul and argued in favour of single-sex laboratories.</p> \n<p> He said: “Let me tell you about my trouble with girls. Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you, and when you criticise them they cry.” Hours later, he attempted to justify his words in comments to Radio 4’s Today Programme.</p> \n<p> The scientist told the Observer that he had been “hung out to dry” over comments that he insisted were meant to be humorous and for which he later apologised.</p> \n<p> Johnson said the comments were made during a “light-hearted, off-the-cuff speech”. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said: “Sir Tim Hunt was doing what he had done all his life – pointing out a natural phenomenon he had observed. He did not deserve to be pilloried, and should be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/jun/15/scientist-tim-hunt-should-be-reinstated-after-girls-row-says-boris-johnson\">reinstated forthwith</a> to his academic positions.”</p> \n<p> The Conservative politician likened the reaction to Hunt’s comments to what he described as “mumbo jumbo” claims by a Malaysian minister that the actions of tourists, including Briton <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/14/backpacker-eleanor-hawkins-stripped-malaysian-mountain-back-in-uk\">Eleanor Hawkins</a>, who stripped on a mountain considered to be sacred, had caused an earthquake. He wrote: “I am afraid that we in 21st-century Britain are in no position to snigger at the tribes and their fit of irrational indignation. We have our own mystery gods these days.”</p> \n<p> Onwurah criticised the way that UCL reportedly forced Hunt to leave his job without a formal explanation, but said he should no longer be put in charge of women employees. “I don’t think he [Hunt] should have been dismissed from his job without being given some performance feedback. But I don’t think he should be in a position to manage women with those views,” she said.</p> \n<p> Onwurah has worked in hardware and software development, production management and strategy for private sector firms in the UK, France, the US and Nigeria. Before becoming an MP in 2010, she was head of telecoms technology at the industry regulator Ofcom. </p> \n<p> A spokesman for Johnson did not reply to a request for a comment.</p> \n<p>Nicky Morgan, the equalities minister, told the Fortune Most Powerful Women International Summit in London on Monday: “We have been reminded of how far we still have to go with men. Just in the last week we have been reminded how far we still have to go in one field: science. I think someone who starts off remarks with ‘I’m a chauvinist should remember the old adage: ‘If you can’t say something nice don’t say anything at all.’”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434415492715/85471741-8421-4da8-b7c4-0a6b534d9a8e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Keith Larby/Demotix/Corbis","altText":"Boris Johnson","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Keith Larby/Demotix/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T05:00:09Z","lastModified":"2015-06-16T06:00:24Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":597,"contributors":[{"name":"Rajeev Syal","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rajeev-syal"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Boris Johnson","Tim Hunt","Women","Gender","Labour","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/boris","webTitle":"Boris Johnson"},{"id":"uk-news/tim-hunt","webTitle":"Tim Hunt"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"world/gender","webTitle":"Gender"},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rajeev Syal","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rajeev-syal"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/16/boris-johnson-criticised-over-women-crying-remarks","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49zde","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jun/16/boris-johnson-criticised-over-women-crying-remarks","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/16/boris-johnson-criticised-over-women-crying-remarks"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434416246465/d3749e62-da03-4f10-899e-cb0fa6ed6b1e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Boris Johnson wrote that it was a scientific fact that women cried more readily than men.

He said he had been instructed by two of the fathers of the nine children, who had become extremely concerned when they could not get in touch with their families.</p> \n<p>“The suspicion and main concern is that the women have taken their children to Syria,” he said. “One of the possibilities is they travelled to Turkey to travel to Syria.” This is understood to be one line of inquiry being pursued by police.</p> \n<p>The fathers are concerned that their children’s lives are in danger, Khan added. “The concern is for the wellbeing and safety of the children. The fathers are distraught; they feel helpless and they don’t know what to do. They want the children out of harm’s way.”</p> \n<p>Khan said he understood that the three sisters had a brother who had already left the UK for Syria, but said he had no further information about him or any group he may have gone to join.</p> \n<p>Police were alerted five or six days ago about the disappearance, Khan said, but officers had been constrained because the family were outside their jurisdiction. Preliminary inquiries suggest 10 members of the family boarded a flight from Medina, Saudi Arabia, to Istanbul, Turkey, on 9 June, lawyers for the family said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/archive-zip/giv-21277eSGDsK96JFeb/\" data-alt=\"Missing Dawood family\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/archive-zip/giv-21277eSGDsK96JFeb/\">Missing Dawood family</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The missing are Khadija Dawood, 30, and her children Maryam Siddiqui, seven, and Muhammad Haseeb, five; Sugra Dawood, 34, and her children Junaid Ahmed Iqbal, 15, Ibrahim Iqbal, 14, Zaynab Iqbal, eight, Mariya Iqbal, five, and Ismaeel Iqbal, three; and Zohra Dawood, 33. They are all believed to have travelled to the Turkish capital.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>However, no details have been found for Zohra Dawood’s children – Haafiyah Binte Zubair, eight, and Nurah Binte Zubair, five – boarding that flight. Their absence from the records may be a computer glitch, Khan said.</p> \n<p>The statement from Khan Solicitors said: “The family of the missing persons are extremely worried and feel helpless.” There has been no contact from any of the family since 9 June, their mobile phones have not been active and their social media profiles, including Facebook and Whatsapp, have not been updated, the statement said. </p> \n<p>Two of the missing women are understood to live in the Thornbury area of Bradford, a few miles east of the city centre. West Yorkshire police are investigating and have contacted the Turkish authorities. </p> \n<p>A spokesman said the force was supporting the family, and officers were “working extensively with authorities overseas to try to locate them”. However, there had been no sightings or contact with the family in Turkey yet. Detectives were at the Khan’s Solicitors office in Bradford city centre on Monday night. Assistant chief constable Russ Foster said: “We are extremely concerned for the safety of the family and would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to us. Our priority is for their safe return, their families are gravely worried about them and want them home. One of our primary concerns is the safety and welfare of the young children.”</p> \n<p>Khan said he and West Yorkshire police would issue a joint statement on Tuesday with more details about the family and the circumstances of their disappearance. </p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434389529522/f903d15a-b14d-4f13-b97d-b6ff87136a92-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Composite","altText":"Missing Dawood family Saudi Arabia","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Composite"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T16:38:54Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T23:07:27Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Jamie Grierson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jamie-grierson"},{"name":"Jessica Elgot","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jessica-elgot"},{"name":"Josh Halliday","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/josh-halliday"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/15/appeal-for-uk-family-of-12-missing-after-saudi-arabia-trip","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49zbt","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jun/15/appeal-for-uk-family-of-12-missing-after-saudi-arabia-trip","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/15/appeal-for-uk-family-of-12-missing-after-saudi-arabia-trip"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434389529522/f903d15a-b14d-4f13-b97d-b6ff87136a92-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The 12 members of the Dawood family who travelled to Saudi Arabia from the UK and did not return as planned.
