The talks were facing their fourth extension in two weeks.<br /></p> \n<p>The deleted tweet on the English-language account under president Hassan Rouhani’s name declared: “#IranDeal is the victory of diplomacy &amp; mutual respect over the outdated paradigm of exclusion &amp; coercion.

European diplomats had confidently predicted a conclusion on Monday evening after 17 straight days of negotiations. US diplomats briefed journalists on the choreography of events to follow the announcement of a deal, but expectations soured over the course of Sunday night and Monday morning. </p> \n<p>Diplomats said it had emerged that some key differences over a new UN security council resolution incorporating the expected agreement, which were thought to have been resolved, were still obstacles to a final agreement. Under that expected settlement, Iran would be subject to restrictions on its nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. <br /></p> \n<p>As the Monday evening target came and went, Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, appeared on the balcony of the hotel venue and faced shouted questions from the journalists in the street below.</p> \n<p>Asked how he was feeling, Zarif replied: “Sleepy and overworked”. On the question of whether there would be a deal overnight, he tilted his head up, a gesture that means “no” in Iran. Asked if there would be a deal on Tuesday, he said: “It is possible.”</p> \n<p>The text of the UN security council resolution is one of the thorniest of the final issues. It will determine whether Iran will remain under an arms embargo and restrictions on its missile programme and would stipulate the conditions in which broader sanctions could “snap back” in the event of non-compliance.</p> \n<p>A commentary on the state of play <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThomasErdbrink/status/620637034693001216\">on Iranian state TV</a> highlighted the stakes saying “even one misplaced comma can change everything”.</p> \n<p>At the Vienna talks, the permanent five members of the UN security council, together with Germany, are negotiating with Zarif’s Iranian delegation. Ali Vaez, an Iran analyst for the International Crisis Group, said both sides were engaging in brinksmanship. </p> \n<p>“This won’t be settled till they all sit down late at night to see who blinks first,” Vaez said. “But that brings the danger of miscalculating.”</p> \n<p>A western diplomat said on Monday evening that there was no plan for a plenary meeting overnight between the six-nation group and Iran, but one could be arranged at short notice. Another diplomat said “a plenary tonight is still not excluded”.<br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/06b50b4584f84d5df3bdbda94463884b85b85ebe/0_68_1305_783/1305.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":783,"width":1305,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Leonhard Foeger/Reuters","altText":"Iranian foreign minister Mohammed Javad Zarif talks to journalists from the balcony of Palais Coburg, the venue for nuclear talks, in Vienna.

The vote, which was promised in the Conservative manifesto, is now almost certain not to pass, as Labour will be whipped to vote against it as well.</p> \n<p>Angus Robertson, the SNP leader in Westminster, said it was “right and proper” to assert the Scottish interest on foxhunting given that there are moves in Holyrood to toughen up Scotland’s law on the issue.<br /></p> \n<p>“We totally oppose foxhunting and, when there are moves in the Scottish parliament to review whether the existing Scottish ban is strong enough, it is in the Scottish interest to maintain the existing ban in England and Wales for Holyrood to consider,” he said. </p> \n<p>Robertson indicated the SNP was not in a mood to be accommodating towards the Conservatives given its unhappiness with the devolution settlement offered in the Scotland bill.</p> \n<p>“We are in a situation where the Tory government are refusing to agree to any amendments to improve the Scotland bill – which are supported by 58 of Scotland’s 59 MPs – and imposing English votes for English laws to make Scotland’s representation at Westminster second class,” he said. </p> \n<p>“In these circumstances, it is right and proper that we assert the Scottish interest on foxhunting by voting with Labour against the Tories’ proposals to relax the ban – in the process, reminding an arrogant UK government of just how slender their majority is – just as we will vote against the Tory welfare cuts next week and appeal to Labour to join us.” </p> \n<p>SNP sources had last week indicated the party would probably abstain but it was coming under pressure from its activists not to be party to a Tory attempt to relax the law, even though it usually takes a decision on principle not to vote on English and Welsh-only matters.</p> \n<p>Under the Scottish ban, enshrined in the Protection of Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002, dogs can only be used if they are “flushing” foxes from cover towards waiting guns. </p> \n<p>But the Scottish government has launched its own investigation into the effectiveness of this legislation after surveillance of five of Scotland’s 10 hunts suggested that they are routinely behaving as they did before the ban, with a complete absence of shotguns. Covert video footage taken by the League Against Cruel Sports over a three-month period apparently shows no practice of ‘flushing to guns’.</p> \n<p>The Holyrood environment minister, Aileen McLeod, confirmed in a letter to the League that MSPs intended to scrutinise the ban, writing that she “would be very concerned” if the law was being flouted and that she was referring her concerns to Police Scotland.</p> \n<p>SNP MPs have been struck by the strength of feeling on the issue. From the moment they were elected, new SNP MPs reported being lobbied by voters in the rest of the UK who promised to holiday in Scotland and buy more whisky if they voted against the repeal of the hunting ban.</p> \n<p>The Conservatives suggested the SNP’s move made them more determined to bring in proposals to allow English votes for English laws. A party source said: “This is a technical change to bring the law in England and Wales more closely into line with Scotland.<br /></p> \n<p>“Hunting is a devolved issue. The SNP’s decision to vote on a draft law that does not affect Scotland at all shows exactly why Conservatives committed in our manifesto to ensure laws that only affect England can only be passed with the consent of English MPs.”<br />However, the Tory English votes proposals would not in fact have stopped the SNP voting down the relaxation of the foxhunting ban because the proposals still require a vote of the whole house for legislation to pass, in addition to a vote by English MPs only.</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436817108827/4c443d7c-af5a-4569-b2f1-5edc09086610-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Simon Dawson/AP","altText":"The Albrighton & Woodland Hunt in 2009.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Simon Dawson/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-13T19:58:52Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T23:20:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2240,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowena Mason","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899403654/Rowena-Mason-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rowena-mason"},{"name":"Libby Brooks","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/5/1399294301217/Libby-Brooks-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/libbybrooks"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Hunting","Scottish National party (SNP)","David Cameron","Conservatives","House of Commons","Animal welfare","Animals","Politics","UK news","Scotland","Scottish politics"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/hunting","webTitle":"Hunting"},{"id":"politics/snp","webTitle":"Scottish National party (SNP)"},{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"politics/houseofcommons","webTitle":"House of Commons"},{"id":"world/animal-welfare","webTitle":"Animal welfare"},{"id":"world/animals","webTitle":"Animals"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland"},{"id":"politics/scotland","webTitle":"Scottish politics"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/13/foxhunting-ban-changes-under-threat-from-snp","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aja5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jul/13/foxhunting-ban-changes-under-threat-from-snp","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/13/foxhunting-ban-changes-under-threat-from-snp"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436817108827/4c443d7c-af5a-4569-b2f1-5edc09086610-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Albrighton &amp; Woodland Hunt in 2009.

The English votes for English laws proposals brought forward go beyond any reasonable proposition and look to make Scottish MPs effectively second-class citizens in the House of Commons. So, I think if there’s an opportunity – as there appears to be here – and on an issue where David Cameron appears to be out of touch with majority English opinion as well, to actually remind the government how slender their majority is.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>I’ve taken the quote from<a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com\"> PoliticsHome.</a></p> \n<p>On the Today programme Liam Fox, the Conservative former defence secretary, has just said the SNP move amounts to “a toxic mixture of opportunism and hypocrisy”. I will post more from his interview, and other reaction to the SNP move, soon.</p> \n<p>Otherwise, it is set to be a busy day at Westminster. Here is the agenda.</p> \n<p><em>9.30am:</em> Inflation figures for June are published.</p> \n<p><em>9.30am:</em> Lord Owen, the former SDP leader, and Jack Straw, the Labour former foreign secretary, give evidence to the public administration and constitutional affairs committee about the purdah rules and referendums.</p> \n<p><em>10.15am: </em>Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee.</p> \n<p><em>12pm: </em>David Cameron gives a speech on gender equality in the workplace.</p> \n<p><em>12.30pm:</em> Theresa May, the home secretary, gives a statement to the Commons on the immigrant crisis at Calais.</p> \n<p><em>1.30pm:</em> Andy Burnham takes part in a Commons press gallery Labour leadership Q&amp;A.</p> \n<p><em>2.45pm:</em> Natacha Bouchart, the mayor of Calais, James Brokenshire, the immigration minister, and others give evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about the situation at Calais.</p> \n<p>As usual I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

All of the other 27 EU nations are expected to be asked to contribute. </p> \n<p>Controversial reforms Greece promised to pass into law by Wednesday include reforming the VAT system, overhauling pensions and signing up to plans that ensure immediate spending cuts in the event of breaching creditor-mandated budget targets.<br /></p> \n<p>Athens has agreed to sell off state assets worth €50bn, with the proceeds earmarked for a trust fund supervised by its creditors. Half the fund will be used to recapitalise Greek banks, while the remaining €25bn will pay down Greek debts as well as be investmented.</p> \n<p>Determined to keep his party together ahead of an expected onslaught by MPs opposing the outlined deal, Tsipras summoned his closest allies to a meeting in Athens before a gathering of his parliamentary party on Tuesday.<br /></p> \n<p>The former Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has called the deal “unviable” and likened it to the 1919 Versailles treaty – widely seen as the harbinger of the second world war for its crushing of Weimar Germany.</p> \n<p>“This has nothing to do with economics. It has nothing to do with putting Greece back on the rails towards recovery,” Varoufakis told Australia’s public broadcaster, the ABC.</p> \n<p>“This is a new Versailles treaty that is haunting Europe again, and the prime minister [Alexis Tsipras] knows it. He knows he’s damned if he does and he’s damned if he doesn’t.”</p> \n<p>The leader of Tsipras’s coalition partner, the populist Independent Greeks, said he could not support a key element of the proposals that he described as “barbaric”.<br /></p> \n<p>Panos Kammenos said a demand that Athens hands over €50bn in assets from privatisations as collateral for fresh loans was a form of “confiscation” and “we cannot agree to that”.<br /></p> \n<p>The level of hostility engendered by the accord ensures that Greece is likely to be plunged into prolonged political tumult.
