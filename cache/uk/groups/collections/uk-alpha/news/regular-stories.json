If we leave, it’s an excuse for everyone else to leave. So I think that could be quite an interesting argument, come the day. I think it is more likely there will be an argument over that than over Europe.”</p> \n<p>Like Clarke and Grieve, Davis says he is in favour of reform but opposes unilateral withdrawal from the ECHR – one of the likely consequences of the party’s draft bill of rights. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/11/human-rights-reform-michael-gove-justice-secretary\">Why human rights reform could trip up Michael Gove | Joshua Rozenberg</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Separately, in an open letter to the prime minister the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute points out that Tory proposals for a British bill of rights will limit the application of human rights laws to the ‘most serious cases’ and exclude those ‘who do not fulfil their responsibilities in society’<em>. </em>Their intervention adds to a growing list of rights groups opposing the move. </p> \n<p>Davis, a former shadow home secretary, has in the past been a trenchant critic of the Human Rights Act.

A significant proportion of the text is understood to consist of sections of the European convention on human rights, which it is intended will be incorporated into UK law.</p> \n<p>Because the draft bill was a Conservative party document and not a product of the coalition government, it could not be worked on by civil servants or official parliamentary draughtsmen before the election. </p> \n<p>The British bill of rights, as it is known, would, according to the Tory manifesto, “break the formal link between British courts and the European court of human rights”.

Lord Faulks, who has been reappointed as a justice minister and who also supports the proposals, will have the challenging task of propelling it through a House of Lords packed with Labour and Liberal Democrat opponents.</p> \n<p>The Ministry of Justice said: “The government was elected with a manifesto commitment to replace the Human Rights Act with a British bill of rights. Ministers will be discussing their plans on this and making announcements in due course.” </p> \n<p>The plans are expected to be mentioned in the Queen’s speech but a final bill may not be put before MPs until later this parliament.</p> \n<p>One of the dilemmas ministers will have to consider is whether to incorporate the European convention into UK law or embark on an even more complex process of drawing up an entirely different set of rights. </p> \n<p> The open letter to Cameron from the International Bar Association’s Human Rights Institute says: “We would like to remind you of the universality with which human rights law is enshrined in international agreements, to which the UK has always been a willing part. </p> \n<p>Human rights can only be an effective mechanism for protection if they apply to all people in all cases.”</p> \n<p>Signed by the organisation’s co-chairs, Baroness Helena Kennedy QC and ambassador Hans Corell, a Swedish diplomat and former under-secretary general at the United Nations, the appeal reminds the prime minister that Europe has just celebrated the anniversary of VE Day the beginning of a reconciliation process that culminated in the establishment of the the European court of human rights in Strasbourg.</p> \n<p>“Human rights can only be an effective mechanism for protection if they apply to <em>all</em> people in <em>all</em> cases,” the open letter continues. “No differentiation can or should be made between ‘serious’ or ‘trivial’ cases and those who have or have not fulfilled particular requirements. To make such differentiations within any new bill of rights would be to remove the effectiveness of any human rights laws in protecting all people, including marginalised or vulnerable individuals. This would not be leadership, but its very antithesis.”</p>","section":"Law","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a70ce738ca6f886123176c8b77cf77b7c715fab8/0_228_1665_999/1665.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":999,"width":1665,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Steve Parsons/PA","altText":"Conservative MP David Davis says he doesn’t want Britain to leave the EHCR.

He is leaving his role when his contract comes to an end, while Richardson has offered his resignation.</p> \n<p>The Ukip leader’s problems then escalated on Thursday when Stuart Wheeler, a major donor, and Hugh Williams, a co-treasurer, said it was time for him to go.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456727618__\n</div> \n<p>But Farage’s position was shored up by the release of several supportive statements from other donors, including Richard Desmond, the Daily Express newspaper owner, and Arron Banks, a businessman. Desmond said: “Nigel has my support 101%.”</p> \n<p>A source with knowledge of Ukip’s internal politics said the root of the battle for the heart of the party is about the role to be played by Farage in any EU referendum. Many Eurosceptics, including some within the Tories and Ukip, fear the prospect of Farage being the voice of the out campaign, because he is too controversial.</p> \n<p>The departure of Farage’s aides appears to be a victory for Patrick O’Flynn, the party’s campaign director, who said the Ukip leader had turned into a “snarling, thin-skinned and aggressive” man during the election and warned of the party turning into a personality cult. He broke cover in an interview with the Times, in which he blamed failures in the party’s election campaign on Farage’s inner circle.</p> \n<p>Speaking later to Sky News, O’Flynn said he supported Farage’s leadership but wanted to call time on advisers who had tried to take the party in an aggressive direction similar to that of the Tea Party movement in the US.</p> \n<p>Kassam responded in a subsequent interview on the same channel, saying O’Flynn “ain’t seen nothing yet” when it comes to aggressive-style politics as he would be returning to a role as a journalist at the right-wing website Breitbart London.</p> \n<p>“I will be scrutinising quite heavily what the Red Ukip team are trying to do to the organisation,” he said.</p> \n<p>Kassam also called on O’Flynn to consider his position for being “utterly unprofessional” and suggested that the MEP had “some issues that he has to deal with”.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the BBC’s Today programme on Friday, Kassam said he thought O’Flynn’s grievances should have been aired during the campaign period. “It strikes me as a little bit bizarrely opportune for this all to come out straight after the election.”</p> \n<p>Commenting on Farage’s leadership of the party, Kassam said: “I don’t think anybody apart from Nigel has the wherewithal and the political nous to make snap decisions based on [the fact that the party only got one seat but 4m votes in the general election].”</p> \n<p>O’Flynn insisted he was only calling for the resignation of the aides and a more “consultative” style of leadership from Farage. But it soon became clear there was also an attempted coup under way over Farage’s leadership.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456734070__\n</div> \n<p>Farage told the BBC’s Question Time he had the overwhelming backing of party members and leaving ahead of a referendum on the crucial issue of the EU would be wrong. “The level of support for me in the party is phenomenal and, frankly, to go through a leadership contest at a time when Cameron says he’s renegotiating our relationship with the European Union would be a massive, massive mistake,” he said.</p> \n<p>O’Flynn’s comments were disappointing, but ultimately just “letting off steam and ... fighting personal wars” after a pressurised election campaign, Farage added.</p> \n<p>Stuart Wheeler, who has given hundreds of thousands of pounds to the party, told BBC Radio 5 Live that it was “time for something quieter” in terms of the Ukip leadership. He said he thought Farage was exhausted, in pain from back problems and should have stayed resigned, at least until a new contest could be held in the autumn.<br /></p> \n<p>Wheeler said Farage was too aggressive and divisive as the party headed into the crucial period before the EU referendum, which would give Ukip the opportunity to campaign for its main aim of leaving.</p> \n<p>Hugh Williams, the party’s treasurer, backed Wheeler, saying Farage was the “best political performer in this country, but there has to come a time – and I think that time is probably now – when he has to let the party stand on its own two feet.”<br />He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: “There is a great danger it is seen as a Nigel Farage party rather than the UK Independence party.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/14/the-main-contenders-to-replace-nigel-farage-in-ukip-coup\">Who's who in the Ukip coup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In a separate row, Douglas Carswell, the party’s only MP, is also in a standoff with Farage because the MP does not want to accept all of the &pound;3.25m in “short money” – funding for its parliamentary activities – that is due to the party on account of its 3.9m votes.<br /></p> \n<p>The MP hit out at “excitable” aides to Farage, who suggested he should hire a huge parliamentary staff to use up the money.

In 1988, a third of swimming spots failed the tests.</p> \n<p>But the data published by the EA on Friday show that authorities will have to redouble efforts to make all public swimming areas safe under the revised <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-bathing/summary.html\">EU Bathing Water Directive</a>, which comes into force this summer bathing season.</p> \n<p>Beaches including Blackpool Central and North, Clacton, Ilfracombe Wildersmouth, Hastings, Lyme Regis Church Cliff Beach, Morecambe South, Lancing and Walpole Bay at Margate are among those predicted to fall foul of the stricter rules this summer.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-bathing/\">new European standards</a> will cut acceptable levels of harmful bacteria in half.

But Ed Mitchell, EA executive director of environment and business, said further upgrades were required.</p> \n<p>“Water quality at English beaches is better than it’s ever been after it reached record levels last year, and we are working hard with others to improve it further still,” he said.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2014/may/23/blackpool-beach-eu-water-law\">EA told the Guardian last year</a> that many of the large infrastructure improvements required were now complete and the job of making house-to-house improvements may prove more difficult in order to eradicate health concerns for all bathers.</p> \n<p>Water companies will invest &pound;350m in upgrading 3,728 miles of river and 50 bathing spots over the next five years.

Niyongabo said he had negotiated with those supporting the coup but if they “did not understand talking we will make them understand by force”. </p> \n<p>Reports afterwards said Nkurunziza had returned to Burundi from Tanzania.

In the afternoon Nkurunziza announced on state radio, from an unknown location, that he condemned the coup, while thanking the soldiers who had remained loyal. “I condemn that group of coup plotters. I thank soldiers who are putting things in order, and I forgive any soldier who decides to surrender,” Reuters reported him as saying. </p> \n<p>Heavy fighting flared around the state broadcasting headquarters, forcing radio transmissions to halt briefly. They resumed after the shooting eased to announce that state radio was still in the hands of forces loyal to the president. The state broadcaster is seen as a strategic asset for both sides to reach the population.</p> \n<p>Earlier the African Public Radio station, which was shut down during the weeks of protests and reopened after the coup attempt, was set alight and prevented from broadcasting. Heavy plumes of smoke rose from the building. Radio Bonesha, another private station, was also attacked by people with grenades and gunfire. Burundi’s international airport, meanwhile, was shut then reportedly reopened and taken over by party loyalists. </p> \n<p>“President Pierre Nkurunziza is now in Burundi,” the president’s senior communications adviser, Willy Nyamitwe, told AFP on Thursday night. “That’s all we can say for now because of security reasons.”</p> \n<p>The violence left the country facing its biggest crisis since the end of a 12-year ethnically charged civil war in 2006. Hundreds of thousands of people died in the conflict and the subsequent peace accord ensured that the future army would be split 50-50 between minority Tutsis and majority Hutus.<br /></p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456723307__\n</div> \n<p>Nkurunziza, a former rebel leader from the Hutu majority and a born-again Christian, believes he ascended to the presidency in 2005 with divine backing. Opposition and rights groups say it is unconstitutional for him to run for more than two terms. The president, however, argues his first term did not count as he was elected by parliament, not directly by the people. This was supported by the constitutional court, although one of the judges fled the country, claiming its members received death threats.</p> \n<p>More than 22 people have been killed and scores wounded since late April, when Burundi’s ruling CNDD-FDD party nominated Nkurunziza to stand for re-election in polls scheduled for 26 June. More than 50,000 Burundians have fled the violence to Rwanda and other neighbouring countries in recent weeks, with the UN preparing for thousands more refugees.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0899252370ca71922cd6c574cb066807483d9c9\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f0899252370ca71922cd6c574cb066807483d9c9/0_16_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protester prepares a petrol bomb in Bujumbura\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester prepares a petrol bomb in Bujumbura.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dr Robert Besseling, principal <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/africa\">Africa</a> analyst at the London-based risk consultancy IHS, warned while the coup was still under way that it could trigger ethnic fighting in Bujumbura, overpopulated rural areas and internally displaced people’s camps along the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzanian borders.
