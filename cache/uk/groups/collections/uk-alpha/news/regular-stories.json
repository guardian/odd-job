Pinckney campaigned for legislation to require police officers to wear body cameras while working. He said: “Body cameras help to record what happens. It may not be the golden ticket, the golden egg, the end-all-fix-all, but it helps to paint a picture of what happens during a police stop.”. The Rev Joseph Darby, the presiding elder at Beaufort AME Church, described Pinckney as “an advocate for the people”.

time of the shooting.</p> \n <p>Police have not confirmed the identities of the victims, eight of whom were killed in the church, another dying later in hospital.</p> \n <p>Charleston police chief <strong>Greg Mullen</strong> said there were survivors, but declined to give more details.</p> \n <p>The suspect, who is still on the loose, has been described as a clean-shaved, white male aged approximately 21, with a small, slender build, wearing a grey sweatshirt with jeans and boots.</p> \n <p>Mullen said he believed the shooting was “a hate crime”.</p> \n <p>The city’s mayor, <strong>Joseph P Riley Jr</strong>, described the killing as an “unspeakable tragedy”, pledging to catch “this awful person and bring him to justice as soon as possible”.</p> \n <p>He said he had met with relatives of the victims in a “heartbreaking scene”.</p> \n <p>South Carolina governor <strong>Nikki Haley</strong> said details of the shooting were still unclear, but “we do know that we’ll never understand what motivates anyone to enter one of our places of worship and take the life of another”.<br /></p> \n <p>“Please join us in lifting up the victims and their families with our love and prayers,” she said.</p> \n <p>Presidential candidate <strong>Jeb Bush</strong> has cancelled a planned trip to the state, and the South Carolina legislature has suspended a sitting planned for

I am reminded that he helped lead our prayer vigil for Scott.</p>— Reverend Al Sharpton (@TheRevAl) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheRevAl/status/611397227391647744\">June 18, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Pinckney campaigned for legislation to require police officers to wear body cameras while working. He said: “Body cameras help to record what happens. It may not be the golden ticket, the golden egg, the end-all-fix-all, but it helps to paint a picture of what happens during a police stop.”</p> \n<p>The Rev Joseph Darby, the presiding elder at Beaufort AME Church, described Pinckney as “an advocate for the people”. He told MSNBC: “He was a very caring and competent pastor, and he was a very brave man. Brave men sometimes die difficult deaths.”</p> \n<p>The Emanuel church website said Pinckney began preaching at 13 and was first appointed as a pastor at 18. He had a degree in business administration, and master’s degrees in public administration and divinity.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP35_JVnP6g\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XP35_JVnP6g?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Clementa Pickney at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>His <a href=\"http://www.emanuelamechurch.org/revpinckney.php\">profile on the church website</a> included a quote from a Washington Post columnist, David Broder, who said Pinckney was a “political spirit lifter for surprisingly not becoming cynical about politics”.</p> \n<p>Pinckney is survived by his wife, Jennifer, and two children, Eliana and Malana.</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434611117946/c47ae772-d2b7-4914-9408-44595bc2faec-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":162,"width":270,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church","altText":"Clementa Pickney","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434611484813/b7f5d64f-a56f-47e3-ae82-630910f7dff6-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":232,"width":292,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Clementa Pickney.

Experts warn that the superbug has emerged as a result of antibiotic use in intensive farming and there is evidence that the UK could be at risk of a wider health crisis unless the issue is tackled by the authorities. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/18/what-is-the-superbug-la-mrsa-cc398-and-why-is-it-spreading-on-farms\">What is the superbug LA-MRSA CC398 and why is it spreading on farms?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The superbug CC398 is a variant of the more commonly known MRSA found in hospitals and is endemic in pig farms in some European countries, particularly Denmark, Europe’s biggest pork producer and a key exporter to the UK. The Guardian tested 74 Danish pork products and 25 British, and one from Ireland.</p> \n<p>CC398 is linked to intensive farms, where the density of pigs crowded together becomes a flashpoint for disease, and farmers become reliant on antibiotics to keep animals healthy and alive. This has led to the emergence of CC398, which is resistant to antibiotics.</p> \n<p>Two thirds of Denmark’s pig farms are currently infected with CC398, where it is spreading rapidly: 648 people were infected with CC398 in 2013; in 2014, 1,271 people contracted the bug. Of those infected two people died as a result of the infection, and many suffered serious blood poisoning. <br /></p> \n<p>None of the British pork tested by the Guardian was infected with CC398, but a similar study carried out by the Alliance to Save Antibiotics, a campaign group which includes the Soil Association, did identify the superbug in pork from British farms. In findings due to be published on Thursday, the Alliance identified the bug in a pork sausage and in a packet of pork mince purchased in the UK. Fifty-two samples of pork from supermarkets in Bristol, Cambridge, London, Northumberland and Surrey were tested by the University of Cambridge on behalf of the Alliance. The findings confirm that CC398 has now spread from British farms into the domestic pork supply chain. <em> </em><em> </em><em> </em></p> \n<p>A leading microbiologist has warned Britain to see the situation in Denmark as a warning. “[It] is an epidemic [that’s] out of control in Denmark,” Professor Hans J&oslash;rn Kolmos, a microbiologist at the University of Southern Denmark told the Guardian. “[Britain] should be worried about it, you should look at our problems. We should have intervened seven years back when we saw the first cases. Don’t think that this is a problem that will solve itself just by closing your eyes,” he said. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9c100d2be541ba2b2ffed2f38005fa3c1a8211e0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434542150086/32bdde03-4dae-496a-a78d-427ce280e230-460x339.jpeg\" alt=\"The bug was identified in a pork sausage\" width=\"460\" height=\"339\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bug has been identified in a pork sausage, confirming the spread of the infection from British farms.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A Guardian film made during the investigation into infected pork also reveals how CC398 has already crossed the species barrier in the UK. A little-reported study by the University of Edinburgh, published in 2014, found the bug in the umbilical cords of two newborn babies in Scotland. </p> \n<p>The Scottish study is thought to be the first confirmation in the UK that the bug has travelled from livestock to humans in Britain, though researchers were not able to explain how the superbug spread and there is nothing to suggest the babies became ill as a result of coming into contact with CC398.</p> \n<p>Dr Melissa Ward of Edinburgh University, the study’s lead researcher, told the Guardian: “We were not able to trace the exact source of CC398 for the individual humans in our study. MRSA bacteria can live on the skin of humans and animals, often without causing any symptoms. The bacteria can spread from person to person, and between animals and humans, by close contact such as touching,” she said.</p> \n<p>But Ward said the findings “emphasise the need for strict biosecurity measures in the food production industry and the importance of infection control measures in hospitals, as well as responsible antibiotic usage in both veterinary and human medicine”.</p> \n<p>Six products purchased from Sainsbury’s stores were found to contain the superbug – five Danish gammon steak and one gammon joint – while an Asda Danish unsmoked gammon steak, a Co-operative Danish unsmoked back bacon pack and a Tesco Irish unsmoked gammon steak were also contaminated with CC398.</p> \n<p>In response to the Guardian’s findings, Sainsbury’s, Asda and the Co-operative said that while they believed there was little risk to consumers they were investigating the sources of contaminated pork. </p> \n<p>Sainsbury’s said its staff “routinely test our own products for a range of microorganisms and take advice from all the relevant authorities”, and reiterated that CC398 could be eliminated through cooking. </p> \n<p>Asda said: “As a responsible retailer we take any concerns over food safety seriously and work closely with our suppliers to ensure we have secure measures in place to guard against any potential issues.” </p> \n<p>The Co-operative said it was “investigating the findings with our Danish bacon supplier, who is at the forefront of research into LA-MRSA CC398”.</p> \n<p>Tesco declined to comment. <br /></p> \n<p>The Guardian’s investigation has established that the spread of CC398 in Denmark is being fuelled by the sector’s reliance on a large number of casual workers who unknowingly contract the superbug and then pass it on to others in the wider community. The UK’s livestock sector also relies on many casual workers who may move from farm to farm. According to Danish union leaders, workers receive little or no training relating to MRSA.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"18be64dee384fecf65cc204d3f594677a105b9cb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434542307055/9f0e4164-7f96-4d06-bc46-383fcb6eca2d-405x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Andre, an infected farm worker in Denmark.\" width=\"405\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andre, a farm worker in Denmark, who has the infection, which has developed into spots on his skin.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian video</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A group of Romanian workers in Denmark who were interviewed as part of the Guardian’s investigation say they knew nothing about MRSA until after they started working at farms. One former farm worker infected with the bug said: “I was three months on the farm, [and] I got some spots on my scalp, also on my chest and I thought first it’s from the dust and the conditions.”</p> \n<p>“[Eight months later] I was in Romania on holiday and I visited the doctor and they took some examples from my skin and they said I have MRSA.” </p> \n<p>The Danish government has pledged to tackle spiralling CC398 rates by reducing the amount of antibiotics used in pig production by 15% by 2018, and to improve biosecurity by strengthening hygiene training of pig-farm workers. Despite this, Dan Jorgensen, Denmark’s minister for agriculture, admitted the situation was a “catastrophe” because the authorities “don’t even have the most basic knowledge of how widespread MRSA is”.</p> \n<p>The FSA said: “There are no known cases of people contracting LA-MRSA CC398 from eating meat in the UK. Even on the continent where LA-MRSA CC398 is much more prevalent there is no clear evidence of food being linked to infection in people. Previous research has found LA-MRSA in meat on sale in the UK and we are working with experts from across government to better understand the potential risk to public health. </p> \n<p>“As part of this we will be consulting our independent expert advisory committee on the issue later this month. In the meantime, consumers should be aware that any risk of contracting MRSA through meat is very low when usual good hygiene and thorough cooking practices are observed.” </p> \n<p><br /></p> \n<p><br /></p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434540284905/3428c09c-0f7a-48c8-b7ce-93ff617bc879-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian video","altText":"Inside a pig farm.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian video"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434542151273/32bdde03-4dae-496a-a78d-427ce280e230-2060x1519.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1519,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The bug has been identified in a pork sausage, confirming the spread of the infection from British farms.

Lifesaving operations – organ transplants, cancer treatments and caesarean sections – will become much more risky.</p> \n<p>The UK’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, has stated that antibiotic resistance is a “ticking time bomb” and thegovernment has demanded tough targets for a reduction in antibiotic prescriptions by doctors, and pledged to lead efforts to develop new drugs to combat the problem.</p> \n<p>However, almost half of all antibiotics used in the UK are administered to farm animals. In the UK, antibiotics can only be legally supplied to farms with a prescription from a vet to treat, and in some cases prevent, illness, but there are several problems with the way animal antibiotics are regulated.</p> \n<p>The European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption collects information based on sales of antibiotics, but not the administering practices on individual farms. Antibiotics are often administered as medicated feedstuffs or on farms authorised by the UK Veterinary Medicines Directorate, an executive agency of the Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs, meaning the drugs can be disseminated widely rather than only to sick animals.</p> \n<p>Public health and veterinary authorities do not have records of the doses of specific antibioticsgiven to livestock on farms. Additionally, the Guardian investigation found that animal antibiotics can be purchased on the internet by anyone – no prescription needed. Furthermore, vets who prescribe antibiotics get paid for the prescription, leading to an inherent conflict of interest.</p> \n<p>There is evidence that links certain antibiotic-resistant bacteria in human infections to drug use on farms, particularly in food poisoning illnesses including campylobacter, salmonella and<em> E coli</em>, as well as MRSA infections.</p> \n<p>Public health experts around the world, including the WHO and the European Food Safety Authority, recognise that these increasingly resistant bacteria are being transmitted from farm animals to people through the food chain.</p> \n<p>Farming bodies maintain that the drugs are necessary to ensure animal health and wellbeing and are vigorously opposing attempts to curtail their use.

For example, Pope Francis is expected to criticise cap and trade programmes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, saying that such “easy solutions” simply give rise to market speculation.</p> \n<p>The encyclical is not just a statement about global warming.

But what exactly is an encyclical? And why is this one causing such a fuss? <strong>John Hooper</strong>, long-term Vatican observer for the Guardian, has all the answers </p>","byline":"John Hooper","body":"<p><strong>Q. Encyclicals. Are they the top level of papal declarations?<br /></strong></p> \n<p>A. Second from top. An apostolic constitution is the highest form of papal decree. Only one has been issued so far this century – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2009/oct/20/pontifical-decree-pope-benedict-vatican\">by Pope Benedict to give Anglicans a way of joining the Catholic church</a> without having to forgo their liturgy and so on.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. So what is an encyclical?</strong></p> \n<p>A. Originally, it was a circular letter; the term comes from the Greek word for a circle. The earliest papal encyclicals were sent by the pope of the day to members of the Catholic hierarchy, and sometimes only to those in a particular country. So they could be about quite mundane issues of ecclesiastical organisation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/13/pope-francis-intervention-transforms-climate-change-debate\">Explosive intervention by Pope Francis set to transform climate change debate</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Q. When did encyclicals come into fashion?</strong></p> \n<p>A. The man who first seems to have gone big on them was the genial and unpretentious Benedict XIV, who was pope in the mid-18th century. He wrote his first encyclical – <a href=\"http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Ben14/b14ubipr.htm\">Ubi Primum</a>, which was about the duties of bishops – four months after being elected and issued the last of 44 in the year before he died in 1758. The all-time encyclical writing champion, though, was Leo XIII who sat on the throne of St Peter from 1878 to 1903. He penned more than 80, including one of the most influential, <a href=\"http://w2.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html\">Rerum Novarum</a>, published in 1891.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. Why was it considered so important?</strong></p> \n<p>A. It was the papacy’s – long overdue – response to a changed world of industrial conflict and class warfare. Rerum Novarum laid the foundations of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/belief/2009/jun/27/face-faith-catholic-church-christine-allen\">Catholic social teaching</a>, condemning both Marxism and unfettered capitalism. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/belief/2009/jun/27/face-faith-catholic-church-christine-allen\">Face to faith | Christine Allen on the breadth of Catholic social teaching</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Q. Other landmark encyclicals?</strong></p> \n<p>A. Probably the one that has had the greatest impact on humanity is <a href=\"http://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae.html\">Humanae Vitae</a>, the encyclical that reaffirmed the Catholic church’s ban on artificial birth control back in 1968. But Humanae Vitae is also probably the papal diktat that has been most widely ignored by Catholics themselves, notably in Italy, which nowadays has one of the world’s lowest birth rates. </p> \n<p><strong>Q. Do encyclicals have to have Latin titles?</strong></p> \n<p>A. No, though most do. There have been French and Italian titles. And one of the most famous encyclicals was written entirely in German.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. Why?</strong></p> \n<p>A. Mit brennender Sorge – <a href=\"http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_14031937_mit-brennender-sorge.html\">With Burning Anxiety</a> – was Pope Pius XI’s denunciation of the ideas of the Third Reich. It was smuggled into Germany and read out from the pulpits of Catholic churches on Palm Sunday 1937.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. But wasn’t the pope a bit soft on the Nazis?</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/feb/09/hitlers-pope-pius-xii-holocaust\">Vatican hopes secret files exonerate 'Hitler's pope'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A. That’s the accusation levelled against Pius XI’s successor, Pius XII.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. Are encyclicals really written by popes?</strong></p> \n<p>A. Not these days. Leo XIII was said to have written his. But nowadays they are a team effort. In the case of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/15/pope-francis-destruction-ecosystem-leaked-encyclical\">Francis’s encyclical on the environment</a>, much of the work was delegated to the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, the Vatican department that most closely resembles an overseas aid and development ministry in a secular government. Nevertheless, it is the pope who does the final editing. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/15/pope-francis-destruction-ecosystem-leaked-encyclical\">Pope Francis warns of destruction of Earth's ecosystem in leaked encyclical</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Q. After which the encyclical goes to be translated …</strong></p> \n<p>A. Yes, and that can be a story in itself. Because of the importance attached to the words used by a pope, it is crucial that what he says in each language should be understood in the same way. Publication of Pope Benedict’s third encyclical, <a href=\"http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20090629_caritas-in-veritate.html\">Caritas in Veritate</a>, was held up for a week because of the difficulties of reconciling certain passages.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. Understandable if what the pope says is held to be infallib</strong><strong>le. No?</strong></p> \n<p>A. No. Pronouncements held to be infallible are very rare and limited to matters of faith and doctrine. The last papal declaration indisputably regarded as falling into this category was in 1950. Whatever Pope Francis has to say about climate change or fossil fuels will carry great moral weight. But neither he nor the Vatican would claim his views on the environment are infallible.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434534918460/ed52ce87-57ab-40cb-b74b-ddc7898682c4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"MAURIZIO BRAMBATTI/EPA","altText":"Pope Francis","cleanCredit":"Photograph: MAURIZIO BRAMBATTI/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T05:00:08Z","lastModified":"2015-06-18T05:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"John Hooper","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/johnhooper"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Pope Francis","Environment","Climate change","Catholicism","Christianity","Cop 20: UN climate change conference | Lima","Global climate talks","Religion","The papacy","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/pope-francis","webTitle":"Pope Francis"},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment"},{"id":"environment/climate-change","webTitle":"Climate change"},{"id":"world/catholicism","webTitle":"Catholicism"},{"id":"world/christianity","webTitle":"Christianity"},{"id":"environment/cop-20-un-climate-change-conference-lima","webTitle":"Cop 20: UN climate change conference | Lima"},{"id":"environment/global-climate-talks","webTitle":"Global climate talks"},{"id":"world/religion","webTitle":"Religion"},{"id":"world/the-papacy","webTitle":"The papacy"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"John Hooper","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/johnhooper"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#005689","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#005689","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#63717a","colourPalette":"analysis"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/18/popes-encyclical-on-the-environment-key-questions-answered","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49pyn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/18/popes-encyclical-on-the-environment-key-questions-answered","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/18/popes-encyclical-on-the-environment-key-questions-answered"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434534918460/ed52ce87-57ab-40cb-b74b-ddc7898682c4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Pope Francis greets the faithful during his weekly general audience in St Peter’s Square, Vatican.

Hong Kong people’s frustrations could explode again at any time.”</p> \n<p>Pro-democracy politicians would now attempt to restart the political reform process and squeeze concessions out of Beijing but the Communist party was unlikely to cave in, Hui added. “If they had wanted to make compromises they would have done so already.”</p> \n<p>Michael Davis, a law professor from the University of Hong Kong, said Beijing had paid the price for its refusal to offer a single concession to those pushing for greater levels of democracy.<br /></p> \n<p>“What they got through this hard line was the whole of civil society protesting and resisting Beijing. It really backfired on them. We would hope that there would be some lessons learned and some acts of contrition going forward. Will that happen? Right now one can’t be optimistic.”</p> \n<p>Hundreds of police had gathered in and around Hong Kong’s government headquarters and parliament this week amid fears that the highly contentious vote could spark renewed protests or even violence.</p> \n<p>Tens of thousands of pro-democracy activists spilled out on to the streets in 2014 as part of the student-driven “umbrella movement” demonstrations. For 79 days large swathes of Hong Kong’s financial heart were transformed into a sea of tents and banners. Police eventually cleared the occupation in December. </p> \n<p>On Thursday Xinhua, China’s official news agency, warned that Hong Kong risked “being torn further apart” if Beijing’s proposal was defeated. The Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, said <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/927703.shtml\">“real chaos” could ensue</a>.</p> \n<p>Speaking shortly before the vote around noon on Thursday, Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s number two official, lashed out at pro-democracy politicians for opposing the government’s package. “I am sad and I am disappointed. I do not know how democratic development can be taken forward,” she said.</p> \n<p>Fanny Law, a pro-Beijing politician who is close to CY Leung, Hong Kong’s current chief executive, <a href=\"http://rthk.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/news.htm?hightlight&amp;20150618&amp;56&amp;1108608\">described the defeat as “heart-wrenching”</a>.</p> \n<p>“But I think there was some misjudgment along the way and we really must sit down and mend the fences after the whole saga is over,” she told RTHK, Hong Kong’s public broadcaster. “We must find a way forward and we must address some of the very deep-rooted problems in our society.”</p> \n<p>Martin Lee, the founding chairman of Hong Kong’s Democratic party, said “a major change of policy” was now needed in the former colony. </p> \n<p>“If you look at Hong Kong today all the important decisions are not made here but in Beijing or locally through the Beijing agents. The whole thing has gone wrong,” he said. </p> \n<p>“This is a good way to persuade [Chinese President Xi Jinping] that he shouldn’t continue with this wrong policy of dismissing the democrats as troublemakers or even as traitors.”</p> \n<p>Since becoming Communist party chief in 2012 Xi had taken a hardline stance towards government critics, journalists, academics and bloggers, noted Davis, the law professor. To take a similarly tough stance on Hong Kong in the wake of Thursday’s defeat would be a mistake, Davis said.</p> \n<p>“One would hope they’d cool it and not take the view to punish Hong Kong,” he said.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think they have a desire to kill Hong Kong and being aggressive in their posture towards Hong Kong or interpreting this as indicating a need for them to interfere more rather than less would be a bad judgment on their part.”</p> \n<p>Compromise was now needed from Hong Kong’s leaders. “The government’s credibility is really low – if all they do after this vote is go back to their offices and do nothing … then I think the problems of crisis and conflict in Hong Kong will persist.”</p> \n<p>Victoria Hui, a political scientist who runs a blog about Hong Kong’s umbrella movement protests, said she expected an “intensification of resistance” to Beijing following the proposal’s defeat. </p> \n<p>[<a href=\"https://victoriatbhui.wordpress.com/about/\">https://victoriatbhui.wordpress.com/about/</a>]</p> \n<p>“What we are seeing is a very artificial calm.

One source said the incident happened in March.</p> \n<p>Mark Burns-Williamson, the police and crime commissioner for West Yorkshire, said he had been in contact with his force’s chief officers and the regional counter-terrorism unit that covers his area. On the prior stopping of some of the women by police he said: “We need to understand if that has happened, what was the context, what was known, what was not known, and why are we now in this situation.” </p> \n<p>Claims that counter-terrorism police had been closely monitoring the family since the departure of their brother, Ahmed, have raised questions about whether more could have been done to prevent the sisters from leaving.<br /></p> \n<p>Naz Shah, MP for Bradford West, said she had spoken frequently to the bewildered husbands of the sisters and that many questions remained unanswered.</p> \n<p>“If there’s truth in the claims the family was being monitored by the security services, there are a lot of unanswered questions for the security services and the police,” she said on her way for a briefing on the issue in Westminster.</p> \n<p>It is believed the sisters are trying to meet one of their brothers in Syria, named by multiple sources as Ahmed Dawood. He is subject to an investigation by West Yorkshire police after he travelled to Syria up to two years ago to fight against the regime of Bashar al-Assad.</p> \n<p>West Yorkshire police said earlier on Wednesday that one of the women had contacted the family and there was an indication that they were now in Syria, which is party controlled by <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/isis\">Islamic State</a>, and may not return.<br /></p> \n<p>Russ Foster, assistant chief constable, said: “We are concerned about anyone who has or is intending to travel to the part of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/syria\">Syria</a> that is controlled by the terrorist group calling itself Islamic State. It is an extremely dangerous place and not a place where young children should be taken.”</p> \n<p>After lunchtime prayers at the Shah Jalal mosque in Little Horton, near where some of the sisters lived, worshippers expressed their frustration with the family’s disappearance and the failure of the authorities to find them.<br /></p> \n<p>One man, who did not want to be named, said he had met Ahmed Dawood. “He’s a really nice chap,” he said. “Maybe he got brainwashed. Fighting for Isis goes totally against the teachings of our religion. We are totally against it. Why must these people give us a bad name?”</p> \n<p>The missing family travelled to Saudi Arabia, apparently for an Islamic pilgrimage, on 28 May and had been due to return to the UK last Thursday. But all 12 members boarded a flight to Istanbul, Turkey, instead and had not been heard of since 9 June.</p> \n<p>The sisters are part of a large family, all British Pakistanis who follow an ultra-conservative form of Islam. Their father, Muhammad Dawood, and his wife, Sara Begum, have at least nine children – two sons and seven daughters – all of them born in Bradford.<br /></p> \n<p>Mixed reports have emerged about the state of the relationships between the missing women and their husbands, with neighbours claiming they were unhappy. However, in a press conference on Tuesday <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/video/2015/jun/16/husbands-missing-bradford-women-syria-video\">two of the husbands said their marriages were perfect</a>.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457182556__\n</div> \n<p>Zubair Ahmed, the estranged husband of Zohra, left for Pakistan last year having been an imam at a local mosque, neighbours revealed. </p> \n<p>He is said to have enjoyed living in Britain after moving from Pakistan when he married Zohra, but friends said the relationship turned sour and he chose not to return from his home country when she demanded a divorce.</p> \n<p>“He was a really nice guy. He enjoyed it here,” said one neighbour who was a friend of Zubair. “He had trouble with the wife and he left his wife a long time ago then he went to Pakistan. He’s not coming back.”</p> \n<p>Asked whether more could have been done to monitor the family, Richard Barrett, a former counter-terrorism chief at MI5 and MI6, told the Guardian that “a line has to be drawn somewhere” when watching people with suspected links to terror organisations.<br /></p> \n<p>“In some cases it’s a fine judgment,” he said. “We have to expect some things to be over-policed and some things to be under-policed.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/archive-zip/giv-21277eSGDsK96JFeb/\" data-alt=\"Family tree\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/archive-zip/giv-21277eSGDsK96JFeb/\">Family tree</a> \n</figure>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f76908bfeafc681baa05a235d366e931aeaa3e37/0_0_1920_1152/1920.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1152,"width":1920,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PA/PA","altText":"Zohra Dawood, Khadiga Bibi Dawood and Sugra Dawood, who are feared to have travelled to war-torn Syria.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PA/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-17T16:54:19Z","lastModified":"2015-06-17T23:01:09Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Helen Pidd","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/27/1422363539931/Helen-Pidd-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/helenpidd"},{"name":"Jamie Grierson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jamie-grierson"},{"name":"Josh Halliday","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/josh-halliday"},{"name":"Vikram Dodd","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/vikramdodd"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Bradford","UK security and counter-terrorism","Syria","Islamic State","Middle East and North Africa","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/bradford","webTitle":"Bradford"},{"id":"uk/uksecurity","webTitle":"UK security and counter-terrorism"},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria"},{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-457182556","source":"ITN","durationInSeconds":208,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10473525&format=video/m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/16/150616bradfordfathers_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/16/1434488515766/KP_299412_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Bradford fathers ","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Bradford fathers ","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Bradford fathers "}}],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/17/bradford-sisters-had-undergone-airport-security-checks-before-police","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49q9t","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jun/17/bradford-sisters-had-undergone-airport-security-checks-before-police","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/17/bradford-sisters-had-undergone-airport-security-checks-before-police"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f76908bfeafc681baa05a235d366e931aeaa3e37/0_0_1920_1152/1920.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1152,"width":1920,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Zohra Dawood, Khadiga Bibi Dawood and Sugra Dawood, who are believed to have entered Syria with their nine children.
