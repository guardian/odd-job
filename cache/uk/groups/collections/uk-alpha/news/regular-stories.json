The chancellor will create a &pound;175,000, tax-free allowance per person for their main property on top of their existing &pound;325,000 allowance that can be applied to all assets.</p> \n<p>His intention to lift all but the wealthiest homeowners out of inheritance tax was first revealed when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/mar/16/tories-1m-inheritance-tax-giveaway-sensitive-papers-wealthier-households\">sensitive Treasury papers</a> were leaked to the Guardian before the last budget, which concluded that it would “most likely benefit high income and wealthier households”.</p> \n<p>The Conservative proposals were later confirmed by David Cameron during the election campaign and became a key plank of the Tory manifesto championing a “Conservative dream”.</p> \n<p>At the time, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the proposal would disproportionately benefit wealthier people and could have a negative effect on the property market if elderly homeowners were discouraged from downsizing.</p> \n<p>The changes, likely to cost about &pound;1bn, will be paid for by reductions to tax relief on pensions, possibly through lowering the amount available to top-rate taxpayers from &pound;40,000 to &pound;10,000 a year on a sliding scale. The IFS has said this would “affect a relatively small number of high-income individuals”.</p> \n<p>It is understood the plans have now been amended to allow pensioners to move into smaller homes without missing out on the &pound;1m relief on their former properties. A new mechanism will mean that if someone sells their main residence and buys one that is cheaper, they will get the allowance up to the value of their previous home.</p> \n<p>Osborne’s decision to bring forward the proposals in his first budget since the Tories won a majority is a sign that it is high on his list of priorities, eight years after he first pledged to raise the threshold to &pound;1m while in opposition as the shadow chancellor.</p> \n<p>Many within Labour are likely to use the announcement to characterise the Conservatives as being the party of tax cuts for millionaires in the same way as they did when Osborne lowered the 50p income tax rate to 45p under the Conservative-Liberal coalition.</p> \n<p>Under the current rules, inheritance tax is charged on estates worth more than &pound;325,000, rising to &pound;650,000 for couples, because the rate is transferable between those who are married or in civil partnerships. It is charged at 40% of the excess value of assets above the threshold and is paid by the estate of the deceased.</p> \n<p>The new proposals raise the rate to &pound;500,000 by introducing a new zero-rate band of &pound;175,000 on a main property when it is passed on death to a child or grandchild. This would create a &pound;1m limit for couples because it would also be transferable and mean that 94% of households are exempt from the tax.</p> \n<p>Osborne is expected to set out details of much of his proposed &pound;12bn cuts in welfare in the same budget, which will be delivered to parliament on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Cameron has strongly hinted that one of the cuts will be reductions to tax credits, after he gave a speech saying he wanted to end the welfare “merry-go-round” whereby wages are topped up by state handouts.</p> \n<p>There have also been reports that Osborne would like to go even further than his plan to reduce the benefit cap from &pound;26,000 to &pound;23,000 and perhaps cut it to &pound;20,000 outside London.</p> \n<p>Separately, the chancellor is under pressure from a group of about 160 Conservatives to reduce the top rate of tax further for those earning more than &pound;150,000 a year from 45p to either 42p or 40p.</p> \n<p>It is possible he could also announce reforms to the non-dom status, including raising the annual charge and stopping its hereditary nature. Labour had pledged to abolish the status in a popular announcement during the election campaign.</p> \n<p>At the time it was announced, the IFS described the inheritance tax pledge as special treatment for homeowners.</p> \n<p>A briefing note said: “Since the children of those with very large estates are disproportionately towards the top of the income distribution, the gains from this [and in fact any] IHT cut will also go disproportionately to those towards the top of the income distribution.”</p> \n<p>Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, then told the BBC that it was “rather odd to give this special treatment to housing given that owner-occupied housing is already extremely tax privileged”.</p> \n<p>He said: “This will only increase the bias we have towards putting your money in a house, to inflating potentially the value of housing, without dealing with the lack of housing, which is driving up the value of private residences.”</p> \n<p>Before the election, Chris Leslie, the then shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said it “cannot be a priority to spend &pound;1bn on a policy which the Treasury says would not apply to 90% of estates”.</p> \n<p>He said: “The Tories would choose to give a &pound;140,000 tax cut for a house worth &pound;2m while they have increased VAT on families and pensioners.”</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/630e08bc50b93d437d8b882bfa78a17870c4d3a7/0_217_1905_1142/1905.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1142,"width":1905,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Niklas Halle'N/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"The UK chancellor George Osborne","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Niklas Halle'N/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T21:00:03Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T23:08:08Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1584,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowena Mason","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899403654/Rowena-Mason-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rowena-mason"},{"name":"Rajeev Syal","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rajeev-syal"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Budget 2015 (July)","Politics","Budget","UK news","Tax and spending","Inheritance tax","Tax","George Osborne","Conservatives","Housing","Institute for Fiscal Studies","Business","Communities","Economics","Benefits","Pensions","Money","Society","Thinktanks"],"tags":[{"id":"uk-news/budget-2015-july","webTitle":"Budget 2015 (July)"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/budget","webTitle":"Budget"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/taxandspending","webTitle":"Tax and spending"},{"id":"money/inheritancetax","webTitle":"Inheritance tax"},{"id":"money/tax","webTitle":"Tax"},{"id":"politics/georgeosborne","webTitle":"George Osborne"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"society/housing","webTitle":"Housing"},{"id":"business/institute-for-fiscal-studies","webTitle":"Institute for Fiscal Studies"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"society/communities","webTitle":"Communities"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"society/benefits","webTitle":"Benefits"},{"id":"money/pensions","webTitle":"Pensions"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"politics/thinktanks","webTitle":"Thinktanks"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/03/inheritance-tax-giveaway-welfare-cuts-budget-conservatives-george-osborne","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aca4","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jul/03/inheritance-tax-giveaway-welfare-cuts-budget-conservatives-george-osborne","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/03/inheritance-tax-giveaway-welfare-cuts-budget-conservatives-george-osborne"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/630e08bc50b93d437d8b882bfa78a17870c4d3a7/0_217_1905_1142/1905.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1142,"width":1905,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The chancellor, George Osborne, first pledged to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £1m while in opposition.

In their pre-election manifesto, the Conservative party promised that if re-elected they would restrict pension contribution allowances for those earning over &pound;150,000.</p> \n<p>There has been growing speculation about how this would be done and when it would be introduced.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday the government posted a <a href=\"http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN05901/SN05901.pdf\">briefing paper about restricting pension tax relief on its website</a> (pdf), which industry experts believe increases the chances pension pots will be targeted. </p> \n<p> “We were fairly sure that there would be a tax relief change in the budget and this has increased the chances greatly,” said Tom McPhail , head of pensions at financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown. </p> \n<p>“Our great concern is that the government will simply cap tax breaks for higher earners. This would do nothing for the vast majority of the population except make the pension system marginally more complicated than it already is.” </p> \n<p>The government has previously said its favoured approach is to hit pension tax relief by progressively reducing the annual allowance at a rate of &pound;1 for every &pound;2 earned over &pound;150,000, until it hits &pound;10,000. </p> \n<p>At present, anyone contributing to a pension is entitled to tax relief on contributions of up to &pound;40,000 a year.</p> \n<p> “The potential cost to someone earning &pound;210,000 or more could be &pound;13,500 in lost tax relief,” McPhail said. </p> \n<p>There has been mounting criticism of this policy with some, including former pensions minister Steve Webb, calling for a flat rate tax relief for everyone of 33%. This would benefit lower earners who contribute to their pension while at the same time reducing relief for the very highest earners. </p> \n<p>Speaking at a recent industry event Webb described the government proposals to taper tax relief for those who <a href=\"http://citywire.co.uk/money/tory-pension-tax-relief-plans-branded-bonkers/a823030\">earn between &pound;150,000 and &pound;210,000 as “bonkers”</a>. </p> \n<p>“Think through the logic,” he said. “Say they do it from 2016-17. So it is the amount you earn in 2016-17 that determines your annual allowance in 2016-17, but at the start of 2016-17 you don’t know what you are going to earn in 2016-17.</p> \n<p>“So presumably they wait till you have your tax return which you’re filing in January 2017-18, then they finalise your income for 2016-17 in the spring of 2018. Then do they decide your annual allowance after all in 2016-17 was &pound;10,000 not &pound;40,000? That would be ludicrous.”</p> \n<p>It is thought that on Wednesday the government may also publish initial statistics on the take-up of the Pension Wise service, which has been running since April to offer guidance to people over 55 considering taking their money from their pension pot under the new pension freedoms. </p> \n<p>The Financial Conduct Authority has said that of calls made by savers to their pension providers about the changes, 16% are being abandoned by consumers.</p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435923952968/31526d9f-634e-40f8-8285-e2fef2d76c35-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Toby Melville/Reuters","altText":"champagne glasses","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T12:11:34Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T23:08:05Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Lisa Bachelor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/lisabachelor"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Tax","Money","Budget 2015 (July)","Budget","UK news","George Osborne","Politics"],"tags":[{"id":"money/tax","webTitle":"Tax"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"},{"id":"uk-news/budget-2015-july","webTitle":"Budget 2015 (July)"},{"id":"uk/budget","webTitle":"Budget"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/georgeosborne","webTitle":"George Osborne"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"}],"section":{"id":"money"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Lisa Bachelor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/lisabachelor"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"money"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/jul/03/top-earners-set-to-lose-13500-in-tax-relief-in-george-osbornes-budget","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4abq5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/money/2015/jul/03/top-earners-set-to-lose-13500-in-tax-relief-in-george-osbornes-budget","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jul/03/top-earners-set-to-lose-13500-in-tax-relief-in-george-osbornes-budget"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435923952968/31526d9f-634e-40f8-8285-e2fef2d76c35-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"High earners may not be celebrating after Wednesday’s budget, which is expected to cut tax relief.

Now they use banks” – said Greece’s long-flourishing street art scene had exploded since the crisis began.</p> \n<p>“Partly it was because of this big wave of anger that started in 2008 and just grew and grew,” he said. “But also, as the crisis got worse, there were more and more closed shops and empty buildings. There were a lot of walls to paint.”</p> \n<p>The two artists survive by selling the odd resolutely non-political artwork, often to tourists, and frequently have to scrounge or improvise for paint and materials. “We don’t sell our beliefs,” Cacao said. “We don’t want to make money out of saying austerity is unjust and clearly isn’t working.” </p> \n<p>Other artists have adopted different media. Since 2014, Stefanos, a 29-year-old graphic artist in Athens who did not want to give his surname, has been turning every euro banknote he can find into <a href=\"http://banknotes.gr/\">an illustrated affirmation</a> of what he sees as the currency’s evils.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e77c76bdba43379cb6978d12a6b5afa243404634\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e77c76bdba43379cb6978d12a6b5afa243404634/0_0_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"‘Then they used tanks.

Passers-by, one a child, look up at the swinging corpse, aghast.</p> \n<p>On a €5 bill, the grim reaper stands beneath a more classical temple, hooded and menacing, scythe in hand. And with boots and hammers, a small crowd are merrily smashing the leaded gothic windows on a €20 note.</p> \n<p>Each drawing, in black ballpoint, is inspired by a headline: a suicide (of which there are now <a href=\"http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2015/06/25/study-austerity-in-greece-led-to-tragic-increase-of-35-in-suicides-in-just-two-years/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+KeepTalkingGreece+%28Keep+Talking+Greece%29\">an estimated 35% more in Greece</a> thanin 2010), a riot, demonstration, act of violence or despair, a story of poverty or deprivation.</p> \n<p>“Whenever I read an article like that, I transfer the message to the medium,” Stefanos said. “By hacking the banknotes, I’m using a pan-European document to spread my imagery across borders.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We should get out of the euro.

I use notes from my salary, family, friends, colleagues”. Once illustrated, he scans each one and uploads the result to <a href=\"http://banknotes.gr/\">his website</a>, then puts the note back into circulation.</p> \n<p>“It is quite a quick act,” he said, “and the drawings in most cases are small. I don’t know what happens to them afterwards; spending a note is an act of infinite possibilities and directions.”</p> \n<p>But they are out there, doing their work. For Stefanos, eurozone policy, decided by an elite for the whole union, “may once have looked necessary to contain and recover from economic instability – but it is clearly not working”.</p> \n<p>Stefanos feels the institutions’ objectives are “doomed to fail – that’s not a matter of an opinion, it is proved by the data. Enforcing austerity cannot be sustained any longer.

And what the institutions are doing to us – yes, we over-borrowed; yes, we had corrupt politicians – but is it really right to make the people pay like this?”</p> \n<p>Fokianaki had no doubt about how she would vote on Sunday. “It’s a question of human dignity now,” she said. “We should get out of the euro. It may mean a year or so of suffering, but we’ll bounce back.”<br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/6dd9eeaee84ddcf267c77f8910a5b5611148a68c/0_0_3211_1926/3211.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1926,"width":3211,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters","altText":"Athens N€IN mural","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/c4d961f09f5a5fd365658aa67da5e128533f62aa/0_0_4252_2552/4252.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2552,"width":4252,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A graffiti by Greek street artist Cacao Rocks pictured on a street in Athens.

Travel companies are encouraging holidaymakers to go ahead with their trips as planned, saying there will be very little effect on them, and that it’s business as usual in the country’s holiday resorts.</p> \n<p>Travellers should take enough cash with them to cover all costs, and not rely on ATMs. Although the €60 ATM withdrawal limit is restricted to Greek residents only and ATMs are functioning, there are mixed reports of cash availability.</p> \n<p>Some operators advised taking at least two forms of payment, such as travellers’ cheques or pre-loaded cash cards, as well as credit and debit cards (which are still being accepted).</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/jun/29/tourists-to-greece-cash-withdrawl\">A few operators are providing special services to reassure and aid travellers.</a> Olympic Holidays and Ionian Holidays are letting people buy cash directly from resort reps using their credit or debit cards.

Customers travelling to Tunisia in this period will be given the opportunity to amend their holidays free of charge to any of our destinations, or receive a full refund. Furthermore, customers planning to travel to Tunisia at any time up until the end of the summer season (31 October) will be able to amend their holidays free of charge to any of our destinations.” The alternatives include 15 new flight destinations, such as the Balearic Islands, mainland Spain, Cape Verde and Cyprus, and those swapping to these new options are to get an extra &pound;50 discount.</p> \n<p>Easyjet had launched a new flight route to Monastir on the Tunisian coast, 40 minutes’ drive south from Sousse, on 2 June, from Stansted. Passengers who are due to travel to Monastir and who booked on or before 26 June can obtain a free flight transfer on any date and on any route, or a flight voucher to the value of their unused flights.</p> \n<h2><strong>France</strong></h2> \n<p>Strikes caused chaos for travel on Le Shuttle and Eurostar last week, and there was still <a href=\"http://www.eurotunnel.com/uk/traveller-info/latest/\">some disruption at the time of going to press</a>, though the passenger service was running to schedule (see <a href=\"http://www.eurotunnel.com/uk/traveller-info/latest/\">eurotunnel.com</a>) for updates. The M20 had been affected, check for updates at <a href=\"http://www.highways.gov.uk/news/breaking-news/\">highways.gov.uk</a>.</p> \n<p>However, tourism to Britain’s favourite country does not seem to be suffering. Marine Catalogna, press officer for <a href=\"http://atout-france.fr/\">Atout France</a>, the French tourist board, said: “We have not noticed any slowdown of enquiries in the past two weeks - people have asked for practical tips, or needed reassurance, but no one has mentioned not going. With the exchange rate very much in favour of sterling, we are positive France will remain a favourite this summer.”</p> \n<p>Ferry companies, including Brittany Ferries, said they had seen a boost in bookings last week as people were worried about travelling through the Eurotunnel. Many overnight bookings for this week are now fully booked, said a Brittany Ferries spokesperson.</p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Travellers to all destinations are strongly advised to take out travel insurance in case they need to cancel their trip for any reason</strong><em> </em></p>","section":"Travel","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435943649934/2c6215fb-2083-4e20-8493-7f10469cf0b2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Skiathos, Greece","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435943863736/08bf2c0f-3293-44b1-bdbf-3be78a3aa332-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Old monastery in Monastir.

Iran and six major powers, led by the US, have given themselves until Tuesday night to complete the deal. After that they could face increased intervention by the Republican majority in the US Congress, who are hostile to a compromise with Iran that would leave it with part of its nuclear infrastructure intact.</p> \n<p>“Some stubbornly believe that military and economic coercion can ensure submission. They still insist on spending other people’s money or sacrificing other people’s children for their own delusional designs,” Zarif <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ali.jusefi.7#\">said in the video</a>, which was recorded on Thursday on a balcony of the Palais Coburg Hotel in Vienna where the talks are under way.</p> \n<p>“I see hope, because I see emergence of reason over illusion. I sense that my negotiating partners have recognised that coercion and pressure never lead to lasting solutions, but to more conflict and further hostility.”</p> \n<p>Zarif then pressed an increasingly important theme coming from Tehran – the possibility of joint action against Islamic State extremists in Syria and Iraq once the 13-year standoff over Iran’s nuclear aspirations is resolved. </p> \n<p>“We are ready to strike a balanced and good deal, and open new horizons to address important, common challenges. Our common threat today is the growing menace of violent extremism and outright barbarism,” Zarif said. </p> \n<p>“The menace we’re facing – and I say we, because no one is spared – is embodied by the hooded men who are ravaging the cradle of civilization. To deal with this new challenge new approaches are badly needed.” </p> \n<p>On Thursday, a senior Iranian <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/07/nuclear-deal-iran-us-cooperation-opportunities.html\">official told journalists</a>: “I can tell you that if we cut a deal on the nuclear issue, there will be opportunities in the future for both Iran and the United States.”</p> \n<p>Other foreign ministers, including Britain’s Philip Hammond and France’s Laurent Fabius, are expected to rejoin the negotiations on Sunday. Meanwhile the talks are being led by Zarif and the US secretary of state, John Kerry. </p> \n<p>Before the two men met on Friday, Kerry told journalists: “We had our teams working very, very hard and very diligently all day in order to maximize progress. And I think it’s fair to say that both sides are working extremely hard with great sense of purpose in a good-faith effort to make progress, and we are making progress.</p> \n<p>“So we have a lot of work to do, we’ve got some tough issues, but there’s a genuine effort by everybody to be serious about this and to understand the time constraints that we’re working under. So we will continue to work – tonight, tomorrow, Sunday – and we certainly both want to try to see if we can arrive at a conclusion.” </p> \n<p>A senior US official, talking to journalists after the Zarif video was aired, described the talks as being “in the end game” but said the negotiations were focuses exclusively on nuclear issues, not questions of possible future cooperation.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/ba176036fef4f72260510e3e37dfbae8c7e47b7d/0_0_2250_1349/2250.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1349,"width":2250,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Leonhard Foeger/Reuters","altText":"Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif on the balcony of Palais Coburg hotel, the venue for nuclear talks in Vienna.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Leonhard Foeger/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T21:30:51Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T21:39:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":100,"contributors":[{"name":"Julian Borger","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741281/JulianBorger.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/julianborger"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Iran","World news","Syria","US news","Nuclear weapons","Nuclear power","Austria","Europe","Middle East and North Africa"],"tags":[{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/nuclear-weapons","webTitle":"Nuclear weapons"},{"id":"environment/nuclearpower","webTitle":"Nuclear power"},{"id":"world/austria","webTitle":"Austria"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Julian Borger","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/julianborger"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/03/iranian-foreign-minister-raises-prospect-of-joint-action-against-islamic-state","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4acde","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/03/iranian-foreign-minister-raises-prospect-of-joint-action-against-islamic-state","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/03/iranian-foreign-minister-raises-prospect-of-joint-action-against-islamic-state"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/ba176036fef4f72260510e3e37dfbae8c7e47b7d/0_0_2250_1349/2250.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1349,"width":2250,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on the balcony of Palais Coburg hotel, the venue for nuclear talks in Vienna.

One phoned and another used a social media platform to tell the loved ones the news that they have been dreading. At the request of their families, the Guardian is not naming the married pair.</p> \n<p>Their families are said be be distraught at the news and have been clinging to the hope their daughters would want to come home.<br /></p> \n<p>The schoolgirls say that they have been separated and have been living apart for several weeks, in and around Raqqa, Syria – an Isis stronghold.</p> \n<p>The two schoolgirls have been living with the men whom they married in a ceremony approved by Isis authorities.</p> \n<p>The two schoolgirls are understood to have been given an effective “catalogue” of men deemed suitable by Isis for marriage. They then made their picks from those presented to them. The teenagers who married are believed to have been wed to older men, in their 20s.</p> \n<p>Tasnime Akunjee, a solicitor representing the families, said the families were grieving at the news of the marriages, as told to them by their daughters: “It has caused a lot of distress. It entrenches their lives in Syria, rather than in Britain. It erodes significantly hopes that they will come back.”</p> \n<p>The girls initially lived together in Raqqa. They plotted the trip together, drawing up a shopping list of items to take with them.</p> \n<p>They had all been gifted students at the Bethnal Green academy in east London, before being lured by Isis propaganda.</p> \n<p>They fled on 17 February while they were on a half-term break, taking a flight from Gatwick to Turkey, which borders Syria.

All three of the women shown in the video are unidentifiable because they are wearing burqas.</p> \n<p>The video, which was taken by a group that says it opposes Isis, was shot eight weeks ago. Six weeks ago, the families’s lawyer was approached by another media organisation about whether the people featured in it were the London teenagers.</p> \n<p>Akunjee said: “At the time the video was shot, two of the girls are known to be married and separated from their friends from east London.</p> \n<p>“The families think the video is unlikely to be them. All three are living apart and those who are married are under the aegis of their husbands and are unlikely to be under the aegis of some woman leader.”</p> \n<p>The Metropolitan police did not confirm any knowledge of the girls’ whereabouts, but said that its investigation into the three girls – plus a fourth student from the same school who went missing previously – was ongoing.“The investigation into all of the missing girls continues. It remains a priority to try to prevent people travelling to join terrorist groups whether they be determined terrorists, radicalised individuals or vulnerable teenagers. We will continue to work with our partners and the authorities to combat this risk and prevent tragedies,” it said.</p> \n<p>The group that took the video, called Eye on Homeland, said when the girls arrived in Raqqa, they were locked in a compound for widows and would-be jihadi brides, while their loyalty to the terrorist group was tested.</p> \n<p>The group claimed the girls were forbidden to leave the building without their chaperone, a woman handler known as Um Laith – “Mother of the Lion” – tasked with “purifying their western minds” by instilling the practices of the caliphate.</p> \n<p>In March, Scotland Yard commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the teenagers could return home without fear of being prosecuted for terrorism, as long as no evidence emerged of them being engaged in violence.</p> \n<p>Their families believe police kept crucial information from them that could have alerted them to the fact they were in danger of being lured by the terrorists. Police have apologised.</p> \n<p>The head of counter terrorism for Scotland Yard, assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, said in March: “We have no evidence in this case that these three girls are responsible for any terrorist offences. They have no reason to fear, if nothing else comes to light, that we will be treating them as terrorists.”</p> \n<p>Rowley said the three girls were different to someone “running around in northern Iraq and Syria with Kalashnikovs”, who then apologised for having committed terrorist offences.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d5366026e826fd74b95f5d83f01cae3a2572a791/117_0_1193_716/1193.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":716,"width":1193,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"LONDON METROPLITAN POLICE / HANDOUT/EPA","altText":"Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase","cleanCredit":"Photograph: LONDON METROPLITAN POLICE / HANDOUT/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T23:22:57Z","lastModified":"2015-07-04T00:20:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":840,"contributors":[{"name":"Vikram Dodd","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/vikramdodd"},{"name":"Nadia Khomami","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/8/1428480381597/Nadia-Khomami-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nadia-khomami"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Islamic State","UK news","London","World news","Syria","Middle East and North Africa"],"tags":[{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/04/two-bethnal-green-schoolgirls-now-married-isis-men-syria","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aceg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/04/two-bethnal-green-schoolgirls-now-married-isis-men-syria","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/04/two-bethnal-green-schoolgirls-now-married-isis-men-syria"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d5366026e826fd74b95f5d83f01cae3a2572a791/117_0_1193_716/1193.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":716,"width":1193,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"From left: Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, the three schoolgirls who have apparently been separated now for several weeks.

We will still be having a security presence in Golders Green just in case anybody does turn up.</p> \n<p>“We are not aware of any plans to do so, but we are covering all eventualities.” </p> \n<p>Protesters are to hold a counter demonstration to the neo-Nazi event in the same street – Richmond Terrace in Whitehall. <br /></p> \n<p>They noted that “an appropriate policing plan is in place for these events” and they have also spoken to businesses in the West End about all the events which are planned. </p> \n<p>The Met decided to impose conditions under the Public Order Act 1986, including moving the original demonstration, saying “the presence of this protest group, and resultant counter-protests by opposition groups in the same area at the same time, is likely to result in serious disorder, serious disruption to the life of the community and the intimidation of others”. </p> \n<p>They stated that the police did not have the legal power to ban a static protest, have a duty to safeguard the right to protest and could not impose unreasonable restrictions upon that right. </p> \n<p>The outrage sparked by the plans for the original neo-Nazi demonstration quickly led to a campaign dubbed Golders Green Together. </p> \n<p>It was set up by the <a href=\"http://londonjewishforum.org.uk/\">London Jewish Forum</a> and advocacy group <a href=\"http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/\">HOPE not hate</a>, after the neo-Nazis announced their intention to hold a rally in the north-west London suburb to protest against its “jewification”. </p> \n<p>Over recent weeks it has leafleted the area, lobbied MPs and the police and urged local shops to drape their properties with gold and green banners and ribbons as a symbol of defiance. </p> \n<p>Rich said: “For neo-Nazis to hold an explicitly anti-Jewish demonstration in Golders Green, in the heart of the Jewish community, on a Saturday – the Sabbath, when Jewish people would be going to and from the synagogue – would obviously be intimidatory and cause offence, which is probably what it was intended to do.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b7a7e3da03fef3f959fca8a50cc41c7d77d4d423/0_798_2000_1200/2000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1200,"width":2000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graeme Robertson for the Guardian","altText":"A swastika is daubed on a Jewish gravestone","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-04T06:00:06Z","lastModified":"2015-07-04T06:00:06Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Judaism","London","Metropolitan police","Police","UK news","The far right","Religion"],"tags":[{"id":"world/judaism","webTitle":"Judaism"},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London"},{"id":"uk/metropolitan-police","webTitle":"Metropolitan police"},{"id":"uk/police","webTitle":"Police"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/far-right","webTitle":"The far right"},{"id":"world/religion","webTitle":"Religion"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/04/jewish-security-officials-prepare-themselves-for-neo-nazi-rally","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4acep","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/04/jewish-security-officials-prepare-themselves-for-neo-nazi-rally","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/04/jewish-security-officials-prepare-themselves-for-neo-nazi-rally"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b7a7e3da03fef3f959fca8a50cc41c7d77d4d423/0_798_2000_1200/2000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1200,"width":2000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A swastika is daubed on a Jewish gravestone in London.
