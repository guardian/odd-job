The wording of the question has not been finalised but the “yes” option is likely to be to stay part of the EU.</p> \n<p>Other key legislation includes:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>A five-year lock on tax rises including VAT, income tax and national insurance</li> \n <li>No income tax for those working 30 hours a week on the minimum wage</li> \n <li>The extension of right to buy to housing association tenants</li> \n <li>Further Scottish devolution and measures that will give English MPs more say over laws that only affect England</li> \n <li>A counter-extremism bill to tackle radicalisation</li> \n <li>A blanket ban on so-called legal highs</li> \n <li>An increase in free childcare for three- and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week</li> \n <li>Reform of strike laws to require a higher turnout of union members</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Cameron said his legislative programme would mean “wherever you live, you can have the chance of a good education, a decent job, a home of your own and the peace of mind that comes from being able to raise a family and enjoy a secure retirement”.</p> \n<p>However, it is the omission of any proposed legislation to scrap the current human rights laws that will be the biggest surprise. The proposals will be on hold until Michael Gove, the justice secretary, has conducted a wider consultation.</p> \n<p>Although the government has an overall majority of 12 seats in the Commons, Cameron is massively outnumbered in the House of Lords, and his whips will have to be alert to any signs of rebellions by backbench MPs, possibly made restive by the prime minister’s promotion of an insufficiently ambitious EU renegotiation agenda.</p> \n<p>Ministers acknowledge that a conflict over the Human Rights Act may prove to be one of the most difficult politically, legally and intellectually for the Tories.</p> \n<p>In an attempt to rally his demoralised party, Clegg was due to attack Cameron for his approach to human rights in the Commons after the Queen’s speech. “The Liberal Democrats worked hard to ensure the coalition government’s agenda had a clear thread of liberalism running through it – from the priority we gave to mental health and the green agenda, to creating the pupil premium and protecting our civil liberties,” he said.</p> \n<p>“So it is dispiriting – if pretty unsurprising – to see how quickly, instead of building on those achievements, the new Conservative government is turning its back on that liberal stance. <a>The human rights we hold dear, our right to privacy in an online age, our future as an open-minded, outward-looking country, are all hanging in the balance again because of the measures being announced by the Conservative government.”</a></p> \n<p>Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, had signalled his determination to make the Human Rights Act a central part of Labour opposition to the Queen’s speech if he was successful in his bid for the party leadership. He said he hoped Labour “throws the kitchen sink” at opposing the measures.</p>","section":"Law","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/c472d02589a94aaf9eaec7441260c2760c272519/962_137_1985_1191/1985.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1191,"width":1985,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA","altText":"David Cameron has faced criticism from his backbenchers, Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems on human rights law proposals.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-27T07:54:21Z","lastModified":"2015-05-27T08:29:55Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":71,"contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Wintour","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/4/1423058528318/Patrick-Wintour-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patrickwintour"},{"name":"Rowena Mason","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899403654/Rowena-Mason-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rowena-mason"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Human Rights Act","Human rights","Law","EU referendum","Queen's speech","Politics","UK news","David Cameron","Conservatives"],"tags":[{"id":"law/human-rights-act","webTitle":"Human Rights Act"},{"id":"law/human-rights","webTitle":"Human rights"},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law"},{"id":"politics/eu-referendum","webTitle":"EU referendum"},{"id":"politics/queens-speech","webTitle":"Queen's speech"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"}],"section":{"id":"law"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"law"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/law/2015/may/27/david-cameron-delay-scrap-human-rights-act-queen-speech","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/499xz","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/law/2015/may/27/david-cameron-delay-scrap-human-rights-act-queen-speech","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/may/27/david-cameron-delay-scrap-human-rights-act-queen-speech"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/c472d02589a94aaf9eaec7441260c2760c272519/962_137_1985_1191/1985.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1191,"width":1985,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"David Cameron has faced criticism from his backbenchers, Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems on human rights law proposals.

That remark spurred hope among progressive Catholics that the church was entering a new era of tolerance and acceptance of homosexuality.</p> \n<p>For some, that hope has been dashed by an ongoing <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/10/vatican-suspected-rejecting-approval-gay-french-ambassador-laurent-stefanini\">controversy involving a French diplomat</a> and practising Catholic named Laurent Stefanini, who is gay. The Vatican has refused to accept Stefanini’s nomination as France’s ambassador to the Holy See because of his sexual orientation, according to media reports in France and Italy.</p> \n<p>The Vatican has declined to comment on the matter, but there has been speculation in recent weeks that the pope could make an abrupt change and accept the nomination, after all. The Vatican recently told the Guardian that any news on the appointment would be made available on the Vatican’s bulletin, where such appointments are usually publicised.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday night, Parolin said the dialogue between the Vatican and France was continuing in regard to the controversial nomination, and that he hoped it would come to a conclusion in a “positive manner”.</p> \n<p>Parolin’s remarks on the Irish vote are significant given the broader role Parolin plays in crafting the church’s message on major diplomatic and social issues.</p> \n<p>At the time of his appointment in 2013, veteran Vatican reporter John Allen wrote in the National Catholic Reporter that Parolin had been “on the frontlines of shaping the Vatican’s response to virtually every geopolitical challenge of the past two decades”.</p> \n<p>Among other issues, the Italian cardinal has been an outspoken advocate for action to combat global warming. In recent remarks, he denounced the “globalisation of indifference and the economy of exclusion” that has put the planet in peril.</p> \n<p>He has also been the public face of Francis’s diplomatic efforts, including the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/dec/17/us-cuba-pope-franicis-key-roles\">church’s role in helping Cuba and the US</a> restore diplomatic ties.</p> \n<p>But on Tuesday, with his choice of words, Parolin differed from the pope in one respect: the Argentinian pontiff has also used the phrase <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.news.va/en/news/francis-war-is-always-a-defeat-for-humanity\">“defeat for humanity”</a>, but he was talking about war, not the legalisation of gay marriage.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432673360232/745f1a7a-60e9-4a81-a7d7-d0fad28f5c39-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sylvain Sonnet/Getty Images","altText":"Rome and Vatican City","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sylvain Sonnet/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-26T20:57:18Z","lastModified":"2015-05-27T07:14:52Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2087,"contributors":[{"name":"Stephanie Kirchgaessner","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stephanie-kirchgaessner"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Vatican","Gay marriage","Ireland","Catholicism","Christianity","Europe","Italy","Marriage","Religion","Sexuality","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/vatican","webTitle":"Vatican"},{"id":"society/gay-marriage","webTitle":"Gay marriage"},{"id":"world/ireland","webTitle":"Ireland"},{"id":"world/catholicism","webTitle":"Catholicism"},{"id":"world/christianity","webTitle":"Christianity"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/italy","webTitle":"Italy"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/marriage","webTitle":"Marriage"},{"id":"world/religion","webTitle":"Religion"},{"id":"society/sexuality","webTitle":"Sexuality"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Stephanie Kirchgaessner","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stephanie-kirchgaessner"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/26/vatican-ireland-gay-marriage-referendum-vote-defeat-for-humanity","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/498n9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/may/26/vatican-ireland-gay-marriage-referendum-vote-defeat-for-humanity","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/vatican-ireland-gay-marriage-referendum-vote-defeat-for-humanity"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432673360232/745f1a7a-60e9-4a81-a7d7-d0fad28f5c39-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The remarks by the Vatican’s top diplomat represent the most damning assessment of the Irish gay marriage vote by a senior church official to date.

If approved, the drug, called T-VEC, could be more widely available for cancer patients by next year, scientists predicted.</p> \n<p>Crucially, the therapy has the potential to overcome cancer even when the disease has spread to organs throughout the body, offering hope in future to patients who have been faced with the bleakest prognosis.</p> \n<p>Kevin Harrington, professor of biological cancer therapies at the Institute of Cancer Research London, who led the work, said: “This is the big promise of this treatment. It’s the first time a virotherapy has been shown to be successful in a phase 3 trial.”</p> \n<p>In the trial, involving more than 400 patients with aggressive melanoma, one in four patients responded to the treatment, and 16% were still in remission after six months. About 10% of the patients treated had “complete remission”, with no detectable cancer remaining - considered a cure if the patient is still cancer-free five years after diagnosis.</p> \n<p>The results are especially encouraging, Harrington said, because all the patients had inoperable, relapsed or metastatic melanoma with no conventional treatment options available to them. “They had disease that ranged from dozens to hundreds of deposits of melanoma on a limb all the way to patients where cancer had spread to the lungs and liver,” he said.</p> \n<p>The treatment works by mounting a two-pronged attack on cancer. It is based on a genetically “neutered” version of the herpes virus, which has been modified to stop it producing the protein that allows it to infect healthy cells. Cancer cells then produce their own version of the blocked protein, filling in the deficit and allowing the modified virus to thrive within cancerous tissue. </p> \n<p>The herpes multiplies vigorously inside the cancer cells until they burst open, spilling the virus into the surrounding area, triggering a secondary immune reaction against the tumour.</p> \n<p>Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, said: “We may normally think of viruses as the enemies of mankind, but it’s their very ability to specifically infect and kill human cells that can make them such promising cancer treatments. In this case we are harnessing the ability of an engineered virus to kill cancer cells and stimulate an immune response.”</p> \n<p>Once the immune system has been nudged into action by the T-VEC treatment, it appears to develop an enhanced ability to detect and attack cancer throughout the body. Scientists are not sure why this happens, but the latest trial confirmed the effect, showing that even secondary tumours that had not been infected by the virus shrank or disappeared.</p> \n<p>“It’s like an unmasking of the cancer,” said Harrington. “The patient’s immune system wakes up and attacks the cancer cells wherever they are in the body.”</p> \n<p>The therapy is given by injection and in the trial patients received a dose every two weeks for up to 18 months. The side-effects tend to be far milder than chemotherapy drugs, with patients typically experiencing mild flu-like symptoms after the first few injections.</p> \n<p>Dr Hayley Frend, science information manager at Cancer Research UK, said: “Using a virus to both kill cancer cells and nudge the immune system into attacking them is exciting. Previous studies have shown T-VEC could benefit some people with advanced skin cancer, but this is the first study to prove an increase in survival.”</p> \n<p>Patients with stage III and early stage IV melanoma treated with T-VEC (163 people in total) lived an average of 41 months, the trial found. This compared with an average survival of 21.5 months in the 66 earlier-stage patients who received the control treatment.</p> \n<p>Rather than the traditional clinical trial, where a drug is compared to a placebo, the control group were given a protein designed to stimulate the immune response against cancer, but without the virus component of the treatment.</p> \n<p>The drug, developed by the company Amgen, has been submitted to both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, and could be available to US patients by next year if approved, and in Europe soon afterwards. Similar treatments are also being trialled for head and neck cancers</p> \n<p>More than 13,000 people are diagnosed with malignant melanoma skin cancer each year in the UK, and about 88% of patients survive for more than five years. However, the survival rates for aggressive forms of skin cancer and when the cancer has spread to other organs are far worse.</p> \n<p>The possibility that viruses could be harnessed to tackle cancer was first raised in the early twentieth century, when doctors noted that cancer patients who caught measles, hepatitis or glandular fever occasionally underwent a temporary recovery. During an early trial in 1949, patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma were injected with viral hepatitis. One patient died and 13 contracted hepatitis, but seven experienced temporary remission. </p> \n<p>Genetic engineering, which has allowed scientists to create safe versions of natural viruses has led to a revival of the concept, and trials of virotherapies based on infections including herpes, measles and vaccinia (which was used in the smallpox vaccine) are currently underway.</p> \n<p>The findings are published today in the <a href=\"http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/early/2015/05/22/JCO.2014.58.3377.abstract?sid=25367564-a56b-46d4-b1d0-c0af42ba0d65\">Journal of Clinical Oncology</a>.</p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432661772978/027c064a-7917-4140-b78b-684781b0ceab-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Bernhard Classen/Alamy","altText":"A 3D model of virus particles.

We’ve been here before | Danny Dorling</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The &pound;6.3bn write-off for the cost of paying interest on a buy-to-let mortgage is the largest of its kind since the Bank of England cut interest rates to 0.5% following the 2008 financial crisis.</p> \n<p>Mortgage interest relief at source (Miras) was introduced in 1983 to encourage home ownership, but was abolished in 2000 by then chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown, who described it as “a middle-class perk”. However, landlords continue to be able to claim mortgage interest as a business expense. Critics of the expanding buy-to-let market have long warned that such tax breaks give landlords a considerable financial advantage over ordinary homeowners.</p> \n<p>Seb Klier, policy manager of Generation Rent, which campaigns for the rights of those privately renting, said: “When you get a taxpayer subsidy to borrow money, it’s no surprise that more people are choosing to invest in property instead of, say, buying shares in companies, which actually create jobs.</p> \n<p>“The tax system also puts landlords at an advantage over potential owner occupiers when competing for the limited supply of houses and it’s those thwarted first-time buyers who end up paying off the mortgage anyway in rents.</p> \n<p>“We need to stop subsidising property investment and use that money to build more homes instead.”</p> \n<p>Richard Lambert, chief executive of the National Association of Landlords, denied that his members enjoyed unreasonable tax privileges.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Letting out property is a business like any other, and is therefore treated and taxed as such</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Richard Lambert, National Association of Landlords</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“Letting out property is a business like any other and is therefore treated and taxed as such, rather than as an investment,” he said. “Landlords are required to pay tax on the profit they make and, like any other business, are entitled to offset their costs incurred from the day-to-day running of the property against tax. They don’t receive any special subsidies compared with other businesses.”</p> \n<p>Lambert said successive governments believed treating landlords as businesses encouraged better practice across the rental sector, and said NLA research found 23% of landlords with a single property either broke even or made a loss.</p> \n<p>“To discriminate against landlords and remove these reliefs, which are offered to other businesses, would cut a swath through their profitability calculations and prompt many to sell up and invest elsewhere. That would mean even higher rents for those forced to chase after a shrinking pool of rented housing,” he warned.</p> \n<p>Data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders indicated that<a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/money/2015/mar/17/mortgages-to-landlords-rise-as-first-time-mortgages-plummet\"> landlords were granted nearly as many mortgages as first-time buyers</a> in January.</p> \n<p>In April, analysis by Wriglesworth Consultancy for the lender Landbay found <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/apr/11/buy-to-let-landlords-earn-returns-of-up-to-1400-since-1996\">landlords had enjoyed returns of 1,400% since 1996</a>, far in excess of the rewards offered by shares, bonds or cash. </p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432647925303/f2f37a41-46f3-41ad-a851-7b86e75ce87c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christopher Furlong/Getty","altText":"To Let signs n the Selly Oak area of Birmingham.

A further 18 hours of evidence-giving has been planned, with detectives considering taking her back to Cannock Chase where she was abused over 20 years ago.</p> \n<p>The 32-year-old broke her silence in <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/1490575/politician-abused-me-regularly-survivor-says\">an interview with Sky News</a> on Tuesday morning. Since it aired, she has been inundated with support from fellow child abuse survivors.</p> \n<p>Baker told the Guardian she was first abused by the politician when she was around six years old. Working with police, she has established that the abuse continued until she was at least 11.</p> \n<p>Detectives have been told that the politician, who is still alive and of the current political era, would make her sit on his knee while she played the piano and on other occasions sexually abused her on Cannock Chase fields. He cannot be named for legal reasons.</p> \n<p>She says she believes a lord and a judge were also involved because their titles would be mentioned while the attacks were taking place. “I was brought up in a religious household and ... I thought they were on God’s authority,” she said.</p> \n<p>“I knew they were important but I always thought they were more important in the church. That’s what I related it to at the time. But I knew there were ones that were more special than others.”</p> \n<p>A small group of police officers, some uniformed, stood guard while the abuse was taking place, she said, and other times they would join in. One of the officers she recognised from church.</p> \n<p>On one occasion Baker tried to flee the abuse but was chased and caught by one of the officers standing guard. He told her he was sorry, she said, but still took her back to where the attacks were taking place.</p> \n<p>She now believes the officers could hold vital information about the abuse meted out to children in Cannock Chase.<br /></p> \n<p>Asked whether she had a message for other child abuse survivors and witnesses, she said: “Just that it’s time to come forward. If we all come forward then they can’t stop us now. They could back then but they can’t now if we all come forward.”</p> \n<p>In a highly unorthodox statement, Jon Drake, assistant chief constable of Staffordshire police, underlined how seriously the force was taking Baker’s allegations when he said officers recognised “the horrific nature of what we are investigating”.<br /></p> \n<p>He said: “Staffordshire police is in the early stages of investigating a number of very serious allegations from the 1980s and 90s. Specially trained officers are carrying out a number of interviews with the victim to build up an understanding of what took place, and her recollections of all those involved.”</p> \n<p>Drake said detectives were determined to thoroughly gather any evidence that would help bring offenders to justice. He added: “To be clear, regardless of role, anyone who has been involved in criminal offences will be investigated to provide justice for the victim.</p> \n<p>“Child abuse is a terrible crime, whenever it occurs.

The victory has triggered a humanitarian crisis, due to the flight of thousands of residents.</p> \n<p>A series of public statements by senior officials in Washington and the Middle East have highlighted disagreements between the US, Iraq and Iran.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, General James Clapper, the director of US national intelligence, <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/homeland-security/james-clapper-global-intelligence-challenges/p36195\">told Congress</a> that officials now believed that 3,400 citizens from western nations, including 150 from the US, had travelled to Iraq and Syria to join violent militant groups.</p> \n<p>More than 700 British extremists are thought to have travelled to Syria – with about half returning to the UK.</p> \n<p>The new report describes Iraq, Syria and Libya as a “veritable finishing school” for terrorists and mentions Tunisia, Morocco, France and the Russian federation as particularly vulnerable to future attacks due to the number of fighters from there.</p> \n<p>“Those that have returned or will return to their states of origin or to third countries may pose a continuing threat to national and international security,” the report said.</p> \n<p>“Many may reintegrate, abandoning violence.

His wife had fled to Syria days before the attack.</p> \n<p>Isis has repeatedly called on Muslims living in the west to mount “freelance” or “lone wolf” operations.</p> \n<p>Alexander Evans, lead UN expert on al-Qaida and Isis, said there was a danger that the international community was becoming too focused on Syria, Iraq and Libya.</p> \n<p>“The risk of people going and people returning is wider,” Evans said.</p> \n<p>Afghan security forces estimated in March 2015 that about 6,500 foreign terrorist fighters were active in Afghanistan, the report notes.
