The London theatres are closed by the plague. The voice of the male actor playing Juliet cracks just as he is about to go on stage. Henslowe never despairs, and he insists all will turn out well.

The scene was set for Greece to default on its debts and perhaps eventually leave (or be forced out of) the euro when a meeting of finance ministers from the 19 countries that use the single currency broke down acrimoniously on Thursday. Christine Lagarde, the IMF’s managing director, did not really need to say that it was time for “some grownups in the room”: the lousy body language was clear from the photos of the meeting.</p> \n<p>But negotiations in Europe rarely end. Instead, they are resumed at a later date, and so it was agreed that eurozone leaders would hold a summit on Greece on Monday following yet another meeting of finance ministers earlier in the afternoon.<br /></p> \n<p>On Friday, Europe turned the screw. The European Central Bank announced for the second time in three days that it was providing emergency finance to prop up the Greek banks. But Frankfurt was not over-generous: the lifeline was only long enough to cover the period up until Monday’s summit. The implied threat was clear: do a deal or we cut off the money and your banks go bust. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-membership\"> \n <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-newsroom-should-greece-leave-the-euro-17456530954\">Guardian Newsroom: Should Greece leave the Euro?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This classic example of the iron fist in the velvet glove appears to have worked. Although the three main actors in the Greek crisis have sometimes given the impression that they cannot stand the sight of each other, none actually wants the euro to lose a member. Alexis Tsipras is a conflicted politician: he thinks an end to austerity is needed if Greece is to start climbing out of the deep economic hole into which it has disappeared over the past five years. But he knows that, by a large margin, the Greek people want to stay in the euro. The price of staying in the euro may well involve swallowing fresh austerity measures.</p> \n<p>His co-star, Angela Merkel, is also torn. The German people are fed up with writing cheques to bail out Greece but remain committed to the European project. Merkel does not want to be held responsible for the disintegration of the euro. Nor does the main supporting actor, Jean-Claude Juncker, who has just taken over as president of the European commission, and whose reputation as the fixer-in-chief is on the line.</p> \n<p>As a result, talks have been <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/21/greece-and-eurozone-leaders-in-last-ditch-scramble-to-reach-deal\">going on all weekend</a> to see if a compromise can be reached. These negotiations have been influenced by Russia and the United States, more accustomed to lead roles but on this occasion lower down the billing. Tsipras has been <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/19/greek-prime-minister-vladimir-putin-help-financial-crisis\">flirting with Putin</a>, something that has not gone down well with Barack Obama. Washington has made its feelings known.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/21/david-cameron-eu-angela-merkel-greek-crisis-grexit\">Why David Cameron is an anxious spectator of the Greek drama | Andrew Rawnsley</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So what might the deal look like? The usual can-kicking exercise, in all likelihood. In Brussels, the talk is of Greece being prepared to offer some compromises on pensions and tax in exchange for enough money to meet its immediate needs, along with the promise of debt relief later provided it sticks to its reform programme. This would resolve little. Greece’s economy will continue to struggle, the government will go slow on reform, and its bailout money will be depleted. Tickets for the new autumn production of the drama will shortly be going on sale. <br /></p> \n<p>Tsipras now has a big decision to make. Clearly, the creditors would be getting more out of this game of give and take than he is: they are not demanding the full pound of flesh but something quite close to it. If he folds, he will have big political problems at home. If he remains defiant he will have a bank run to contend with by Tuesday morning. Like all the best plays, there is more than one possible ending to Tsipras of Athens. The stage is set for a gripping final act.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434910793057/d5d2cca7-2553-4d65-9d71-abcdea2e7dfe-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters","altText":"The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, leaves his office in Athens on Sunday.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-21T18:23:45Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T06:55:32Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Larry Elliott","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733742341/LarryElliott.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/larryelliott"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Greece","Europe","World news","Alexis Tsipras","Eurozone","Eurozone crisis","Euro","European Union","European Central Bank","Business","Economics"],"tags":[{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/alexis-tsipras","webTitle":"Alexis Tsipras"},{"id":"business/eurozone","webTitle":"Eurozone"},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis"},{"id":"business/euro","webTitle":"Euro"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"business/european-central-bank","webTitle":"European Central Bank"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Larry Elliott","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/larryelliott"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/21/tsipras-of-athens-drama-entering-gripping-final-act","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a236","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/21/tsipras-of-athens-drama-entering-gripping-final-act","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/21/tsipras-of-athens-drama-entering-gripping-final-act"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434910793057/d5d2cca7-2553-4d65-9d71-abcdea2e7dfe-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, leaves his office in Athens on Sunday.

Everybody has been so kind – overfriendly, even,” she said. “This is all about the politics, tourists are not responsible for that.” Bj&ouml;rn J&uuml;rgensen, an electrical technician travelling with her, added: “I haven’t thought about the crisis at all, people have been great.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/21/greece-and-eurozone-leaders-in-last-ditch-scramble-to-reach-deal\">Greece and eurozone leaders in last-ditch scramble to reach deal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The tourist sun-loungers and bars seem a world away from the meeting rooms of Brussels. But tourism is more than ever a barometer of Athens’s international relations and a lifeline for the economy. Tourism is Greece’s biggest industry, making up a fifth of GDP. Last year, record numbers of tourist flocked to Greece, including a record 2.5 million Germans; there was a 17% increase of Germans arriving on package holidays. </p> \n<p>This year had been expected to set further records, but the uncertainty over Greece’s future and fears of a credit crunch and capital controls has begun to scare off Germans. The surge in tourism last year that helped drag the country out of a six-year slump has given way in the first months of this year to a drop in momentum. While UK and US tourists rush to benefit from the exchange rate, German bookings for Greece have unexpectedly declined since the radical left Syriza took power and as the economic crisis deepened.</p> \n<p>This month Germany’s travel board felt the need to issue a statement assuring travellers: “Despite isolated political campaigns against Germany in the past, German tourists do not need to fear hostility or hatred in Greece.” So crucial is the tourist trade to Greece that two conservative German politicians, Axel Fischer and Ruediger Kruse, proposed that German holidaymakers whose holiday spending helps boost the Greek economy should be reimbursed €500 by the German state on their return – on condition that the hotel and restaurants they visited have paid their taxes.</p> \n<p>On a long stretch of beach at the holiday spot of Perea, outside Thessaloniki, Eleftheria Poungoura had repainted her gift shop and carefully arranged the array of scarves, bags and luxury souvenirs. But on her newsstand the headline from the front page of the Daily Mirror – “Acropolypse Now” – was a reminder of the possibility of Greece having to leave the euro. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-membership\"> \n <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-newsroom-should-greece-leave-the-euro-17456530954\">Guardian Newsroom: Should Greece leave the Euro?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Poungoura, who trained in computer graphics, had been struggling to find a job over the past few years, so she had opened her shop almost two months ago. “At fist I thought people would think I was absolutely crazy starting a business. But I’m starting fresh, other businesses have debts and owe lots of money, it’s much easier for me to survive.” She said she worked from 10am to 3am each day and didn’t feel able to take on staff. “Tourist income is the biggest income we have, the biggest hope,” she said. </p> \n<p>Poungoura had had many German tourist customers, one of whom had been buying Bild every day for three weeks. “We don’t let politics get in the way of personal relations,” she said. “Greeks do not hate German people, many of my friends live in Germany, many have gone there to work.”</p> \n<p>Those working in Greek tourism worry that any VAT hikes that might be imposed under a financial deal in the coming days might force a rise in prices. On Perea’s beachfront, value for money was a crucial draw for tourists. “The other day, some German visitors came in and bought six bottles of wine. They said they were going to Athens and the same wine would be far more expensive if they bought it there. Price does matter,” Poungoura said.</p> \n<p>Angela Verbeneiuc, a Romanian economist, had been travelling the beaches with her family, attracted by the weather and the prices. She had noticed the high contingent of eastern European and Russian visitors. Nikolai Marchenko, an engineer from Siberia who worked in Thessaloniki and was showing tourist friends around, said that if Greece left the euro there was “no doubt” the country would turn to Russia for support. </p> \n<p>Susan and Roger Askill, from the West Midlands, had been travelling in Rhodes and Crete before returning to the Cyprus cottage they had retired to several years ago. They had heeded Foreign Office advice to bring enough cash to get by in case of bank closures, and used hotel safes during their journey. “It’s best to be prepared but we never considered cancelling our trip,” Susan Askill said.</p> \n<p>Odd Skriubakken, a retired teacher from Sarpsborg, Norway, said: “My wife has just retired and needed some sun. We booked months ago and wouldn’t have dreamt of cancelling. Despite everything, Greece is still seen primarily as a holiday destination.

These rules will mean that money has just been thrown down the drain.</p> \n<p>“The UK will be sending away nurses who have contributed to the health service for six years. Losing their skills and knowledge and then having to start the cycle again and recruit to replace them is completely illogical.”</p> \n<p>The rules, part of home secretary Theresa May’s plan to “ensure that only the brightest and best remain permanently” will apply to all people in the UK from outside the European Economic Area (EEA).</p> \n<p>Carter said that overseas recruitment of nurses was likely to continue to rise – although it would be made more difficult as a result of the rule change – because of a crackdown on agency spending and as long as there was a shortage of home-grown people trained to do the job. <br /></p> \n<p>In June, the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/02/no-more-3500-a-shift-doctors-jeremy-hunt-tells-nhs\">announced new rules </a>that would introduce a maximum hourly rate that agencies can charge for a stand-in doctor or nurse’s services and would cap the amount any trust in financial trouble can spend on them. </p> \n<p>These rules were designed to tackle the NHS’s growing financial problems but Carter said that coupled with the immigration rules, trusts were “being asked to provide safe staffing with both hands tied behind their backs”.</p> \n<p>He said an ongoing reliance on overseas recruitment is unreliable and unsustainable, due to growing evidence of a global shortage, but the answer was to expand training. <br /></p> \n<p>“The only way for the UK to regain control over its own health service workforce is by training more nurses,” said Carter. “Thirty-seven-thousand potential nursing students were turned away last year, so there are people out there who want to embark on a nursing career.”</p> \n<p>A Home Office spokesman said: “As the prime minister has made clear, the government wants to reduce the demand for migrant labour.</p> \n<p>“There are exemptions to this threshold for occupations where the UK has a shortage – but the independent <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/migration-advisory-committee\">Migration Advisory Committee</a> recommended against adding nurses to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/migration-advisory-committee-recommended-shortage-lists\">the shortage occupation list</a> after taking evidence from groups, including the RCN.</p> \n<p>“Employers have had since 2011 to prepare for the possibility their non-EEA workers may not meet the required salary threshold to remain in the UK permanently.”</p> \n<p>There are a record number of nurses in training, according to the Department of Health, which is working with the Home Office on the issues around overseas recruitment.</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/49554723c0c009330b41de9e175cc84c8a2f9f42/0_40_2500_1500/2500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1500,"width":2500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dominic Lipinski/PA","altText":"New immigration rules will cost millions of pounds to the NHS and compromise patient safety, a nurses union has warned.

After striking licensing deals with major labels, the company had planned to only start paying royalties after the trial period.</p> \n<p>Independent label trade bodies in the US, UK, Germany, France and Australia spoke out against these plans in recent days, claiming that their members would be most at risk from any three-month blip in earnings if a large number of people buying music downloads from Apple’s iTunes store switched to the free trial.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jun/09/apple-music-interview-jimmy-iovine-eddy-cue\">Apple Music interview: 'Algorithms can't do it alone – you need a human touch'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“We struggle to see why rights owners and artists should bear this aspect of Apple’s customer acquisition costs,” <a href=\"http://beggars.com/group/pressrelease/90/with-regards-to-apple-music\">claimed indie label group Beggars Group</a> in a statement published on its website.</p> \n<p>“As a whole the independent sector is a powerful voice in the music industry but its individual parts , the smaller labels particularly, cannot withstand such a potentially catastrophic drop in revenue,” <a href=\"http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/aim-apple-music-deal-does-not-meet-a-standard-of-commercial-fairness-that-we-can-endorse/062068\">added British indie trade body AIM</a> in a statement sent out to its members.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457098393__\n</div> \n<p>Swift’s blog post on Sunday made even more headlines, however. “I’m sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service,” she wrote.</p> \n<p>“I’m not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company.”</p> \n<p>Swift cited the plans as one reason she would not be making her last album, 1989, available to stream on Apple Music, although she had not announced whether she would be withholding her entire back catalogue from the service as she has from Spotify.</p> \n<p>Swift has become one of the most vocal musicians in the ongoing debate about how well (or poorly) streaming pays off for artists and songwriters, having taken Spotify to task in 2014 for the free tier of its service.</p> \n<p>“I’m not willing to contribute my life’s work to an experiment that I don’t feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists and creators of this music,” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/nov/15/taylor-swift-music-spotify\">she said then</a>. “And I just don’t agree with perpetuating the perception that music has no value and should be free.”</p> \n<p>Swift is already celebrating Apple’s change of heart:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/statuses/612841136311390209\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I am elated and relieved.

In 2015, that debate is still going on, and it's even more heated.</p>\n<p>Now McCandless has created a new version of the infographic, updated for 2015.</p>\n<p>As before, it digs in to stats from various digital music companies, from the likes of Bandcamp, iTunes and Amazon that sell music, to streaming services: Spotify, Deezer, Apple's Beats Music, Rhapsody, YouTube and Tidal.</p>\n<p>Besides calculations for how much an artist can expect to earn from a single sale or stream, the infographic shows how many of those sales or streams they'd need to earn the US monthly minimum wage of $1,260.</p>\n<p>Some important caveats: these numbers apply to performing musicians, but they do not include publishing royalties for the songwriting. Plus, the most important factor in how much an artist signed to a label earns is the terms of their contract: some have good, fair deals. Others... less so.</p>\n<p>Averaging that out is also the reason why the figures here may not match those announced by the streaming services.</p>\n<p>For example, Spotify says that <a href=\"http://www.spotifyartists.com/spotify-explained/\">its average payout for a stream to labels and publishers is between $0.006 and $0.0084</a> but Information Is Beautiful suggests that the average payment to an artist from the label portion of that is $0.001128 – this being what a signed artist receives after the label's share.</p>\n<p>Finally, the per-play figures for streaming service can be misleading, as they depend on how many (or few) users the service has. Beats may pay more per-stream than Spotify, but that's because it has relatively few users.</p>\n<p>Artists will be making a lot more money in aggregate from Spotify, and if Beats' user numbers grow, its per-stream payouts will come down. So this graphic isn't proof that one service is better for artists than another, in that sense.</p>\n<p>Information is Beautiful has included a metric of &quot;users per play needed&quot; – the little dots at the bottom right of each circle – to reflect this.</p>\n<figure data-media-id=\"gu-image-456304964\">\n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/10/1428667990141/GUARDIAN_Musicians_2015_09_FB_(2).png\" alt=\"Spotify Infographic updated\" width=\"940\" height=\"7500\" class=\"gu-image\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Even so, it's a great conversation-starter.

However, he added: “The CofCC is hardly responsible for the actions of this deranged individual merely because he gleaned accurate information from our website.”</p> \n<p>Reached by telephone at home on Sunday evening by the Guardian, Holt said he was busy and hung up.</p> \n<p>Holt has since 2012 contributed $8,500 to Cruz, the Texas senator running for the Republican presidential nomination, and his <a href=\"http://www.jobsgrowth.org/\">Jobs, Growth and Freedom Fund</a> political action committee, according to <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/\">Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC) filings. On some filings Holt’s occupation was listed as “slumlord”.</p> \n<p>He has also given $1,750 to <a href=\"http://www.randpac.com/\">RandPAC</a>, the political action committee of Paul, the Kentucky senator and presidential contender, and he gave $2,000 to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney. </p> \n<p>A further $1,500 was donated by Holt to Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator and 2012 Republican presidential primary runner-up, who is running for president again in the 2016 race and attended Sunday’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/gallery/2015/jun/21/charleston-shooting-remembrance-march-service-in-pictures\">memorial service</a> at Emanuel AME Church.</p> \n<p>In response to questions from the Guardian, Rick Tyler, a spokesman for Cruz, said in an email: “Upon review, we discovered that Mr Holt did make a contribution. We will be immediately refunding the donation.” </p> \n<p>Tyler said Cruz’s own campaign and leadership PAC would “be making a full refund”.</p> \n<p>Matthew Beynon, a spokesman for Santorum, said in an email: “Senator Santorum does not condone or respect racist or hateful comments of any kind. Period. The views the Senator campaigns on are his own and he is focused on uniting America, not dividing her.”</p> \n<p>A spokesman for Paul’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>A series of racist statements have been posted over the past four years to the website of The Blaze, a conservative news outlet, by a user going by Holt’s full name, Earl P Holt III.

Beneath their feet, directly under the pews, was the basement where just four days before a white supremacist spent an hour with a Bible study group and then stood up, removed a gun from his fanny pack and opened fire.</p> \n<p>“We’re reminded this morning about the freshness of death,” said Norvel Goff, the elder who led the service in place of pastor Clementa Pinckney, one of those killed on Wednesday. “It comes like a thief in the night.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/20/dylann-roof-fbi-website-manifesto-charleston-shooting\">Dylann Roof</a>, the 21-year-old who has been charged over the massacre, is said to have told friends he wanted to start a race war. Instead, the shooting spree he is accused of perpetrating achieved the opposite, bringing together black and white churchgoers who so often worship apart in a state as racially segregated as South Carolina.</p> \n<p>A mixed crowd of worshippers walked up the church’s white steps, past a sign saying “Thou Shalt Not Kill”, after doors were opened for the first time since the shooting.</p> \n<p>The Emanuel church, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/18/charleston-church-shooting-civil-rights-legacy-south-carolina\">founded in 1816</a>, is the oldest black church south of Baltimore and has been at the forefront of America’s racial injustices through the years, hosting slave insurrectionists one century and civil rights leaders the next. Yet this week’s massacre was brutal even by historical standards, and resulted in a Sunday service like no other. </p> \n<p>The church was filled to bursting, with hundreds lined up in pews and balconies. Many, many more were were gathered outside in 36C (96F) heat, wiping away sweat and tears as the sermon echoed out of the church through loudspeakers. Inside, for what must have been the first time in the church’s history, armed police lined the walls, creating silhouettes against the stained-glass windows.</p> \n<p>The congregation broke out in a hymn, spontaneously. It was the start of a service that was solemn at one turn and almost defiantly joyful the next, as congregants shouted approval when preachers suggested they should not be cowed in the face of the week’s atrocity.</p> \n<p>One moment, there would be euphemistic references to “that horrible situation” or “heinous act” that had taken the lives of nine dedicated members of the church who would otherwise have been sat beside their family. Some relatives of those killed had to be escorted from the hall, overcome by grief and unable to stand. The next moment, there were jokes about Father’s Day, and a routine message of support for a member of the church undergoing medical treatment.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457229071__\n</div> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/18/charleston-church-victims-profiles\">The Charleston shooting victims: a poet, a politician, a librarian, women of faith</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When a gospel choir, aided by trumpet and piano, began an upbeat rendition of Jesus Said You Can Lean on Me, people lifted their arms, swayed and danced. The response was so impassioned that the floorboards began to shake.</p> \n<p>One custodian said he and others had spent the night cleaning the basement, washing the floor and walls and covering the bullet-holes in anticipation of visits to the scene of death from relatives of the victims.</p> \n<p>When Goff read out the names of the victims, who were aged between 26 and 87, he gave only the briefest description of their deaths. “There they were in the house of the Lord,” he said, “studying your word, praying with one another, but the devil also entered and the devil was trying to take charge.”</p> \n<p>Relatives of the three survivors – two of whom escaped with their lives by playing dead – have provided reporters with harrowing accounts of events that unfolded around 9pm on Wednesday. Roof was welcomed by the Bible study group and according to one report, almost considered abandoning his alleged killing spree because the group treated him with such kindness. </p> \n<p>He is believed to have shot the pastor first. When members of the Bible study group pleaded with the suspect to show them mercy, Roof is said to have replied: “I have to do it. You rape our women and you’re taking over our country. You have to go.” Another report said that after killing the nine worshippers, Roof turned the gun on himself and pulled the trigger, but discovered he had run out of ammunition. He was arrested the following day, 200 miles away in North Carolina.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"853a0db6f5aed9f66bd7b4248798de52b75c4b07\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/853a0db6f5aed9f66bd7b4248798de52b75c4b07/0_4_3000_1975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"658\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People pray in front of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/20/dylann-roof-fbi-website-manifesto-charleston-shooting\">Dylann Roof: FBI probes website and manifesto linked to Charleston suspect</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By Friday, Roof was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/19/i-forgive-you-charleston-church-victims-families-confront-suspect\">in a Charleston courtroom</a>, for a bond hearing at which he was forced to listen to relatives of his alleged victims express their suffering and, one by one, offer him forgiveness. <br /></p> \n<p>All the evidence suggests that was the last message Roof wanted to hear.

Well, they just don’t know us,” he said. “Because we are a people of faith and we believe that when we put our forces and heads together working for a common good, there is nothing that we can’t accomplish in the name of Jesus. It has been tough. It’s been rough. Some of us have been downright angry. But through it all, God has sustained us and has encouraged us.

He said: “Who is it reaching out to young people, in particular, by social media, to get them to come, in the first place? It’s very difficult because of the dynamic nature of social media.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/sep/01/europol-taskforce-cybercrime-hacking-malware\">Europol launches taskforce to fight world’s most sophisticated cyber crooks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The director added that the police team would be working with social media companies to identify the most important accounts operating in a range of languages that are “underpinning what Isis are doing”. </p> \n<p>Europol said it would not name the social media firms who have agreed to help the police. It will use network analytics to identify the most active accounts, such as those pumping out the most messages and those part of an established online community.</p> \n<p>Wainwright said the new unit would aim to “identify the ringleaders online”, but even then counter-terrorism investigators could not go through every one of the estimated 50,000 targeted accounts, as there were too many and new ones could easily be set up.</p> \n<p>Last week, Isis’s ability to reach into British communities to gain recruits was demonstrated once again. One Briton, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/15/dewsbury-in-utter-shock-at-over-talha-asmals-death-in-iraq-suicide-bombing\">Talha Asmal</a>, a 17-year-old from Dewsbry, West Yorkshire, is believed to have killed himself in a suicide bombing in Iraq, while <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/21/police-complicit-radicalisation-missing-sisters-claim-family-lawyers\">three Bradford sisters</a> are feared to have fled to Syria with their nine children in the hope of joining a brother who has been fighting the Assad regime.</p> \n<p>A total of 700 Britons have travelled to territory controlled by Isis in Syria and Iraq – a problem shared with other European countries. Europol’s database tracking suspected foreign fighters in the two countries has 6,000 names. Some of those may be facilitators, or their associates. Wainwright said up to 5,000 were believed to have travelled to Isis-held territory from countries including Holland, France and Belgium, as well as from the UK.</p> \n<p>He said some were “disaffected” youths migrating from teenage gangs in their own countries seeing Isis as a “bigger gang in Syria”. But he added that others being attracted are those who had bright futures in their home countries.</p> \n<p>The new European initiative is in part based on Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism internet-referral unit. The hope is the new unit will boost efforts across European countries, with results passed back to nations to take action against the individuals running the accounts.<br /></p> \n<p>The unit is part of European governments’ response to the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jan/07/cartoonists-victims-charlie-hebdo-attack\">terrorist attacks on the office of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo</a> in Paris in January.</p> \n<p>Wainwright said money used to fund Isis activities will also be hunted down. He added: “Where you follow the money trail, it helps find who they are, what they are doing and who their associates are.”</p> \n<p>The home secretary, Theresa May, stressed in a speech this week the need to tackle the cross-border threat of Isis. She said: “The threat … that we face is a common one shared by many of your countries. And if we are to defeat it, we need to work together. <br /></p> \n<p>“We have also supported the EU in setting up an internet-referral unit at Europol to address the increasing amount of terrorist and extremist propaganda available on the internet, and I am pleased to say the UK will be seconding a police officer to this unit.”</p> \n<p>David Cameron last week said Isis was using the internet to lure western youngsters to its cause. He said: “It may be medieval in its outlook, but it is modern in its tactics, with the internet as the main tool to spread its warped worldview.”<br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7c8a1fb94e2181143889ff4fce48bfc9ad4aad16/203_378_3893_2339/3893.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2339,"width":3893,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Martijn Beekman/EPA","altText":"Europol director Rob Wainwright","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Martijn Beekman/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-21T19:37:54Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T00:00:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":289,"contributors":[{"name":"Vikram Dodd","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/vikramdodd"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Islamic State","Police","UK news","Europe","World news","Iraq","Syria","Middle East and North Africa"],"tags":[{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State"},{"id":"uk/police","webTitle":"Police"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/iraq","webTitle":"Iraq"},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Vikram Dodd","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/vikramdodd"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/21/europol-internet-unit-track-down-extremists-isis-social-media-propaganda","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a247","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/21/europol-internet-unit-track-down-extremists-isis-social-media-propaganda","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/21/europol-internet-unit-track-down-extremists-isis-social-media-propaganda"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7c8a1fb94e2181143889ff4fce48bfc9ad4aad16/203_378_3893_2339/3893.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2339,"width":3893,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Europol director Rob Wainwright said Isis uses social media to target young people in particular.
