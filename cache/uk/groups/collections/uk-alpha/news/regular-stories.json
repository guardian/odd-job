Eighteen others were killed in avalanches on Mount Everest.</p> \n<p>Another avalanche hit a village in the district of Rasuwa, north of Kathmandu, on Tuesday, leaving up to 250 people missing. Ghodatabela, about a 12-hour walk from the nearest town, is along a popular trekking route, but it was not clear if the missing included trekkers.</p> \n<p>Health workers said they feared a major health crisis was unfolding among survivors of the quake who are living in the open or in overcrowded tents with no access to sanitation or clean water.<br /></p> \n<p>On Tuesday helicopters crisscrossed the skies above Gorkha, close to the epicentre of Saturday’s magnitude 7.8 quake, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/28/people-have-nothing-left-scale-of-nepal-quake-devastation-emerges-at-epicentre\">ferrying the injured to clinics and taking emergency supplies back to remote villages</a>. Aid workers who had reached the region described entire villages reduced to rubble.</p> \n<p>“In some villages, about 90% of the houses have collapsed. They’re just flattened,” said Rebecca McAteer, an American physician. Udav Prashad Timalsina, the top official for Gorkha, warned that people were not getting food and shelter.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/27/nepal-earthquake-victims-poor-homeless\">Nepal earthquake: what the thousands of victims share is that they are poor</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That grim assessment was supported by World Vision aid worker Matt Darvas, who reached Gorkha on Monday. “It does not seem aid is reaching here very quickly,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Further north from here the reports are very disturbing,” he said, adding that up to 75% of the buildings in Singla may have collapsed. There has been no contact with that village since Saturday night.</p> \n<p>In the town of Dhulikhel, the main hospital, one of only two serving the Kabre district, with a population of 380,000, was due to run out of diesel fuel for its generator at midnight on Monday.<br /></p> \n<p>“We are trying to get more but it’s difficult.

Anyone who stayed in these could not afford better.</p> \n<p>“Outside Kathmandu it’s the rural poor. But in the city it’s the people in the older precarious housing. It’s obvious: the wealthier you are, the stronger the house you have,” said Bhaskar Gautam, a local sociologist.<br /></p> \n<p>The aid situation is expected to improve as more planes packed with supplies arrive from India, China, the US, the UK, Australia, Pakistan and other countries, although that operation too is being held up by congestion at Kathmandu’s airport, and by a shortages of workers to unload cargo and vehicles to ferry supplies to where they are needed.</p> \n<p>While the scale of the disaster is not yet fully known, aid workers said the humanitarian impact was likely to be overwhelming.</p> \n<p>The United Nations estimates that as many as eight million of Nepal’s 28 million people have had their lives disrupted by the earthquake, adding that it was releasing US$15m from an emergency response fund to help the victims.</p> \n<p>The UN said more than 1.4 million people need food assistance, including 750,000 who live near the quake’s epicentre in poor quality housing.

That was a year in which the company’s responsibility for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jan/07/shell-announces-55m-payout-for-nigeria-oil-spills\">oil spills in Nigeria</a> was frequently in the news, as were the company’s interests in Iraq, Kurdistan and Libya.</p> \n<p>BP’s meetings helped to develop, in the words of a Foreign Office diplomat, the effort to “strengthen the strategic alliance” between BP and the government on global economic and energy issues. The comment, made in documents disclosed under the freedom of information act, was made last year before an annual “high-level” dinner attended by senior diplomats and BP executives. </p> \n<p>A BP spokesman said: ”BP is a major UK-headquartered company with significant businesses and investments in the UK as well as worldwide. We employ around 15,000 people in this country and are currently undertaking a multi-billion pound investment programme in the UK North Sea.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I was just amazed at their sense of entitlement. They thought the government was there to ease their way</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“As such, we have regular meetings with various Government departments who are interested in both our business and various issues involving our industry. Many of these are at the Government’s request.”</p> \n<p>A Shell spokesman said: “Shell is a leading FTSE100 company, and as part of our perfectly legitimate corporate activity we engage regularly with many stakeholders, including government ministers and officials, on a wide range of topics related to the energy industry and Shell’s operations.”</p> \n<p>The face-to-face meetings with ministers allow the fossil fuel industry to promote their interests. A government source who was regularly involved in the meetings with energy companies described how they vehemently objected to a windfall tax that was suddenly imposed on North Sea oil producers in 2011. </p> \n<p>They warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK would be lost. “The oil companies were absolutely furious, as they hadn’t known anything about it. They said it had ruined their positions within their [multinational] companies in fighting for investment in the North Sea,” said the source. </p> \n<p>The same source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, has been struck by the firms that want to start fracking: “I was just amazed at their sense of entitlement. They thought the government was there to ease their way, not to strike a balance with public concerns.”</p> \n<p>Senior figures in the renewable industry said they had difficulty securing face-to-face meetings with ministers. One senior person in the renewables industry also described how ministers seemed indifferent to an overseas renewables company that was offering to invest a substantial sum in Britain. “You’d think that would be welcomed, but there was no sign of a red carpet, let alone a cup of coffee. There was an odd atmosphere and they were not really paying full attention.”</p> \n<p>Another senior executive in the renewables industry blamed Conservative ministers in the Liberal Democrat-controlled Department of Energy and Climate Change for the difficulty in getting meetings.</p> \n<p>“There was a huge difference with the Liberal Democrat ministers. They were accessible and supportive. We couldn’t have asked for more from them but they did not have the clout to deliver everything,” said the executive. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If Cameron’s serious about keeping people’s energy bills down... he’d put his money – and meetings – where his mouth is</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Caroline Lucas</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Michael Fallon, the energy minister in 2013 and 2014, before he was promoted to the cabinet, was identified by two renewable industry executives as being particularly unwelcoming. One said: “He refused all our meeting requests and flatly refused to engage. He kept finding excuses not to meet.”</p> \n<p>The other said: “We found it very difficult even to get a meeting with him, even when the issues directly affected his brief as energy minister.” </p> \n<p>Environmental campaigners said their access to ministers was diluted as they met the politicians with other campaign groups. </p> \n<p>The database shows that more of the meetings that Shell and BP had with ministers were on their own (43 and 33 respectively) compared to Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. Friends of the Earth had 14 meetings on their own and Greenpeace 11.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Ministers meetings with fossil fuel and renewable energy firms and climate NGOs\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://d26adhsj11a4c2.cloudfront.net/2kgtP/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" oallowfullscreen=\"\" msallowfullscreen=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"600\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>One campaigner involved in these meetings said the encounters with ministers often took the form of a question and answer session about issues that were topical. Another campaigner, Alastair Harper, a policy adviser at the Green Alliance, said the advantage of a range of environmental campaigns meeting ministers at the same time was that it allowed the campaigners to signal that they had broad support on a particular issue. </p> \n<p>Lucas added: “This year, David Cameron dubbed climate change <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/10662654/David-Cameron-man-made-climate-change-is-one-of-the-greatest-threats-to-UK.html\">one of “the greatest threats”</a> we faced. But the chasm unearthed here is sadly illustrative of a government out of touch with the vast opportunities offered by the renewables industry. If Cameron’s serious about keeping people’s energy bills down and improving energy security, he’d put his money – and meetings – where his mouth is.”</p> \n<p>The Department for Energy and Climate Change said it would not comment while the general election was taking place. </p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>How The Guardian calculated the number of meetings:</em></p> \n<p><em>Every department publishes a record of ministers’ meetings with external organisations. The records are usually published every quarter. The Guardian downloaded all of these since the coalition came to power, in all 116 documents. The information was turned into a database listing every meeting and every organisation. The organisations can either meet with the minister one-on-one, or as part of a larger group. </em></p> \n<p><em>Often, several organisations take part in the same meeting. For example, BP met ministers 79 times, Shell 112 times, but Shell and BP had 165 meetings together with the ministers. That’s because Shell was present in some of the 79 meetings that BP had, and vice versa. </em><em>This affects the totals when the figures for individual organisations are added together. </em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/kiln/fuelticker/\" data-alt=\"Climate campaign ticker\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/kiln/fuelticker/\">Climate campaign ticker</a> \n</figure>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430218704098/1004632a-b4f3-437d-a5aa-83210f8552f2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andy Buchanan - WPA Pool/Getty Images","altText":"British Prime Minister David Cameron tours the BP ETAP (Eastern Trough Area Project) oil platform in the North Sea ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andy Buchanan - WPA Pool/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-04-28T13:12:18Z","lastModified":"2015-04-28T14:36:13Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":60,"contributors":[{"name":"Rob Evans","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/robevans"},{"name":"Helena Bengtsson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/helena-bengtsson"},{"name":"Damian Carrington","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733736253/DamianCarrington.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/damiancarrington"},{"name":"Emma Howard","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/emma-e-howard"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Climate change","Fossil fuels","Renewable energy","Environment","Energy","Oil and gas companies","Energy industry","Business","Liberal-Conservative coalition","Politics","UK news"],"topics":[],"series":{"title":"Keep it in the ground","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/series/keep-it-in-the-ground"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"environment"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/apr/28/fossil-fuel-lobby-given-far-more-access-to-uk-ministers-than-renewables-analysis","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/47qm4","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/environment/2015/apr/28/fossil-fuel-lobby-given-far-more-access-to-uk-ministers-than-renewables-analysis","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/28/fossil-fuel-lobby-given-far-more-access-to-uk-ministers-than-renewables-analysis"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430218704098/1004632a-b4f3-437d-a5aa-83210f8552f2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"British Prime Minister David Cameron tours the BP ETAP (Eastern Trough Area Project) oil platform in the North Sea.

US soldiers were also seriously injured by the blast and others were wounded in a firefight while dealing with another IED Sardar had made, the court heard. </p> \n<p>Opening the prosecution case, Max Hill QC told the jury: “This is an unusual trial in that almost all of the evidence you will hear and see comes from Iraq. The offences, we say, are the most serious imaginable, and the British link is the fact that the defendant, a British citizen, lives and works here. For that reason, it is lawful to place him on trial in London, even though the activities you will hear about took place far away in Iraq. </p> \n<p>“The crown’s case is that the defendant, Mr Sardar, was directly involved in making bombs for use in Iraq during 2007. As you will hear, he seems to have been based in Syria, probably in the capital city, Damascus, at relevant times.” </p> \n<p>The court heard that Sardar claimed to have travelled to Syria to learn Arabic, but documents found at his London home suggested an advanced understanding of the language. Police searching the property also found an Arabic-language bomb-making manual. </p> \n<p>Hill said: “The crown says therefore that while it may be true that he was studying languages, he was without doubt involved in bomb-making, whether in Syria or in neighbouring Iraq. </p> \n<p>“During the period with which we are concerned, namely several months during 2007, a number of bombs or improvised explosive devices were found buried under the roads leading west from Baghdad in Iraq. One of those bombs detonated fully as a US military vehicle passed over it, killing Sgt Johnson. Several other bombs were recovered, in at least one instance after a firefight in which further US military soldiers were injured.” </p> \n<p>Hill said the devices linked to the case “were not off-the-shelf bombs, they were made with deadly intent”. </p> \n<p>The bombs were later taken to an FBI lab in the US for examination by experts. Those allegedly made by Sardar were found on the road from Baghdad to Abu Ghraib prison. </p> \n<p>But the prosecuting barrister said the trial had “nothing to do with the rights and the wrongs” of the second Iraq war or the current conflict in Syria. </p> \n<p>Two of the recovered bombs carried the fingerprints of Sardar, the court heard. These devices and another two also had the fingerprints of another man, Sajjad Adnan. Hill said the two men had been working together and with others to build the bombs and plant them. </p> \n<p>The bomb that killed Johnson was only found to have a fingerprint left by Adnan. “That bomb was part of a sequence, involving bombs concealed geographically quite close together, all as part of a joint effort by the defendant Mr Sardar, together with Adnan and others,” Hill said. “That is why it is unnecessary for Mr Sardar to have left his own finger mark on the bomb which killed Sergeant Johnson.” </p> \n<p>Of the four bombs recovered that were later linked to Sardar and Adnan, two were intact and one was safely detonated by a bomb disposal team. </p> \n<p>The device that killed Johnson went off when the vehicle he was travelling in went through a dip in the road. It blew a hole in the bottom of the vehicle beneath where Johnson was standing and he took the full force of the blast, while four other soldiers were injured. Despite attempts to save his life on board a Medevac helicopter his injuries were too severe and he was pronounced dead. </p> \n<p>Johnson, originally from Washington DC, was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart military decoration for US service personnel killed or injured while serving. </p> \n<p>Two other soldiers, Jesus Bustamante and Joseph Bacani of 2-5 cavalry, received gunshot wounds to the abdomen and the knee when trying to retrieve the second bomb linked to Sardar, on 21 March 2007. The device was safely detonated but caused a “massive explosion” and a cloud about 45 metres high (150ft), the court heard.</p> \n<p>Adnan, who is not a British citizen, was arrested after the bombings and handed over to the Iraqi authorities. His whereabouts are unknown. Sardar denies murder, conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion.</p> \n<p>The trial continues.<br /></p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430217502209/10875a9a-525f-421f-9f74-eb5f5805937a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"John Stillwell/PA Archive/Press Association Images","altText":"Woolwich crown court in south London.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: John Stillwell/PA Archive/Press Association Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-04-28T12:08:01Z","lastModified":"2015-04-28T14:36:20Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["UK news"],"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/apr/28/briton-allegedly-killed-us-soldier-bomb-iraq-trial-uk","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/47qp2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/apr/28/briton-allegedly-killed-us-soldier-bomb-iraq-trial-uk","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/apr/28/briton-allegedly-killed-us-soldier-bomb-iraq-trial-uk"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430217502209/10875a9a-525f-421f-9f74-eb5f5805937a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Woolwich crown court heard that Sardar claimed to have travelled to Syria to learn Arabic, but documents found at his home suggested an advanced understanding of the language.
