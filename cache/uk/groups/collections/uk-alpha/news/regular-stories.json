GPs will also be able to order more tests than at present, which should speed up a diagnosis.<br /></p> \n<p>“It’s about getting the right patients to the right tests at the right time,” said Willie Hamilton, professor of primary-care diagnostics at Exeter University, who helped develop the guidance. “One of the difficulties in our field is identifying the patient who has cancer over all the other patients who don’t.” <br /></p> \n<p>GPs are already able to request X-rays, blood tests and some scans, but now they will be able to get fast-tracked endoscopy investigations and MRI or CT brain scans tests that a specialist might order after referral of a patient but which will now bring a faster result.<br /></p> \n<p>There are 300,000 cancer diagnoses each year in the UK and 40,000 doctors, which means the average GP will see about eight. Under the new guidance, doctors and patients who suspect cancer will be able to look up the symptoms and find out which tests are appropriate. <br /></p> \n<p>Fatigue, for instance, might mean ovarian or lung cancer, mesothelioma or leukaemia, but unexplained fatigue in somebody over 40 who has never smoked merits a chest X-ray for lung cancer. Unexplained fatigue in women would justify a blood test for ovarian cancer.<br /></p> \n<p>Abdominal pain could be a sign of one of five cancers. In the upper abdomen, with weight loss in the over-55s, it could be caused by oesophageal or stomach cancer, but occurring elsewhere in the abdomen, in a patient aged 60, an urgent CT scan might reveal pancreatic cancer.<br /></p> \n<p>Not every patient going to a GP will be assessed for cancer symptoms, but “there is an educational element to his guidance”, said Hamilton. “For some patients with abdominal pain, cancer is not the first thing you think of.” But, he added, “if your first idea of what you think is wrong with the patient turns out to be wrong, cancer will be higher up the agenda.”<br /></p> \n<p>The guidance is also “to inform the public where risks are and where risks aren’t”, said Dr Steve Hajioff, a director of public health and chair of the Nice guidance group. Some information patients can find online is useful and some is harmful, he said. “My personal view is that it is never wrong to share with people the information that allows them to make decisions about their own health.”<br /></p> \n<p>While more people may ask GPs whether they have cancer, others may read the guidance and decide they are not at risk. “Even if it were to increase, I would suggest that it is an appropriate increase,” said Hajioff. The savings from treating people early – in terms of lives as well as financial costs – would justify any increase in GP appointments and tests.<br /></p> \n<p>Dr Rosie Loftus, joint chief medical officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: “We know that every GP wants to do a good job and identify cancer early, and what will really enable them to do so consistently is more practical support in the workplace. In particular, they need more support to identify the symptoms of cancer types which are very hard to spot.”</p> \n<p>Sara Hiom, director of early diagnosis for Cancer Research UK, said more diagnostic resources must be made available. “We know a lot more about symptoms and symptom clusters. For those patients who in the past have perhaps been let down by the system, we must remember a number of things, such as a diagnosis of cancer is a complex thing and cancer, while a common disease, is very rare in primary care. </p> \n<p>“It certainly seems to be the case, and research would indicate, we do fewer diagnostic tests in this country than comparable countries, but there is a lack of workforce, perhaps a lack of kit, to do those tests, so patients may be missing out because there are delays, backlogs or bottlenecks and this really does need to be addressed.”</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1435003710717/38a0dcf8-a984-475b-bb69-17acf48489ad-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Kallista Images/Visuals Unlimited","altText":"An X-ray showing cancer in a smoker’s lung.

This Eurogroup meeting – the third in less than a week – will be followed by a long-scheduled summit of all 28 European Union leaders where a final deal could be approved.<br /></p> \n<p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she hoped EU leaders meeting on Thursday would only have to “take note” of the Eurogroup agreement with Greece. She has been reluctant to add the Greek crisis to the packed agenda of the summit, which includes the humanitarian migrant crisis at Europe’s borders and the UK’s demands for EU reform.<br /></p> \n<p>On Monday night, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, called for all sides to take responsibility to prevent an “uncontrollable chaotic Grexit”, as thousands of pro-European Greeks poured into central Athens in a pro-euro demonstration.<br /></p> \n<p>The lefist Greek government, which swept to power in January on a promise to end austerity, has made a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/22/greece-deal-red-lines-blur-and-bend?CMP=twt_gu\">series of concessions</a> to its eurozone creditors.<br /></p> \n<p>Under the proposals, billed by Tsipras as “absolute and complete”, Greece would increase VAT and reform its pension system in order to eventually raise the retirement age to 67.

The creditor side will put pressure on Greece to come up with further reforms to its VAT system and tear down protectionist barriers that it says artificially inflate prices for hundreds of products from food to medicines. </p> \n<p>But one leading figure in Syriza said the package would never pass the Greek parliament. Alexis Mitropoulos, vicepresident of the 300-seat house, told Star TV last night that the Tsipras <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/live/2015/jun/22/greek-crisis-eurozone-summit-leaders-eurogroup-ecb-live#block-55888cc1e4b072541506935b\">proposals were “extreme and anti-social”</a> and “cannot come to the Greek parliament”.</p> \n<p>While Donald Tusk, president of the European council, insisted that eurozone countries were “all on the same page”, some leaders showed no sign of toning down the rhetoric. </p> \n<p>Dalia Grybauskaitė, the president of Lithuania, which pushed through deep spending cuts at the height of the financial crisis, said the Greeks did not appreciate the seriousness of the situation.

Many African Americans consider it to be a symbol of racial hatred. The South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley, on Monday <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/22/confederate-flag-south-carolina-charleston\">called for the flag to be removed</a> from the grounds of the capitol.</p> \n<p>“I think it’s time for the whole south, with all the progressive individuals that we have, to start having a dialogue where we put out the right message that goes out to the rest of the nation,” Jones, a Democrat who is chairman of the state’s legislative black caucus, said.</p> \n<p>“It goes back to everything stereotypical that people have seen over the years when it comes to the south. I just think it’s time to change it … It’s an insult, it’s very offensive to all AfricanAmericans everywhere,” he said.</p> \n<p>“We are definitely going to be looking at legislation, to put it back on the table just so we can get the dialogue started in a respectful manner so we can talk about what’s best, especially for Mississippi.</p> \n<p>“We can pre-file a bill to see what kind of support we get. The caucus will be jumping on this relatively quickly, because I’m quite sure this will be one of our main objectives when we get back in 2016.”</p> \n<p>Philip Gunn, the Republican speaker of the house, also called for the flag to be redesigned. “We must always remember our past, but that does not mean we must let it define us. As a Christian, I believe our state’s flag has become a point of offence that needs to be removed.</p> \n<p>“We need to begin having conversations about changing Mississippi’s flag,” <a href=\"http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2015/06/22/petition-mississippi-confederate-flag/29113157/\">he said</a>.</p> \n<p>However, Phil Bryant, the state’s Republican governor, said the referendum had produced a definitive result that should not be challenged. “I don’t believe the Mississippi legislature will act to supersede the will of the people on this issue,” he said.</p> \n<p>An <a href=\"http://petitions.moveon.org/sign/remove-the-confederate-4?source=s.icn.tw&amp;r_by=13394567\">online petition</a> to change the flag had gathered more than 7,000 signatures by Monday night. The petition’s creator, Jennifer Gunter, said she started it after last week’s murders. “I am encouraged, but I do know that the problem is bigger than a flag. But I think it would be a very good gesture of unity in the wake of the tragedy,” she said.</p> \n<p>Gunter is a Mississippi native and a PhD student at the University of South Carolina. “I think the knowledge is starting to spread that that symbol has been co-opted by hate groups around the world and I’m hopeful that the citizens of Mississippi would want to disassociate themselves from such a symbol,” she said.</p> \n<p>“It would remove one more symbol of the inequity that exists,” said Frank Figgers, vice-president of the Veterans of the Mississippi Civil Rights Movement group.</p> \n<p>Flags are not the only point of contention.

He is accused of ordering massacres while head of Rwanda’s military intelligence between 1994 and 1997, and ordering the killing of three Spanish nationals working for the NGO M&eacute;dicos del Mundo, the BBC reports. He is one of 40 current or former Rwandan military officials named on the indictment.</p> \n<p>Karake is a leading member of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the current ruling party of Rwanda, and fought in the civil war that preceded the genocide in which 800,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutus were killed. </p> \n<p>He was previously the deputy commander of the UN peacekeeping mission in Darfur, Sudan, a role which he left in 2009. Humanitarian campaigners Human Rights Watch had protested against his appointment, accusing him of orchestrating deadly attacks against civilians when Rwandan forces were fighting Uganda in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2000.</p> \n<p>It is thought Gen Karake had travelled to the UK on business earlier this month, and is said to have visited the country on previous occasions. </p> \n<p>Jordi Palou-Loverdos, a lawyer representing nine Spanish massacre victims, told BBC’s Newsnight: “We hope in the name of the victims that this time justice will be provided and Karenzi Karake will soon be delivered to the Spanish court to have a fair trial, where he can defend himself.
