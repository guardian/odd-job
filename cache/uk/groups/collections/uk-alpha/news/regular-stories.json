But the commission said on Wednesday morning it was “clear and unanimous” Heathrow’s plan was the strongest case for future airport capacity, delivering the greatest strategic and economic benefits, and the conditions would make the airport a “better neighbour” than today.</p> \n<p>The &pound;17bn expansion plan would mean 250,000 more flights a year, providing a &pound;150bn boost to GDP over 60 years and 70,000 new jobs – but would mean demolishing 783 homes, including most of the neighbouring village of Harmondsworth.</p> \n<p>The long-awaited verdict comes five years after the government cancelled plans for a new runway at Britain’s biggest airport and is expected to spark a renewed political battle.</p> \n<p>Sir Howard Davies, the commission chair, said the government would need to review the analysis carefully before making a decision. But he warned it to “move as quickly as it can” or be seen as unwilling to “take the steps needed to maintain [Britain’s] position as a well-connected open trading economy”.</p> \n<h2>Heathrow’s third runway: the conditions in full</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>A ban on all scheduled night flights from 11.30pm to 6am.<br /></li> \n <li>No fourth runway – the government should make a firm commitment in parliament not to expand further. Davies states: “There is no sound operational or environmental case for a fourth runway.”<br /></li> \n <li>A legally binding “noise envelope”.<br /></li> \n <li>A noise levy on airport users to compensate local communities.<br /></li> \n <li>A legal commitment on air quality (details to be announced, compliant with EU limits).<br /></li> \n <li>A community engagement board to let local people have a say.<br /></li> \n <li>An independent aviation noise authority to be consulted on flightpaths and operating procedures at airports.<br /></li> \n <li>Training and apprenticeships for local people.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>The government must now decide whether to act on the recommendation of the commission, which the prime minister established in 2012 to examine the need for more airport capacity, having shortlisted Heathrow or Gatwick for a required new runway.</p> \n<p>The report said Heathrow’s benefits were “significantly greater” than Gatwick’s. Davies said Gatwick presented a “plausible case for expansion” but was “unlikely to provide much of the type of capacity which is most urgently required: long-haul destinations in new markets”. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/heathrow_third-zip/giv-212778xiH7azkR1l9/\" data-alt=\"Heathrow third runway graphic\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/heathrow_third-zip/giv-212778xiH7azkR1l9/\">Heathrow third runway graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite the exhaustive report, trying to expand Heathrow would run into intense opposition.</p> \n<p>While most airlines in the UK and abroad back the commission’s recommended option, a central plank in Gatwick’s campaign was the claim that a third runway for Heathrow would prove “politically undeliverable” due to pollution and noise issues.</p> \n<p>That claim may yet prove correct. Prominent members of the government – including cabinet members Justine Greening and Philip Hammond, as well as the London mayor, Boris Johnson – are all vehemently anti-expansion, while MPs of all parties from constituencies around Heathrow, as well the remaining Liberal Democrats and Greens, are opposed.</p> \n<p>For Cameron himself, who unequivocally ruled out a third runway in 2010 – saying “no ifs, no buts” – it will be a political embarrassment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"584263636398591676113f345155f8bd1fa06cd0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435728312638/15f53c3f-01d6-4996-872c-84e101e22f14-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Airports Commission chairman Sir Howard Davies has delivered his long-awaited report.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Airports Commission chairman Sir Howard Davies has delivered his long-awaited report on airport expansion.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The report stressed that the plan was “a fundamentally different proposition” from previous proposals to expand Heathrow, with the runway located further to the west and expected to have much less impact on local communities through noise. The commission said the airport should be held to account to spend more than &pound;1bn on community compensation, including &pound;700m insulating homes under the flight paths.</p> \n<p>Business groups and most airlines will welcome the commission’s verdict. A majority had accepted Heathrow’s argument that only a hub airport could deliver the long-haul connections to emerging growth markets that would underpin high-value exports and inward investment.</p> \n<p>John Stewart of the anti-expansion group Hacan, who chaired the last campaign against a third runway, said: “This is far from the end of the story. It will be the government that makes the final decision and given the strong opposition in the cabinet to Heathrow, the final chapter may come out in favour of Gatwick.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8211bbcc429e1f695ed4178a1c31886e68ff1175\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/8211bbcc429e1f695ed4178a1c31886e68ff1175/0_0_3000_1803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A passenger plane comes over Heathrow airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A passenger plane comes into land over a field at Heathrow airport.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said his department would consider the commission’s advice in detail.<br /></p> \n<p>He said: “As a nation we must be ambitious and forward-looking. This is a once-in a-generation opportunity to answer a vital question. I will make a statement to parliament later today in which I will set out the process for that decision to be made.”</p> \n<p>Heathrow said it would “work for all Britain” in trying to deliver the runway. The airport’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said: “This debate has never been about a runway, it’s been about the future we want for Britain. Expanding Heathrow will keep Britain as one of the world’s great trading nations, right at the heart of the global economy.</p> \n<p>“Our new plans have been designed around the needs of local communities and will meet carbon, air quality and noise targets, and provides the greatest benefit to the UK’s connectivity and its long-term economic growth.</p> \n<p>He promised to “create the world’s best connected, most efficient and most environmentally responsible hub airport”.</p> \n<p>Gatwick Airport’s chief executive, Stewart Wingate, said: “It is for the commission to make a recommendation but it is of course for the government to decide. So we now enter the most important stage of the process.” He claimed the commission had “left the door open to us”.</p> \n<p>But speaking on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, Davies said that while Gatwick had been “not inconceivable” when it was placed on the shortlist 18 months ago, he reiterated the commission’s “clear and unanimous” view that Heathrow offered significantly more benefits.</p> \n<p>He said Heathrow was “by a long, long way” the better choice for air freight and exports, and said 60% of the benefit would go to the regions of the UK who could now connect at the hub. He said: “There are only seven airports connected to Heathrow and the reduction in numbers has been relentless. People in the regions have been denied access to Heathrow’s network.”</p> \n<p>Asked if politicians would follow his advice, Davies said: “It has become a symbolic point around the world – is the UK and London prepared to make the decisions that are needed.”</p> \n<p>Environmental campaigners warned that building a new runway would put climate targets at risk, despite the commission’s insistence that it was compatible with the targets.</p> \n<p>Cait Hewitt of the Aviation Environment Federation said: “Increased emissions from a third runway at Heathrow, like all the shortlisted expansion options, would breach the climate change target for aviation unless politically challenging measures are introduced to limit growth at other airports or to substantially increase the cost of flying.”</p> \n<p>She added: “The UK has a legal obligation to meet EU air quality legal limits and the Airports Commission still cannot say confidently whether or not expansion would be legal.”</p> \n<p>Friends of the Earth said: “Building a new runway at Gatwick or Heathrow would have a hugely damaging impact on local people and their environment and would be a step backwards in UK efforts to tackle climate change.”</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/324291d300eb4a40d2d14fb098602dcd5a3bbadb/135_0_3279_1969/3279.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1969,"width":3279,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Heathrow Airport/PA","altText":"Artist’s impression of Heathrow airport’s planned third runway.

Here are the key points.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Davies said that David Cameron’s “no ifs, no buts” promise in 2009 to block a third runway at Heathrow applied to a different plan.<br /></strong></li> \n</ul> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The proposal in place then was a deficient proposal; it did not offer the economic advantages of this proposal. It was a short runway to the north of Heathrow, really focussed just on regional links, there was none of the proposals that we are making about the noise framework for the airport, the air quality framework. So, I think the prime minister has a very different proposition to look at today.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Davies summarised the benefits of Heathrow.</strong><br /></li> \n</ul> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The economic benefits of expanding Heathrow are much greater than from any other of the options.

McLoughlin will tell MPs in a statement to the Commons that the government welcomes the report but that ministers will take their time to reach their own decision.</p> \n<p>Senior Conservatives expect that the commission will endorse controversial plans to expand runway capacity at Heathrow, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/25/heathrow-gatwick-airport-campaigns-continue-davies-commission-report\">possibly through a third runway</a>. The commission has also examined the extension of the existing north runway at Heathrow to allow it to operate as two separate runways.</p> \n<p>But the Tories expect Davies to keep open the option of a second runway at Gatwick if the operators of Heathrow are unable to give binding commitments on levels of noise and air pollution at the west London airport. A final, unexpected public consultation on air quality was held in May to focus on an aspect that could have proved a legal obstacle to expanding Heathrow.</p> \n<p>The airports commission, appointed by the last government to overcome divisions within the coalition and between senior Tory cabinet ministers, will present David Cameron and George Osborne with a headache. A recommendation for expansion at Heathrow, with environmental caveats that could point to Gatwick, will prompt warnings from a powerful group of ministers and backbenchers that the government must steer clear of expanding Britain’s biggest airport.</p> \n<p>At least five senior Conservatives, including cabinet ministers Justine Greening, Philip Hammond and Theresa May as well as the London mayor Boris Johnson, are opposed to a third runway at the west London hub. Zac Goldsmith, the frontrunner for the Tory nomination for London mayor, is also an ardent opponent. <br /></p> \n<p>A decision to build there would also be embarrassing for the prime minister, as Cameron unequivocally ruled it out in 2010, pledging “no ifs, no buts”.<br /></p> \n<p>But a highly influential group of Tories with seats in Sussex and parts of Surrey are making clear that they will cause trouble if Gatwick is chosen. The group, led by the former justice minister <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/05/gatwick-mps-warn-political-stitch-up-boris-johnson-anti-heathrow\">Crispin Blunt</a> and including the support of Sir Nicholas Soames, have demanded that ministers opposed to expansion at Heathrow should recuse themselves from the decision-making process.</p> \n<p>The Gatwick coordination group took heart from an assurance by Davies that he would reach a clear decision. In a letter to Blunt, who had called for a “crystal clear recommendation”, Davies wrote on 17 June: “I can assure you that your points are well understood and that we will make a clear recommendation based on the appraisal framework we set out earlier.”</p> \n<p>Blunt said: “I am confident that a clear decision will be made and that can only be a recommendation that a third runway is built at Heathrow or the extension [of its north runway]. The show stoppers for Gatwick are practical – infrastructure and there is no local labour force to deliver it. It would be possible to make an economically disastrous decision but sensible people tend not to.”</p> \n<p>Business leaders have demanded quick action from government after the report is published.</p> \n<p>Airlines and business leaders have mainly backed Heathrow, although the noise and pollution it creates close to the centre of London makes it politically fraught. Campaigners have warned that Britain would not meet its CO2 targets to tackle climate change should a third runway go ahead, although the commission has claimed it is possible.</p> \n<p>The British Chambers of Commerce called on the government to act swiftly: “Failure to invest in capacity is hampering business growth and costing jobs.” <br /></p> \n<p>Its director general, John Longworth, said: “Unless the UK overhauls its lacklustre approach to managing infrastructure and gets serious about investment, we risk falling behind in the global race. </p> \n<p>“We need the government to make irreversible commitments to new airport capacity and … speed up the delivery of projects that help strengthen the economy.”</p> \n<p>The Airport Operators Association released a poll of MPs showing three-quarters agreed that the government should commit to acting on Davies’s recommendations “as soon” as they are delivered.<br /></p> \n<p>Heathrow has given the prime minister some cover for a potential U-turn by submitting a different plan from 2010. A separate proposal for Heathrow expansion, shortlisted by Davies, from the Heathrow Hub group could also give some leeway by extending the current northern runway to allow take-offs and landings on the same strip. Jock Lowe of Heathrow Hub said: “We’re not a third runway. Politicians said no third runway, not no longer second runway.”<br /></p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7e0e9dce7895c6941fb82afc57d558a92bafcea9/0_49_4386_2632/4386.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2632,"width":4386,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters","altText":"A British Airways 747 with it's undercarriage deployed approaches Heathrow airport over Richmond in west London, June 19, 2015.

We’re just a bit ill-equipped. We don’t have air conditioning. Milky tea is our national drink. So help us out? Over on Guardian Witness, we’ve been collecting advice from readers living in hot countries on what they do to cope in the heat, while they also take the time to give us variations of “you call that hot?” In my country this would be considered mild and I’d be considering putting on a jumper.”. Slow and necessary I grew up in South Africa where summers can be very hot and winters mild. You learn to keep cool in the following ways: be economic with your body movements - there is no need to rush around or unnecessarily flap your appendages about, or even walk and talk. Fewer, more fluid movements keep your body temperature down, so practice the art of slow and necessary movement. Place a bowl of ice cubes underneath a portable fan, or drape a cold tea towel rung out in ice water over the protective grid to make sure the fan blows cool air around. Remember that heat rises, so it is cooler nearer the floor and sit / lie down there rather than sitting in chairs or standing up. Do most things that involve using body energy in the cooler times of the day ie eating or exercising in the early morning or late evening. Have a cool shower before bed and go to bed with wet hair. This keeps your head cool at night and you wake up with nice dry hair in the morning. The key to handling hot weather is just to go with its flow. Sent via GuardianWitness.

Pour a small amount of salt into the middle & twist. Tear off the remaining tissue and you have a nugget sized, tasteless 'salt bomp'. Knock this back with a glass of sweet lime soda & within ten minutes you are refreshed & ready for whatever Mother India has in store for you. These days I suffer from low blood pressure & use this for dizzy spells. Works brilliantly. Sent via GuardianWitness. By mammakay. 1 July 2015, 4:42.

You learn to keep cool in the following ways: be economic with your body movements - there is no need to rush around or unnecessarily flap your appendages about, or even walk and talk. Fewer, more fluid movements keep your body temperature down, so practice the art of slow and necessary movement. Place a bowl of ice cubes underneath a portable fan, or drape a cold tea towel rung out in ice water over the protective grid to make sure the fan blows cool air around. Remember that heat rises, so it is cooler nearer the floor and sit / lie down there rather than sitting in chairs or standing up. Do most things that involve using body energy in the cooler times of the day ie eating or exercising in the early morning or late evening. Have a cool shower before bed and go to bed with wet hair. This keeps your head cool at night and you wake up with nice dry hair in the morning. The key to handling hot weather is just to go with its flow.</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <footer class=\"element-witness--footer\"> \n  <p class=\"element-witness--source\">Sent via <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/\" class=\"element-witness--brand\" itemprop=\"provider\">GuardianWitness</a></p> \n  <div class=\"element-witness--metadata\"> \n   <p class=\"element-witness--author\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> By <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/artsyfartsy\" class=\"element-witness--author-name\" itemprop=\"name\">artsyfartsy</a> </p> \n   <p class=\"element-witness--date\"> <time itemprop=\"dateCreated\" datetime=\"2015-06-30T18:22:27Z\">30 June 2015, 19:22</time> </p> \n  </div> \n </footer> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-witness element-witness-text\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/WebPageElement\" data-canonical-url=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55928c56e4b0a9ccc5ace5ad/1596580\"> \n <div class=\"element-witness--main\"> \n  <h3 class=\"element-witness--title\" itemprop=\"name\"><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55928c56e4b0a9ccc5ace5ad/1596580\" itemprop=\"url\">Man Man Lai</a></h3> \n  <div itemprop=\"text\"> \n   <p>I live in Taipei where it regularly reaches 35-36 C in the summer. &quot;Man man lai&quot; means roughly &quot;take your time&quot;.

You learn to keep cool in the following ways: be economic with your body movements - there is no need to rush around or unnecessarily flap your appendages about, or even walk and talk. Fewer, more fluid movements keep your body temperature down, so practice the art of slow and necessary movement. Place a bowl of ice cubes underneath a portable fan, or drape a cold tea towel rung out in ice water over the protective grid to make sure the fan blows cool air around. Remember that heat rises, so it is cooler nearer the floor and sit / lie down there rather than sitting in chairs or standing up. Do most things that involve using body energy in the cooler times of the day ie eating or exercising in the early morning or late evening. Have a cool shower before bed and go to bed with wet hair. This keeps your head cool at night and you wake up with nice dry hair in the morning. The key to handling hot weather is just to go with its flow.</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <footer class=\"element-witness--footer\"> \n  <p class=\"element-witness--source\">Sent via <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/\" class=\"element-witness--brand\" itemprop=\"provider\">GuardianWitness</a></p> \n  <div class=\"element-witness--metadata\"> \n   <p class=\"element-witness--author\" itemprop=\"author\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> By <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/artsyfartsy\" class=\"element-witness--author-name\" itemprop=\"name\">artsyfartsy</a> </p> \n   <p class=\"element-witness--date\"> <time itemprop=\"dateCreated\" datetime=\"2015-06-30T18:22:27Z\">30 June 2015, 19:22</time> </p> \n  </div> \n </footer> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-witness element-witness-text\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/WebPageElement\" data-canonical-url=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55928c56e4b0a9ccc5ace5ad/1596580\"> \n <div class=\"element-witness--main\"> \n  <h3 class=\"element-witness--title\" itemprop=\"name\"><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55928c56e4b0a9ccc5ace5ad/1596580\" itemprop=\"url\">Man Man Lai</a></h3> \n  <div itemprop=\"text\"> \n   <p>I live in Taipei where it regularly reaches 35-36 C in the summer. &quot;Man man lai&quot; means roughly &quot;take your time&quot;.

In August 2003, temperatures were the highest recorded in the UK, and rose to 38C during a nine-day heatwave.</p> \n<h2><br /></h2> \n<h2>How to deal with the heat</h2> \n<p>Hot summer days are a rarity in Britain, no one likes to be told they should be huddled inside. Mainly, the advice from PHE is just to be sensible.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bea84aa47011851128bbb6596e6622c704fc3db9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435655424445/eaace7bd-e760-424a-9a2e-506de7f1cb81-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Early morning sunshine overlooking Hastings, East Sussex, on 30 June.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Early morning sunshine overlooking Hastings, East Sussex, on 30 June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Pugh/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li>Cold beers don’t hydrate you - drink plenty of water and keep a bottle with you in case you feel unwell, especially on public transport.</li> \n <li>If you’re outside in the day, spend your time in the shade.</li> \n <li>Wear a hat in the sun, and sunglasses to protect your eyes.</li> \n <li>Eat normally, but salads and fruit can help you keep cooler.</li> \n <li>Stay out of the sun during the hottest parts of the day between 11am and 3pm – most of us will probably be at work then anyway.</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Keeping the house cool</h2> \n<p>“We know people in Britain are actually quite well aware of how to keep themselves cool during the day,” said Angie Bone, who is in charge of extreme events and health protection at PHE. “What Brits can be really bad at, which people in southern Europe are really good at, is keeping environments cool.</p> \n<p>“When it’s a sunny day, we throw open our doors and windows, and don’t realise that’s just letting the heat in. Then we might get back from work and wonder why the house is so hot and can’t sleep.”</p> \n<p>PHE advises keeping windows shut and blinds or curtains closed while it’s at its hottest outside – and then open later when it gets cooler. Work out the coolest room in the house so you know where to go to chill out – or take a cold shower.</p> \n<h2><p>Can you ever drink too much water?</p></h2> \n<p>There are instances when people can drink too much water, and that “can be very dangerous”, Bone said. “We have seen it for example when people take ecstasy in nightclubs, or among professional sportspeople. But it is very unusual for normal people to drink so much it becomes dangerous.”</p> \n<p>Unless you have a medical issues such as liver problems which might require limiting your fluid intake, just listen to your body, Bone advised. You should be able to tell when you’ve had the right amount to drink, and follow the NHS advice to drink around 1.6 litres of water a day. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5228a3e4e0f549d370ece17c474b61ee4f8b8624\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435655343379/d1175b45-f671-4b79-a104-752cdda14c92-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Darcie Kennedy, aged two, cools off in the water fountains at Granary Square in King's Cross,on 29 June.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darcie Kennedy, aged two, cools off in the water fountains at Granary Square in King’s Cross, on 29 June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Stillwell/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Remember people who might be in difficulty</h2> \n<p>Make a phone call to friends and relatives who might be more vulnerable to heat, those who are elderly, sick, pregnant or with small children.</p> \n<p>Normal healthy people will generally cope with hot temperatures, but the elderly, or those suffering from heart or lung conditions, or long-term illnesses such as Parkinson’s, might have more problems changing their clothing, keeping their homes cool or adapting how much water they drink.</p> \n<p>“All of us will know someone who might have more difficulty coping with the heat,” Bone said. “Give them a call, check on them to see if they are having problems and help them adapt.”</p> \n<h2>Will it disrupt my day?</h2> \n<p>It might, because British offices and other workplaces can be unprepared for the hottest days, and because rail travel is likely to be affected.</p> \n<p>There is a legal limit for working in cold temperatures, 16C, but there is no upper limit, probably because it doesn’t happen very often. </p> \n<p>Trade unions are urging firms are being urged to let workers wear casual clothes during the heatwave. The TUC has asked employers to let workers wear shorts or vest tops, rather than jackets and ties. </p> \n<p>It’s in employers’ interests, the TUC argue, because employees dressed in full suits working with no air conditioning are likely to feel very lethargic.</p> \n<p>“Clearly vest tops and shorts are not suitable attire for all front line staff, but those not dealing with the public should be able to discard their tights, ties and suits,” said Frances O’Grady, TUC general secretary.</p> \n<p>That’s if you can get to work. Network Rail has imposed a speed restriction on some services to stop the rails from buckling. </p> \n<p>“As rails are made out of steel, they expand as they heat up and are subject to strong compression,” Network Rail said on its website. “This expansion has to be managed to reduce the risk of track buckling. If the track does buckle, the line must be closed and the track repaired before services can resume, causing considerable disruption. Usually, these repairs can’t be done until the temperature of the rails has dropped.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a85113cc1669f720487af2c8e529e3c586825929\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435655516223/8526541c-262c-45b5-92f0-5240a0757a77-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A women enjoys the afternoon sunshine on a terrace of the South Bank Centre in London on 29 June.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A women enjoys the afternoon sunshine on a terrace of the South Bank Centre in London on 29 June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niklas Halle'n/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>First Great Western services in the Thames Valley area will be hit from midday to 8pm. “As a result there will be no fast trains between London Paddington and Bourne End or Henley-on-Thames from 12pm until 8pm on Tuesday,” a spokesman said, with earlier terminations on some services.</p> \n<h2>What should I do if I feel unwell?</h2> \n<p>If someone feels unwell, and you suspect they might have heat exhaustion, find a cool place where they can rest and encourage them to take a drink. </p> \n<p>Heatstroke is a serious medical issue, and can develop if heat exhaustion is untreated, but it can also occur suddenly.

The country failed to make a €1.5bn payment to the International Monetary Fund on time and has thrust the eurozone into an emergency.</p> \n<p>The long-running debt debacle left Greece on the brink of financial collapse, worsening recent years of wrenching austerity, and represented a historic blow to a Europe committed to the irreversibility of its 16-year-old single currency.</p> \n<p>The deadline on Greece’s bailout programmes, inaugurated in 2010, ended at midnight on Tuesday night, leaving the country without a financial lifeline.</p> \n<p>In a sudden referendum called on creditors’ bailout terms which are formally no longer on the table, Greeks are to vote on Sunday on what EU leaders say is a choice between quitting or staying in the euro.</p> \n<p>After a fortnight of non-stop brinkmanship at the highest level of EU leadership over how to resolve the impasse over Greece’s financial rescue, the leftwing Syriza government of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, tabled surprise new proposals on Tuesday, demanding that the bailout be rolled over into a new two-year programme worth almost €30bn to Greece to be spent on servicing debt.</p> \n<p>The demand included calls for a month of bridging finance to avoid the IMF default and for broader debt relief without mentioning Greek concessions in return for acceptance. It was promptly spurned by key creditors as too little too late.</p> \n<p>“We won’t negotiate about anything new at all until a referendum, as planned, takes place,” said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. “This evening the programme expires.”</p> \n<p>The 19 finance ministers of the single currency bloc talked for merely an hour by teleconference on Tuesday evening and dismissed the last-minute brinkmanship from Tsipras.</p> \n<p>But Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the committee, said the ministers would confer again on Wednesday and that Athens was expected to present further proposals on how to resolve the critical situation.</p> \n<p>Tuesday’s rollercoaster of on-off negotiations marked the lowest of lows in the eurozone’s five-year sovereign debt saga. As the midnight bailout deadline approached, hope of striking a deal between the creditors and the radical leftists in Athens dissolved.</p> \n<p>There will be no more IMF lending after the failure to repay the debt. And for the first time since 2010, Greece is bereft of a eurozone and European Central Bank package keeping it afloat.</p> \n<p>The Greek government insisted on Tuesday the ballot meant Athens remained at the negotiating table, while rejecting the terms on offer. Eurozone leaders maintained that the vote was tantamount to a choice of whether or not to stay in the single currency.</p> \n<p>After stunning fellow EU leaders last Saturday by calling the referendum, Tsipras delivered his last-minute bombshell by writing to eurozone leaders demanding a new, separate two-year bailout hours before the current arrangements lapsed.</p> \n<p>Tsipras called the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, on Monday evening, to explore a possible last-minute way out of the crisis after the Greeks abandoned talks with the eurozone late on Friday and called the referendum. <br /></p> \n<p>Tsipras was told he could accept the creditors’ slightly amended final offer from last Friday and that he would have to campaign for a yes vote in the referendum if he was serious about rescuing a bad situation. He has strongly recommended a no in the vote on Sunday.</p> \n<p>“We see the referendum as part of the negotiation process, not in lieu of it. We look forward to greater flexibility in the days to come,” said Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece’s chief negotiator, as he listed several reasons why the terms from the so-called troika of the European commission, European Central Bank and IMF had to be spurned.</p> \n<p>During a day of gambles, demands and standoffs , Tsipras’s aides remained in telephone contact with commission officials for most of Tuesday before the Greek leader delivered his final move.</p> \n<p> He asked for bridging loans to get him through the IMF non-payment problem and for a new two-year programme covering almost €29bn in debt servicing costs as well as debt relief measures. There was nothing in his letter to Juncker, Klaus Regling, the head of the eurozone’s bailout fund, and Pierre Moscovici, the commissioner for monetary affairs, to indicate what his government was prepared to accept in return for a new deal.</p> \n<p>Any such arrangement would come with tight strings attached. Tsipras has already rejected the creditors’ terms. If he wins his no vote, the Germans and others believe he has burnt his boats and bid farewell to the euro. If he loses to a large yes vote, however, eurozone leaders would be keen to strike a new deal but not with Tsipras, whom they do not trust to deliver.</p> \n<p>A new rescue package would take time to negotiate with no guarantees of a successful conclusion. An agreement on more loans for Greece would need to pass through several eurozone parliaments, including the Bundestag in Berlin where it would get a rough ride.</p> \n<p>Juncker earlier told Tsipras that a last-minute deal was possible if Athens agreed to sign up to the creditors’ proposals presented last Friday. The commission president also dangled the prospects of debt relief for Greece and a €35bn “new start for jobs and growth” programme.</p> \n<p>That appeared to be old wine in new bottles. The €35bn is unlikely to be new money while the debt relief suggestion is the revival of a conditional offer to the previous Greek government from 2012.</p> \n<p>In the past five months, Tsipras has persistently blocked agreement on the current bailout which would have released €7.2bn in return for meeting fiscal targets, spending cuts, and tax rises. He has aimed to get the current programme dropped and wrapped into a new one involving debt relief.</p> \n<p>Since the weekend eurozone leaders desperate to avoid the blame for the departure of the first country from the currency have been declaring that the door remains open to more talks. Tsipras’s gambit on Tuesday tested the credibility of that pledge. But it appeared that it came too late.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435703679928/71549155-f26e-442c-9f22-ff6266138d3e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Petros Karadjias/AP","altText":"Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Petros Karadjias/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T22:47:02Z","lastModified":"2015-07-01T00:23:14Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2268,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian Traynor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/iantraynor"},{"name":"Jennifer Rankin","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jennifer-rankin"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Greece","Europe","Alexis Tsipras","European Union","International Monetary Fund (IMF)","Economics","Eurozone crisis","European Central Bank","European monetary union","European banks","Euro"],"tags":[{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/alexis-tsipras","webTitle":"Alexis Tsipras"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"business/imf","webTitle":"International Monetary Fund (IMF)"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis"},{"id":"business/european-central-bank","webTitle":"European Central Bank"},{"id":"business/emu","webTitle":"European monetary union"},{"id":"business/europeanbanks","webTitle":"European banks"},{"id":"business/euro","webTitle":"Euro"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/30/eurozone-emergency-greece-without-financial-lifeline","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9tn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/30/eurozone-emergency-greece-without-financial-lifeline","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/30/eurozone-emergency-greece-without-financial-lifeline"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435703679928/71549155-f26e-442c-9f22-ff6266138d3e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" Greece goes to the polls on Sunday in a referendum called by Tsipras to vote on whether to accept bailout terms which are no longer on the table.

An extraordinary state of affairs given that – on one level at least – the only thing happening this weekend is that Greece, a country representing just 2% of the entire EU population, will hold a referendum on whether or not to accept the latest deal offered by creditors. The rhetoric coming from Athens is as heated, where there is talk of European “blackmail” against the free will of Greek voters, as if Europe’s creditor nations don’t have voters of their own. If cool heads are to prevail, they must first reflect on how things have turned so sour. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/live/2015/jun/30/greek-debt-crisis-day-of-decision-for-tsipras\" title=\"\">Unless a last-minute deal can be reached between Greece and its creditors</a>, the only thing that can be hoped for is serious damage limitation. In&nbsp;the worst-case scenario of a Greek exit from the euro, it would pile disaster upon disaster if the country were to leave the European Union. Europe must stare into this abyss to&nbsp;prevent itself from falling into it.</p> \n<p>No side bears sole blame for the current mess. From the very start, the idea of a common European currency was built on a logical flaw. Put at its crudest, monetary union all but requires fiscal union, which in turn requires political union. Yet when the euro was launched, there were no such institutions or mechanisms, just the perennial but vague hope of ever closer union. What’s more, the world’s largest currency area was run on two unsustainable economic motors: Germany exporting ever more to southern Europe and the rest of the world, and southern Europe relying on cheap credit. That fragile system was crushed under the rubble of the financial crisis.</p> \n<p>Nor is there much dispute that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/29/alexis-tsipras-must-be-stopped-the-underlying-message-of-europes-leaders\" title=\"\">creditors have mismanaged the Greek dossier</a> ever since the first bailout in 2010. The troika of creditors – the European Central Bank, the EU commission and the IMF – told Greece that the only way to fix its economy was to adopt severe austerity, medicine that felt to Greeks like the shredding of cherished labour rights and benefits. This programme not only failed to make the debt sustainable; it has recreated the kind of poverty that western Europe thought it had left behind. Meanwhile, the bulk of the €240bn (&pound;170bn) total bailout money Greece received in 2010 and 2012 <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/29/where-did-the-greek-bailout-money-go\" title=\"\">went&nbsp;straight back to the banks</a> that lent it money before the crash.</p> \n<p>But both sides in this clash have motives of their own, not all of them unconnected with democracy. The creditors point to some of Europe’s poorest nations, the likes of Portugal and Ireland, whose voters have endured their own austerity and who would look askance if Greece were now let off the hook. Even the reviled IMF can explain its hard line: given the bitter programmes it has imposed on countries from the global south, it can hardly now be lenient towards a European country that is, relatively, better off.</p> \n<p>Greece’s woes are not wholly of others’ making. Witness the decades of clientelist Greek politics of left and right, the notoriously poor tax collection, and the fudging of statistics when the country joined the euro in 2001. Much of this predated Alexis&nbsp;Tsipras and Syriza, but it’s also true that the party won power in January partly by&nbsp;promising that less would have to change than, in reality, it would.</p> \n<p>Nor has the Greek prime minister helped his cause by framing Sunday’s referendum question in terms that hardly suggest a great democratic moment. The question put to Greek voters is so technical that it defies understanding, and it relates to an offer (made by creditors on 25 June) that has since disappeared. Negotiations were cut off by Greece before a belated new offer could even&nbsp;be considered.</p> \n<p>For all that, Greece’s break from the eurozone, not to mention the EU, would amount to a historic weakening of Europe at moment when solidarity has never been more needed. It may be possible to have a Greek default without a Grexit from the euro, but that will require much creativity – something that has been lacking from this generation of unstatesmanlike European leaders. It is also unclear whether a euro-Grexit would lead to a Greek withdrawal from the EU altogether: the legal debate is complex. This would nevertheless be the absolute worst scenario. A Greek exit from the EU is an outcome no one should want. Whatever the result of the Greek referendum, Europe must not be allowed to self-destruct. The brinkmanship must end, if the 60-year-old project of a peaceful, united Europe is to be pulled back from the brink.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d736ee7e1ae4d95592d17cbfdaaccadeab745afa/0_386_5757_3454/5757.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3454,"width":5757,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Petros Karadjias/AP","altText":"Demonstrators hold Greek flags during a rally organised by supporters of the yes vote for the upcoming referendum","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Petros Karadjias/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T19:42:34Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T23:01:15Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Editorial","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/editorial"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Greece","Europe","Eurozone","International Monetary Fund (IMF)","Syriza","Alexis Tsipras"],"tags":[{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"business/eurozone","webTitle":"Eurozone"},{"id":"business/imf","webTitle":"International Monetary Fund (IMF)"},{"id":"world/syriza","webTitle":"Syriza"},{"id":"world/alexis-tsipras","webTitle":"Alexis Tsipras"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Editorial","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/editorial"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/30/the-guardian-view-on-the-greek-crisis-the-european-project-itself-is-at-stake","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9gm","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/30/the-guardian-view-on-the-greek-crisis-the-european-project-itself-is-at-stake","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/30/the-guardian-view-on-the-greek-crisis-the-european-project-itself-is-at-stake"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d736ee7e1ae4d95592d17cbfdaaccadeab745afa/0_386_5757_3454/5757.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3454,"width":5757,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘A Greek exit from the EU is an outcome no one should want.

Hunt will highlight the case of a man found in Edinburgh last week three years after he died, and the eight council-funded “lonely funerals” a day in England, half of which involve over-65s.</p> \n<p>“Are we really saying these people had no living relatives or friends? Or is it something sadder, namely that the busy, atomised lives we increasingly lead mean that too often we have become so distant from blood relatives that we don’t have any idea even when they are dying?” Hunt will tell the annual conference of the Local Government Association. </p> \n<p>“In Japan, nearly 30,000 people die alone every year and they have even coined a word for it, <em>kudokushi,</em> which means ‘lonely death’. How many lonely deaths do we have in Britain where, according to Age UK, a million older people have not spoken to anyone in the last month?”</p> \n<p>Hunt will also urge people to be more careful about drawing on “finite NHS resources” and to display greater personal responsibility by taking better care of their own health in order to reduce lifestyle-related illness such as obesity, diabetes and cancer. </p> \n<p>Hunt will praise the work of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/social-care-network/2014/may/23/shared-lives-community-based-supporting-adults\">Shared Lives</a>, a charity that pays people to let vulnerable individuals – including pensioners who have recently come out of hospital or suffered a bereavement – stay with them until they have got back on their feet. Recipients also include people with learning disabilities and mental illness. </p> \n<p>Around 12,000 people across the UK receive accommodation and support through the scheme, which describes itself as providing “a unique way to live well and feel independent but not alone”. Half live with families on a long-term basis and half temporarily. </p> \n<p>Hosts receive payment for the care and support they provide. The arrangement is estimated to save &pound;26,000 in care costs for someone with learning disabilities, and &pound;8,000 for an individual with mental health problems. </p> \n<p>Hunt will say that the UK’s six million carers and a strong network of charities do great work but are not enough to help ensure the growing number of older people get the support they need. “If we are to rise to the challenges we face, taking care of older relatives and friends will need to become part of all of our lives,” he will say.</p> \n<p>Talking to a boss about elderly care should become as normal as discussing childcare arrangements, he will add. </p> \n<p>While stressing the need for the NHS to be efficient and to spend every pound of its &pound;110bn budget wisely, Hunt will say: “There is a role for patients here too. There is no such thing as a free health service: everything we are proud of in the NHS is funded by taxpayers and every penny we waste costs patients more through higher taxes.”<br /></p> \n<p>His call for people to live healthier lives to ease the strain on the increasingly overburdened NHS echoes a policy already being pursued by Wales’s Labour government. Its “prudent healthcare” initiative seeks to tackle “the twin challenges of rising costs and increasing demand, while continuing to improve the quality of care”.</p> \n<p>Citing greater personal responsibility as a way to relieve the strain on the NHS, Hunt will say: “The best person to prevent a long-term condition developing is not the doctor, it’s you.” </p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435690096826/8dece369-e286-4e34-b9fa-4027dad6e4b4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dave and Les Jacobs/Blend Images/Corbis","altText":"Carer and older woman","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dave and Les Jacobs/Blend Images/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T23:01:01Z","lastModified":"2015-07-01T00:05:58Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Denis Campbell","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/deniscampbell"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Older people","Jeremy Hunt","Social care","Health","Society","UK news","Health policy","Politics"],"tags":[{"id":"society/older-people","webTitle":"Older people"},{"id":"politics/jeremy-hunt","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt"},{"id":"society/social-care","webTitle":"Social care"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/health","webTitle":"Health policy"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Denis Campbell","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/deniscampbell"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/01/invite-lonely-elderly-strangers-home-jeremy-hunt","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9g6","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jul/01/invite-lonely-elderly-strangers-home-jeremy-hunt","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/01/invite-lonely-elderly-strangers-home-jeremy-hunt"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435690096826/8dece369-e286-4e34-b9fa-4027dad6e4b4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"People are leading increasingly ‘atomised lives’ and becoming too distant from their elderly relatives, said health secretary Jeremy Hunt.

The trust blocked moves to use the spectrum for a cheaper BBC1+1 time-adjusted channel.</p> \n<p>With the BBC trying to protect its remaining television channels and radio stations, it is expected that job cuts could run into the high hundreds or more from its 18,000 workforce.<br /></p> \n<p>“Having to find another &pound;150m inevitably makes decisions even tougher, but the director general has always said he came here to make the BBC a simpler and leaner place,” said the source. “None of this is easy, but his priority is what appears on screen and on the airwaves. Everything else must be reduced to a bare minimum.”<br /></p> \n<p>A green paper on the future of the BBC is expected to be published in the coming weeks, with the BBC facing a financial and political onslaught from Conservative ministers. <br /></p> \n<p>In recent weeks, ministers have: </p> \n<ul> \n <li>Warned that the BBC was at risk of being closed down if it did not deal with rightwing charges of leftwing bias. Nick Robinson, the BBC’s political editor, said David Cameron had threatened during the election campaign that he would “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/21/nick-robinson-cameron-threatened-close-down-bbc-election-bus\">close them down after the election</a>”. </li> \n <li>Considered whether to insist that the BBC pay for the &pound;700m-a-year charge of providing free television for the over-75s. Currently funded by the Treasury, the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/may/12/john-whittingdale-backed-bbc-paying-500m-cost-of-tv-licences-for-over-75s\">BBC governors threatened to resign </a>the last time this was mooted in 2010.</li> \n <li>Examined decriminalising non-payers of the &pound;145.50-a-year licence fee, which the BBC estimates would cost it a further &pound;200m.</li> \n <li>Debated whether to impose a new governance structure in charter renewal negotiations in which the BBC Trust would be closed to make way for external regulation from communications regulator Ofcom or a new organisation dubbed “Ofbeeb”. In an interview with Radio Times in April, the chancellor, George Osborne, signalled that he favoured the handover of BBC regulation from the BBC Trust to Ofcom.</li> \n</ul> \n<p></p> \n<p>Against that backdrop , the BBC has discovered a shortfall in its forecast income for 2016-17: a total of about &pound;3.7bn collected largely from licence fee payers is &pound;150m less than had been forecast. The deficit has emerged because increasing numbers of people have become aware of a loophole that allows people not to pay the licence fee if they only watch catch-up television. </p> \n<p>One BBC source said: “Change has come much faster than anyone predicted.” </p> \n<p>Since becoming director general two years ago, Hall, a former BBC head of news, has drawn up plans to save money by capping payoffs and introducing pay restraint. The BBC News division announced plans to<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2014/jul/17/bbc-news-cuts-digital-james-harding\"> cut 400 jobs last July.</a></p> \n<p>With the government looking for savings in next week’s budget as well as the autumn spending review, BBC insiders fear its licence fee funding in the runup to the end of its current charter in 18 months’ time will be a target.<br /></p> \n<p>With a full response to the green paper not expected until Hall makes a major speech at the RTS convention in Cambridge in September, the BBC is likely to argue that the licence fee should be modernised to include catch-up TV.</p> \n<p>The BBC is set to release details of a new study by auditors PWC which suggests that the corporation is already among the most efficient organisations in the public sector. It shows just 8% of spending is on general overheads, well below the average of 11.2% in the public sector. </p> \n<p>As part of its fightback against those who accuse it of waste, the BBC last year unveiled a report which said that administrative and property savings, pay restraint and staff cuts had already led to savings of more than &pound;1.5bn a year by 2017. </p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e33ac4bf9f0377a3126753ac9623ef33482de532/0_87_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jeff Overs/BBC/PA","altText":"Handout photo issued by the BBC of the gallery screen as Sophie Raworth presents today's BBC News at One for the new BBC newsroom studio at Broadcasting House, which is now home to the BBC News at One, Six and Ten and the BBC News Channel.

But many low income households are still much worse off than in 2008, leaving them struggling to make ends meet and reliant on benefits to top up their incomes.</p> \n<p>“A couple with two children who each earn the minimum wage faces a shortfall of almost &pound;4,000 a year between their incomes and what the public say they need for a minimum standard of living. </p> \n<p>“We need to see action to raise wages, build more genuinely affordable homes and tackle the UK’s low productivity to help people get on at work.”</p> \n<p>Donald Hirsch, director of the centre for research in social policy, Loughborough University and author of the report, said: “Even though earnings are forecast to grow healthily in the next few years, rising prices will prevent low earners from becoming better off if their tax credits are frozen – and more so if threats to cut them are implemented in the forthcoming budget.”</p> \n<p>A government spokesman claimed that the report showed that people on low incomes have become better off relative to their needs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/pensions-zip/giv-21277MC7Ay4MdiC26/\" data-alt=\"Pension credits gap\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/pensions-zip/giv-21277MC7Ay4MdiC26/\">Pension credits gap</a> \n</figure> \n<p>He added: “We will continue to ensure that every part of Britain benefits from a growing economy and that everyone who works hard gets the opportunities they need to succeed.</p> \n<p> “And as part of our long-term economic plan, our reforms to the tax system are allowing people to keep more of what they earn.”</p> \n<p> TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “This report reveals the living standards crisis is far from over. Wages have fallen in real terms, with vital benefits reduced and public services scaled back. Too many of those in work cannot afford an acceptable standard of living.</p> \n<p>“This research shows why Britain needs a pay rise not tax credit cuts. Unless we see stronger real wage increases and more decent jobs, the recovery will remain out of reach for many working families.”</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435710365150/0b297eda-9387-4dd9-a85e-0bdbbb0b58d6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graham Turner for the Guardian","altText":"Julia Unwin Joseph Rowntree Foundation","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-01T07:49:16Z","lastModified":"2015-07-01T07:51:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Butler","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patrickbutler"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Minimum wage","Benefits","TUC","Politics","Society","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"society/minimum-wage","webTitle":"Minimum wage"},{"id":"society/benefits","webTitle":"Benefits"},{"id":"politics/tuc","webTitle":"TUC"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Patrick Butler","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/patrickbutler"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/01/low-income-families-thousands-pounds-short-basic-standard-living-joseph-rowntree-foundation","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9cz","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jul/01/low-income-families-thousands-pounds-short-basic-standard-living-joseph-rowntree-foundation","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/01/low-income-families-thousands-pounds-short-basic-standard-living-joseph-rowntree-foundation"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435710365150/0b297eda-9387-4dd9-a85e-0bdbbb0b58d6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Julia Unwin, the chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said there needs to be more action to raise wages.
