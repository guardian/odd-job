The EU may have made “serious mistakes” in the crisis, he said, but it was vital that Greece remained in Europe’s hard core.</p> \n<p> “Staying within the European family is imperative not only on economic and social grounds … it is, foremost, imperative on national [security] grounds,” he said.</p> \n<p> “By pushing Greece out of the European context, we expose the country to dangers. This should not happen in any way. Those who, with good intentions think that by voting no on Sunday, they strengthen the negotiating position of the country are making a mistake … no will be interpreted by the whole world as a choice of withdrawal from the heart of Europe. It will be the first step towards exit.” </p> \n<p>The intervention, buttressed by similar appeals from Antonis Samaras and Constantine Mitsotakis, also former conservative premiers, added unexpected gravitas to the campaign now being waged by those who believe Athens must remain in the euro, at any cost.<br /></p> \n<p>“We need people and it’s a good thing he did finally decide to speak,” said Thanos Veremis, an emeritus professor of political science at Athens University. “A ‘no’ at this point would be terribly destructive. It would take Greece out of the euro and then gradually out of Europe itself.” <br /></p> \n<p>Karamanlis’s uncle, Konstantine Karamanlis, oversaw the country’s entry to what was then the European Economic Community in 1981. The politician is also reputed to have good relations with the radical leftists now in power even if, ironically, during his five-year term in office – beginning in the golden year of the 2004 Athens Olympics – Greece’s deficit soared.</p> \n<p>The hiring of an estimated 150,000 civil servants, under a government that took clientelist politics and profligacy to previously unseen heights, is widely blamed for the country being forced to seek financial rescue from the EU and International Monetary Fund in late 2009.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457390100__\n</div> \n<p>With polls showing the outcome of the referendum as being too close to call, the appeals by all three former leaders quickly elicited fury from a government openly urging Greeks to reject reforms it says will only exacerbate the nation’s economic death spiral.</p> \n<p>Prime minister Alexis Tsipras’s Syriza party has denounced what it says are deliberate efforts to intimidate voters into supporting the yes campaign, with the young firebrand insisting that a no vote would not be tantamount to endorsing euro exit. <br /></p> \n<p>On Thursday, the left-leaning daily Syntaktwn railed against the “machine of terror” that had cast its shadow over the ballot, placing the German chancellor Angela Merkel as the centrepiece in a group of machine cogs.</p> \n<p>“We are watching a crush of former prime ministers and political figures rushing to defend a yes vote,” the government spokesman Gavriel Sakellarides said in a statement.</p> \n<p>“That’s their right. However, it is also the right of the people not to forget them. And to decide about their dignity and interests undistracted from blackmail and unprecedented propaganda.” <br /></p> \n<p>Tsipras’s shock decision to hold the referendum – a move that effectively killed five months of ongoing, if fraught, negotiations between Athens and creditors – has triggered anger and fear, with both palpable on the streets of the capital as the chasm grows between the two camps. <br /></p> \n<p>Athens mayor, George Kaminis, said voters had been posed with a false dilemma that lay behind a question, which was not only unclear but lacked legal validity because the proposed cash for reform deal was no longer on the table. <br /></p> \n<p>“The real question is whether we want Greece in or out of the European Union and the eurozone,” he told reporters. “As a result of this referendum, our country risks being completely isolated within the European Union and facing even worse hardships and threats.”</p> \n<p>With tensions mounting, Syriza party supporters accused municipal authorities of waging a campaign to rid Athens of anything associated with the no vote. </p> \n<p>“We’ve had a lot of complaints that they’ve been removing no posters,” said Elthina Angelopoulou, who heads the Syriza-aligned bloc in the town hall. “We will go and put them back up. There is so much propaganda against us but what we know and believe is that after five years of austerity we will win.”<br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/017f8d98532b98076d0a15a9c8e967d36b3f1cce/0_229_4394_2636/4394.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2636,"width":4394,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"EU flag burn","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T06:47:56Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T06:47:58Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":760,"contributors":[{"name":"Helena Smith","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/helenasmith"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Greece","Syriza","Eurozone crisis","Eurozone","European Union","World news","Financial sector","Financial crisis","European monetary union","European banks","Europe","Euro","Currencies","European Central Bank","Economics","Business","Banking","International Monetary Fund (IMF)"],"tags":[{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"},{"id":"world/syriza","webTitle":"Syriza"},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis"},{"id":"business/eurozone","webTitle":"Eurozone"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"business/financial-sector","webTitle":"Financial sector"},{"id":"business/financial-crisis","webTitle":"Financial crisis"},{"id":"business/emu","webTitle":"European monetary union"},{"id":"business/europeanbanks","webTitle":"European banks"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"business/euro","webTitle":"Euro"},{"id":"business/currencies","webTitle":"Currencies"},{"id":"business/european-central-bank","webTitle":"European Central Bank"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/banking","webTitle":"Banking"},{"id":"business/imf","webTitle":"International Monetary Fund (IMF)"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Helena Smith","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/helenasmith"}}],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-457390100","source":"guardian.co.uk","durationInSeconds":423,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/02/150702AthensUSE_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/02/150702AthensUSE.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/2/1435841214197/KP_338866_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Deal or no deal - Greece gambles with its future - video","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Deal or no deal - Greece gambles with its future - video","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Deal or no deal - Greece gambles with its future - video"}}],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/02/former-greece-pms-throw-support-behind-yes-vote-ahead-of-referendum","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4abeg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/02/former-greece-pms-throw-support-behind-yes-vote-ahead-of-referendum","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/02/former-greece-pms-throw-support-behind-yes-vote-ahead-of-referendum"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/017f8d98532b98076d0a15a9c8e967d36b3f1cce/0_229_4394_2636/4394.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2636,"width":4394,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An anti-EU protester burns an EU flag in front of the European commission offices in Athens.

Altogether, under the package proposed by the institutions to the Greek authorities, these needs are projected to reach about €50bn from October 2015 to the end of 2018, requiring new European money of at least €36bn over the three-year period.”</p> \n<p>The fund said Greece’s financing needs had risen since it completed its study in late June, with paralysis in the economy following the imposition of capital controls last weekend.</p> \n<p>Greece was already back in recession even before the recent deepening of the crisis and looks unlikely to meet the IMF’s forecast of 0% growth this year. The fund has been consistently over-optimistic about Greece’s economic prospects, but officials said that if the economy did contract in 2015, it would make up the lost ground in the future.</p> \n<p>Nick Kounis, economist at ABN Amro, said: “The IMF’s report on Greek debt makes grim reading but its growth assumptions are too optimistic, hence debt projections are too low.”</p> \n<p>The IMF said that even if Greece is offered generous terms, it is still likely to require a reduction in debt of around 30% of national income to bring it down to 117% of GDP, the uppermost limit of what the fund considered sustainable at the time of the second Greek bailout in the autumn of 2012.</p> \n<p>“Even with concessional financing through 2018, debt would remain very high for decades and highly vulnerable to shocks. Assuming official (concessional) financing through end–2018, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected at about 150% in 2020, and close to 140% in 2022.</p> \n<p>“Using the thresholds agreed in November 2012, a haircut that yields a reduction in debt of over 30% of GDP would be required to meet the November 2012 debt targets.” </p> \n<p>The IMF added that if growth was lower than expected or if the Greek government failed to meet targets for running a surplus on its budget excluding interest payments, there would be “significant increases in debt and gross financing needs”.</p> \n<p>The IMF said that is was releasing its preliminary draft debt sustainability analysis as a result of the leaks of documents reported in the Guardian earlier this week.</p> \n<p>Significantly, it said its assessment had “not been agreed with the other parties in the policy discussions” – an admission that the fund is at odds with its troika partners, the European commission and the European Central Bank – over the need for debt relief.</p> \n<p>The fund has traditionally viewed debt relief as an integral part of any package to improve the economic prospects of a country seeking help, but it has met resistance from European governments fearful that the cost would have to be met by their own taxpayers.</p> \n<p>In response to criticism that the IMF has failed to tackle intransigence in European capitals against a further debt write-off, a senior IMF official said: “We are asking the Greeks to do very difficult things. We are also asking the Europeans to do something very difficult. </p> \n<p>“The extension of maturities [by the EU] on Greek debt would be a dramatic move.”</p> \n<p>He said that while “it was a fact that Europe has already provided considerable debt relief in GDP terms” to Greece, the current dire situation meant they needed to do more.</p> \n<p>The official said he had refused to put forward plans for a further bailout of Greece to the IMF board without a comprehensive deal that included debt relief.</p> \n<p>“We cannot go to our board with this report unless we have a credible programme that is sustainable and with a policy from the EU on debt relief. We want a comprehensive solution and cannot go to the IMF board without it.”</p> \n<p><br /></p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7bcb4577a153a52d31dca0a0f8008bcec9ce85a2/0_0_3543_2126/3543.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2126,"width":3543,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Fotis Plegas G./EPA","altText":"A woman passes a wall covered with Vote NO campaign posters on Greece’s bailout referendum.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Fotis Plegas G./EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T15:20:55Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T06:28:43Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Phillip Inman","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/phillipinman"},{"name":"Larry Elliott","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733742341/LarryElliott.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/larryelliott"},{"name":"Alberto Nardelli","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/15/1413373452737/Alberto-Nardelli-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/alberto-nardelli"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["International Monetary Fund (IMF)","Eurozone crisis","Greece","Eurozone","Banking","Business","Economics","Euro","Currencies","Europe","European Central Bank","European Union","European banks","European monetary union","Financial crisis","Financial sector","World news","Alexis Tsipras","Syriza"],"tags":[{"id":"business/imf","webTitle":"International Monetary Fund (IMF)"},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis"},{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"},{"id":"business/eurozone","webTitle":"Eurozone"},{"id":"business/banking","webTitle":"Banking"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"business/euro","webTitle":"Euro"},{"id":"business/currencies","webTitle":"Currencies"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"business/european-central-bank","webTitle":"European Central Bank"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"business/europeanbanks","webTitle":"European banks"},{"id":"business/emu","webTitle":"European monetary union"},{"id":"business/financial-crisis","webTitle":"Financial crisis"},{"id":"business/financial-sector","webTitle":"Financial sector"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/alexis-tsipras","webTitle":"Alexis Tsipras"},{"id":"world/syriza","webTitle":"Syriza"}],"section":{"id":"business"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-457389962","source":"guardian.co.uk","durationInSeconds":168,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/02/150702GreeceUpdateJonathanFreedland_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/02/150702GreeceUpdateJonathanFreedland.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/2/1435840489959/KP_338869_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Three-minute Greece update: could this be the end of Alexis Tsipras? - video","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Three-minute Greece update: could this be the end of Alexis Tsipras? - video","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Three-minute Greece update: could this be the end of Alexis Tsipras? - video"}}],"adTargetingPath":"business"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/02/imf-greece-needs-extra-50bn-euros","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ab68","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/business/2015/jul/02/imf-greece-needs-extra-50bn-euros","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/02/imf-greece-needs-extra-50bn-euros"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7bcb4577a153a52d31dca0a0f8008bcec9ce85a2/0_0_3543_2126/3543.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2126,"width":3543,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A woman passes a wall covered with Vote NO campaign posters on Greece’s bailout referendum.

But in the last month there has been a peak, there has been a sudden increase in the number of emails and phone calls we’ve received with all these rumours about Greece going out of the euro,” said Dr Gregory Makris, president of the association.</p> \n<p>He said that if Greece voted no in the referendum on Sunday, the number of doctors leaving the country would increase even further. “A lot of people are waiting to see what happens on Sunday, we could see a sharp increase on that 30%,” he said.</p> \n<p>Over the past five years, an estimated 200,000 Greeks, or 2% of the nation’s population, have left the country to search for work. But as the uncertainty in Greece worsens, people are sending out pleas for help to Greeks living abroad.</p> \n<p>One Greek-Australian academic has been receiving about 10 emails a day, every day, for the past month, from Greek professionals asking for help getting work in Australia. On Wednesday alone, he received 56 such emails.</p> \n<p>“In the beginning I thought it was spam,” said Vrasidas Karalis, professor of modern Greek and chair of department at the University of Sydney. “Some of them send letters with complete CVs, or with ideas for projects they’ve planned. Or they just say: ‘Can you help me to come there? Whom should I approach? What should I do?’</p> \n<p>“It’s heartbreaking. There is a tone of despair, of hopelessness or total resignation and abandonment,” he said.</p> \n<p>Of the hundreds of Greek people who have approached Karalis, some of whom he knows, most of whom he has never met, he said all but one – a taxi driver – had university degrees.</p> \n<p>“Most have master’s degrees and a substantial percentage have PhDs. All of them are really educated and accomplished professionals. Mostly they are in their 20s and 30s, at the most creative and most productive period of life.”</p> \n<p>Among those who have approached Karalis, who is a prominent member of the Sydney Greek community, are teachers, doctors, lawyers, dentists or, like him, academics seeking work in an Australian university. While speaking to the Guardian, Karalis received two messages on Facebook from Greek university lecturers, pleading for his help in finding employment in Australia.</p> \n<p>“One of them is very successful as well. They must be very desperate. Poor things. What can I do?” he said.</p> \n<p>Nelly Skoufatoglou, 32, is among the young, accomplished Greeks pushed out of the country by the economic conditions. A journalist with dual Australian-Greek citizenship, she was previously the editor-in-chief of a fashion magazine, Ozon Raw, in Athens. But after months of receiving pay cheques that bounced and salary payments being delayed, she moved to Australia – where her mother was born – and took up a job in Melbourne as online editor of Neos Kosmos, a bilingual Greek newspaper distributed throughout Australia, New Zealand and Greece.</p> \n<p>Now she is on the receiving end of requests from other well-educated Greek professionals looking for employment. On Thursday, through Neos Kosmos’s social media and email accounts, she received 22 unsolicited messages asking for work; in the past week, she has received more than 100.</p> \n<p>“I get a lot of emails and messages from people in Greece, or newly arrived Greeks in Australia looking for employment, sponsorship or even asking for financial aid,” said Skoufatoglou.</p> \n<p>Of the hundreds of people who have contacted Skoufatoglou for help since October last year, she says more than 80% hold university degrees, 60% have master’s degrees and more than 10% hold PhDs.</p> \n<p>“They’re asking to do anything, even asking to be connected to restaurants to wash dishes. We’re talking about doctors, lawyers, they don’t care what they do as long as they can work and support families back home,” said Skoufatoglou.</p> \n<p>Karalis calls this exodus of professionals from his homeland “squandering the intellectual and social capital” of Greece, a brain drain from which the country will struggle to recover.</p> \n<p>“It means that in five or 10 years Greece could be left with no educated elite who could take over and modernise the country. These people have been educated in the country, the Greek state paid for their education, and now they’ll leave and the benefit will be harvested by another state. Not to mention in all these cases the human cost, most of these people have left families behind,” he said.</p> \n<p>Professor Richard Hunter, regius professor of Greek at Cambridge and president of the council of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece’s largest university, said the exodus of university lecturers from Greece would be particularly devastating for the country.</p> \n<p>“Every bit of Greece is suffering at the moment, but the universities are in serious peril,” he said.</p> \n<p>Hunter said that for several years young Greek academics had been forced to leave the country to find work – a blow for the nation’s universities, which for the last decade have produced world-leading research in software engineering, nanotechnology, archaeology and classical antiquity.</p> \n<p>“Obviously Greece has been suffering for some years from the fact that its young academics are leaving. Most countries prosper on research, and it is hard to overestimate the value which universities bring to national prosperity and social progress,” said Hunter.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/78e26555ef87627f25ca68ef15217c5f44eadc72/0_134_5184_3109/5184.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3109,"width":5184,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Petros Giannakouris/AP","altText":"FILE - In this  Feb. 3, 2015, file photo, a Greek flag flies outside the Athens Stock Exchange.

The facts are that the vulnerable children of this country remain largely unprotected. There’s no point in shooting the messenger if the message is uncomfortable. I am being silenced.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There is a lack of political leadership in relation to maltreated children and vulnerable children in this country</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Camila Batmanghelidjh</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Kids Company predicted that the proposed restructuring, which it said was triggered after the government signalled that it was to end &pound;5m annual funding, will leave thousands of vulnerable youngsters without support.</p> \n<p>The charity has been negotiating for weeks with the Cabinet Office over a one-off grant of around &pound;3m to enable it to restructure. If the grant is unforthcoming, the charity could call in the receivers within weeks.</p> \n<p>The charity has expanded rapidly in recent years to cope with what it says are huge rises in demand, particularly from troubled children who have been turned away from mainstream health, education and care services.</p> \n<p>Kids Company’s HQ is currently in temporary accommodation located on an upper floor of an investment bank in the City of London. According to Batmanghelidjh, the charity “nearly went bust” recently but was given a temporary lifeline after well-known artists including Antony Gormley, Tracy Emin and Anish Kapoor donated works to raise money for it.<br /></p> \n<p>Batmanghelidjh warned that without a regular source of state funding, Kids Company would be reliant on fundraising: “We are doing the most serious work [funded] by cupcake sales and cocktail parties, and I don’t think that is right or sustainable.”</p> \n<p>As a result, the charity would struggle to meet the needs of its children in future, she said: “We will be able to offer them food, hopefully, and at least give them the dignity of being a compassionate witness to their experience. But we are not going to able to sort out their problems because we do not have the resources.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d57cb86ccbb554c3efe7b5aaea344f9657ea5465\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435883155011/0531ee71-c29b-4508-9969-bb5630de8f58-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Founder of Kids Company, Camila Batmanghelidjh (left) attends a 'big society' meeting chaired by prime minister David Cameron in 2010.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Founder of Kids Company, Camila Batmanghelidjh (left) attends a ‘big society’ meeting chaired by prime minister David Cameron in 2010.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Batmanghelidjh, a trained psychotherapist, will step down as chief executive in the next few months but continue to carry out clinical work with Kids Company clients and act as the charity’s figurehead.</p> \n<p>The prime minister David Cameron has been a prominent supporter of Batmangelidjh, but it is understood that the price of further government help was the departure of Batmagelidjh and the charity’s chairman, broadcaster Alan Yentob.</p> \n<p>Kids Company believes its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/kids-company\"> close relations</a> with the government soured last Autumn, after its <a href=\"http://www.seethechild.org/\">See The Child</a> campaign criticised the UK’s child protection system as not fit for purpose. According to one source, Whitehall made it clear the campaign had failed to show the government “enough respect”.</p> \n<p>The charity also believes it lost support from City donors after an <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9437932/the-trouble-with-kids-company/\">article about it</a> appeared earlier this year in the rightwing Spectator magazine, alleging that the charity was poorly managed and could not demonstrate the social impact of its work. The charity says it has <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-week/letters/9446042/spectator-letters-camila-batmanghelidjh-defends-kids-company/\">independent</a> audits to prove its effectiveness.<br /></p> \n<p>Three Kids Company directors <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/19218/three_kids_company_directors_quit_over_conditions_of_extreme_stress\">quit earlier this year</a>, amid what Batmanghelidjh said were “conditions of extreme stress” at the charity caused by funding difficulties.</p> \n<p>In a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian, Batmanghelidjh warned that growing inequality was fuelling a distorted “emotional economy” for young people in the UK that would lead to riots and conflict between haves and have nots. </p> \n<p>“At some point, the two shall meet and when you get a very violated individual meeting a very well-cared for individual, the violated individual’s rage will bring down the well-cared for individual. That’s what people haven’t understood yet.”</p> \n<p>Although increasing numbers of children were suffering abuse, politicians had repeatedly shown they lacked the “moral fibre” to invest properly in child protection, she said. <br /></p> \n<p>“If when I look back on my 30 years of work with vulnerable children on the streets, what I would say is there is a lack of political leadership in relation to maltreated children and vulnerable children in this country,” she added. “Until there is genuine political leadership on this issue the system will remain failing.”</p> \n<p>The prime minister David Cameron courted what he called the “visionary” Kids Company during his mission to detoxify the Tory party while in opposition, and cited it in his infamous <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/5166498.stm\">“hug a hoodie” speech</a> in 2006 as an exemplar of the type of public service he wanted to see – one which concentrated on “emotional quality” rather than hitting bureaucratic targets. </p> \n<p>Batmanghelidjh was subsequently co-opted on to his<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/interactive/2012/may/07/big-society-whatever-happened\"> ill-fated Big Society project</a> in 2010. In 2012, Cameron personally intervened, like <a href=\"https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-167827535/children-s-charity-pleads-with-brown-for-funding\">Gordon Brown five years before him</a>, to ensure Kids Company continued to receive a government grant at a time when many other charities grants were cut.</p> \n<p>But Batmanghelidgjh says Cameron lost his nerve in latter years: “He lacked courage. When they [the media] started spinning it into ‘hug a hoodie’ he needed to stand up for his belief and say to the nation: ‘I stand by what I said, because it really matters.’ This crystalises the whole issue, which is they [politicians] put their finger out and whichever way the wind blows that’s the way they blow.”</p> \n<p>Iranian-born <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2013/feb/22/camila-batmanghelidjh-interview\">Batmanghelidjh</a> founded Kids Company nearly 20 years ago. It provides care, support and education for around 36,000 highly vulnerable young people and adults in London, Bristol and Liverpool. Many have experienced sexual abuse, violence, addiction, mental illness and family instability.</p> \n<p>The charity believes its intensive therapeutic model for working with maltreated youngsters should be adopted by mainstream children’s care services, but its high upfront costs and often unconventional approach has scared off many potential local authority funders.</p> \n<p>Although Batmanghelidjh has attracted tens of millions from charity donors over the years, she said she had been worn down by the stress of having to constantly fundraise: “I have just got to a point now where I am saying: ‘I don’t play this game any more.’ The scale of what is arriving at our door is too profoundly disturbing for us to be able to address it through unpredictable morsels of funding. It is not just right.” </p> \n<p>“If I went under a bus right now, Kids Company would not have any money, and I worry about that.” </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2013/aug/30/poverty-high-cognitive-toll-children\">Living in poverty exerts a high cognitive toll on families | Camila Batmangelidh</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For some years Kids Company has received a &pound;5m annual government grant, equivalent to a fifth of its annual income. But Batmanghelidjh said ministers had cut the grant from 2015-16: “Consequently we will start the year not knowing where our money is coming from and that’s too high a risk to sustain when you have got disturbed children and young people.”</p> \n<p>She criticised politicians for failing to prioritise investment in child protection: “I don’t accept that there is not enough money to do the job. There’s enough money for high-speed rail. There is enough money for arms. There is enough money for the glory of the Olympics. But there is just not enough money for child protection and that is wrong.”</p> \n<p>The charity is well-known for its celebrity supporters and donors, which have included <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2011/dec/02/coldplay-childrens-charity-kids-company\">Coldplay</a>, Damien Hirst, the comedian Michael McIntyre, JK Rowling and Emma Thompson.

A city state should be established in Magilligan<em>, </em>between Coleraine and Derry, he said, because the colony’s population would have no political future after the territory reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. </p> \n<p>A Northern Ireland civil servant, George Fergusson, seized on the idea and launched into enthusiastic discussions with the Foreign Office. A file entitled The Replantation of N. Ireland from Hong Kong records the exchanges – the title echoes the 17th-century settlement, or “plantation of Scots in Ulster by King James I”.<br /></p> \n<p>Written in an era of sectarian bloodshed and political stalemate, the correspondence reflects the private exasperation of those close to the heart of power and appears to have provided them with an entertaining diversion from more serious challenges. The file was given a “restricted” status but there is nothing to indicate that it ever reached ministers. </p> \n<p>“If the plantation were undertaken,” Fergusson wrote, “it would have evident advantages in reassuring Unionist opinion of the open-ended nature of the Union.” American doubts about the scheme would be assuaged by the “possibly happy outcome to the uncertainties currently surrounding Hong Kong”.</p> \n<p>He continued: “We are undecided here whether the arrival of 5&frac12; million Cantonese would make government policy [on devolution] … more or less easy to implement. Arithmetically, recognition of three identities might be thought more difficult.</p> \n<p>“On the other hand, the newly arrived ‘third’ identity would be hard not to recognise and this in turn might lessen the scale of the problem in recognising the other two.”</p> \n<p>There were legal precedents, Fergusson added: “If Gibraltar and Falkland Island inhabitants … may be EC citizens, how could Brussels … seriously object to the inhabitants of Hong Kong, particularly if they were living in the Magilligan area?”</p> \n<p>Fifty Chinese families from Vietnam had been resettled in Craigavon and Coleraine already, he pointed out. “It has at least established that the Chinese do not find the Northern Ireland climate objectionable and that they can get on reasonably well with the current inhabitants.”</p> \n<p>Fergusson said there would be a need to liaise with the Treasury, Home Office and Hong Kong itself. “At this stage we see real advantages in taking the proposals seriously,” he commented. There would need to be planning applications on a confidential basis.</p> \n<p>In reply, DR Snoxell, of the FCO’s Republic of Ireland department, adopted a tone that suggested parody as much as caution. He wrote: “You have raised some important considerations to which we shall want to give careful thought.</p> \n<p>“My initial reaction, however, is that the proposal could be useful to the extent that 5&frac12; million Chinese may induce the indigenous peoples to forsake their homeland for a future elsewhere. Arrangements would, of course, have to be made for [the Chinese] to retain their UK nationality.”</p> \n<p>Sovereignty disputes with the Irish republic over Lough Foyle could complicate their resettlement, he added. “The Chinese people of Hong Kong are essentially a fishing and maritime people,” Snoxell said. <br /></p> \n<p>“I am sure you would share our view that it would be unwise to settle the people of Hong Kong in the vicinity until we had established our claims on the lough and whether these extended to high or low-water mark.”</p> \n<p>Another appreciative official at the FCO had written on the letter: “My mind will be boggling for the rest of the day.” </p> \n<p>Although the Chinese community never reached five million, it has contributed to Northern Ireland’s political progress. Anna Lo, originally from Hong Kong, moved to Belfast in 1974, eventually becoming a Stormont assembly member for the Alliance party. She announced last year that she would stand down because of racist attacks by loyalists. <br

With more work, they say that by the end of the decade it will at least be possible to help stabilise patients.</p> \n<p>Cystic fibrosis, the most common life-shortening inherited disease in the UK, was an early target for scientists excited by the concept of gene therapy when the mutated gene that causes it was identified some 25 years ago.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It is the world’s first demonstration that repeated gene therapy can improve lung function</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Professor Eric Alton</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p> It is estimated that one in every 2,500 babies born in the UK will be born with cystic fibrosis, with the disease affecting about 10,000 people in the UK, and more than 90,000 worldwide. Those born with CF have a limited lifespan. Their body produces thick mucus, which affects the lungs and digestive system in particular.</p> \n<p>Scientists and doctors from Imperial College London, Oxford and Edinburgh Universities, the Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, and NHS Lothian came together in 2001 to try to develop a gene therapy, supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. They developed a technique to enable patients to breathe in molecules of DNA, delivering a normal copy of the defective gene to cells in the lung.<br /></p> \n<p>A trial of 136 patients, aged 12 and over, showed better lung function in most of those given gene therapy. “It is the world’s first demonstration that repeated gene therapy can improve lung function,” said Professor Eric Alton, the coordinator of the UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy Consortium from Imperial. But he said: “The effects were modest and variable. This is not yet ready for clinical use for those reasons.”</p> \n<p>Half the patients treated at the Royal Brompton and at Western General hospital in Edinburgh were given the gene therapy and half given saline instead. Those who did best were those with the worst lung function. Alton explained that mucus was obstructing their smaller airways, so that most of the dose ended up in the larger airways. For those with milder respiratory problems, “we’re simply going to have to increase the dose,” he said.</p> \n<p>The scientists have not found a way to make a permanent change to the faulty gene. In the trial, <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/pb/assets/raw/Lancet/pdfs/S2213260015002453.pdf\">published in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine</a> they dosed patients once a month. Dosing them more often could improve the results, they say. In a bigger trial, they will also try combining the gene therapy with other treatments. </p> \n<p>A second new trial is planned that will deliver the therapy through a specially engineered virus rather than encasing it in fat globules – the method used to date – which might give longer term benefits. Giving repeated doses via a virus is not usually possible, because the immune system recognises and rejects it. </p> \n<p>If the next trial shows a bigger benefit, said Alton, it would be feasible to have a treatment to improve lung function available for patients by the end of the decade. The aim would be to prevent damage to the lungs occurring.</p> \n<p>Developing a gene therapy for cystic fibrosis has proved to be much more difficult than anybody imagined 25 years ago. “The lungs must be one of the worst possible organs to go for,” said Alton. “They are so extremely well-defended. With bone marrow you can take it out, do the gene transfer in controlled conditions in the laboratory and put it back in the patient. That is the low-hanging fruit. We have gone for the high-hanging fruit but I’m not at all sorry we have.” </p> \n<p>Gene therapy remains largely an experimental technique, with some treatments available mostly for rare diseases. The aim has been to effect a cure, but the benefits have generally not been as long-lasting as hoped.</p> \n<p>The cystic fibrosis trial was funded by the Medical Research Council and the National Institute for Health Research. Pledging to continue investment in health research, George Freeman, the government’s minister for life sciences, said: “Cystic fibrosis can have a devastating effect on patients and families and this is an excellent development for people living with the condition.”</p> \n<p>Ed Owen, chief executive of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, said: “This is an extraordinary time for therapeutic development in cystic fibrosis and the need is urgent to stop so many young lives being cut short because of this cruel condition. We will therefore continue to invest in innovative genetic research and to work with academic and industry partners to develop advancements which will make further progress towards our goal of a life unlimited by cystic fibrosis.”</p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/be291b09a3f988e44a7241f9be79a45d7b9b01c1/0_294_5500_3304/5500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3304,"width":5500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andrew Brookes/Corbis","altText":"Scientist using a pipette in a laboratory","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andrew Brookes/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T08:18:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T08:18:14Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":12,"contributors":[{"name":"Sarah Boseley","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sarahboseley"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Medical research","Science","Health","UK news","Imperial College London","University of Oxford","University of Edinburgh"],"tags":[{"id":"science/medical-research","webTitle":"Medical research"},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"education/imperialcollegelondon","webTitle":"Imperial College London"},{"id":"education/oxforduniversity","webTitle":"University of Oxford"},{"id":"education/universityofedinburgh","webTitle":"University of Edinburgh"}],"section":{"id":"science"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sarah Boseley","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sarahboseley"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"science"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/jul/03/gene-therapy-cystic-fibrosis-2020-scientists","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aazf","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/science/2015/jul/03/gene-therapy-cystic-fibrosis-2020-scientists","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/03/gene-therapy-cystic-fibrosis-2020-scientists"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/be291b09a3f988e44a7241f9be79a45d7b9b01c1/0_294_5500_3304/5500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3304,"width":5500,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A consortium of scientists and doctors is working to develop a gene therapy for people with cystic fibrosis.
