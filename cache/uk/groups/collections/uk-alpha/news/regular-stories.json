The timing - just three days before a scheduled summit of all European Union leaders - was determined by fears of a run on the banks.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Greek depositors have withdrawn more than €3.2bn since Monday, including €1.2bn on Thursday, raising fears of a run on the banks.<br /></p> \n<p>The ECB warned finance ministers on Thursday that Greek banks may not open on Monday. According to Reuters, when asked whether the banks would be open on Friday, ECB executive board member Benoit Coeure said: “Tomorrow yes. Monday I don’t know.” <br /></p> \n<p>On Friday morning, the ECB’s decision-making governing council will discuss a request from the Bank of Greece for an increase in liquidity to Greek banks. According to newspaper <a href=\"http://www.ekathimerini.com/\">Kathimerini</a>, the Bank of Greece will ask for – and expects to get – €3.5bn (&pound;2.5bn) of assistance via the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) facility. The request comes just two days after the ECB threw Greece a €1.1bn lifeline in ELA funds.</p> \n<p>The talks between finance ministers broke down after barely an hour of discussions on the Greek crisis. Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, said there was an urgent need for dialogue with adults in the room.<br /></p> \n<p>Greece’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, has insisted that only a political deal at the level of heads of state and government can end the crisis. Speaking on Friday morning, he said Monday’s summit was a positive development on the road towards a deal.<br /></p> \n<p>“All those who are betting on crisis and terror scenarios will be proven wrong. There will be a solution based on respecting EU rules and democracy which would allow Greece to return to growth in the euro”</p> \n<p>European stock markets opened flat on Friday morning, reflecting the fact that investors have already priced in the chaotic negotiations over the five-year Greek debt crisis.</p> \n<p>The UK chancellor, George Osborne, has urged Greece to come to a deal with its creditors. Arriving in Luxembourg for a meeting of EU finance ministers, he said: “We have entered the eleventh hour of this Greek crisis and we urge the Greek government to do a deal.”</p> \n<p>“We hope for the best, but we now must be prepared for the worst.”</p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434700933955/23ff1577-a1c1-4fec-9723-55f6949d76cb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"NurPhoto/REX Shutterstock/NurPhoto/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Pro-Europe demonstrators at the entrance to the Greek parliament in Syntagma Square, Athens, Greece.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: NurPhoto/REX Shutterstock/NurPhoto/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T08:02:59Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T08:15:58Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Jennifer Rankin","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jennifer-rankin"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["European Central Bank","Eurozone","Eurozone crisis","Business","Greece","European Union","European banks","European monetary union","World news","Euro","Europe"],"tags":[{"id":"business/european-central-bank","webTitle":"European Central Bank"},{"id":"business/eurozone","webTitle":"Eurozone"},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"business/europeanbanks","webTitle":"European banks"},{"id":"business/emu","webTitle":"European monetary union"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"business/euro","webTitle":"Euro"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"}],"section":{"id":"business"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jennifer Rankin","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jennifer-rankin"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"business"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/19/greek-crisis-ecb-meeting-to-decide-on-emergency-funding","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avm7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/business/2015/jun/19/greek-crisis-ecb-meeting-to-decide-on-emergency-funding","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/19/greek-crisis-ecb-meeting-to-decide-on-emergency-funding"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434700933955/23ff1577-a1c1-4fec-9723-55f6949d76cb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Pro-Europe demonstrators at the entrance to the Greek parliament in Syntagma Square, Athens, Greece.

rejected</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Some €2bn of deposits have been withdrawn from Greek banks so far this week – including a record €1bn yesterday – triggering fears that a breakdown in talks would spark a further flight of funds. The German leader Angela Merkel, French president Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande and Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras agreed to stage an emergency EU summit on Monday as a last critical attempt to prevent Greece going bankrupt. A representative of the European Central Bank told the meeting it was unsure whether Greek banks would have the funds to be able to open on Monday.</p> \n<p>As thousands of pro-EU protestors gathered outside the Athens parliament building, leaders of the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund aimed bitter criticism at the leftwing Greek government, accusing it of lying to its own people, misrepresenting and misleading other EU leaders, refusing to negotiate seriously, and taking Greece to the brink of catastrophe.</p> \n<p>The Luxembourg talks broke down within an hour of discussions about the Greek crisis starting, indicating the bad blood between both sides. Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, said there was an urgent need for dialogue “with adults in the room”. She added: “We can only arrive at a resolution if there is a dialogue. Right now we’re short of a dialogue.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457210231__\n</div> \n<p>Lagarde has taken a tough line on debt talks with Athens over the past four months, since the radical leftist Syriza government took control and insisted creditors drop proposals for further austerity as the price of releasing the last tranche of bailout funds. At the talks in Luxembourg she reportedly introduced herself to Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis as “the criminal in chief”, in reference to Tsipras’s claim earlier this week that the IMF bore “criminal responsibility” for the situation in Greece.</p> \n<p>Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic affairs, who has been more sympathetic to the Greek case, said: “There’s not much time to avoid the worst.” He appealed to the Tsipras government to return to the negotiating table, making it plain that Athens has been treating its creditors and EU partners with contempt. He said Athens had made no credible counter-proposals on the bailout terms and said that Varoufakis tabled no new proposals on Thursday, despite the session of Eurogroup finance ministers being billed as the last chance to secure a deal sending Greece a financial lifeline and keeping it in the euro. He called on the Greek government “to avoid a fate that would be catastrophic”.</p> \n<p>The current bailout for Greece expires on 30 June when Athens is also due to repay the IMF around €1.6bn. Lagarde said if the payment is not made on time, Greece will be declared to be in default and would disqualify itself from receiving any further IMF funds.</p> \n<p>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and president of the eurogroup, said: “No agreement is yet in sight.”</p> \n<p>Varoufakis reiterated demands for debt relief as part of a deal. The creditors concede that this could be agreed in the future, but that first Greece has to meet the terms of the present rescue package which expires in 11 days. “We are dangerously close to a state of mind that accepts an accident,” said Varoufakis.</p> \n<p> As the talks quickly broke down in Luxembourg, in Brussels, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, promptly convened an emergency leaders’ summit on Monday evening, putting the onus on both Merkel and Tsipras as the two key leaders to bend towards concessions to clinch a deal.</p> \n<p>A senior EU official taking part in the meeting told the Guardian that Monday’s summit was convened as soon as EU leaders learned of the collapse of the Luxembourg talks. The spectre of a Greek banking collapse under the weight of withdrawals prompted the meet, he said. </p> \n<p>The standoff is over what actions Greece has to take to access the remaining €7.2bn in bailout funds.</p> \n<p>Dijsselbloem made plain that even if agreement is reached in the end, the rescue package would need to be extended beyond 30 June, as there simply was not enough time left to negotiate the fine print and get through the parliamentary procedures needed in several eurozone countries.</p> \n<p>At issue is just a €2bn financing gap between what the Greeks are prepared to offer and what the creditors are demanding, but the problem goes deeper into questions of power and rules. Dijsselbloem said any deal that might be reached would need to maintain the credibility of the eurozone as a rules-based community.</p> \n<p> As the meeting degenerated into rancour, Greek banks stood on the brink of collapse after a flood of cash withdrawals on Thursday, raising the prospect of capital controls and temporary bank closures. The five major commercial banks saw around €2bn of deposits withdrawn by customers anxious that Greece was nearing the end of its credit line with lenders and about to go bust.</p> \n<p> Dijsselbloem demanded that the Greek government act quickly to restore trust and stem the haemorrhaging of deposits. “It’s a sign of great concern for the future,” he said. “It can be dealt with, but it requires quick action.”</p> \n<p> Top officials from the European Central Bank told the meeting that Greece might need to impose capital controls within days. They said the banks would be open on Friday. “On Monday, I don’t know,” Benoit Coeure from the ECB board was said to have told the ministers.</p> \n<p>The precarious situation, which has previously forced the ECB to regularly increase its credit line to Greek banks, formed the backdrop to intense negotiations between Athens and the troika of creditors – the European commission, the International Monetary Fund and the ECB.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457203217__\n</div> \n<p>Lagarde said there would be “no grace period or possibility of delay” to loan payments that are due on 30 June. The hardening of the IMF’s stance follows an admission by the debt-stricken Greek government on Wednesday that it would be unable to pay without a deal with Brussels and the IMF to provide extra funds.</p> \n<p>Lagarde said the Syriza administration would need to make further reforms to its pension system to get a deal, something prime minister Tsipras has refused to countenance.</p> \n<p>Writing in German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, Tsipras said pensioners had become the main breadwinners in many families, meaning cuts in pension payments would increase poverty.</p> \n<p>“Traditionally, this solidarity has meant that young people, through their contributions, fund the pensions of their parents,” he said.</p> \n<p>“But during the Greek crisis, we’ve witnessed this solidarity being reversed as the parents’ pensions fund the survival of their children.”</p> \n<p>But the IMF and Brussels want further cuts to bring down the cost of pensions, which account for 16% of GDP, with further restrictions on early retirement and lower supplementary pension payments.</p> \n<p>The Greek government has maintained, throughout five months of talks, that it remains ready to join talks to secure an agreement, but could not accept the current proposals to cut pensions or the insistence it achieve a 1% budget surplus in the middle of a recession.</p> \n<p>Chief negotiator, Euclid Tsakalotos, warned on the BBC’s Today programme on Radio 4 that “if Greece goes out, the euro might break down.” He said: “Once one country has left, you change a monetary union into a fixed exchange rate system, where it’s a cost-benefit analysis whether another country leaves.</p> \n<p>“My greatest fear is that the breakup of the euro will return [us] to the competitive devaluations, and the nationalisms, and the kind of politics we had in the 1930s. If we don’t [have a deal], we have to go to the Greek people, because we have no mandate to leave the euro, and that would be a very bad eventuality.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434662293333/43300b83-aef3-46e2-9668-568ba7f0c242-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Francois

If Greece were to default on the IMF and then also leave the currency union, pinning down the precise losses to creditors will not be a straightforward task. </p> \n<p>Any calculation will need to not only consider the size of the Greek debt (roughly €320bn, which translates into 175% of its GDP) but also take into account possible contagion – a market panic spreading to other countries – and the amount Greece chooses to not pay.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/18/greece-eurozone-finance-ministers-talks-austerity-protests-athens\">Eurozone talks end without deal as Greek proposals rejected</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Data detailing the world’s financial exposure to Greece give an indication of how a total breakdown between Greece and its creditors might play out.</p> \n<p>At the end of 2014 the three main creditors held more than 75% of Greece’s total debt, most of which lay in the hands of eurozone governments. These countries are directly exposed to the risk of Greece defaulting, through bilateral loans and the money they have put into the EFSF (the <a href=\"http://www.efsf.europa.eu/about/index.htm\">European Financial Stability Facility</a>), which has dispersed loans to Greece. </p> \n<p>The exposure from the bilateral loans and the EFSF alone amounts to €195bn, or 61.5% of the outstanding Greek debt.</p> \n<p>But eurozone countries are also exposed indirectly due to interventions in the sovereign debt market such as the ECB-operated <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/glossary/html/act4s.en.html\">Securities Markets Programme</a>, for which Greece still owes €28bn. </p> \n<p>Those countries are also potentially exposed to Greek banks, which have borrowed more than €80bn under the ECB’s <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-17/ecb-said-to-raise-greece-s-ela-ceiling-by-1-1-billion-euros\">Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) programme to counter capital flight</a>. It is especially unclear how much individual states would lose under ECB-operated programmes if Greece were to default.</p> \n<p>The sum of all this debt exposure, according to Barclays Research, amounts to 3.3% of the eurozone’s GDP.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FGoria/statuses/588677405834883073\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Barclays: Official exposure to Greece in EMU by country and type <a href=\"http://t.co/5QKkrsWr77\">pic.twitter.com/5QKkrsWr77</a></p>— Fabrizio Goria (@FGoria) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FGoria/status/588677405834883073\">April 16, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>The eurozone’s largest economies, Germany and France, are nominally the most exposed. However, relative to the size of each nation’s economy, the hit would be greater on some of the area’s smaller members, such as Slovenia and Malta, and on Spain and Italy, whose economies are still fragile. In Spain and Italy political dissatisfaction is elevated as clearly shown by the recent local elections in both countries.</p> \n<p>But it is not only the government in Greece to which foreign investors are exposed. And though they would be the ones absorbing most of the losses, the three official creditors are not alone in the list of those who could potentially be hurt by a Greek default. There is also the private sector, led by the banks.</p> \n<p>After Greece came under market pressure and entered a bailout programme in 2010, foreign banks started to rapidly reduce their exposure to Greece.</p> \n<p>Euro area banks’ exposure to Greece, which had peaked at about €128bn in 2008, dropped to €12bn in September 2013. UK banks’ exposure was €13bn in March 2008, and dropped to €4.3bn by December 2012. US banks’ exposure, which was about €14bn in September 2009, was down to €2.5bn at the end of 2012.</p> \n<p>However, <a href=\"http://www.bis.org/statistics/consstats.htm\">data from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS)</a> reveals that the potential exposure of both US and UK banks has recently been increasing again.</p> \n<p>As of December 2014, US banks’ <a href=\"http://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt0509f.pdf\">total consolidated claims</a> towards Greece tallied at €10.2bn, while the UK has €9.7bn tied up in the country.</p> \n<p>Even <a href=\"http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1557-whos-still-exposed-to-greece/\">eurozone banks have been increasing their exposure compared to the low points of 2012</a>. German banks’ claims on Greece, which dropped to €3.9bn at the end of 2012 after having peaked at above €30bn just two years earlier, were back to €10.6bn at the end of last year. Although at a reduced scale, Dutch and Italian banks have also seen their exposure increase over the same time period. The aggregate claims of French banks remain relatively low, compared with an exposure that was higher than €50bn five years ago.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/bankexposure-zip/giv-21277nz8Jlhu0jVPq/\" data-alt=\"Banks'exposure\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/bankexposure-zip/giv-21277nz8Jlhu0jVPq/\">Banks'exposure</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The composition of banks’ exposure varies across countries and has changed significantly over time. In 2012, for example, exposure to the Greek private non-financial sectors accounted for the largest share of banks’ exposure to the country.</p> \n<p>Exposure to Greek banks has increased both in nominal terms and as a share of total claims, <a href=\"http://www.bruegel.org/nc/blog/detail/article/1557-whos-still-exposed-to-greece/\">according to analysis by thinktank Bruegel</a>. Most of the US (€9.5bn) and UK (€6.7bn) current exposure is in fact to the banks.</p> \n<p>If Greece were to leave the eurozone, it is unclear what the process would be to recoup this money.</p> \n<p>In addition to all this there is the IMF. It holds about 10% of Greek debt. Although <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/glance.htm\">Greece is one of the fund’s biggest borrowers</a>, the exposure is <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/glance.htm\">relatively modest within the context of its resources</a> - and more importantly, as the most senior creditor, it would be the first to be paid back. </p> \n<p>Support the IMF provides is based on members’ quotas. According to <a href=\"http://openeurope.org.uk/\">OpenEurope</a> calculations, the UK has provided &pound;1.72bn to the IMF’s share of Greece’s bailout package.</p> \n<p>These of course are just the numbers. The cost of Greece exiting the euro goes beyond the currency union’s 3.5% of GDP.

That blame game is wrong – and it is dangerous. By accepting the finger-pointing – whether it’s at agencies or authorities – we are ignoring the fact that the radicalisation starts with the individual.”</p> \n<p>He was speaking in a week in which one Briton, Talha Asmal, has blown himself up as a suicide bomber in Iraq and three sisters have left their homes in Bradford to take their families to Syria.</p> \n<p>The prime minister had been prompted to make his call for greater responsibility after being impressed by the remarks of Manzoor Moghal, chairman of the Muslim Forum. </p> \n<p>Moghal had said there was a “climate of division” in some British towns, adding that foreign policy, Islamophobia and online propaganda were being used as “scapegoats”. He added: “The eagerness to pass the buck is not just wrongheaded and hypocritical, it also allows extremism to flourish. Instead of endlessly pointing the finger at others, Muslim communities should face up to their own responsibilities.”</p> \n<p>Cameron will express his personal surprise and distress at the numbers travelling to Syria, although stopping short of introducing new measures. Instead he will try to pinpoint a clear chain of causation that leads someone to lose a sense of identity and then become fully radicalised.</p> \n<p>The prime minister will say there are Muslims who buy into aspects of the critique of the west but who don’t go so far as to advocate violence. By accepting some of these prejudices and telling fellow Muslims to accept aspects of this world view, the extremist Islamic narrative is given weight, he will say. </p> \n<p>“This paves the way for young people to turn simmering prejudice into murderous intent. To go from listening to firebrand preachers online to boarding a plane to Istanbul and travelling onward to join the jihadis.”</p> \n<p> As a result, Cameron intends to warn that “a troubled boy who is angry at the world or a girl looking for an identity, for something to believe in and there’s something that is quietly condoned online or perhaps even in parts of your local community then it’s less of a leap to go from a British teenager to an Isil [Isis] fighter or an Isil wife than it would be for someone who hasn’t been exposed to these things.”</p> \n<p>The prime minister will express his surprise at the background of some of these terrorists.</p> \n<p>He will say: “These are young people, boys and girls, leaving often loving, well-to-do homes, good schools and bright prospects travelling thousands of miles from home to strap explosives to their chests and blow themselves up and kill innocent people, to live in a place where marriage is legal at nine and where women’s role is to serve the jihadists, to be part of a so-called state whose fanatics are plotting and encouraging acts of despicable terrorism in the countries from which they have come.”</p> \n<p>“It is an Islamist extremist ideology one that says the west is bad and democracy is wrong that women are inferior and homosexuality is evil. It says religious doctrine trumps the rule of law and caliphate trumps nation state and it justifies violence in asserting itself and achieving its aims. The question is: how do people arrive at this worldview?”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e4cfd5614e6eea592b92c4a4fc6e5a1c307fa05a/0_360_3500_2100/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2100,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Srdjan

shooting?</a></p>","byline":"Michael Safi, Jessica Glenza and Amanda Holpuch","body":"<p>The 21-year-old accused of killing nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, had been “planning something like that for six months”, his roommate has revealed, as friends recalled Dylann Roof’s tirades against African Americans “taking over the world” and his desire to ignite “a civil war”.<br /></p> \n<p>The killings have sent shockwaves across the US, as the nation confronts a breaking point over race and gun violence following yet another mass shooting. Hundreds of people gathered to pay their respects outside the Emanuel AME Church – the scene of the shooting – on Thursday evening, with more prayer services held throughout Charleston.</p> \n<p>A day after the massacre – labelled a “hate crime” by South Carolina police – a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/18/dylann-roof-south-carolina-charleston-shooting-suspect\">portrait of Roof as an apparently committed racist</a> is building from interviews with associates of the young man, shown in Facebook photos wearing a jacket bearing the flags of the former white-racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia.</p> \n<p>Joseph Meek Jr, a childhood friend who saw Roof the morning of the shooting, said the pair had never discussed race growing up. But when they recently reconnected, Roof told him “blacks were taking over the world [and] someone needed to do something about it for the white race”, he told the Associated Press.</p> \n<p>“He said he wanted segregation between whites and blacks. I said, ‘That’s not the way it should be.’ But he kept talking about it.”</p> \n<p>Meek said that when he woke up on Wednesday morning Roof was at his house, sleeping in his car outside – its license plate bearing the confederate flag. </p> \n<p>Later that day, Meek said he and some friends had gone to a nearby lake but Roof stayed behind, deciding he’d rather see a movie. The next time he saw Roof was in surveillance-camera photos distributed by police in the aftermath of the killing. “I knew it was him,” Meek said.</p> \n<p>A roommate, Dalton Tyler, said Roof had been “planning something like that for six months”. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"745b17044f02598e102e7a68514faaa3f4cbb788\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/745b17044f02598e102e7a68514faaa3f4cbb788/0_59_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An undated handout photo provided by Berkeley County of Dylann Roof.

He said he was going to do something like that and then kill himself.”</p> \n<p>He said Roof had been “on and off” with his parents, but they had previously bought him a gun. He hadn’t been allowed to take it with him until this week, Tyler said.</p> \n<p>Roof’s uncle Carson Cowles said the gun, a .45-caliber pistol, had been a gift for the introverted young man’s 21st birthday.</p> \n<p>“I said he was like 19 years old, he still didn’t have a job, a driver’s license or anything like that and he just stayed in his room a lot of the time,” Cowles said. “I don’t have any words for it. Nobody in my family had seen anything like this coming.”</p> \n<p>A high school contemporary, John Mullins, <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/18/everything-known-about-charleston-church-shooting-suspect-dylann-roof.html\">told the Daily Beast</a>: “He made a lot of racist jokes, but you don’t really take them seriously like that. You don’t really think of it like that.” But now, he said, it seemed that “the things he said were kind of not joking”.</p> \n<p>Richard Cohen, the president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Roof was not known to his organisation, which tracks hate crimes across the US, but based on his Facebook page he appeared to be a “disaffected white supremacist”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/19/charleston-shooting-florist-debbie-dills-hailed-a-hero-after-tailing-suspects-car\">Charleston shooting: florist Debbie Dills hailed a hero after tailing suspect's car</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Others expressed surprise at Roof’s crimes. “I never thought he’d do something like this,” a high school friend, Antonio Metze, told AP. “He had black friends.”<br /></p> \n<p>Meek’s mother, Kimberly Konzny, described him as a “sweet kid”. “He was quiet. He only had a few friends,” she said.</p> \n<p>Though police say Roof lived in Columbia, South Carolina, he apparently had ties to the nearby Lexington area. Roof had a mixed educational record in the Lexington school district, attending White Knoll high school in both the 2008-09 and 2009-10 school years. </p> \n<p>Roof previously had at least two run-ins with the law.

That’s us.”</p> \n<p>The reluctance to label domestic shootings of this kind as terrorism, he went on, led to what he called a “disparity of response between when we think people that are foreign are going to kill us and us killing ourselves”.</p> \n<p>“If this had been what we thought was Islamic terrorism … we invaded two countries and spent trillions of dollars and thousands of American lives, and now fly unmanned death machines over, like, five or six different countries …</p> \n<p>“Nine people.

France-Presse","body":"<p> French actor Julie Gayet appeared for the first time on Thursday at an official event attended by President Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, amid speculation that she is being gradually introduced as the nation’s new first lady.</p> \n<p>Gayet, 43, dressed all in black, stepped out at a ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of a famous wartime address by Gen Charles de Gaulle.</p> \n<p>Hollande, 60, split with his long-term girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler last year after revelations that he was having an affair with Gayet.</p> \n<p>Arriving shortly before Hollande at the ceremony at Mont Valerien, on the western edge of Paris, Gayet was seen pushing the wheelchair of her grandfather, Alain Gayet, a decorated hero of the French resistance.</p> \n<p>The ceremony marked the anniversary of De Gaulle’s historic radio address from London on 18 June, 1940, urging French citizens to resist German occupation.</p> \n<p>Accompanied by her father Brice, Gayet stayed discreetly at the back throughout as Hollande shook hands with the former resistance fighters.</p> \n<p>The presidency insisted it was a coincidence that Gayet was at the event. “There was no strategy on our part,” an advisor to Hollande said, saying the actor attended the ceremony in her capacity as the granddaughter of a decorated resistance fighter.</p> \n<p>The surprise appearance came as society magazine Paris Match splashed the headline “Julie Gayet comes into the light” on its front cover, reporting on Thursday the actor was set to “enter her new role little by little” as Hollande’s official partner.</p> \n<p>In April, celebrity magazine Voici printed photos of the two walking together at La Lanterne, the president’s residence at Versailles outside Paris, alongside some old friends of Hollande.</p> \n<p>The same magazine had in November published pictures of the two together inside the Elysee presidential residence, prompting five staff members to be reassigned over what constituted a damaging security breach.</p> \n<p>Repeatedly asked in recent months about the status of his relationship with Gayet amid huge speculation in the tabloids, Hollande has neither confirmed nor denied that the pair are still together, saying he has a right to have his privacy respected.</p> \n<p>Paparazzi photos in January 2014 of Hollande in a scooter helmet, visiting Gayet at a Paris apartment, set off an international media firestorm. </p> \n<p>Trierweiler, a journalist, published a bestselling tell-all memoir of their subsequent breakup, portraying the president as a cold-hearted egotist and champagne socialist who was contemptuous of the “toothless” poor.</p> \n<p>The president has four children with another former partner, the current ecology minister S&eacute;gol&egrave;ne Royal.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f9e93eba6531a01b36ab0805f373d0db13af5b92/0_0_4076_2448/4076.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2448,"width":4076,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Thomas
