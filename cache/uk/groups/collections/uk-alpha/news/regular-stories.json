Over dinner at a summit in Brussels, the meeting’s chair, Donald Tusk, will give the prime minister the floor and ask him to outline if, and on what terms, Britain wants to stay in the union, when the vote will take place, and what the procedures should be preceding this historic event dominating Cameron’s second term.</p> \n<p>For the prime ministers, chancellors and presidents around the table, it will be a first. No head of government has ever come to a summit with such a message and such a claim. The United Kingdom is staging a plebiscite on whether to stay in. If you do not give me what I need, Cameron will implicitly or explicitly tell the leaders, the EU’s third biggest country may quit.</p> \n<p>There are four subjects on the summit agenda. The draft statement, obtained by the Guardian, details what will happen on the first three. Item number 4 is empty except for two letters: UK.</p> \n<p>“It will not be a big debate,” said a senior EU official. That is because since his re-election, Cameron has toured Europe to explain his position and gauge support bilaterally with EU heads of government while hosting others at Downing Street and Chequers. “There won’t be anything new,” said several senior people already consulted by the British.</p> \n<p> Many in the EU elite are bemused that the question of Europe played no role at all in the UK general election campaign, but became the number one issue on 8 May. Leaders and officials said repeatedly, with some relief, that once Cameron had won his second term they would learn the details of Britain’s aims and hopes. In vain.</p> \n<p>Cameron is being advised to remain vague, say informed sources, not to list his demands too specifically lest he make himself a hostage of his own position. There is unlikely to be a detailed written list of reforms that he can be measured against.</p> \n<p>“David Cameron’s strategic approach is not to come up with specific things,” said a continental politician who has spoken to the prime minister. “Because then you can fix him and the Tory party will never let him go.”</p> \n<p> Senior diplomats in Brussels said the empty space in the summit communique would probably stay vacant because Cameron did not want it filled in.</p> \n<p>Officials preparing the summit said Tusk’s aim was to agree on a timeline for negotiations and the procedure. That means they need to know when Cameron plans to hold the referendum so as to adjust their negotiating schedule. But the British take the opposite view – that the timing will depend on the substance and outcome of the negotiations.</p> \n<p>One likely outcome on Friday is that the EU leaders charge Tusk with running the negotiations. The British think that likely. The senior EU official said: “There will be a need for political understanding at the top level. This is a job for the leaders, not senior eurocrats. This is the responsibility of the president of the European council [Tusk].”</p> \n<p>But the months ahead will be dominated by “technical” and legal discussions between the lawyers, eurocrats and Downing Street aides, he added.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday the European commission created a new “taskforce” dedicated to the British question. And it put Britain’s most senior and most experienced eurocrat, Jonathan Faull, in charge of it. A fervent if critical pro-European, Faull, 60, has spent his entire career, 37 years, in Brussels. A lawyer, a liberal, not a Tory, a francophile, he is a consummate Brussels insider.</p> \n<p>He knows the legal machinery of the EU’s single market inside out, and has spent recent years dealing with eurozone banking regulation and capital markets. These are critical areas for Cameron and George Osborne – making sure that the imperatives of the 19-country eurozone do not impinge on the single-market interests of the British outside the euro, and that the interests of the City of London, by far the EU’s biggest financial centre, are not disadvantaged by closer eurozone integration.</p> \n<p>Senior sources in Brussels say that during the recent round of bilaterals, Phillip Hammond, the foreign secretary, told an EU colleague that the City question was the most important in the negotiations. He demanded a British veto over eurozone and European Central Bank decisions and regulations that affect the City.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b8af27b90a58b59ce5bab3cda955314bb6f945b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435155698685/66bd63b1-f71a-4467-bc2f-63582cb01107-460x299.jpeg\" alt=\" the City of London\" width=\"460\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron will seek to ensure the interests of the City of London are not disadvantaged by closer eurozone integration.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The person he was speaking to guffawed in astonishment. “What? Are you going to give us a veto over Bank of England decisions?” he is said to have replied.</p> \n<p>Faull will be central to settling these financial issues. It should not be the trickiest bit of the negotiations.</p> \n<p>Without going into detail, the British have pitched their demands under four “pillars” or “buckets” – sovereignty, competitiveness, fairness and welfare. The first is symbolic, focused on the EU treaties’ mission statement of “ever closer union”. It is not entirely meaningless, but hardly worth the fight.</p> \n<p> Competitiveness will be agreed relatively easily. They are all singing from the same hymn sheet. Fairness entails the single market structures and financial regulation. There is broad assent that Britain has a case, but these negotiations will be substantive.</p> \n<p>Welfare – connected to Cameron’s attempts to curb immigration and free movement of labour in the EU – will be Cameron’s most testing area. He is demanding a four-year benefits holiday for low-paid EU citizens working in the UK and for those unemployed. The government has run up against the limits of what it can do here in British law without breaking EU law and needs changes from Brussels. </p> \n<p>Many leaders say no, it is discrimination, and changing the regime would mean opening the Lisbon Treaty, seen almost everywhere outside Britain as a can of worms.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This is not really about content. It's about politics and symbols</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The summit will also discuss plans for strengthening the euro over the next decade. The blueprint has been deliberately structured to postpone treaty change until after 2017 specifically because of the British issue, senior sources said.</p> \n<p>On welfare there is willingness to tinker with the rules to limit so-called benefits tourism and “social security shopping”, but the changes are unlikely to be as deep as Cameron is requesting.</p> \n<p>Europe is crisis-ridden, tetchy and febrile. The last thing most leaders want is the third biggest country to leave. It could be a disaster. A British no to Europe would boost anti-European political movements and help populists make gains all across the union, they fear. And if Britain, traditionally the heartland of euro-scepticism, votes to stay in, it will be a major blow to the populists and a badly needed tonic for Europe, they hope.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t ask for a referendum, but we have to deal with it,” said a senior figure in Brussels. “That’s why we have to contribute. It might be complete nonsense but I’m a politician. This is not really about content. It’s about politics and symbols.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/62c8d5ccd05c170bff299eabef37bee16f0ee6ac/269_597_4763_2859/4763.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2859,"width":4763,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ints Kalnins/Reuters","altText":"European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker (R), Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron and European Council President Donald Tusk.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ints Kalnins/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435155699230/66bd63b1-f71a-4467-bc2f-63582cb01107-2060x1337.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1337,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"David Cameron will seek to ensure the interests of the City of London are not disadvantaged by closer eurozone integration.

She linked it to St Paul’s church in Frankfurt, which she will visit on Thursday, where Germany’s first freely elected legislature, the Frankfurt parliament, met in 1848.</p> \n<p>Drawing on the biographies of Britons who had emigrated to other parts of Europe and made their mark, she mentioned the Welsh engineer John Hughes, who founded the mining town of Donetsk, now in Ukraine, in the Russian empire of the 19th century, and the 17th-century Scottish publican Richard Cant, who moved his family to Pomerania. “His son moved further east to Memel and his grandson then moved south to K&ouml;nigsberg, where Richard’s great-grandson, Immanuel Kant, was born,” she said.</p> \n<p>In her repeated emphasis of the strong collaboration between Britain and Germany, which had “achieved so much” since 1945 and would “continue to do so in the years ahead,” the Queen said the most “enduring reminder” of the cultural cooperation between Germany and Britain was the Reichstag dome, designed by British architect Norman Foster. <br /></p> \n<p>Earlier in the day, she had observed the dome from the terrace of Merkel’s chancellery as the chancellor had shown her the Berlin skyline. On Friday, the Queen visits Bergen-Belsen, the former Nazi concentration camp in northern Germany. </p> \n<p>In response to the speech, the German president sought to emphasise the important role Britain had played in building democracy in Germany after the war and how grateful Germans were for that. Gauck said that Britain continued to have a vital role to play in Europe and was needed by the EU and that a “constructive dialogue” was necessary to address Britain’s concerns about its membership.</p> \n<p>“A quarter of a century after the division of our continent ended, the European Union is facing major challenges,” he said. “We know that we need an effective European Union based on a stable foundation of shared values. A constructive dialogue on the reforms Britain wants to see is therefore essential.”</p> \n<p>Germany would support such discussions, he said. “For Britain is a part of Europe. The European Union needs Britain.”</p> \n<p>Gauck, who was born in the northern port city of Rostock into a family of sailors, said: “There is a saying in the nautical world: ‘There is but a plank between a sailor and eternity’.” He said that while some planks in the European ship could be improved “to be frank, we in Germany would rather strengthen the planks than tear them out”.</p> \n<p>The banquet included trout, lamb and asparagus followed by strawberries and elderflower blossoms and accompanied by an assortment of German wines.</p> \n<p><em>This article was amended on 24 June to correct the title of Konrad Adenauer</em><br /></p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/468ae583b6d75e3bf730e59c47e9a7e0655d5d12/60_109_3340_2004/3340.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2004,"width":3340,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"STEFFEN KUGLER / HANDOUT/EPA","altText":"epa04817338 Britain's Queen Elizabeth II speaks during a state banquet in honor of the British Queen, in Berlin, Germany, 24 June 2015.

The prime minister is due to outline his plans towards the end of the summit dinner on Thursday night, after a lengthy discussion on the Mediterranean migrant crisis. If that discussion overruns, the prime minister may have to wait until the summit resumes on Friday morning.</p> \n<p>Cameron, who discussed his plans with the German chancellor in Berlin ahead of a state dinner in honour of the Queen, said: “This is my first European council since the election and it’s the first EU summit where renegotiation of the UK’s relationship with the EU is formally on the agenda. This presents an opportunity to get the negotiation underway and to kick off a process to work through the substance and to find solutions. </p> \n<p>“It will take us another step closer to addressing the concerns that the British people have about the EU. And closer to changing the status quo for the better and then giving the British people a say on whether the UK should stay in or leave the EU.”</p> \n<p>Downing Street was encouraged when Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, appointed the most senior British official in the commission, Jonathan Faull, to head a new taskforce examining issues relating to the UK referendum. Faull will report to Juncker, who will also be advised by the commission’s Anglophile first vice president Frans Timmermans.</p> \n<p>Faull is expected to liaise with officials from the EU’s council secretariat and the prime minister’s senior European adviser Tom Scholar, who will embark on technical discussions lasting several months after the summit.</p> \n<p>The council will examine Britain’s demands for treaty change on giving Britain an opt out from the “ever closer union” and on the changes to in-work benefits. Faull will be the key figure on changes that would be introduced through secondary legislation, Merkel’s preferred route.</p> \n<p>Cameron will fly from Berlin to Brussels on Thursday morning to allow him to take part in a final round of bilateral meetings with EU leaders. The prime minister had aimed to meet, or at least speak to, all 27 leaders, but it is expected that he will struggle to speak to his Greek counterpart Alexis Tsipras, who is focused on a eurozone summit on the Greek financial crisis that will follow the EU summit.</p> \n<p>The impact of Britain’s planned reforms – and the possibility that the UK could leave the EU – was highlighted by the Irish parliamentary committee’s report. It warned that some cross-border bodies could become redundant. The members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann (equivalent to MPs) and senators said: “The committee also heard that [a UK exit] could also threaten other north-south bodies and would ultimately have a politically destabilising effect on the region, relationships and the Good Friday agreement itself.”</p> \n<p>The committee said that a British exit could have a “significant psychological impact on those living near the border,” as it called for the maintenance of the Common Travel Area between the UK and the Irish Republic. Dublin should also be given a seat at the negotiations. “Ireland must be involved from the outset in these negotiations based on the special status of the Irish/UK relationship and that the UK/EU relationship is a ‘vital national interest’ to Ireland,” it said.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> This article was amended on 25 June 2015.

Greece’s creditors looked at the plan submitted by Alexis Tsipras to end his country’s debt crisis and found it wanting. Like a teacher dealing with an obtuse pupil, the message in the revised document sent back to the Greeks was simple: this is a shoddy piece of work. Do it again.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-membership\"> \n <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-newsroom-can-greece-be-saved-17456530954\">Guardian Newsroom: Can Greece be saved?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Without question, this makes life tough for the Greek prime minister, who thought the concessions offered on Monday were as much as he could deliver politically. Tsipras bridled at the demands from the troika to cross all his red lines and that means the crisis is back on again.</p> \n<p>Athens should not have been entirely surprised by the response given that the International Monetary Fund – one third of the troika – thinks a repair job on the public finances should be structured so that 80% of the improvement comes through spending cuts and 20% from tax increases.</p> \n<p>The plan put forward by Tsipras was skewed in the other direction. Of the €7.9bn (&pound;5.6bn) that the Greek government said the plan would raise, 92% came from tax increases. </p> \n<p>In the unlikely event that the extra revenues were collected in full, the IMF believes the one-off levy on bigger businesses coupled with the increases in corporation tax would hinder growth. It thinks the Greek plan will only add up if there are immediate cuts in pensions and higher VAT on restaurants and medical supplies.</p> \n<p>Olivier Blanchard, the IMF’s chief economist, explained its reasoning earlier this month. Greece’s creditors, he said, were prepared to accept that the state of the economy meant it was now impossible to meet the target of running a 3% primary budget surplus (revenues minus spending, excluding debt interest payments) in 2015, and that a lower 1% goal would now be acceptable to creditors.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8271d8d227b6cd28a167c8d6772c70686a3e3a65\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435160808097/f85f68ec-4e49-4f04-bd78-bce137124996-460x276.png\" alt=\"Amendments made by Greece's creditors\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greece’s creditors are in the mood for a rewrite.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Skai.gr</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“We believe that even the lower new target cannot be credibly achieved without a comprehensive reform of the VAT – involving a widening of its base – and a further adjustment of pensions”, Blanchard <a href=\"http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2015/06/14/greece-a-credible-deal-will-require-difficult-decisions-by-all-sides\">said in a blogpost</a>. <br /></p> \n<p>“Why insist on pensions? Pensions and wages account for about 75% of primary spending; the other 25% have already been cut to the bone. Pension expenditures account for over 16% of GDP, and transfers from the budget to the pension system are close to 10% of GDP. We believe a reduction of pension expenditures of 1% of GDP (out of 16%) is needed, and that it can be done while protecting the poorest pensioners. We are open to alternative ways for designing both the VAT and the pension reforms, but these alternatives have to add up and deliver the required fiscal adjustment.”</p> \n<p>The response from the Greek government is that the Fund’s sums don’t add up either, and won’t add up unless budget savings are accompanied by a hefty dollop of debt relief. Analysis by the London-based consultancy Capital Economics suggests that Tsipras is right.<br /></p> \n<p>When the IMF reviewed its programme in Greece in July 2014 it assumed that Greek debt would fall from its current 175% of GDP to 120% of GDP by 2020, a level considered sustainable. For that to happen, though, the Greek economy would need to grow by 3% this year and at similar level for the rest of the decade, inflation would have to average between 1% and 2% a year, and Athens would need to run a primary budget surplus of 4% a year.</p> \n<p>None of these assumptions looks remotely plausible. Greece’s economy will contract this year; it has deflation, not inflation; and it can only run primary surpluses of 4% a year by keeping the economy in permanent recession. Using a different – perhaps more realistic – set of assumptions (1% average growth, 0.5% inflation, 2% primary budget surplus), Greece’s debt to GDP ratio would continue rising.</p> \n<p>Debt relief would help square the circle. It would limit the need for further austerity, and it would be less politically toxic in Greece. The IMF knows this and has been pressing for it.</p> \n<p>But debt relief is being resisted by Greece’s European partners, who think it would mean their taxpayers paying for a writedown. Nor do they want anti-austerity parties in Spain and Portugal to be emboldened. So they have left Tsipras with a choice: surrender unconditionally or walk.</p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435160896010/b7084516-aea4-4f41-b9cd-2344fa2dbaa8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Julien Warnand/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime minister, at the talks in Brussels.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Julien Warnand/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435160809034/0454fdfb-f2b8-4803-991f-456d9ed28772-1020x612.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Greece’s creditors are in the mood for a rewrite.

That is why, as part of our long-term economic plan, our reforms to the welfare system are focused on making work pay, while our reforms to the tax system are allowing people to keep more of what they earn. </p> \n <p>“Latest figures show UK employment has reached an all-time high, with employment up more than two million since 2010, and the number of households where no one works is the lowest since records began.” </p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-558bc16ce4b024f829c5d480","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-25T08:54:59Z","body":"<p><em>Q: Did you ever slam the phone down on David Cameron?</em></p> \n<p>No, says Clegg.

Providing quality and reasonably priced childcare is an important factor but policy makers should also address workplace policies.”</p> \n<p>The researchers found that, on average, the daughters of working mothers were paid around 4% more than their peers, even adjusting for their greater levels of education and prevailing social attitudes, and were much more likely to have been promoted into managerial positions.</p> \n<p>One in three daughters of working mothers were in managerial posts, compared with only one in four of those with non-working mothers.</p> \n<p>“These findings suggest that in addition to transmitting gender attitudes across generations, mothers’ employment teaches daughters a set of skills that enable greater participation in the workforce and in leadership positions,” the study argues.</p> \n<p>Rebecca Allen, a working mother of two children and herself the daughter of a mother who worked, said the research suggested today’s women had benefited from their mothers’ struggles against discrimination and prevailing social attitudes.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>“There’s not overt discrimination against women and working mothers in the way that there had been in the previous generation,” said Allen, a senior academic at UCL’s Institute of Education and the <a href=\"http://www.educationdatalab.org.uk/Team/Rebecca-Allen.aspx\">director of an education data research thinktank</a>.</p> \n<p>“In some ways [the study’s findings are] a comfort to women who do go out to work – and a signal to women who don’t that they have to think hard about how the role they have within the household is going to impact their children’s perceptions of what it means to be a woman and to be a mother,” she said.</p> \n<p>While earlier research has also shown no negative consequences for the children of working mothers, the new study reveals that the children of working mothers have more liberal attitudes towards women in the workplace, and that sons of working mothers take a greater share of parenting and other household care roles.</p> \n<p>“Our analyses find that sons raised by an employed mother are more involved at home as adults, spending more time caring for family members than men whose mothers stayed home full-time,” the study reported.</p> \n<p>“Daughters raised by an employed mother spend less time on housework than women whose mothers stayed home full-time, but maternal employment has no effect on adult daughters’ involvement in caring for family members.”</p> \n<p>Belinda Phipps, chair of the <a href=\"http://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/\">Fawcett Society</a> for women’s equality, said: “Although we have known for a long time that there are lots of benefits to children to have working mothers, it is great to see more research confirming this.”</p> \n<p>But Phipps said it was disappointing to see that progress on sharing domestic housework other than childcare was proving slow to change. “Women are still ‘doing it all, not having it all’ and we must shift cultural attitudes to achieve full gender equality,” she said.</p> \n<p>“What is clear is that making the workplace more family-friendly, improving the availability and quality of part-time and flexible working, and investing in childcare are vital to helping individuals achieve a full work-life balance,” she said.</p> \n<p>Allen said that schools also need to adjust their demands on parents. “We’ve got to stop primary schools from having a day every week where parents are expected to dress up their children in some complicated outfit, or make something, or bring something in, or turn up to help with something or have an assembly,” she said.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435170566170/6a5fc3f4-41cd-41ad-85fd-6594de67ef0f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter

Dressed in a black suit, the 21-year-old sat impassive next to his lawyers. </p> \n<p>He folded and refolded his hands, rested his chin in a fist, and occasionally scratched his beard or head. He tilted his gaze to the ground, and only rarely looked at the speakers as they described injuries, nightmares and lost loved ones. </p> \n<p>In contrast, many of the survivors and victims’ families and friends made direct remarks to Tsarnaev, often in voices shaking with emotion.</p> \n<p>Jennifer Rogers, the sister of Sean Collier, an MIT police officer killed by the Tsarnaev brothers after the bombing, vented years of anger at Tsarnaev.</p> \n<p>“I will never have a complete family ever again,” Rogers said before describing her brother as a gregarious, generous man, whose love of “the small moments” was stolen by Tsarnaev. She said there was at least some solace in knowing Tsarnaev would not know the joy of those moments.</p> \n<p>“He is a coward and a liar,” she said. “He is a leech abusing the privileges of American freedom.”</p> \n<p>O’Toole was required to uphold the jury’s May recommendation that Tsarnaev be sentenced to death, but Rogers urged him to place exceptional restrictions on Tsarnaev’s incarceration wherever possible. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7767b362e8a2137cbe9717a67e16258194104b82\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435180625299/9559c94d-827d-483d-b21d-ec26c35ebf1f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Boston Marathon bombing survivors \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boston Marathon bombing survivors speak to the media on Wednesday, after Dzhokhar Tsarnaev made an apology during his sentence hearing </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Elizabeth Bourgault, a runner who survived the blasts with injuries, also called Tsarnaev a coward.</p> \n<p>“Whatever God that the defendant believes in is not going to welcome his actions,” she said. “The defendant’s God will condemn him to an eternity of suffering.”</p> \n<p>Intense sadness mingled with the anger. Bill Richard, who lost his eight-year-old son Martin to the bombing, said: “There’s nothing we can say that will change anything for us.”</p> \n<p>Tsarnaev “could have stopped his brother, he could have changed his mind”, Richard said. “He chose hate, he chose destruction, he chose death.”</p> \n<p>But Richard said of he and his wife Denise: “We choose love,” and reiterated their opposition to the death penalty.</p> \n<p>“We prefer he have a lifetime to reconcile himself with what he did that day, [but] he will not live that long,” said Richard.</p> \n<p>The bombing killed three people, Krystle Marie Campbell, 29, Lu Lingzi, 23, and eight-year-old Martin Richard. <br /></p> \n<p>Days later Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan killed Collier as federal and state law enforcement hunted them down in the Boston area.</p> \n<p>“This was an extraordinary case,” O’Toole said. “We will never forget the victims of these crimes and their stories.”</p> \n<p>“You had to forget your own humanity, the common humanity you shared with your brother Martin, your sister Lingzi Lu,” he continued. “It is tragic, for your victims and now for you.”</p> \n<p>O’Toole also repudiated the extremist rationale that inspired the Tsarnaev brothers: “Surely someone who believes God smiles on and rewards the killing of innocents believes in a cruel god. This is not and cannot be the god of Islam.</p> \n<p>At 21, Tsarnaev now becomes the youngest person on death row in the United States. Following the hearing, he will be taken from custody in Massachusetts to a federal prison in Indiana. He probably faces over a decade of appeals before his execution could take place.</p> \n<p>O’Toole said no one would remember that Tsarnaev’s teachers or friends were fond of him. He said what they what remember was that Tsarnaev “murdered and maimed innocent people” and “did it willfully and intentionally”. </p> \n<p>Tsarnaev looked down and rubbed his hands together as the judge sentenced him.

But many spoke of fighting for their future and of recovering despite the rippling consequences of the attack: medical costs, nightmares, children growing up without limbs, friends who no longer know how to communicate, and terror at the sounds of doors and sirens.</p> \n<p>Survivor Johanna Hantel said that the trial “has not been healing” for her: “I do not believe in closure.”</p> \n<p>But she did express pity for Tsarnaev, and was among a minority who asked him to try to do something good with the time he has left. In contrast, Michael Chase, a first responder who described the horror on Boylston Street in graphic detail, said: “I don’t want to speak to him. I’m here to say we’re OK.”</p> \n<p>Stephanie Benz, whose left side had “frozen” as a result of injuries sustained in the bombing, said that she still had hope despite daily pain.

But those figures also showed the conviction rate for rape fell to 56.9%. </p> \n<p>About 107,100 cases concerning violence against women and girls were prosecuted over the 12 months, a rise of 18.3% on the previous year.</p> \n<p>The figures also laid bare the young ages of many of those convicted of rape. The majority of defendants were aged 25-59 (59%) and 18-24 (21%). A total of 354 defendants (just under 8%) were aged 14-17 and 56 were aged 10-13.</p> \n<p>There were increases in the number of successful prosecutions for sexual offences, child sex abuse, domestic violence cases and honour-based violence, while more people were charged with rape than ever before in the past year. The CPS said it was investigating more historic allegations following the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/09/violent-against-women-massively-understated-statistics-agency-told\">Violent crime against women massively understated, statistics agency told</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Campaigners welcomed the report and praised prosecutors, the police and victims for their work in securing more convictions than ever before.</p> \n<p>But they said greater funding was required to help increase conviction rates and ensure women had access to support services.</p> \n<p>Katie Russell, a national spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England and Wales, said: “It’s clear that some progress has been made towards improving responses to this broad range of devastating crimes.</p> \n<p>“At the same time, the report highlights that we still have some distance to travel before all survivors of sexual violence and violence against women and girls receive the justice they want and deserve and there is no room for complacency.”</p> \n<p>Sarah Green, the acting director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: “The increase in prosecutions shows that more women are seeking justice, with big increases for example in the numbers of rape prosecutions and child sexual abuse prosecutions.</p> \n<p>“If as a society we really care about ensuring justice for survivors, we should do everything in our power to try to prevent abuse in the first place. This has to start in schools, with compulsory sex and relationships education to give young people the chance to talk about respectful relationships.</p> \n<p>“The CPS report includes figures on the alarmingly young age of many defendants in rape prosecutions. This is a call to urgent action.”</p> \n<p>The report showed the highest conviction volumes for domestic abuse (68,601), rape (2,581), sexual offences (7,591), honour-based violence (129) and child abuse (7,469), with more than 10,000 additional defendants convicted of domestic abuse.</p> \n<p>There was a 15% rise in stalking and harassment prosecutions to more than 12,000. Of these, 1,103 prosecutions were commenced under the new stalking offences.</p> \n<p>Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, said the report was “really good news for the victims of these dreadful crimes” and testament “to the hard work we (the CPS) have done recently to encourage victims to come forward, to work better with the police and ensure specially trained prosecutors bring the right cases to court”.</p> \n<p>She said: “Where cases meet the code for crown prosecutors, we will not shy away from taking cases forward, even when they are difficult and complex.</p> \n<p>“Of course, this additional volume of violence against women and girls brings challenges for prosecutors not only in terms of numbers, but the type of cases we are seeing – prosecutors across England and Wales are telling me that we are seeing more non-recent child sexual abuse cases and more of the particularly complex rape cases coming forward.</p> \n<p>“While there has been a slight drop in the rape conviction rate, we are bringing the right, although often the more difficult, cases to court as they are left to the jury to decide.</p> \n<p>“Anyone who is a victim of these crimes should feel encouraged by this news and confident that they will be believed when reporting these crimes.”</p> \n<p>Polly Neate, the chief executive of Women’s Aid, said: “The report demonstrates that significant progress has been made in taking more cases of domestic violence through the criminal justice system. This is positive.</p> \n<p>“This progress must continue until we have a system where women who experience domestic violence have exactly the same level of confidence as victims of other crimes, that they are heard and believed, the system works for them and protects their human right to live free from violence.”</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435167412424/782e29b8-35be-4ffb-a8e4-6afaacb02378-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dominic Lipinski/PA","altText":"A woman tries to hide from her partner on a sofa.
