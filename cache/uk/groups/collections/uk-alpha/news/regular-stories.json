Its debt should have been written down in 2010, but it wasn’t because it was “bailed out” to the extent that it was given money to then give to French and German banks. The longer Europe pretends this new debt will be paid back, the longer Greece’s depression will go on. Now, it’s true that Europe has lowered the interest rates and extended the maturities on Greece’s debt so far out that, for now at least, it’s like a lot of it doesn’t exist. But eventually it will, and at that point they’ll either need to extend-and-pretend some more or hope that Greece has returned to growth.</p> \n <p>Until then, Greece will be stuck in its economic Groundhog Day. It keeps trying to resist these pointless budget cuts that just keep it in a perpetual state of high unemployment, but then gives in at the last minute.

Cameron’s official spokeswoman pointed out that this means fewer children could be in poverty during a recession because average household incomes have fallen, even if their circumstances stayed the same.</p> \n<p>The issue was considered two days before official Below Average Income statistics are published, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies forecasting an increase from 2.3 million to 2.5 million children in poverty – the first rise for 10 years. When the figures are released, the government is expected to argue they are not a true reflection of poverty and should be changed. But Cameron may not want to risk accusations that he is trying to dodge his record on child poverty by making an official announcement on changing the measurements on the same day. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You can’t have one nation if children’s opportunities and life chances at every turn are shaped and limited by poverty</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Alison Garnham, Child Poverty Action Group</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>One option could be to supplement the current definition with new ones, rather than replacing it altogether. Changing the definition of child poverty was discussed under the last government but then put on hold in 2014, as the coalition could not agree how it would be done. The measure under consideration would have taken a complex approach that also took into account whether children have access to a good education, a decent home, and a stable family.</p> \n<p>A little-noticed line in the Conservative party’s general election manifesto said the government would “work to eliminate child poverty and introduce better measures to drive real change in children’s lives, by recognising the root causes of poverty: entrenched worklessness, family breakdown, problem debt, and drug and alcohol dependency”.</p> \n<p>In a speech on Monday about welfare and opportunity, Cameron gave a strong hint that proposals to change the definition were back on the table. “Just take the historic approach to tackling child poverty,” he told the audience in Runcorn. “Today, because of the way it is measured, we are in the absurd situation where if we increase the state pension, child poverty actually goes up.”</p> \n<p>The No 10 spokeswoman said ministers had talked about how they would deliver on the manifesto and had considered “how to have the right measures in place to drive real change to tackle the root causes of poverty”. “Some of this ties in with the argument the prime minister was making [on Monday].

It is understood that the Scottish parliament intends to retain the profits from the crown estate in Scotland for use in Scotland, which could have the consequence of reducing the sovereign grant, which funds the monarchy. </p> \n<p>Buckingham Palace intends to raise the consequences for the Queen with David Cameron and George Osborne.</p> \n<p>It had been understood that Scotland would still agree to contribute to the Queen’s costs after taking over management of the crown estate assets north of the border, worth &pound;26m, but it appears that under Nicola Sturgeon this will not occur. “Originally, Alex Salmond did imply that might happen. But the new leadership said no,” one senior aide said.</p> \n<p>The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2014/jan/28/queens-royal-household-budget\">sovereign grant</a> – which this year was &pound;39.9m – funds the royal household. It is calculated on a formula that sees the Queen handed 15% of the annual surplus of the crown estate, one of the largest property owners in the UK. This year, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/nov/27/scottish-devolution-smith-commission-key-points\">revenue from the crown estate in Scotland</a> stood at &pound;14.5m, which represents a &pound;2.2m contribution to the sovereign grant.</p> \n<p>Palace officials raised the issue as they presented the Queen’s annual accounts. Sir Alan Reid, keeper of the privy purse, said the Scottish plans created a complication over future funding. “The transfer of the Scottish assets of the crown estate to the Scottish government does confuse the issue of renegotiating the percentage in due course because the total assets under the crown estate management will fall, and therefore 15% will be less than it would be if the transfer of the Scottish assets had taken place,” he said.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Under Alex Salmond, the SNP last year pledged that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/sep/11/queen-governor-general-scotland-independence-monarchy\">Scotland would retain the Queen as head of state</a>, if the country had voted for independence from the rest of the UK last September. But the monarch faced criticism in Scotland after she was asked to make a rare public intervention in the final days of the Scottish independence referendum, speaking publicly to a well-wisher outside church near Balmoral saying: “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/sep/14/queen-scottish-independence-voters-think-carefully-referendum-balmoral\">I hope people will think very carefully about the future</a>.”<br /></p> \n<p>Buckingham Palace stressed that the funding issue would not affect the royal family’s relationship with Scotland. The Queen will “continue to go to Balmoral, and to Holyrood, and she’ll continue to be Queen of Scotland”, said one source.</p> \n<p>There appears to be no other mechanism in place for Scotland to contribute to the monarchy. Scottish ministers are thought to be considering transferring the management of the crown estate assets in Scotland on to the local authorities, with the intention of using the surplus for more social purposes.</p> \n<p>A Buckingham Palace spokesman said it was wrong to infer that Scotland would no longer contribute to the monarchy based on the change to the operation of the crown estate and its impact on the grant received by the Queen.</p> \n<p>The spokesman said it was an “entirely hypothetical” situation, and that though the sovereign grant was calculated on a percentage of the crown estate income, “there is a formulaic connection between the two, but there is no financial connection between the two”. </p> \n<p>Scots would effectively still contribute to the costs of the monarchy because they pay taxes to the Treasury, which in turn supplies the money for the sovereign grant, he said. </p> \n<p>A Scottish government spokeswoman added: “Scotland will continue to make the same financial contribution to the monarchy as at present – there will be no reduction in the sovereign grant as a result of devolution of the crown estate.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>The Scottish government said that the level of funding the Queen receives from the Treasury under the sovereign grant is set by reference to 15% of the crown estate’s profits and does not come directly from crown estate profits themselves. With most taxes paid in Scotland continuing to be controlled by the Treasury, Scotland will continue to make the same contribution to the monarchy through general taxation.</p> \n<p>The sovereign grant – which apart from security costs represents the main public funding of the monarchy – was introduced in 2011 to replace the annual civil list and property and travel grants. It is based on 15% of crown estate profits from two years previously, but its amount cannot drop below the previous year and the exact percentage is renegotiated every five years. It is due for review from April 2016.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>The crown estate income was surrendered to the Treasury in return for an annual civil list by George III.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>The Queen’s accounts show a 6.7% increase in funding last year to &pound;37.9m, of which she spent &pound;35.7m, setting the rest aside in a reserve account. </p> \n<p>Defending the increase, at a time of austerity, aides said money had to be found for major repairs on property, including at Buckingham Palace. As part of a 10-year plan, aides have looked at re-servicing Buckingham Palace, with an initial estimate of &pound;150m to bring it up to date. One option would involve the Queen and royal household moving out for the duration of repairs. </p> \n<p>The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall notched up the largest travel bill – a &pound;446,159 tour of Mexico and Colombia, a &pound;239,710 tour of the United States and Charles’s visit to the Middle East, which cost &pound;262,212 – all of them using charter flights. </p> \n<p>Royal travel costs rose to &pound;5.1m, up 21% on 2013-4. The Duke of York spent &pound;62,856 on a charter flight to Kuwait and &pound;43,343 on a charter to Saudi Arabia. Prince Harry’s tour of Brazil and Chile cost &pound;43,872 on scheduled flights and &pound;41,754 on charter flights. </p> \n<p>Prince Charles saw his income from the Duchy of Cornwall rise by 1.7% to &pound;19.8m. His tax bill, after the deduction of business expenditure, was &pound;4.5m.</p> \n<p>Presenting the accounts, which will be laid before parliament, Reid said: “The Queen, the royal family and the household continue to provide excellent value for money: at 56p per person annually.”</p> \n<p>He added: “Over the coming years, the maintenance of the estate and in particular Buckingham Palace will present a significant financial challenge. We will continue to work closely with the royal trustees to ensure that the funding for the royal household reflects that challenge.”</p> \n<p><br /></p> \n<p> </p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/33fc1b7c91333f9a872108abb03a052e8769dfc4/0_122_1992_1195/1992.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1195,"width":1992,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"KAY NIETFELD/EPA","altText":"The Queen","cleanCredit":"Photograph: KAY NIETFELD/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T23:17:47Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T23:18:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1038,"contributors":[{"name":"Caroline Davies","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/5/26/1432636572595/Caroline-Davies-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/carolinedavies"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Scotland","The Queen","Nicola Sturgeon","UK news","Monarchy","Tax and spending","Alex Salmond","Politics","Devolution","Scottish National party (SNP)","Prince Charles"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland"},{"id":"uk/queen","webTitle":"The Queen"},{"id":"politics/nicola-sturgeon","webTitle":"Nicola Sturgeon"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk/monarchy","webTitle":"Monarchy"},{"id":"politics/taxandspending","webTitle":"Tax and spending"},{"id":"politics/alexsalmond","webTitle":"Alex Salmond"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"politics/devolution","webTitle":"Devolution"},{"id":"politics/snp","webTitle":"Scottish National party (SNP)"},{"id":"uk/prince-charles","webTitle":"Prince Charles"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Caroline Davies","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/carolinedavies"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/24/scotland-decides-stop-funding-queen-scottish-crown-estate","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a4v5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jun/24/scotland-decides-stop-funding-queen-scottish-crown-estate","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/24/scotland-decides-stop-funding-queen-scottish-crown-estate"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/33fc1b7c91333f9a872108abb03a052e8769dfc4/0_122_1992_1195/1992.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1195,"width":1992,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Queen’s accounts show a 6.7% increase in funding last year to £37.9m, of which she spent £35.7m, setting the rest aside in a reserve account.

It hands all its profits to the Treasury, about 15% of which is then passed to the Queen. The organisation’s portfolio value has hit an all-time high of &pound;11.5bn, up 16% on 2014.</p> \n<p>Profits rose 6.7% over the past financial year as the estate benefited from rising land values and property sales of &pound;451m into “strong markets”, outstripping acquisitions of &pound;327m. The group said it outperformed the market for a fifth year, with total returns from capital growth and revenues up 20.8%. </p> \n<p>All of the estate’s West End shops in London are let. The estate will build half of the total new office space in the West End (about 38,000 sq m) in the coming year. There is so much demand that the group now lets new space before a building’s practical completion.</p> \n<p>Although the property estate dates back to the Norman conquest of 1066, the <a href=\"http://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/who-we-are/our-history/history/\">organisation began in 1760</a> when George II handed over management of the royal lands to the government. According to the director of investment, Paul Clark, save for the “odd acquisition”, the group now focuses on new developments. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>The crown estate made its biggest acquisition ever last summer, when it bought Fosse Shopping Park in Leicester, one of Britain’s biggest out-of-town retail parks, together with the Chinese state investor Gingko Tree for &pound;345m. Fosse joined its portfolio of 16 retail parks worth &pound;1.5bn, with empty space at 2%. “We haven’t bought a lot in London this year. More of the capital is going into developments,” Clark said.</p> \n<p>While it does not build homes itself, the estate owns strategic land across the country that received approvals for 2,410 new homes over the past year. It also leases the seabed to offshore windfarms that now generate close to 5 gigawatts of electricity. The goal is to double generation to 10GW by 2020. This would deliver 10% of the UK’s electricity and bring costs down below &pound;100 per megawatt hour. The price at present ranges up to &pound;121. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>As part of devolution in Scotland, management of the group’s Scottish assets – now worth &pound;260m – will pass to a standalone organisation, although the crown estate will continue to own them. Assets include farmland, coastal waters and the rights for renewable energy – wind, wave and tidal power plus carbon capture storage. Annual revenues in Scotland make up less than 4% of the group’s total.</p> \n<p>In Scotland, more than 80% of rural land remains privately owned, with about half of that owned by 432 landowners, led by the Duke of Buccleuch, <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/sunday-herald-view/cairngorms-call-highlights-need-for-land-reform.123549132\">the Sunday Herald reported recently</a>. Scotland has the most concentrated pattern of private land ownership in the developed world.</p> \n<p>The crown estate has been careful not to take sides before the referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU.

They also purport to show that Hollande feared a Greek euro zone exit as far back back as 2012.</p> \n<p>The documents are said to include summaries of conversations between French government officials on the global financial crisis, the future of the European Union, the relationship between Hollande’s administration and Merkel’s government, French efforts to determine the make-up of the executive staff of the United Nations, and a dispute between the French and US governments over the latter spying on France. </p> \n<p>In 2012, just days after Hollande took office, according to the Wikileaks documents, he “approved holding secret meetings in Paris to discuss the eurozone crisis, particularly the consequences of a Greek exit from the eurozone”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29c6b01e781c8698e0fb2fdc26260586f93c138a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/29c6b01e781c8698e0fb2fdc26260586f93c138a/80_106_2292_1373/1000.jpg\" alt=\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel , US President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande chat after they posed for a family photo during the G8 summit, May 2012 at the Camp David\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">German Chancellor Angela Merkel , US President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande chat after they posed for a family photo during the G8 summit, May 2012 at the Camp David</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The files say Hollande believed German chancellor Angela Merkel “had given up [on Greece] and was unwilling to budge”.</p> \n<p>“This made Hollande very worried for Greece and the Greek people, who might react by voting for an extremist party,” the document alleges.</p> \n<p> The revelations come as France gives its domestic intelligence and surveillance services controversial greater powers to combat jihadist networks, with more permissions to bug phones and licences to carry out mass surveillance on the internet.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.liberation.fr/monde/2015/06/23/chirac-sarkozy-et-hollande-trois-presidents-sur-ecoute_1335767\">an article</a> co-authored by Julian Assange, the French newspaper Lib&eacute;ration pointed out that in matters of spying, there are no friends: “Spying abroad is the ultimate ‘grey zone’ in surveillance – it is also, in France, the real blind spot of the planned law on surveillance, expected to be adopted this Wednesday.”<br /></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.mediapart.fr/journal/international/230615/ce-que-revelent-les-documents-wikileaks\">Mediapart said</a>: “For almost 10 years, the United States has listened into French presidents … it was all classed top secret or ‘special intelligence’.</p> \n<p>“In the five documents that we are publishing, four were marked with a G, kept for the most ‘highly sensitive material’, others were labelled ‘NF’, stipulating that they must not be communicated to foreign countries in any circumstances.

As a general matter we do not conduct any foreign intelligence surveillance activities unless there is a specific and national security purpose. This applies to ordinary citizens and world leaders alike.”</p> \n<p>The Elys&eacute;e has not commented on the revelations except to say it is looking at the leaks to see “what is involved”. </p> \n<p>Hollande’s Socialist party issued a statement saying the reports suggested “a truly stupefying state paranoia”. Even if the government had been aware of such intercepts, the party said, it would not mean “that this massive, systematic, uncontrolled eavesdropping is tolerable”.</p> \n<p>Sources close to Sarkozy told journalists the spying was “unacceptable as a general rule and even more so among allies”.</p> \n<p>There was no immediate comment from Chirac.</p> \n<p>Michele Alliot-Marie, a former defence and foreign affairs minister under Chirac and Sarkozy, told the iTele channel that France had long known the US had the technical means to try to intercept conversations.</p> \n<p>“We are not naive: the conversations that took place between the defence ministry and the president did not happen on the telephone,” she said.</p> \n<p>“That being said, it does raise the problem of the relationship of trust between allies.”</p> \n<p> </p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b995f8ce28408a063637c7ad8650570ff1e524ec/138_210_2083_1250/2083.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1250,"width":2083,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Francois Holland with Barack Obama","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alain Jocard/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/29c6b01e781c8698e0fb2fdc26260586f93c138a/80_106_2292_1373/2292.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1373,"width":2292,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"German Chancellor Angela Merkel , US President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande chat after they posed for a family photo during the G8 summit, May 2012 at the Camp David Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images","credit":"Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"German Chancellor Angela Merkel , US President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande chat after they posed for a family photo during the G8 summit, May 2012 at the Camp David","cleanCaption":"German Chancellor Angela Merkel , US President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande chat after they posed for a family photo during the G8 summit, May 2012 at the Camp David","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-24T07:07:23Z","lastModified":"2015-06-24T08:07:06Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":657,"contributors":[{"name":"Kim Willsher","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/kim-willsher"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["France","US news","WikiLeaks","NSA","Nicolas Sarkozy","Europe","Jacques Chirac","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/france","webTitle":"France"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"media/wikileaks","webTitle":"WikiLeaks"},{"id":"us-news/nsa","webTitle":"NSA"},{"id":"world/nicolas-sarkozy","webTitle":"Nicolas Sarkozy"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/jacques-chirac","webTitle":"Jacques Chirac"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Kim Willsher","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/kim-willsher"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/23/francois-hollande-emergency-meeting-wikileaks-us-spied-three-presidents-france","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a42a","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/23/francois-hollande-emergency-meeting-wikileaks-us-spied-three-presidents-france","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/23/francois-hollande-emergency-meeting-wikileaks-us-spied-three-presidents-france"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b995f8ce28408a063637c7ad8650570ff1e524ec/138_210_2083_1250/2083.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1250,"width":2083,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"French president François Hollande has called a meeting of the defence council after WikiLeaks revealed the US had spied on him.
