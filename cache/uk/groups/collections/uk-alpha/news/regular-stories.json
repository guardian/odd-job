The figures show an increase of 38% – more than a third – on the previous year.</p> \n<p>The majority of the victims were aged between 12 and 16 but more than one in four – 8,282 – were younger than 11, the charity said. Of those, 2,895 are estimated to be aged five or under, including 94 babies.</p> \n<p>More than three-quarters of the reported abuse cases were against girls (24,457). Britain’s largest force, the Metropolitan police, recorded the highest number of sex crimes against children, with 3,523.</p> \n<p>The data, obtained through freedom of information requests, reveals a significant year-on-year increase in the number of sex offences against children. In 2012-13, the same research showed that a total of 22,654 sexual crimes against children were recorded by 41 police forces. All 43 forces in England and Wales responded in the latest study.</p> \n<p>The NSPCC said that until now the total had largely remained steady and the 38% rise was the biggest increase in six years of requesting the figures. Since 2008/09, the number has increased by almost 50%. </p> \n<p>Last year the charity helped 2,400 young victims through its therapeutic recovery programme, but it says there are not enough services to support every child who has experienced abuse.</p> \n<p>Jon Brown, senior policy officer for the NSPCC, said: “Our estimate is that there are 50,000 children in the country who need help and support for abuse who are not getting it. </p> \n<p>“We need the government to step up and breach this gap. It cannot be right that so many children are going without support. We should be treating this as a public health problem given the damage done into adulthood to individuals who have been abused as children.”</p> \n<p>The figures provide more evidence of an <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/apr/09/reported-child-sexual-abuse-has-risen-60-in-last-four-years-figures-show\">increase in reports of sexual offences</a> in the wake of the revelations about the scale of abuse by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/feb/27/jimmy-savile-sexual-abuse\">Jimmy Savile</a> which emerged in 2012.</p> \n<p>Police experts say the effect of the case has been to encourage more victims, both those reporting abuse in the past and ongoing abuse, to come forward because they are now more confident they will be believed.</p> \n<p>But improved recording methods by police have also been cited as a possible reason for the increase.</p> \n<p>Brown said it was not clear whether the increase in reports of abuse was due to an actual rise or increased confidence of victims coming forward.</p> \n<p>He agreed with comments made last month by Simon Bailey, chief constable of Norfolk and the national police lead on child abuse, that there was a real increase in abuse taking place, much of it facilitated by the internet.</p> \n<p>Responding to the new figures, Bailey said they still represented the tip of the iceberg.</p> \n<p> “Many, many, more victims have found the confidence to report abuse, knowing they will be treated with sensitivity and respect, that we will listen to them and that we will take their allegations seriously,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Increased reporting means we are dealing with unprecedented number of investigations but it is my belief that more abuse is being perpetrated. The internet has given people the ability to sit in their room and indulge fantasies in a way that simply was not available to them two decades ago.”</p> \n<p>Last month Bailey revealed that the police are <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/20/1400-suspects-operation-hydrant-politician-and-celebrity-child-sex-abuse-inquiry\">investigating more than 1,400 prominent men</a>, including politicians, celebrities and those linked to institutions, over allegations that they have sexually abused children in the past. The investigations are being carried out by forces across the country and coordinated by a team running Operation Hydrant.</p> \n<p>The NSPCC is publishing its report on the safety of children on Wednesday at its annual conference in London which will be attended by leading figures from the world of child protection.</p> \n<p>Peter Wanless, the charity’s chief executive, said: “These figures are disturbing and clearly illustrate child sexual abuse is a continuing and widespread problem that needs urgent action. But we know this is still only a fraction of the true number of victims because some endure an agonising wait of many years before telling anyone – and others never reveal what has happened to them.”</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434495355885/aa233f3c-73d1-4583-9d94-dac040ebb227-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andersen Ross/Getty Images","altText":"Shadow of girl on a swing","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andersen Ross/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-17T07:08:20Z","lastModified":"2015-06-17T08:13:39Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Sandra Laville","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sandralaville"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Children","UK news","Child protection","Social care","Society"],"tags":[{"id":"society/children","webTitle":"Children"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"society/childprotection","webTitle":"Child protection"},{"id":"society/social-care","webTitle":"Social care"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sandra Laville","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sandralaville"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/17/police-record-85-sexual-assaults-children-day-nspcc","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49pbn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jun/17/police-record-85-sexual-assaults-children-day-nspcc","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/17/police-record-85-sexual-assaults-children-day-nspcc"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434495355885/aa233f3c-73d1-4583-9d94-dac040ebb227-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"More than three-quarters of the reported abuse cases were against girls.

While absent without leave, he had posted a dossier online alleging 30 flaws on the submarines that carry Britain’s nuclear warheads and warning that Trident was “a disaster waiting to happen”.</p> \n<p>The navy described his dossier as “subjective and unsubstantiated” and launched an inquiry that concluded by dismissing his allegations as “factually incorrect or the result of misunderstanding or partial understanding”. But now he has hit back, fiercely defending the accuracy of what he said. </p> \n<p>All but three of the safety flaws he highlighted were “either witnessed or read in documented reports on the patrol,” he says. The remaining three “were accurate reports of what was described to me by experienced submariners.”<br />“Other submariners have been anonymously releasing information to journalists. It’s only a matter of time before worse information comes out, and everything is proven to be true,” he adds.</p> \n<p>“All of the charges against me were dropped; there’s nothing that I can be charged with now. Most people know that I acted in the interest of national security. However, I was still given a dishonourable discharge from the Royal Navy.”</p> \n<p>He was discharged “on the claim that my sole aim was to discredit their public image”, he says. “The truth is I view the Royal Navy as the greatest navy in history.”</p> \n<p>McNeilly, a 25-year-old recruit from Belfast, served on the Trident submarine HMS Victorious for three months at the beginning of the year. He claims that during his dismissal process he refused to sign a naval document discrediting his allegations.</p> \n<p>He has had support from other military personnel, he says. “Some of them were shocked that I didn’t receive an honourable discharge or wasn’t kept in the service.”</p> \n<p>He reiterates his claims that security procedures are dangerously lax. “All it takes is for one contractor or one person from the military to put a bomb in his/her bag, and the UK is at a high risk of becoming the Chernobyl of Europe,” he says. </p> \n<p>“When I joined the Royal Navy, I had no idea that I was going to work with nuclear weapons. When I found out, I was happy. I used to think they were an essential tool in maintaining peace, by deterring war,” he adds.</p> \n<p>“It wasn’t until I saw the major safety and security issues that I realised the system is more of a threat than a deterrent.” </p> \n<p>Security must be tightened “above its current highest possible state until the missiles are removed,” he argues.</p> \n<p>According to McNeilly, people were lied to about weapons of mass destruction in the runup to the Iraq war. “Now you’re being lied to about how safe and secure the nuclear weapons on your homeland are,” he says.</p> \n<p>“I’ve been strongly advised to remain silent and live a private life. I’m civilian now, and I have the right to free speech. I’m not going to waste that freedom by just sitting around on my ass, while the UK is in danger.”</p> \n<p>It is “absolutely ridiculous” to suggest that he is some kind of “SNP super agent”, he says. But he is supportive of the Scottish political party’s aim of ridding Scotland of Trident, and promises to make a judgement on the UK government’s Trident policy on 7 July.</p> \n<p>At the same time as McNeilly’s new report went online on 16 June, the Daily Telegraph reported an anonymous naval source suggesting that he had been thrown out of the Royal Navy. “He is no longer in the navy,” the source was quoted as saying. “He has not resigned and not retired.”</p> \n<p>A spokeswoman for the Royal Navy confirmed to Portsmouth News that Able Seaman McNeilly had left the service. “Throughout the process AB McNeilly was still being afforded the duty of care that we give all our personnel, as was his family,” she said.</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434523004873/37543273-19a2-4d1f-aa91-7fb185e45a52-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","credit":" William Lewis/Facebook","altText":"William McNeilly","cleanCredit":"Photograph:  William Lewis/Facebook"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-17T06:49:50Z","lastModified":"2015-06-17T08:06:04Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Rob Edwards","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rob-edwards"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Trident","Scotland","Defence policy","Military","Nuclear weapons","Politics","UK news","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/trident","webTitle":"Trident"},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland"},{"id":"politics/defence","webTitle":"Defence policy"},{"id":"uk/military","webTitle":"Military"},{"id":"world/nuclear-weapons","webTitle":"Nuclear weapons"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rob Edwards","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rob-edwards"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/17/trident-whistleblower-william-mcneilly-discharged-from-royal-navy","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49phb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jun/17/trident-whistleblower-william-mcneilly-discharged-from-royal-navy","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/17/trident-whistleblower-william-mcneilly-discharged-from-royal-navy"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434523004873/37543273-19a2-4d1f-aa91-7fb185e45a52-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Whistleblower William McNeilly warned that Trident was ‘a disaster waiting to happen’.

Anything could happen.”</p> \n<p>Governments use capital controls to stop banks haemorrhaging deposits and to avert insolvency. They can involve setting ceilings on foreign transfers, taxing particular kinds of withdrawal, performing physical checks at borders – but also limiting cash withdrawals from banks and ATMs. </p> \n<p>In Cyprus that limit was set at €300 a day, but many observers believe Greece might well need to set a considerably lower daily limit. “What’s that going to be like – no one allowed to take out more than, I don’t know, €100 a day?” asked Christos Ekonomou, a hairdresser. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/14/greeces-latest-attempt-to-reach-deal-with-creditors-collapses\">Greece's latest attempt to reach deal with creditors collapses</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As Greece’s choice comes ever more sharply into focus – between opting to stay in the eurozone and experiencing yet more austerity, or defaulting on its repayments and possibly returning to the drachma – some economists have also suggested, as an interim measure, a halfway house parallel currency that would involve government IOU notes and tax credit certificates. </p> \n<p>On Tuesday, for every wealthy Kolonaki resident fretting about their cash, there was a less well-off state or company employee convinced it would not come to that. “I’m worried, sure, for my job, my kids, my future.

But despite deep concerns about the their country’s economic future, few Greeks see any benefits to be had from leaving the eurozone.</p> \n<p>A recent opinion poll for the news website Newsit showed as many as 74% of Greeks back the euro – with fully 50% saying they would be prepared to accept “major concessions” by the country’s Syriza-led government if it would help break the deadlock with bailout lenders. “We have to stay in,” said Votskaris. “If we leave, things will only get far, far worse.” </p> \n<p>Barpakis concurred: “We should definitely stay in – as long as the eurozone is prepared to be what it really should be, which is to say a genuine union whose members help, not punish, each other.”</p> \n<p>Christofosaki, though, while also convinced Greece’s future had to be inside the eurozone, was less sure how things would pan out. “The big problem in this country is a mental one,” she said. Even if we do get concessions and there is a deal, a majority of people don’t really want to reform.

It needs the money to meet debt repayments and without it there is a fear that Greece will end up defaulting, which could precipitate its exit from the eurozone. </p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/14/greeces-latest-attempt-to-reach-deal-with-creditors-collapses\">Talks at the weekend ended in a stalemate</a>. Eurozone finance ministers meet on Thursday, possibly the last chance to unlock badly needed rescue funds for Greece before it has to repay €1.6bn (&pound;1.2bn) to the International Monetary Fund at the end of June.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/live/2015/jun/15/greek-default-fears-markets-talks-draghi-live\">Greek default fears hit markets, as commissoner predicts &quot;state of emergency&quot; - live updates</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>What are the debt talks?</h2> \n<p>After bailouts in 2010 and 2012, Greece owes money to the so-called Brussels Group, made up of the IMF, the European commission and European Central Bank (ECB). A further €7.2bn in bailout money is still to be paid out to Greece by the trio of creditors. The creditors, also known as the troika, want to see more reforms in Greece in return for releasing the last lump of rescue funds.</p> \n<p>Greece’s government, led by Alexis Tsipras, the prime minister, contends that austerity measures demanded by creditors are too harsh and that some of its huge debts need writing off or shifting back for much later repayment if the country is ever to get back on its feet. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jan/25/greece-election-vote-austerity-leftwing-syriza-eu\">Tsipras came to power on an anti-austerity ticket in January</a> and is refusing to accept new spending cuts and tax rises to achieve the budget surpluses demanded by Greece’s lenders.</p> \n<p>Tsipras has indicated he would accept compromises on the lenders’ austerity demands in return for debt relief – the writing off or rescheduling of some of Greece’s debt. But debt relief, and the prospect of never recovering money owed, is staunchly opposed by Germany, the biggest contributor to Greece’s €240bn bailouts.</p> \n<h2>Where have the two sides got to?</h2> \n<p>Last-ditch talks on Sunday collapsed in acrimony after 45 minutes. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/eu\">European Union</a> officials dismissed Greece’s latest reform package as incomplete and said there was still a €2bn gap between Athens and the trio of lenders in terms of yearly permanent budget savings.</p> \n<p>Greece continues to insist on softer terms for the rescue funds. <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/06/15/uk-eurozone-greece-paper-idUKKBN0OV0GB20150615\">Tsipras implied on Monday that he would continue to resist demands to raise taxes and cut pensions</a>. “One can only see a political purposefulness in the insistence of creditors on new cuts in pensions after five years of looting under the bailouts,” he said in a statement to the Greek newspaper Ton Syntakton.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/15/markets-slide-as-greece-demands-end-to-creditor-looting\">Markets slide as fears grow that Greece is close to defaulting on debt</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“We will await patiently until the institutions accede to realism,” he said. “We do not have the right to bury European democracy at the place where it was born.”</p> \n<p>After the breakdown of Sunday’s talks, the IMF sought to bring the parties closer together, with its chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, making suggestions for both sides. He said Brussels should be prepared to delay more of Greece’s debt repayments, accept only limited reforms and cut the interest applied to debt-relief loans, while Tsipras should offer further pension reforms and accept that some VAT exemptions must be dropped.</p> \n<h2>What happens this week?</h2> \n<p>On Wednesday, the ECB’s governing council meets and will discuss whether to extend emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) for Greece. The ECB has been drip-feeding this support to Greek banks as they struggle with dwindling deposits because worried Greek savers are pulling their money out of accounts to keep at home or move overseas.</p> \n<p>However, as the name implies, this was never intended to be a long-term measure to keep a eurozone country afloat and the ECB has come under pressure to pull the plug. On Thursday, eurozone finance ministers gather in Luxembourg, and the cash-for-reform talks will resume.</p> \n<h2>Headlines say time is running out. Is it?</h2> \n<p>Over five months of fruitless talks, phrases like “last-ditch” and “crunch time” have been used again and again. But a look at Greece’s debt repayment schedule suggest things really are coming to a head now.</p> \n<p>Greece has a heavy calendar of debt repayments, as the chart below shows (note that the June payments to the IMF are now due in one lump sum of €1.6bn on 30 June, after Greece was allowed to bundle them together). Greece also needs funds for domestic spending obligations such as paying public-sector workers and pensions. Without the held-up bailout money Greece will sooner or later miss a debt repayment – technically defaulting.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Greek debt calendar\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1429523245329/greek-debt.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Greek debt calendar\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/15/unsustainable-futures-greece-pensions-dilemma-explained-financial-crisis-default-eurozone\">Unsustainable futures?

Of course, he too may have given up on reaching an agreement and is keeping up appearances simply to impress Greek voters. Either way, he is no longer in last-chance saloon but no-chance saloon.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>What is happening to Greece’s economy in the meantime?</h2> \n<p>As talks grind on, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/may/29/stock-markets-unsettled-greek-debt-deal-uncertainty-cash-exodus\">Greece’s economy has fallen back into recession</a>. A sharp drop in investment by increasingly nervous businesses and falling imports and exports left GDP down 0.2% in the first quarter after a 0.4% drop in the final months of 2014, according to the latest figures.</p> \n<p>Unemployment remains the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Unemployment_statistics\">highest in the eurozone</a> at more than 25%.

It is not in anyone’s interests for Greece to leave the eurozone. For Greece, it would mean widespread bankruptcies. For the remaining eurozone members, the fact that a precedent of exit had been established would probably lead to a permanent upwards re-pricing of their sovereign debt. For both sides, it would be a very risky leap into the unknown.</p> \n <p>A short-lived default should not therefore lead to Grexit. It would not be the end of the road for Greece, but potentially the precursor to a breakthrough on a longer-term deal.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>But others argue Greece would need considerable help recapitalising its banks following a default, given those banks own significant amounts of government bonds and government-guaranteed bonds and they would slump in value after a default.</p> \n<p>Greek banks also use their government bonds and government-guaranteed bonds as collateral to raise funds at the ECB but that would no longer be possible after a default, further raising the pressure on Greece’s financial system. The ELA support that has been propping up the system would probably end.</p> \n<p>All this raises the risk of Grexit. Without the help of European partners, recapitalising the banks would probably require issuing IOUs or in fact a new currency altogether – in other words Greece leaves the euro.</p> \n<p>Traders polled by Reuters on Monday <a href=\"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/one-three-chance-greece-leaves-euro-zone-traders-123231018--business.html#pMJTTui\">put the chances of Grexit at one in three</a>, higher than just a month ago.</p> \n<p>If it leaves, Greece would move to a drastically devalued currency. That could attract tourists and overseas manufacturers keen to take advantage of cheap deals on holidays and labour, respectively. But in the short-term, Grexit would entail capital controls, financial market chaos and high inflation.<br /></p> \n<h2>What happens to the rest of the eurozone if Greece leaves?</h2> \n<p>There are plenty of risks to the eurozone aside from the damaging symbolism for politicians such as the German leader, Angela Merkel, of presiding over the first departure from the single currency.</p> \n<p>Near-term worries focus on volatility in financial markets and damage to the euro currency. A disorderly exit by Greece would probably raise fears about the other eurozone countries that were worst hit by the financial crisis and the interest rates on their government bonds would rise.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, banks around Europe have reduced their exposure to Greece and the ECB has insisted <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/18/greek-euro-exit-imf-ecb-europe-debts\">financial buffers are sufficient to prevent contagion to other weak economies in the currency union</a>.</p> \n<p>In the longer term, there is the worry that Greece leaving may well prompt other countries to follow, threatening the entire eurozone project.</p> \n<p>Gary Jenkins, chief credit strategist at asset manager LNG Capital, says much would depend on whether Grexit can be turned into a “seminal moment” that brings the remaining eurozone countries closer together, such as through jointly issued bonds.<br /></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Much would depend upon the response of the eurozone and the ECB in the short term, economic growth (or the lack of) in the medium term and of course the economic performance of Greece relative to the other eurozone countries in the longer term...</p> \n <p>So we could soon find out if the eurozone/ECB really do have a plan B. One would hope so, after all, as a certain Mr Wilde might have said: to lose one country may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2><br /></h2>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/639d698cbbfc77399531e89c7f1713418ef85e08/0_0_3543_2126/3543.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2126,"width":3543,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Yannis Kolesidis/EPA","altText":"A man walks in the reception of the stock exchange in Athens.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Yannis Kolesidis/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434367457090/d0984731-d91f-4661-86c3-4e7e41788f7e-620x309.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":309,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Greece, EL on this chart, has the highest unemployment rate in the eurozone and the wider European Union.

Independent analysts, including the IMF’s <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr13156.pdf\" title=\"\">own internal evaluation office</a>, have identified a number of critical design faults: the massive debt haircut of 2012 should have been implemented in 2010, which would have allowed a smoother fiscal adjustment path and resulted in a shallower recession.</p> \n<p>Even after that, the “troika” of European commission, European central bank, and International Monetary Fund has consistently placed more importance on adherence to overly ambitious fiscal targets rather than structural reforms and state-building.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Successive Greek governments have only fitfully understood of the country's economic problems</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In addition, structural reforms that were implemented early on – such as the necessary but abrupt adjustment in labour market regulation and the minimum wage without consultation with social partners – were poorly sequenced and proved insufficient to boost exports given the sclerotic business environment.</p> \n<p>In short, there is plenty of blame to go around. There is no question however that the bulk of the blame lies with successive Greek governments that have only fitfully shown true understanding of the economy’s problems and a willingness to confront them. It is ultimately this lack of political ownership of reforms that separates Greece from other programme countries, and which is the main source of angst in European capitals.</p> \n<p>Many, including myself, held hopes that the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jan/25/greece-election-vote-austerity-leftwing-syriza-eu\" title=\"\">Syriza-led government elected last January</a> would change this dynamic given its lack of ties to the clientelist system. Unfortunately, its performance to date has shown them to be just as conservative, tribal, power-hungry and ideological as their predecessors.</p> \n<p>Not only do many of its appointments in key positions owe their jobs to party allegiance rather than competence, but the only common thread to their governing strategy thus far has been a blanket reversal of reforms, good or bad, undertaken by previous governments – seemingly for the sole reason of making a symbolic break with the past.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/15/europe-greece-greek-grexit\">Europe must save Greece to save itself | Timothy Garton Ash</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Moreover, the government has failed to articulate a concrete, progressive, forward-looking reform agenda, and move beyond its populist talking points to aggressively embrace the urgently needed structural reforms, many of which are outlined in the memorandum. These include market liberalisation, business environment simplification, an expanded and better targeted social welfare system, a truly meritocratic public administration, privatisation in sectors dominated by inefficient state monopolies, and pension reform.</p> \n<p>As a result of the government’s lack of concrete reform proposals and general intransigence, the creditors have reverted to requesting ambitious fiscal targets and further horizontal austerity measures (ie VAT hikes) that are easily monitored in order to justify further aid to their parliaments, while the structural reforms are pushed back again.</p> \n<p>So is all lost? Actually, beneath the hype in the news about austerity, default and Grexit, a genuinely exciting structural political opportunity has emerged: several opinion polls show that there is a silent but strong majority of Greek people who want two things: an agreement that ensures eurozone membership, and a cross-party government of national unity that can deliver.</p> \n<p>If the current Greek government – comprised of two parties who for five years railed against the bailout – would sign its own memorandum, this would potentially create closure and an opportunity for renewal. Under previous Greek governments, there had always been at least one large populist opposition party deluding an electorate under severe stress that there were painless alternatives to the bailout. This structural political problem has now been addressed, and the conditions are ripe for a government that finally owns its reform programme.</p> \n<p>The frustration and fatigue felt in many European capitals regarding Greece is understandable, but these aren’t good reasons to miss this unique opportunity for both Europe and Greece.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434390236043/A-statue-of-the-Greek-god-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A statue of the Greek goddess Athena in central Athens.

Creasy seems to have the best chance; she is is on 28, making her seven short. <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/06/list-mps-endorsements-labour-deputy-leadership-candidates-0\">According to the New Statesman’s list, </a>Eagle currently has 25 backers, Ali 24 and Bradshaw 21.</p> \n<p>Tonight we’ve got the first televised hustings for the Labour leadership. It starts at 7pm. I will be covering that on a separate live blog, which I will launch at around 6pm.</p> \n<p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n<p><em>9.30am:</em> Unemployment figures are released.</p> \n<p><em>10.50am: </em>Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, and William Dartmouth, the Ukip MEP, launch a pamphlet called “The Truth about Trade Beyond the EU.”</p> \n<p><em>12pm: </em>Nominations close for the Labour deputy leadership. <br /></p> \n<p><em>12pm: </em>George Osborne faces Hilary Benn at PMQs.</p> \n<p>Cameron will be in Milan, meeting his Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi, before going to Luxembourg to meet the prime minister, Xavier Bettel.</p> \n<p>As usual I will be covering the breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon.</p> \n<p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I’m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow</a></p>","postType":"blog"}],"paginationLinks":{"updates":"http://live-blogs.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/updates/politics/live/2015/jun/17/labour-deputy-leadership-nominations-close-at-noon-politics-live?date=2015-06-17T08:09:00Z"}},"links":{"uri":"http://live-blogs.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/live/2015/jun/17/labour-deputy-leadership-nominations-close-at-noon-politics-live","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49pkn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/live/2015/jun/17/labour-deputy-leadership-nominations-close-at-noon-politics-live","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2015/jun/17/labour-deputy-leadership-nominations-close-at-noon-politics-live"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/49329e25bd992f7abb167408b6a0cc453c78491e/0_0_5760_3455/5760.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3455,"width":5760,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Stella Creasy at a One Billion Rising for Justice event in Trafalgar Square.

The findings revealed that among 40 to 41-year-olds, the IVF success rate was 15.6%, a number that dropped to 6.6% in those aged 42 and 43.</p> \n<p>“There is a clinically relevant decline from 41 to 42 – but the prognosis is really futile from 44 and onwards,” Devesa said.</p> \n<p>Doctors familiar with the study said that many women may be unaware of the crash in fertility that occurs beyond the age of 35, while some could be fooled into unrealistic expectations by media stories of celebrities starting families in their 40s.</p> \n<p>The fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, has long publicised very similar success rates from UK clinics. According to their figures, a woman’s chances of having a baby through IVF stand at 32% under the age of 35 and fall to 1.9% once she is 45 or over.</p> \n<p>Stuart Lavery, a consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith hospital said that many women were likely to be shocked at the sharp decline in fertility among women in their early 40s. The drop in fertility is thought to be caused by genetic damage that builds up in older eggs. The latest figures, he said, could help promote more “realistic expectations” among older women who hoped to start a family. </p> \n<p>Adam Balen, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said: “Whilst you hear lots of good news stories about celebrities who may have given birth at an older age, nobody knows the number of celebrities who may not have been able to have babies, either because of infertility or possibly even having had fertility treatment that has been unsuccessful.”<br /></p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a1cd608a82bcd304364d68768b2ad162ecb408fe/267_161_2133_1280/2133.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1280,"width":2133,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alessandro Bianchi/REUTERS","altText":"A doctor at the Alma Res fertility clinic in Rome works prepares eggs and sperm for an attempt at artificial insemination, June 7.
