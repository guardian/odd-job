The manifesto proposed that, from April 2016, the 40p rate should only kick in when earnings reach &pound;42,700 and, from April 2017, when they reach &pound;43,300. Officials added the rate would rise further to &pound;45,020 in 2019.</p> \n<p>The change is estimated to cost the exchequer &pound;1.68bn by 2019-20. The tax break for the middle class will be defended on the basis that a failure in the past to raise the threshold has brought more people into the 40p rate. </p> \n<p>The changes to welfare, the biggest test of Osborne’s political judgement since his “omnishambles” budget in 2012, also leave in question the future design of universal credit, the government’s major integration of in- and and out-of-work benefits. The cuts will probably put hundreds of thousands of families into poverty under the definitions the government abolished only last week.<br /></p> \n<p>It is expected Osborne will urge more employers to improve the skills of their workforce and to pay the living wage as a way of filling the hole left by the cut in work tax credits and in housing benefit. But he is not expected to impose any requirement on companies to pay the living wage, but instead point to the plan to enshrine a tax-free minimum wage in law and to raise the personal tax allowance to &pound;12,500 by 2020.</p> \n<p>Some Tory pressure groups are still hoping Osborne will commit to measures to incentivise companies to pay the living wage, currently set at &pound;9.15 an hour in London and &pound;7.85 an hour in the rest of the UK, as opposed to the national minimum wage of &pound;6.50 an hour for over 21s.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/11/george-osborne-pressure-slow-welfare-cuts\">George Osborne under pressure to slow welfare cuts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Labour said the government was involved in a systematic attempt to discredit the welfare state constructed by Labour’s Gordon Brown. The party said that if tax credits were cut back to 2003-04 levels, a saving of &pound;5bn, then 3.7 million families in work will suffer an average income loss of &pound;1,400 a year. The reform would also mean that 300,000 families would fall into relative poverty.</p> \n<p>The shadow treasury minister, Shabana Mahmood, claimed the minimum wage, which is set to rise to &pound;6.70 an hour in October for workers aged 21 and over, would need to rise overnight by 25% should the government make the predicted changes to tax credits.</p> \n<p>“Without tax credits to help them through, those who are working and stuck on low pay simply cannot make ends meet,” she said.</p> \n<p>The Resolution Foundation has calculated that if income was to match the current value of the living wage, an average rise of 80% would be necessary – since the living wage takes in to account the payment of tax credits</p> \n<p>But Osborne will point to the dramatic events in the eurozone, and the crisis in Greece, to argue the government has no choice but to continue to put deficit reduction at the heart of the budget.<br /></p> \n<p> He will tell MPs: “Our long-term economic plan is working. But the greatest mistake this country could make would be to think all our problems are solved.</p> \n<p> “You only have to look at the crisis unfolding in Greece as I speak to realise that if a country is not in control of its borrowing, the borrowing takes control of the country.”</p> \n<p>He will argue that if welfare is not cut in this emergency budget, other departmental spending will have to be reduced even more in the autumn spending review.</p> \n<p>During the election, Osborne reduced his room for manoeuvre by ruling out increases in income tax, VAT and corporation tax, and has set a long-term commitment to lift the personal tax allowance to &pound;12,500 by the end of the parliament.</p> \n<p>Osborne, with his own chances of taking the leadership reins from David Cameron at stake, will try to lift the sights of the country beyond deficit reduction and impress voters that the Conservatives have a coherent positive agenda.</p> \n<p>He is expected to promise to be “bold in transforming education, bold in reforming welfare, bold in delivering infrastructure, bold in building the ‘northern powerhouse’, bold in backing the aspirations of working people … it is a budget that sets the way to secure Britain’s future”.</p> \n<p>Cameron has already tried to pave the way for the reforms promised to end the merry-go-round of tax credits and housing benefit saying he wants to shift to a low tax, high wage and low welfare economy</p> \n<p>The Treasury economic secretary, David Gauke, speaking in the Commons, prepared the ground for the welfare cuts by describing the current welfare state as “financially and morally unsustainable”. He claimed the cost of tax credits had risen from 2003 to 2010-11 by 180%.</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e0d15f94e4dc3c4ffee89d4d40f36ffc4ec7d4cc/0_243_5760_3457/5760.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3457,"width":5760,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christopher Thomond for the Guardian","altText":"Chancellor George Osborne","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-08T07:30:16Z","lastModified":"2015-07-08T07:30:19Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":763,"contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Wintour","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/4/1423058528318/Patrick-Wintour-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patrickwintour"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Budget 2015 (July)","George Osborne","Politics","UK news","Budget","Conservatives","Welfare","Society","Living wage","Minimum wage","Poverty"],"tags":[{"id":"uk-news/budget-2015-july","webTitle":"Budget 2015 (July)"},{"id":"politics/georgeosborne","webTitle":"George Osborne"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk/budget","webTitle":"Budget"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"politics/welfare","webTitle":"Welfare"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"society/living-wage","webTitle":"Living wage"},{"id":"society/minimum-wage","webTitle":"Minimum wage"},{"id":"society/poverty","webTitle":"Poverty"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Patrick Wintour","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/patrickwintour"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/07/george-osborne-slow-pace--12bn-welfare-budget-slash","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aezf","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jul/07/george-osborne-slow-pace--12bn-welfare-budget-slash","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/07/george-osborne-slow-pace--12bn-welfare-budget-slash"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e0d15f94e4dc3c4ffee89d4d40f36ffc4ec7d4cc/0_243_5760_3457/5760.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3457,"width":5760,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The chancellor is not thought to be imposing a requirement to pay living wage.

Of course, politicians never get a totally free hand; even a prime minister with a large majority is constrained by internal party politics, Whitehall inertia, the judiciary, and a host of other factors. But for George Osborne, the chancellor, today will probably be as close as he will ever get to that moment of maximum elbow room. This is his seventh budget, but his first without Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander vetoing some of his ideas. The Conservative majority is small, but Tory MPs are buoyed by their surprise election victory and Osborne will never have a better chance to get difficult measures through the Commons.

Of course, politicians never get a totally free hand; even a prime minister with a large majority is constrained by internal party politics, Whitehall inertia, the judiciary, and a host of other factors. But for George Osborne, the chancellor, today will probably be as close as he will ever get to that moment of maximum elbow room. This is his seventh budget, but his first without Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander vetoing some of his ideas. The Conservative majority is small, but Tory MPs are buoyed by their surprise election victory and Osborne will never have a better chance to get difficult measures through the Commons.

Speculation around possible cuts to working and child tax credits has been circulating the Audley and Queen’s Park children’s centre in Blackburn this week, and parents voiced unease about the prospect of losing an income stream they regard as vital.</p> \n<p>Days before the budget – when the chancellor, George Osborne, is expected to set out some of the ways the government will start to make &pound;12bn of cuts to welfare spending – reports that cuts to these benefits could be among the first to be announced have been widely shared here. Blackburn with Darwen council has the second highest number of families receiving child and working tax credits in the country – after Newham in east London – with 7,600 households, 13.3% of the area’s total, receiving one or both benefits.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/07/summer-budget-2015-what-to-expect-from-the-chancellor\">Summer budget 2015: what to expect from George Osborne</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Parents recoiled at the implicit suggestion that the current payments are excessively generous, and set out in detail how little money there is, even before cuts are made.</p> \n<p>Kulsum Patel, 32, who had brought her two-and-a-half-year-old daughter and four-month-old son to sing nursery rhymes at the pre-school play session, said she relied on working tax credits to top up her husband’s wages; he works as a part-time office assistant, earning the minimum wage, and his income is not enough to support the family. She has been out of work since losing her job as a receptionist for the council last November, after being diagnosed with diabetes.<br /></p> \n<p>“The child tax credit just covers their clothes, food and milk. They’re forever growing. None of the money gets saved. A cut would have a major impact for our family,” she said.</p> \n<p>The absence of clear information about the extent of possible cuts to these payments was making most of the 22 mothers at the afternoon session anxious. It has been <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33089711\">reported</a> that Osborne is considering making &pound;5bn of cuts to child tax credits, returning them to 2003-04 levels. The changes would cut entitlements for about 3.7 million low-income families by about &pound;1,400, according to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.</p> \n<p>Conservatives have said they would like to see the burden moved away from the state to large, profitable companies. The Resolution Foundation, a think tank that specialises in living standards, predicted that more than two-thirds of the families affected by the cuts to child tax credits under consideration would be in work, and that families with two children could lose up to &pound;1,690; their research also suggested that almost two-thirds of the cut would be borne by the poorest 30% of households.</p> \n<p>Child tax credits are a means-tested benefit paid to hard-up families with children, regardless of whether anyone in the family is in work. Working tax credits are paid to people who are in work but whose incomes are low; the amount payable for each benefit depends on the number of people in a household. The titles of the benefits are slightly confusing, since they have no direct connection with taxation. Working tax credits are also set to face cuts.</p> \n<p>Touching on this issue in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-on-opportunity\">speech on welfare</a> last week, David Cameron said he wanted to end the “merry-go-round” that saw “people working on the minimum wage having that money taxed by the government and then the government giving them that money back – and more – in welfare. Again, it’s dealing with the symptoms of the problem: topping up low pay rather than extending the drivers of opportunity – helping to create well-paid jobs in the first place.”<br /></p> \n<p>Kulsum Patel struggled to see how reducing the amount her family received would prompt her husband’s employer to pay him more; she didn’t think there was any prospect of them giving him a pay rise. “They put his hours down already. Maybe they are struggling with their overheads. We’ve had conversations about it, that he needs to go and ask for a raise, but I don’t think he’s confident that they will. The job opportunities in Blackburn aren’t great,” she said.</p> \n<p>Farzana Bathan, 39, said there was no prospect of her husband – a part-time chef in an Indian takeaway restaurant, on the minimum wage – progressing up the pay scale or getting more hours from his employer. Bathan, who was at the play session with her two daughters aged two and eight months, said she and her husband received working tax credit and child tax credit because his earnings were not sufficient to feed and house the family.</p> \n<p>Before her second child she worked as a care assistant for an Age UK day care centre, also a minimum wage job, which she hopes to return to when her children are a bit older. But she does not believe that either Age UK or the restaurant where her husband works have the capacity to increase wages to compensate for a reduction in tax credits. “He used to get 20 hours but it has gone down to 16 hours, and they say there is no more work,” she said.</p> \n<p>She was alarmed at the suggestion that the benefits might be cut. “There is nothing left at the end of the week, after the nappies, and the powdered milk. We don’t have holidays. There’s never any money to save,” she said.</p> \n<p>A mile away, in a side street off Blackburn’s central shopping area, a statue of William Gladstone, erected by public subscription in 1899, the year after he died, is inscribed: “Four times prime minister of Great Britain. ‘The most brilliant intellect that has been placed at the service of the state since parliamentary government began’ (Salisbury).”</p> \n<p>If the stone statue were able to peer down the streets nearby, Gladstone’s effigy would see a rapidly changing city centre: the Lyca mobile outlet (“Call the world for less”), the Godfather pizza and kebab house, all the cheap shops, charity outlets and betting shops that have thrived in town centres since the recession began – Poundland, Brighthouse, Pound Crazy, Ladbrokes, Cash Generator, Nobles Amusements, Cancer Research, Age Concern. </p> \n<p>Hartley’s cafe, behind Gladstone’s back, has struggled since the recession, and owner Christine Pickup, who opened the cafe 20 years ago, laughed at the idea that she might be under pressure to pay a living wage to staff. “I think employers pay out enough money already. We pay the minimum wage. I couldn’t afford to bump up the wages,” she said. “We’re keeping our head above water but business isn’t what it used to be. We would have to cut down staff if we were forced to raise wages. There would be fewer jobs, we’d put people out of work.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/05/budget-tax-credits-in-work-benefits-tories-business-low-pay-families\">Tories want businesses to pick up slack as budget targets in-work benefits</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kate Hollern, the Labour MP Blackburn, said: “It’s going to be impossible. We have got 14,000 children who come from working families who are dependent on that tax credit just to make ends meet. There’s going to be a devastating effect on those families, but also on the local economy, because these people spend that money – they don’t put it in an ISA and stash it away for a rainy day.”</p> \n<p>In the Mall, the covered shopping precinct in the city centre, parents calculated how a tax credit cut might impact their finances. Gianna Jones, 27, is studying to get a childcare qualification while also working 20 hours a week as a nursery assistant. Her husband, Steve, 35, is a joiner. The child tax credits they receive pay for childcare for their three-year-old daughter while Gianna is at college and at work.</p> \n<p>“It pays for a huge chunk of childcare. If it was cut, I might end up not working. It allows me to go to work, otherwise I would be better off staying at home,” she said.</p> \n<p>Abby Fielding, 37, a part-time school cleaner whose husband works full-time as a labourer, wondered whether reducing tax credits would act as a disincentive to staying in work for a lot of people. They receive child tax credits of about &pound;539 a month, for their three children, 11, nine and two, but their income is just over the threshold for working tax credits. Her husband has recently taken a &pound;7,000 pay cut after losing a higher-skilled position as a heating engineer.</p> \n<p>“A lot of the jobs you can get here are minimum wage jobs. If you cut working tax credits, it may not make sense for a lot of people to work,” she said. “I don’t expect to get stuff for free – we are trying to work, and trying to do the right thing.”</p> \n<p>Evangelina Read, 20, shopping with her 18-month-old son, gets child tax credit of around &pound;68 a week, she estimates, as well as income support; she is studying health and social care at college. She said she had heard – wrongly – that the payments could be replaced with food bank vouchers, and said that would be fine by her. “It all goes on food anyway, so what’s the difference?” she said.</p> \n<p>Rebecca Jackson, whose husband is a support worker in a hospital, works part-time in a bar to supplement the family’s income. Their children are 10, nine and four. The family gets child credit of about &pound;60 a week, although the sum has been reduced recently because of Jackson’s rising income. “It goes on food and clothes. We don’t go out much,” she said. “People will struggle.” </p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436269947491/63ebe74d-0c01-4334-97e9-e89e7d30f1ac-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christopher Thomond/Guardian","altText":"Christine Pickup","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Christopher Thomond/Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T14:00:03Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T23:00:46Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Amelia Gentleman","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733733291/AmeliaGentleman.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ameliagentleman"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Benefits","Budget 2015 (July)","Welfare","Tax and spending","Tax credits","Family finances","State benefits","Budget","UK news","Society","Politics","Money"],"tags":[{"id":"society/benefits","webTitle":"Benefits"},{"id":"uk-news/budget-2015-july","webTitle":"Budget 2015 (July)"},{"id":"politics/welfare","webTitle":"Welfare"},{"id":"politics/taxandspending","webTitle":"Tax and spending"},{"id":"money/taxcredits","webTitle":"Tax credits"},{"id":"money/family-finances","webTitle":"Family finances"},{"id":"money/statebenefits","webTitle":"State benefits"},{"id":"uk/budget","webTitle":"Budget"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Amelia Gentleman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ameliagentleman"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/07/benefit-cuts-blackburn-child-working-tax-credits","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ae9g","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jul/07/benefit-cuts-blackburn-child-working-tax-credits","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/07/benefit-cuts-blackburn-child-working-tax-credits"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436269947491/63ebe74d-0c01-4334-97e9-e89e7d30f1ac-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Christine Pickup, owner of Hartley’s cafe in Blackburn.

But the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/06/budget-2015-george-osborne-britain-productivity-puzzle\">remarkable absence of productivity growth in the seven years since 2007</a>, has left output per hour 15% below where it would have been if pre-crisis trends had continued, as this chart shows.</p> \n<p>Economists have warned that without improving productivity, the UK will struggle to raise living standards. A key worry is that as unemployment settles at a low level and firms face higher wage demands, without better productivity – more out of each hour worked – employers will have to pass that cost on in higher prices. The resulting inflation could prompt an interest rate hike sooner rather than later from the current record low of 0.5%.</p> \n<h2>4. Wages are only just starting to rise<br /></h2> \n<p>While GDP growth has picked up, economists note that what really matters for economic wellbeing is GDP per person and because of population growth that is still not back to its pre-crisis strength.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/4gdp_indexed-zip/giv-21277E7JC8EWACvGp\" data-alt=\"GDP per head is not back to pre-crisis levels\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/4gdp_indexed-zip/giv-21277E7JC8EWACvGp\">GDP per head is not back to pre-crisis levels</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The ONS says <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/30/economy-grows-faster-expected-first-quarter-revised-forecast-gdp\">GDP per head continued to grow in the first quarter</a> but at a slower pace, rising 0.2% compared with a 0.7% increase in the previous quarter. It remains 0.6% below the pre-downturn peak.</p> \n<p>Wages are now rising again in real terms after falling for years - because inflation was higher that what little pay growth there was during and after the downturn. But the return to growth is largely down to inflation being close to zero rather than pay rising. Pay growth was 2.7% in the three months to April – inflation in April was 0.1%. </p> \n<p>Other recent figures from the ONS showed that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/jun/29/british-households-500-pounds-worse-off-than-before-financial-crisis-2008\">British households are still &pound;500 a year worse off</a> than before the financial crisis in 2008.</p> \n<h2>5.

In his first, emergency budget for the coalition government in June 2010, borrowing was expected to be &pound;37bn in 2014-15.

Business groups regularly call for corporate welfare and other “pro-growth” measures on the grounds that they help create jobs. Firms protesting against onerous taxes and red tape will sometimes threaten to move, just as the giant bank HSBC is considering relocating to Hong Kong.</p> \n<p>The research was carried out by Kevin Farnsworth, a senior lecturer at York University, who has researched and published studies of corporate welfare for more than a decade and who is launching on Wednesday an online database of grants made to companies.</p> \n<p>To determine how much Britain pays for its businesses, he looked at the figures for the financial year 2012-13 – the last year for which there is a near-complete set of accounts. The elements of the &pound;93bn corporate handout break down as follows: </p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <strong>Subsidies and grants: &pound;14.5bn</strong> This includes cash to the train operators to run services, subsidies to defence firms and grants to businesses to induce them to invest. The &pound;14.5bn figure for 2012-13 is used by the Treasury in its own statistical analysis of government spending.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <strong>Corporate tax benefits: &pound;44bn</strong> Of the 93 major tax reliefs provided by the Treasury, 27 are aimed at business. The largest amount was spent allowing businesses to write off billions spent on plants, machinery and equipment among other items. </p> \n<p>In 2012-13, the public gave a &pound;20bn subsidy to private investment. The construction industry gained more than &pound;7bn in exemptions on new housing and land duty. </p> \n<p>A 2009 study by the rich nations’ thinktank, the OECD, found that the UK had more generous corporate tax benefits than the US, Germany or any of the seven other major economies it examined.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <strong>Hidden transport subsidies: &pound;15bn</strong> Unlike motorists and the petrol levies they are charged, airlines do not pay tax on fuel – support worth about &pound;8.5bn a year, according to MPs on parliament’s transport select committee. Train companies also enjoy lower duty on fuel.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <strong>Energy subsidies: &pound;3.8bn</strong> Most public handouts to energy firms are not widely acknowledged, according to a recent House of Commons environmental audit committee report. It said: “The variation in definitions of subsidy allows the government to resist acknowledging subsidy in many areas.” Yet the dismantling of Britain’s nuclear power stations cost the public &pound;2.3bn in 2012-13 alone.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <strong>Insurance, advice and advocacy services: &pound;406m</strong> Includes such vital services as the state’s insurance scheme for trading abroad – the export credit guarantee – of which the defence firm BAE Systems says: “Many of our customers require it.” It also includes government trade advisers and overseas business networks.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <strong>Government procurement from the private sector: &pound;15bn</strong> Capita, Atos, G4S and Serco alone received &pound;4bn worth of public-sector contracts in 2012-13. While procurement provides the public with services, it is not always about securing value for money for taxpayers, as the business secretary at the time, Vince Cable, acknowledged in 2012. He said: “There is a role for the government using procurement in a more strategic way.” </p> \n<p>Drawing on the financial accounts of the big outsourcing companies, Farnsworth calculated the direct above-cost element of procurement at &pound;15bn out of a total spend of &pound;238bn. The &pound;93bn sum is, he stresses, “a conservative estimate”. It leaves out invaluable support on which it is nonetheless hard to put a price tag – such as the trade delegations abroad led by Cameron, Osborne and other politicians or the use of foreign aid to help British business win contracts in poor countries. </p> \n<p>It also does not include the legacy costs of the bank bailouts for 2008-09 and other crisis measures, which are estimated to have cost &pound;35bn in 2012-13.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4f0f9b70378f4f5a21d1b6aceaa194d6b5b70a69/0_57_5241_3145/5241.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3145,"width":5241,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Barros & Barros/Getty Images","altText":"BUSINESSMEN shaking hands.

We need an affordable state.” The government had to cut the bloated welfare state because it was sucking up too much money.</p> \n<p>Yet in the financial year ending March 2013, the Guardian can reveal, Britons handed &pound;93bn in welfare to corporations. That is enough to wipe out at a stroke this year’s budget deficit – and it was given to companies in direct aid, subsidies and tax breaks.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jul/07/corporate-welfare-a-93bn-handshake\">Corporate welfare: a &pound;93bn handshake</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The term “corporate welfare” may sound unfamiliar to some. In the Westminster thesaurus, welfare appears alongside benefits and social security as a term for public spending targeted at individuals and households. But corporations rely on public funds, too. </p> \n<p>When Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic took &pound;28m from the Welsh government in 2011 to set up a call centre in Swansea, that was a form of welfare. The German, French and Dutch companies that now run our train services are subsidised by the British public to the tune of hundreds of millions. The &pound;45bn taken by firms in corporate tax benefits is a form of welfare. So is the ultra-low cost insurance scheme the government runs for exporters such as BAE Systems.</p> \n<p>None of these are labelled corporate welfare, but that’s precisely what they are: direct public spending aimed at protecting and supporting businesses. </p> \n<p>In many cases, the basic facts about this spending are almost impossible to find. Some of the information making up the calculations published by the Guardian – fundamental stuff such as which arm of the British state gave how much cash to which firm – is so hard to collate that even experts are forced to admit defeat.</p> \n<p>Discussions about corporate welfare take place at the twilight checkpoint between economics and democracy. Researchers and civil servants know a lot about the individuals who claim hundreds in, say, employment support allowance: every last cough, spit and missed appointment at the jobcentre. Yet of the big companies that rake off millions in direct grants, taxpayers often hear very little. The result is that the public do not know where billions of their own taxes are going.</p> \n<p>Yet were they to be widely known, the facts about corporate welfare would electrify our debates about public spending and the role of the state. On Wednesday, Osborne will set about chopping into our social security budget. Among the measures he is believed to be considering is taxing disability benefits. That will raise about &pound;900m, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. That is about the same sum as the state gives every year to managers who buy shares in, say, their dotcom startup and see them soar in value, without having to pay much tax on the gain, thanks to a scheme called Enterprise Management Incentives.</p> \n<p>Revealing how far taxpayers fund the private sector is not the same thing as saying the private sector should not receive any public subsidy at all. All rich countries do it, although there is evidence from the OECD thinktank and others that when it comes to corporate tax benefits or public-sector outsourcing, Britain is more indulgent to businesses than many other nations. But many might back public funding for green technology startups, say, or struggling social enterprises in deprived areas. The fundamental point, surely, is to allow public debate over where public funds go.</p> \n<p>Full disclosure of the size of the corporate welfare state might also have improved economic debate over the past half-decade. When Cameron and Osborne launched their austerity programme in 2010, they argued that the public sector was “crowding out” the private sector. To enable the economy to grow, government needed to retreat and allow businesses to fill the void. That powerful argument was disproved over the next few years, as Britain stuttered and stumbled through the weakest economic recovery in its modern history. But it would have been undermined from the start had ministers been confronted with &pound;93bn of proof that the relationship between public and private sector is far more complicated.</p> \n<p>This research on corporate welfare takes you to the heart of one of the biggest arguments in British capitalism. For decades, the UK has operated on the basis that it is in an international dogfight to attract investment. It was summed up by Michael Heseltine in his 2013 report on industrial policy: “Unless we make it worthwhile for footloose capital to come here, it won’t.”</p> \n<p>This orthodoxy has been swallowed by all the main political parties. It has led to the slashing of corporation tax rates, so that Britain has a lower corporation tax rate than the US, Japan or Germany. It has encouraged devolved administrations in Holyrood and Cardiff to disburse millions to big companies, without demanding much in return. The result has been fiscally disastrous. As this research shows, of the 44 companies that received more than &pound;1m in government grants between 2005 and 2011, 13 paid no corporation tax at all; a further 17 did not pay any corporation tax either the year before or the year that they received public money.</p> \n<p>Such a state of affairs reflects a severe imbalance of power between the public and private sectors. As Philip Baker QC, a European tax expert and Treasury adviser on the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/sep/29/what-is-google-tax-george-osborne\">Google tax</a>, remarked last month: “I don’t think in the last 20 years or so one can say that governments have driven corporation tax policy. It’s the large companies that have driven the direction of corporate tax policy.”</p> \n<p>The result is a stratum of businesses that is not beholden to the same social settlement as previous generations. Modern big business has got so used to tax breaks, handouts and easy ways of making cash (such as squeezing staff pay and conditions) that it no longer researches or innovates. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile, politicians and officials tout for investment, no matter how fly-by-night. But even the savviest operators get caught out. AstraZeneca was assisted by a local MP to get a &pound;5m government grant to develop its research and development centre at Alderley Park, Cheshire. Five months later, in 2013, it announced it was closing the plant and shedding 2,100 jobs. Absent from the public record is what it told its local MP. He was, of course, the chancellor, George Osborne.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/adaf315370114bfd1f5a161ee88417701e8077dc/0_415_2801_1681/2801.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1681,"width":2801,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter Byrne/PA","altText":"The chancellor, George Osborne","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter Byrne/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T20:05:17Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T23:11:22Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Aditya Chakrabortty","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/24/1411565194870/Aditya-Chakrabortty-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/adityachakrabortty"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Tax and spending","Tax avoidance","Business","Corporate governance","Politics","George Osborne","David Cameron","UK news","Tax","Money","Virgin Atlantic","Wales","Welfare","BAE Systems","OECD","Michael Heseltine","Amazon.com","AstraZeneca","Airline industry","E-commerce","Global economy","Economics","Internet","Pharmaceuticals industry","Technology"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/taxandspending","webTitle":"Tax and spending"},{"id":"business/taxavoidance","webTitle":"Tax avoidance"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/corporate-governance","webTitle":"Corporate governance"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"politics/georgeosborne","webTitle":"George Osborne"},{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"money/tax","webTitle":"Tax"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"},{"id":"business/virginatlantic","webTitle":"Virgin Atlantic"},{"id":"uk/wales","webTitle":"Wales"},{"id":"politics/welfare","webTitle":"Welfare"},{"id":"business/baesystems","webTitle":"BAE Systems"},{"id":"business/oecd","webTitle":"OECD"},{"id":"politics/michael-heseltine","webTitle":"Michael Heseltine"},{"id":"technology/amazon","webTitle":"Amazon.com"},{"id":"business/astrazeneca","webTitle":"AstraZeneca"},{"id":"business/theairlineindustry","webTitle":"Airline industry"},{"id":"technology/efinance","webTitle":"E-commerce"},{"id":"business/global-economy","webTitle":"Global economy"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet"},{"id":"business/pharmaceuticals-industry","webTitle":"Pharmaceuticals industry"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Aditya Chakrabortty","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/adityachakrabortty"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jul/07/direct-aid-subsidies-tax-breaks-the-hidden-welfare-budget-we-dont-debate","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aezk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jul/07/direct-aid-subsidies-tax-breaks-the-hidden-welfare-budget-we-dont-debate","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/07/direct-aid-subsidies-tax-breaks-the-hidden-welfare-budget-we-dont-debate"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/adaf315370114bfd1f5a161ee88417701e8077dc/0_415_2801_1681/2801.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1681,"width":2801,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"George Osborne will chop into the social security budget, with measures that will raise about £900m – the same sum as the state gives every year to managers who buy shares in their startup under the Enterprise Management Incentive.

He indicated more branches would close and jobs would go. “Barclays is not efficient,” he said.<br />He also added that Barclays’ sponsorship of the Premier League would end next year.</p> \n<p>Sandy Chen, analyst at Cenkos, said: “There’s a new sheriff in town,<br />and he’s got the board’s (and, we assume, the regulators’) backing to<br />make sweeping changes. We have long advocated an aggressive pruning of<br />the investment bank; the time for this, it appears, is now. Barclays shares rose 3% to 260p after the news.”</p> \n<p>Jenkins’ departure will be cushioned by a year’s salary and other benefits, which will run to at least &pound;2.5m before any bonuses are released to him from prior years as he is being paid until next July.<br /></p> \n<p>The timing of the announcement evokes memories of 2013 when the bank <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2013/mar/20/barclays-bonuses-budget-day\">announced it was paying its top bankers &pound;39.5m in bonuses</a> – including the since departed Rich Ricci – on the day of the budget. The chancellor George Osborne is due to deliver his first budget in a Conservative government on Wednesday. </p> \n<p>Jenkins had been attempting to restore the bank’s reputation in the wake of the Libor rate-rigging scandal. He was lambasted for explaining that bonuses had to be increased in 2013 when profits had fallen to avoid a “death spiral” of staff leaving.</p> \n<p>The change takes place from 17 July when McFarlane will leave the board of First Group. His promotion to the top job mirrors the role he took on at insurer Avivia during the 2012 shareholder spring when the insurer’s boss was also ousted.</p> \n<p>McFarlane said: “Whilst it is unfortunate that I have had little time to work with Antony, I respect and endorse the position of the board in deciding that a change in leadership is required at this time. I would add my personal thanks for everything that Antony has done for us. He can be proud of his heritage, especially his excellent work on culture and values that we will continue. I wish him well.</p> \n<p>“Arriving at Barclays with a fresh perspective, it is evident that we have a standout brand with first-class retail, commercial and investment banking businesses. Nevertheless, we are leaving value on the table and a new approach is required. As a group, if we aspire to bring shareholder returns forward, we need to be much more focused on what is attractive, what we are good at, and where we are good at it.”</p> \n<p>Jenkins’ departure will fuel speculation that Barclays is poised to further retrench from investment banking. Last year he said <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2014/may/08/barclays-to-cut-19000-jobs-scale-back-investment-bank-antony-jenkins\">19,000 jobs would go</a> in attempt to bolster returns in the business that once generated a third of the bank’s profits. <br /></p> \n<p>Jenkins said: “In the summer of 2012, I became group chief executive at a particularly difficult time for Barclays. It is easy to forget just how bad things were three years ago both for our industry and even more so for us. I am very proud of the significant progress we have made since then.”</p> \n<p>Sir Mike Rake, the most senior independent director at Barclays, said: “I reflected long and hard on the issue of group leadership and discussed this with each of the non-executive directors. Notwithstanding Antony’s significant achievements, it became clear to all of us that a new set of skills were required for the period ahead. This does not take away from our appreciation of Antony’s contribution at a critical time for the company.”<br /></p> \n<p>Jenkins was promoted from running the retail bank when Diamond was forced out three years ago just days after the bank was fined &pound;290m for rigging Libor. The new chief executive repeatedly said he wanted to make Barclays the “go to” bank. In an attempt to show he was trying to turn around the culture, he had also installed five huge blocks inside the cavernous entrance hall of the bank in Canary Wharf, each one emblazoned with his buzzwords of “respect, integrity, service, excellence and stewardship”. <br /></p> \n<p>A full-time successor will be sought externally and internally. Immediate speculation will focus on the finance director Tushar Morzaria and Jonathan Moulds, who was recently hired to implement the “ringfencing” rules that UK banks must comply with to separate their high street banks from their investment banking businesses.<br /></p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5d88fc435902f8270cf2d4580bc02df8e0f09c92/84_321_3353_2012/3353.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2012,"width":3353,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Stefan Wermuth/Reuters","altText":"Antony Jenkins is leaving his post as Barclays’ chief executive.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-08T06:13:50Z","lastModified":"2015-07-08T08:05:32Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Jill Treanor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jilltreanor"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Barclays","Banking","Business","UK news","World news","Banks and building societies","Consumer affairs","Money"],"tags":[{"id":"business/barclay","webTitle":"Barclays"},{"id":"business/banking","webTitle":"Banking"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"money/banks","webTitle":"Banks and building societies"},{"id":"money/consumer-affairs","webTitle":"Consumer affairs"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"}],"section":{"id":"business"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jill Treanor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jilltreanor"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"business"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/08/barclays-fires-chief-executive-antony-jenkins","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4af26","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/business/2015/jul/08/barclays-fires-chief-executive-antony-jenkins","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/barclays-fires-chief-executive-antony-jenkins"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5d88fc435902f8270cf2d4580bc02df8e0f09c92/84_321_3353_2012/3353.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2012,"width":3353,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Antony Jenkins is leaving his post as Barclays’ chief executive.

The potential downside is that the cash would need to be authorised by the Eurogroup unanimously.</p> \n<p>Thomas Piketty, author of the best-selling book Capital, said it was up to Merkel to remember the benefits Germany had received from debt relief and show leadership.</p> \n<p>In a letter to the Guardian, Piketty and other leading economists said: “Together we urge Chancellor Merkel and the Troika to consider a course correction, to avoid further disaster and enable Greece to remain in the eurozone. Right now, the Greek government is being asked to put a gun to its head and pull the trigger. Sadly, the bullet will not only kill off Greece’s future in Europe. The collateral damage will kill the eurozone as a beacon of hope, democracy and prosperity, and could lead to far-reaching economic consequences across the world.</p> \n<p>“In the 1950s Europe was founded on the forgiveness of past debts, notably -Germany’s, which generated a massive contribution to post-war economic growth and peace. Today we need to restructure and reduce Greek debt.”</p> \n<p></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e8a631ad28189258c22d56783c6f0be60339935a/0_453_3936_2362/3936.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2362,"width":3936,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"An EU flag waves above the ancient temple of Parthenon in Athens.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T23:27:21Z","lastModified":"2015-07-08T06:28:52Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":3053,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian Traynor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/iantraynor"},{"name":"Larry Elliott","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733742341/LarryElliott.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/larryelliott"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Greece","Europe","World news","Eurozone crisis","Banking","Business","Economics","Euro","Currencies","European Central Bank","European Union","European banks","Financial crisis","European monetary union","Financial sector","Alexis Tsipras","Angela Merkel"],"tags":[{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis"},{"id":"business/banking","webTitle":"Banking"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"business/euro","webTitle":"Euro"},{"id":"business/currencies","webTitle":"Currencies"},{"id":"business/european-central-bank","webTitle":"European Central Bank"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"business/europeanbanks","webTitle":"European banks"},{"id":"business/financial-crisis","webTitle":"Financial crisis"},{"id":"business/emu","webTitle":"European monetary union"},{"id":"business/financial-sector","webTitle":"Financial sector"},{"id":"world/alexis-tsipras","webTitle":"Alexis Tsipras"},{"id":"world/angela-merkel","webTitle":"Angela Merkel"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-457431090","source":"guardian.co.uk","durationInSeconds":249,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/07/150707GreeceMarkets_KP-24733211_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/07/150707GreeceMarkets_KP-24733211.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/7/1436282414789/KP_344811_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Greece","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Greece","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Greece"}}],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/07/greece-crisis-eurozone-tsipras-banking-collapse","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aejd","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/07/greece-crisis-eurozone-tsipras-banking-collapse","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/greece-crisis-eurozone-tsipras-banking-collapse"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e8a631ad28189258c22d56783c6f0be60339935a/0_453_3936_2362/3936.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2362,"width":3936,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An EU flag waves above the ancient temple of Parthenon in Athens.

The families of the deceased – both present for the first time at the hearing – have asked for privacy. </p> \n<p>They walked together into the court on Wednesday shortly after it started, escorted by British consular officials and sat a few metres from the defendants.</p> \n<p>The family of Witheridge said in a statement on Wednesday: “Hannah was a beautiful person, inside and out, she brought a room alive just being there. She was fun, honest and loved life. Her bright future was brutally ended, leaving those who loved her broken with no answers. We ask that the media treat Hannah with dignity in their reporting of the trial.”</p> \n<p>“Please allow the police and the court to do their jobs during the coming weeks and months. We of course want to see those responsible for the brutal murder of our precious girl brought to justice.”</p> \n<p>Miller’s family said: “The act which ended David’s life devastated our family and his friends. Just hours before he died, David was talking to us with his usual enthusiasm, describing the beauty of Koh Tao and the friendliness of the Thai people.”</p> \n<p>“Over the coming weeks we hope to gain a better understanding as to how such a wonderful young man lost his life in such idyllic surroundings in such a horrible way.”</p> \n<p>The Burmese men initially admitted to the murder of Miller, who suffered head injuries and drowned in shallow water, and the rape and murder of Witheridge, who died from severe head injuries. But they later retracted their confessions, saying they had been tortured and threatened with death by their interrogators.</p> \n<p>A team of pro-bono lawyers and human rights activists are working as the defence, wearing black gowns and sitting in the court. They accuse Thai police of improperly collecting evidence at the crime scene, intimidation and abuse of witnesses and suspects – which the police deny – and not sharing key forensic evidence with the defence, a move they say seriously impedes a fair trial.<br /></p> \n<p>The case has caused Thailand’s judiciary to be closely scrutinised. “This appears to be a situation where the accused had been tortured to confess to the crimes,” said lead defence lawyer Nakhon Chompuchat said in a statement before the trial started.</p> \n<p>A key issue for the defence is whether DNA samples, taken from sputum and semen, which the prosecution says links the Burmese migrant workers to the murder could be independently checked. The judge said on Wednesday the matter would be dealt with on Thursday when the police officer who holds the samples will be present in the court.</p> \n<p>Andy Hall, a migrants’ rights activist from Britain who is working for the defence, told the Guardian outside the court: “Recently in the last few weeks we’ve got some significant information from the UK side and it’s raises a lot of very important inconsistencies between the Thai evidence and the the evidence from the UK.” He did not give details on what evidence UK authorities had provided.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePpJPKqoTQ4\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ePpJPKqoTQ4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Andy Hall speaks about the case.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Metropolitan police detectives were sent to Thailand in 2014 to look over the case and report back to officials and the families.</p> \n<p>“For this case to rest, it’s very important to re-examine that DNA material and find out whose DNA profile it really is,” Hall said.</p> \n<p>A UK Foreign Office spokeswomen refused to comment on that issue but said consular officers provided support and assistance to the families of Witheridge, 23, from Norfolk, and Miller, 24, from Jersey.<br /></p> \n<p>In the court, a supermarket trolley held other pieces of evidence, including a guitar wrapped in plastic and said to be owned by the defendants and rolls of paper. Other witnesses to appear will be the doctor who determined the cause of death and a woman who first found the bodies.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d6741dbaff4cf21ed53e5f8e1f0de9eeea99d309/0_0_2640_1585/2640.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1585,"width":2640,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PA/PA","altText":"Two Burmese men charged with the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller went on trial on Wednesday.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PA/PA"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/37ffcd084f52f4bb6331564b9a88a6eeaec73fb1/0_84_3500_2101/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2101,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Myanmar migrant workers Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo arrive at the Koh Samui Provincial Court.

About 1,400 companies, or more than half of those listed – filed for a trading halt in an attempt to prevent further losses.<br /></p> \n<p>China’s securities regulator said there was “panic” in the stock market with irrational selling off increasing and “leading the stock market to a situation of intense liquidity”.</p> \n<p>The People’s Bank of China said it was assisting China’s Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC), the national margin trading service provider, to acquire liquidity in an effort to steady the stock market. </p> \n<p>It said it would do this through measures such as inter-bank lending, mortgage financing and floating financial bonds. It said it would keep a close watch on the market and continue to support the CSFC and guard against systematic and financial risks. </p> \n<p>A spokesperson for China Securities Finance Corporation also said it would purchase more shares of small- and medium-size listed companies. It is these companies that have suffered the biggest losses.</p> \n<p>Christopher Balding, a professor of economics at Peking University said that while it was not possible to know exactly why so many companies had suspended trading, a large number were doing so because they had used their own stock as collateral for loans and they want to “lock in the value for the collateral”.</p> \n<p>Ayako Sera, a senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank in Tokyo, said: “Today is all about China, with Greece in the background now that it’s been given a new deadline.” <br /></p> \n<p>“Shanghai’s early losses were like a cliff-dive, which had a huge impact on investor sentiment.” </p> \n<p>Previous measures taken over the weekend by the Chinese government in an attempt to stabilise the markets appeared to have been unsuccessful. Analysts said the falls looked set to continue. Balding said: “I don’t see it getting better. There is not going to be a turn around within the next week or two.” </p> \n<p>“It probably has a long way to go. Margin loans basically rose much faster and they are not falling nearly as fast, margin debt is not falling nearly as fast as the market is falling. What that is telling us is that there is a lot of stock that needs to be sold that hasn’t been sold yet.” </p> \n<p>China’s stock markets had previously been among the top-performing in the world, and had hit a seven-year peak in the middle of June. The Shanghai stock market had surged more than 150% in 12 months, but it has fallen 30% over the past three weeks – including a plunge of 12% last week. </p> \n<p>Unlike most other stock markets, where investors are mostly institutional investors, in China, 80% of investors are small retail investors. This is a concern for the Chinese government because it causes a “political risk”, according to Balding. The losses on the stock markets are going to cause a lot of people to lose money causing the government to “worry about people protesting on the streets”, he said.</p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/acf28d45e0f27d08538dccdc2d444f92efda26b2/0_37_3000_1801/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1801,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"STR/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Investors sit in front of a screen showing market movements in a stock firm in Hangzhou, eastern China’s Zhejiang province on July 8, 2015.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-08T06:22:46Z","lastModified":"2015-07-08T06:22:48Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":292,"contributors":[{"name":"Jennifer Duggan","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jennifer-duggan"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Chinese economy","China","Asia Pacific","World news","Business"],"tags":[{"id":"business/chinese-economy","webTitle":"Chinese economy"},{"id":"world/china","webTitle":"China"},{"id":"world/asia-pacific","webTitle":"Asia Pacific"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"}],"section":{"id":"business"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jennifer Duggan","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jennifer-duggan"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"business"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/08/china-stock-markets-continue-nosedive-as-regulator-warns-of-panic","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4afxx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/business/2015/jul/08/china-stock-markets-continue-nosedive-as-regulator-warns-of-panic","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/08/china-stock-markets-continue-nosedive-as-regulator-warns-of-panic"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/acf28d45e0f27d08538dccdc2d444f92efda26b2/0_37_3000_1801/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1801,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Unlike most other stock markets, where investors are mostly institutional investors, in China, 80% of investors are small retail investors.

Seat reservations are unlikely to be honoured during the strike.</p> \n<p>An overtime ban on Saturday could also lead to late changes or cancellations, the company warned.</p> \n<p>The union accused FGW of “playing for time” during talks and “going through the motions rather than addressing the issues.</p> \n<p>The RMT said it was campaigning to avoid job losses, keep a safety-competent guard on every train, maintain buffet car facilities and ensure that the maintenance of new rolling stock remained in-house.</p> \n<p>General secretary Mick Cash said: “RMT has made every effort to secure a series of very basic assurances from FGW over jobs, services and safety as a result of the introduction of the new Hitachi fleet and they have shown no intention of addressing those issues in the talks today.</p> \n<p>“RMT is angry and disappointed that the company have ignored the massive vote for action by their staff and have instead opted to plough ahead with a series of actions that will decimate jobs, services and safety. </p> \n<p>“It is frankly ludicrous that East Coast, who are introducing the same trains, have given us the assurances we are seeking, but FGW have ignored us and are crashing on with the ripping out of buffet cars and the threat to safety-critical station and train staff, purely to maximise the profits from new trains bought for them by the British taxpayer.”</p> \n<p>A FGW spokesman said: “All we want is to make sure our services give the best possible deal for our passengers. These brand new trains have been designed to deliver more seats, and faster, more frequent journeys for passengers, but we can’t deliver those if they are operated in the same way as the 40-year-old trains that run today.</p> \n<p>“We have already made assurances about job security and commitments to increase the number of staff on board Super Express Trains.</p> \n<p>“We have made a number of additional commitments that we believe meet the concerns of the RMT, while still allowing us to deliver the improvements our customers want to see.</p> \n<p>“While it is disappointing that the RMT were not able to take this proposal away today, we believe a negotiated solution to these proposals is possible, and are keen to continue discussions as soon as possible.”</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7745a1fd7557e46b96a69eb47645baf3d52cbe38/0_0_3600_2160/3600.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2160,"width":3600,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"First Great Western train","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-08T04:00:01Z","lastModified":"2015-07-08T04:00:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":92,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Rail transport","FirstGroup","Travel & leisure","Business","Transport","UK news","RMT"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/rail-transport","webTitle":"Rail transport"},{"id":"business/firstgroup","webTitle":"FirstGroup"},{"id":"business/travelleisure","webTitle":"Travel & leisure"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"uk/transport","webTitle":"Transport"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk-news/rmt","webTitle":"RMT"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/08/rail-strike-leads-to-warning-over-significant-disruption-to-busy-routes","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aeqc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jul/08/rail-strike-leads-to-warning-over-significant-disruption-to-busy-routes","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/08/rail-strike-leads-to-warning-over-significant-disruption-to-busy-routes"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7745a1fd7557e46b96a69eb47645baf3d52cbe38/0_0_3600_2160/3600.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2160,"width":3600,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"FGW says it has made additional commitments that match RMT’s concerns.
