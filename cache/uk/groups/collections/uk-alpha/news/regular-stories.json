Campbell and Charles Kennedy were close friends - their families would meet up on holiday in Scotland - and Campbell was one of the first to hear the news about Kennedy’s death yesterday. One thing they had in common was a struggle with alcohol and, <a href=\"http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog/2015/06/02/charles-kennedy-a-lovely-man-a-talented-politician-a-great-friend-with-a-shared-enemy/\">in a long, insightful and generous blog,</a> Campbell says that at some point he might write more about this if Kennedy’s family don’t mind. Instead, in the blog, Campbell focuses on the qualities that made Kennedy special.</p> \n<p>Here’s an extract.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>For some years, my family has spent either Easter, or Christmas and New Year, sometimes both, in Charles’ former constituency and he, his wife Sarah before they split up, and their lovely son Donald would always come over, sometimes to stay. I always think one’s own children’s judgement of friends is a good indicator, and my kids, used to politicians in their lives and often seeing straight through them, saw right into Charles for what he was – clever, funny, giving, flawed. My Mum could listen to him all day. ‘I think you’re marvellous on Question Time,’ she would purr about some programme she had remembered from months earlier. She always took his side when I was trying to persuade him he would be a ‘natural on twitter,’ and he felt it was all a bit silly and new fangled. I helped him set up his twitter account. Fair to say he never quite moved that far from his initial assessment.</p> \n <p>Mother and children enjoyed his robustness in braving whatever storms were lashing outside ‘to nip out for a wee bit of fresh air,’ otherwise known as a cigarette. Coming as they do from a maniacally exercising family, they appreciated his studied indifference to all forms of heavy exercise. ‘I’ve never actually been to the top of Ben Nevis,’ he said proudly and to great hilarity of the mountain on our doorstep, which had been on his doorstep all his life. They liked the way he advised on where the next long walk should be, ‘but I’ll probably stay and read a book.’</p> \n <p>I think they also appreciated that Charles, such a passionate and eloquent opponent of the war in Iraq, was nonetheless unwilling to join those who when it came to their view of Tony Blair or of me, could never see beyond that issue. Charles knew that it was possible to disagree with people without constantly feeling the need to condemn them as lacking in integrity or values; though he was not averse to making a few cracks about historic events down the road in Glencoe.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Campbell also reveals that Kennedy sent him this text after the general election.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>fancy starting a new Scottish left-leaning party?

The Liberal Democrats wouldn’t have existed without Charles Kennedy.</p> \n<p>It was his oratory, his persuasive way of speaking, that meant he was able to bring people who weren’t sure about that merger [the SDP and the Liberals] and make sure it actually happened.</p> \n<p>His like will not be seen again. We can all learn from him to take people seriously, not just as electoral units.<br /></p> \n<h2>Paddy Ashdown</h2> \n<p>He is a loss to the Liberal Democrats when we can ill afford to lose a man of that calibre and stature. His judgment on the Iraq war was outstandingly good, opposing the entire political establishment and getting it right, and he got the reward for that at the election that followed when he achieved the greatest number of Liberal Democrat MPs than any before him.</p> \n<p>He had his demons – we all have our demons – but when he was on form, on song, Charles was the best of all of us. One’s heart just goes out to his family.</p> \n<p>It has been a very difficult time for him. He lost his seat; at the beginning of the election campaign he lost his father.</p> \n<h2>Norman Lamb</h2> \n<p>This is an untimely death and a really tragic loss of a lovely and immensely talented man – one of the most talented politicians of his age.</p> \n<p>He had a special talent for communication and connecting with people in a very passionate but decent way. He was a committed internationalist who believed in bringing people together.</p> \n<p>It is a great loss for my party but also for the country.

Here’s a round-up of some of them – first, from his own Liberal Democrat colleagues:</p> \n<h2>Tim Farron</h2> \n<p>I think it had been difficult for him – he was somebody who was a towering figure even from an early age. The Liberal Democrats wouldn’t have existed without Charles Kennedy.</p> \n<p>It was his oratory, his persuasive way of speaking, that meant he was able to bring people who weren’t sure about that merger [the SDP and the Liberals] and make sure it actually happened.</p> \n<p>His like will not be seen again. We can all learn from him to take people seriously, not just as electoral units.<br /></p> \n<h2>Paddy Ashdown</h2> \n<p>He is a loss to the Liberal Democrats when we can ill afford to lose a man of that calibre and stature. His judgment on the Iraq war was outstandingly good, opposing the entire political establishment and getting it right, and he got the reward for that at the election that followed when he achieved the greatest number of Liberal Democrat MPs than any before him.</p> \n<p>He had his demons – we all have our demons – but when he was on form, on song, Charles was the best of all of us. One’s heart just goes out to his family.</p> \n<p>It has been a very difficult time for him. He lost his seat; at the beginning of the election campaign he lost his father.</p> \n<h2>Norman Lamb</h2> \n<p>This is an untimely death and a really tragic loss of a lovely and immensely talented man – one of the most talented politicians of his age.</p> \n<p>He had a special talent for communication and connecting with people in a very passionate but decent way. He was a committed internationalist who believed in bringing people together.</p> \n<p>It is a great loss for my party but also for the country. My heart goes out to all of his family and friends.</p> \n<p>Thanks to my colleague <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong>, who has been collating these.</p>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-556d4cd2e4b04a873a5a944f","title":"Tributes from across the political spectrum","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-02T06:49:55Z","body":"<h2>Jeremy Hunt, Conservatives</h2> \n<p>When things like this happen, it puts everything else into perspective. He was only 55, that is tragically young. He was a giant of British politics.</p> \n<p>I suppose the thing that strikes me is that we are in an era where people are quite cynical and suspicious of politicians; they tend to think we are out of touch. He really [had the] common touch.</p> \n<p>He will be missed on all sides of the House of Commons. I was alway impressed with his personal bravery: being leader of Lib Dems in a rowdy House of Commons is pretty difficult. He was pretty much on his own in opposition to the Iraq war, and was a man of great principle, whether or not you agreed with him.</p> \n<h2>Harriet Harman, Labour</h2> \n<p>Everybody will be shocked and deeply saddened to hear Charles Kennedy has died. He was someone who fought for social justice and brought courage, wit and humour to everything he did.</p> \n<p>He had many friends in the Labour party as he did across the political spectrum and away from Westminster.</p> \n<p>Thoughts will now be with his family.</p> \n<h2>John Swinney, SNP</h2> \n<p>Terribly sad news about Charles Kennedy.

In a political age not overburdened with gaiety and good sense, he brought us wit, charm, judgment, principle and decency.”</p> \n<p>Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, said: “Sad beyond words to hear the news about Charlie Kennedy. A lovely man and one of the most talented politicians of his time. Gone too soon.”</p> \n<p>Kennedy, who first entered parliament as MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye in 1983 for the SDP/Liberal Democrat Alliance at 23, was nicknamed “Chat Show Charlie” in light of his easy manner on television that once saw him chair an edition of Have I Got News for You. But Kennedy, who won the Observer Mace for University Debating in 1982 in the year he graduated from Glasgow university, was a deeply serious politician who placed the fight for social justice and the battle to keep the UK in the EU at the heart of his politics.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"ashdown\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n &lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Charles Kennedy.

But he felt deeply uncomfortable with Ashdown’s closeness to New Labour in the mid-1990s and loosened the ties when he succeeded Ashdown as Lib Dem leader in 1999. He eventually abandoned Ashdown’s joint consultative committee, which saw Lib Dem MPs sit round the cabinet table with Labour ministers after Blair aborted plans to form a coalition with Ashdown in the face of objections from John Prescott.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Nick Clegg tweets a tribute to Charles Kennedy\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n &lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Charles Kennedy was one of the most gifted politicians of a generation, he always spoke with great humour, humility and courage.&lt;/p&gt;— Nick Clegg (@nick_clegg) \n &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nick_clegg/status/605608120463847424&quot;&gt;June 2, 2015&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Kennedy went to on to become the most senior opponent at Westminster of the Iraq war as he forged a position to the left of New Labour. In his speech in the Iraq debate in March 2003, in which MPs approved military action, Kennedy said: “Before launching an almighty assault upon Iraq, is it not better to pursue the course of disarmament on the ground in the presence of weapons inspectors? No matter how sophisticated modern technology, even compared with at the time of the last Gulf war, is it not more precise to have weapons dismantled in the presence of inspectors rather than so-called precision bombing trying to take them out?”</p> \n<p>Prescott said in his tribute that Kennedy had been vindicated on Iraq. The former deputy prime minister tweeted: “So sad to hear of Charles Kennedy’s passing. He proved to be right on Iraq. History will be as kind to him as he was to others. A great loss.”</p> \n<p>His success included the Lib Dems achieving their best result of the modern era when they won 62 seats in the 2005 general election. But Kennedy’s leadership was dogged by ill-health and he stood down in 2006 after admitting he had experienced alcohol problems. Kennedy was briefly succeeded by Sir Menzies Campbell before Clegg assumed the leadership in 2007.</p> \n<p>Clegg followed a different path, dubbed the “Orange Book” approach, as he moved the Lib Dems to the centre ground with ambitions of becoming a party of government. Clegg fulfilled this ambition when he formed a coalition with the Tories in 2010 – to the deep shock of Kennedy, whose political hero, Roy Jenkins, had hoped to realign the centre-left by forging links between the Lib Dems and Labour.</p> \n<p>Kennedy voted against Clegg’s decision to form a coalition with the Tories in 2010. In an Observer article explaining his decision, Kennedy wrote: “With uncharacteristic understatement, Paddy Ashdown described last week’s events as ‘a rather unexpected moment’. Certainly, they drive a strategic coach and horses through the long-nurtured ‘realignment of the centre-left’ to which leaders in the Liberal tradition, this one included, have all subscribed since the Jo Grimond era. It is hardly surprising that, for some of us at least, our political compass currently feels confused. And that really encapsulates the reasons why I felt personally unable to vote for this outcome when it was presented to Liberal Democrat parliamentarians.”</p> \n<p>Kennedy had one son with Sarah Gurling. They were divorced in 2010.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d85b73e7b3ef07d2edbaab15d5920300359403bc/0_288_5157_3099/5157.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3099,"width":5157,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Martin Rickett/PA","altText":"Charles Kennedy in September 2005, preparing his speech to the Liberal Democrat conference in Blackpool.

But now Lib Dems are set to elect him their next leader. Simon Hattenstone wonders what lies beyond the common touch","byline":"Simon Hattenstone","body":"<p>Abracadabra! A discreetly retouched Charles Kennedy. Man with the common touch, and with just a touch of common. You only need to look at Kennedy's face, though - shocking pink and flaccid as an omelette - to know that he's not really changed. </p>\n<p>The idea that he didn't take his politics seriously was best illustrated by a shocking front-page Sun story revealing how he had won &pound;2,000 after placing a &pound;50 bet that the Lib Dems would only win two seats in Europe in 1994. Soon after, Kennedy completed his term as president and a couple of years ago was made responsible for rural affairs - a post with little visibility and less prestige. </p>\n<p>Which is where Kennedy remains. But next week the voting forms go out to the 90,000 Lib Dem members to find the successor to Paddy Ashdown , and Kennedy is almost certain to win. More than half the 46 Lib Dem MPs have announced that they will back him, and the party's favourite thinker Menzies Campbell has dropped out to ease Kennedy's way. </p>\n<p>We are sitting on the terrace of the National Liberal Club, soaked by the sun. London's traffic is a friendly background buzz, and the lagers are once again within supping distance. Kennedy says he is enjoying the hustings and launches into the first of many anecdotes. The other day the leadership candidates were asked what they had changed their mind about most over the past 10 years. 'It was one of those questions you're not going to win on and you could lose badly if you don't answer carefully, so my answer was 'Well 10 years ago I had my 30th birthday party, so by definition this year you can guess that the big 4-0 is approaching, and one thing I've fundamentally changed my mind about is that 10 years ago I thought 40 was ancient and now I realise I was completely wrong.' Eheheheh!' </p>\n<p>Good answer, I say. 'Enough to get you out of a potentially tricky situation,' Kennedy adds, still laughing. But I can't help thinking the questioner has been short-changed that such a glib response is insulting. What would the true answer be? He sets off on another extended anecdote and then another... </p>\n<p>I remind him I'm still waiting for the real answer. 'It wasn't deliberate,' he says apologetically, 'I was just gossiping.' Eventually he tells me he wishes he hadn't supported the way the Child Support Agency had been set up, and he should have taken urban environmental concerns a little more seriously, but coming from the West Highlands of Scotland you take clean air for granted. Good consensual issues. He won't make enemies over those confessions. </p>\n<p>It's a fascinating time for the Lib Dems. As Labour swamps the centre ground of British politics, the Liberal Democrats rail against social injustice: the stripping of benefits for asylum seekers, single parents, the disabled the joke that is public transport, Blair's dubious patronage of celebrity. And Kennedy says that there is more dissent on the way: 'Over the next two years, as people's minds focus on the next Westminster election, they're going to be talking less about collaboration and more about competition.' </p>\n<p>He says there's a good deal that Labour should be praised for (notably the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly) before advancing to his pet hate. 'Politics is becoming so soundbitten and airbrushed. Wit as a parliamentary weapon is not being used nearly enough nowadays.' </p>\n<p>Kennedy is regularly called a bon viveur, a charmer and a wit. As he knows, it's not always a compliment. 'If people want to be negative about you, I suppose they're going to say it's all a bit fluffy, that you lead a slightly charmed existence.' </p>\n<p>The critics have also named him Inaction Man in contrast to Ashdown. How harmful has this been? 'Let me reach for a cigarette first of all in defiant response to that.' He claims not to be bothered, but it hurts enough for him to tell me he represents the country's biggest geographical constituency and that he's always had to battle hard to hold his seat. </p>\n<p>'If it was a serious reputation I don't think half the MPs in this party would be supporting me. I doubt they'd say Inaction Man is the guy to deliver me a second term, you know.' </p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, Action Man and Inaction Man are supposed to have fallen out. Did Ashdown sideline him with rural brief? 'It's a job I asked to do after the last election,' Kennedy insists. He says he was offered a more glamorous post in foreign affairs, but he felt the real work was to be done in rural areas where the Liberals won the bulk of their seats at the last election. He says Ashdown has been brilliant, absolutely brilliant, at a time when the military approach was essential to keep the party alive, but he hopes he will be more collegiate. </p>\n<p>Didn't Ashdown criticise him for all the appearances on quiz shows when he could have been working? 'It's not true. He said he thinks it's very important that people like me show the Lib Dems are not just a one-man band.' That they are a two-man band? 'No. No. That we've got other recognisable faces that are not just appearing on the Newsnights and Question Times of this world, important though they are. But appearing in other guises. If it's a good news day on Newsnight you'll get a million people on an average weekend over the two editions of Have I Got News For You you get nine million.' </p>\n<p>What turned him towards politics? 'First, there was just a burning interest and passion.' There is little sense of fire in the belly, though. His father was a crofter and draughtsman and Kennedy says that throughout childhood he had a sense of remoteness, apartness. But it seems as much a hankering for decent TV reception as a desperate sense of political isolation. 'There was no colour TV, I knew what Blue Peter was but didn't know what Magpie was because we didn't get ITV.' </p>\n<p>I ask again what politicised him, and he talks about the school debating society. There is a story I've always presumed was apocryphal that Kennedy moved away from the Labour Party because it was against competitive debating. 'Yes. Yes that's right,' he says with a nostalgic grin. 'At Glasgow University they didn't participate in the student debates 'cos it was considered bourgeois, middle class.' </p>\n<p>What does he consider his strengths as a politician? 'I think you've got to like people. There are MPs who are either painfully shy or who don't like public speaking or don't socialise very well, and you just think this must be the worst job in the world for them.' </p>\n<p>He says he believes few people are turning out for elections because politics is failing to connect with people. 'I think that's because there are not enough people in politics who are actually normal members of the human race. If that is the charge against me, I'm happy to plead guilty.' </p>\n<p>He's right. It is his strength. But, as leader of the Lib Dems, it may well prove to be his weakness. In being so normal, the nice guy who likes a chat and a beer and who suffers his fair share of surplus chins, is also utterly unremarkable. His reason for challenging for the leadership is predictably uninspiring. 'Politics is about time and chance and you've just got to take the opportunity when it comes to you.' </p>\n<p>There is something endearing about Charles Kennedy when he's not trying to be the clever, evasive politician. I ask him what his greatest regret is, and without hesitation he mentions the bet in the Euro-elections. He replays it in slow-motion, squirming over the details. I say I was shocked when I read about it, that it reminded me of stories of goalkeepers who had allegedly bet against their own team.</p>\n<p>'No. I wasn't betting against the party. It was in line with what I'd publicly predicted. Looking back it's funny now, but it was embarrassing at the time.

He has already made clear his conclusions are of an interim nature and there is every likelihood he will ask for more time. If so, it is imperative Britain supports him. This is not an argument for prevarication. It is logical. </p>\n<p>We all accept the world would be safer without Saddam's baleful dictatorship. But I see no contradiction between abhor rence of his leadership and the profound anxiety many in this country feel about the way in which the Americans - with Tony Blair's support - propose to launch an invasion. </p>\n<p>The case has not yet been made for military action. The evidence has not been clearly assembled. Public opinion in this country is profoundly opposed to unilateral action by US and British forces without a UN mandate and without clear evidence of the need for war. This is a moral as well as political dilemma, and there may well be circumstances in which British troops should not go to war; in which case we should be prepared to part company with the US. </p>\n<p>A quarter of the British Army is on its way to the region. There, our soldiers will cease to be an independent force. The command relationship between the American and British contingents has not been publicly spelt out; but if a decision is taken in Washington to attack Iraq, whether or not our Prime Minister agrees, it is inconceivable British soldiers could stand back and leave the Americans to go it alone. </p>\n<p>In the House of Commons I have asked the prime minister whether he would rule out unilateral military action without clear evidence and a UN mandate twice in the past three weeks. He has declined to respond, preferring to talk about the circumstances under which the British should actively engage at the American behest - neither a sufficient nor satisfactory answer. As a country we have to be clear about our intent as well as our interests. </p>\n<p>The Government has failed to address either intent or interest. Ours is an alarmingly isolated position. Last week has seen Britain dispiritingly detached from our continental partners - notably Germany and France - making it even harder for the Prime Minister to claim to be 'at the heart of Europe' if he is not only isolated from discussions but seen as part of the problem. </p>\n<p>I welcome the argument moving from ill-defined rhetoric about 'regime change' to the aim of removing any weapons of mass destruction from Saddam's grip. </p>\n<p>Yet the logic and justification underpinning the Government's response to how you do that is far from clear. </p>\n<p>Last September British security services published a dossier to coincide with the recall of Parliament. It said: 'Despite the conduct of the Iraqi authorities towards them, both Unscom and the IAEA Action Team have valuable records of achievement in discovering and exposing Iraq's biological weapons programme and destroying very large quantities of chemical weapons stocks and missiles as well as the infrastructure for Iraq's nuclear weapons programme.' </p>\n<p>This balanced assessment may not sit easily alongside belligerent Bush rhetoric about the inspection process, but it is valid nonetheless. It makes more sense at this juncture to pursue a proven and effective inspection programme as the best means of Iraqi containment than to hurtle into war - indeed, that is why the Liberal Democrats remain emphatically the pro-UN party, rather than an all-out anti-war party. </p>\n<p>Last week I wrote to the Prime Minister again, requesting a further parliamentary debate to properly consider the myriad issues involved. We need to understand the command structure envisaged for any military campaign. We need to know, if there is such a campaign, who will police the peace. The UN? This American administration - witness Afghanistan - has displayed noticeably less enthusiasm for dealing with the aftermath of conflict than for starting one. And what of the 90,000 British expatriates in neighbouring Middle East and Gulf states who could be in the front line of any terrorist backlash? These are legitimate questions the Government must answer. </p>\n<p>The situation is rapidly developing into a test of confidence, in the Government and in Parliament. There is genuine public perception that we are being bulldozed into a war not of our choosing and not - on the basis of the evidence so far - vital to national interests. </p>\n<p>If British troops are committed to action, then the nation will, of course, support them. Their courage and skill is not in doubt. But they and their families deserve a much clearer statement of aims than they have had so far from their political masters; we owe them that. </p>\n<p>Meantime, Britain must stick to the UN route, use all available influence to press for the recommencement of the Middle East peace process, and ensure the House of Commons can record a definitive view, through a vote, on committing our forces to action. </p>\n<p>It would be a tragedy if the remarkable international coalition against terrorism, successfully marshalled in the aftermath of 11 September, were to fragment over a unilateral US strike against Baghdad. </p>\n<p>Military action may become necessary, but we are not there yet. There is a dreadful sound of an inexorable drumbeat and of moral dilemmas unvisited since Suez. The Prime Minister should listen to the British people. He and President Bush should take on board the very real sense of alarm.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2003-01-26T03:43:00Z","lastModified":"2015-06-02T07:18:29Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Charles Kennedy","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/charleskennedy"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Iraq","Foreign policy","Politics","World news","Liberal Democrats","UK news","Middle East and North Africa","Liberal Democrat conference","Liberal Democrat conference 2003"],"tags":[{"id":"world/iraq","webTitle":"Iraq"},{"id":"politics/foreignpolicy","webTitle":"Foreign policy"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"politics/liberaldemocrats","webTitle":"Liberal Democrats"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"politics/libdemconference","webTitle":"Liberal Democrat conference"},{"id":"politics/libdems2003","webTitle":"Liberal Democrat conference 2003"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Charles Kennedy","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/charleskennedy"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2003/jan/26/libdems2002.iraq","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/x2f88","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2003/jan/26/libdems2002.iraq","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/jan/26/libdems2002.iraq"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":0,"kicker":{"title":"'We're being bulldozed into war'"},"byline":{"title":"Charles Kennedy"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[]},{"title":"Opinion / A truly authentic politician who rose above the crowd","rawTitle":"A truly authentic politician who rose above the crowd","item":{"type":"comment","id":"commentisfree/2015/jun/02/charles-kennedy-lib-dems-truly-authentic-politician","title":"Charles Kennedy, a truly authentic politician who rose above the crowd","trailText":"Whatever his inner demons, the former Lib Dem leader was one of the few politicians of the modern era to whom ordinary Britons could relate","standFirst":"<p>Whatever his inner demons, the former Lib Dem leader was one of the few politicians of the modern era to whom ordinary Britons could relate</p>","byline":"Martin Kettle","body":"<p>Authenticity is the most elusive but the most precious of all qualities in modern democratic politics. Very few politicians are blessed with it. Lots of politicians pretend to possess it. The lack of it causes many careers to stumble and not even get off the ground. But Charles Kennedy had it naturally and he had it in spades. He was one of the very few politicians of the modern era to whom ordinary non-political people instinctively related. People liked him and were right to do so. It gave him a special status in public life right to the enormously sad end.</p> \n<p>At his best, Kennedy had the ability to rise above the crowd and speak for his times in easily expressed and easily understood language. His ability to cut through the evasions and cliches of modern politics was a quality so many others struggle to emulate, often without success. He also had a great and natural sense of humour, unusual in a very private man such as he. It made him one of the few politicians who could master every form of television interview or appearance without looking awkward.</p> \n<p>Two such memories stand out and show him at his best. The first was his apparently effortless ability to put into words some of the most complicated issues of modern UK identity politics, when he described himself as comfortable with himself as a Highlander, a Scot, a Briton and as a European. It worked because it was true. He was the same man in Fort William and in Brussels. He didn’t need to put on an act to be consistent. Whatever Charles’s inner demons, he had a facility of mind and speech that others could only dream of.</p> \n<p>The other was his decision, as leader of the Liberal Democrats, to oppose the war in Iraq. This was self-evidently the right decision on principle. But it was a big call for the Liberal Democrats. It took the party out of its comfort zone. Kennedy wasn’t a natural street politician in the way he was a natural studio politician or a parliamentarian, and he swithered about the decision. I like to think the Guardian editorials urging him to put himself at the head of the anti-war campaign helped to push him over the line. But he did it, and in 2005 he was rewarded with the best election result the Liberal Democrats had ever seen – and possibly will ever see. When he was tested he did the right thing. It was the mark of a leader.</p> \n<p>He will be remembered as a Liberal Democrat, but he was always a social democrat too. His early political career as a member of the SDP was a consistent thread through the rest of his career. Charles was a Highlander and a Scot and all the rest of it, but he was also an anti-Tory. His political comfort zone as a Liberal Democrat was on the left of the spectrum, not the right. This never made him a great flirter with Labour, not least because as a Scot he was a lifetime witness to Scottish Labour’s authoritarian and now ultimately self-destructive ways. But it always meant he was unhappy with the way events propelled Nick Clegg’s party into coalition with the Conservatives.</p> \n<p>Charles started young and somehow seemed to stay young, even when he got older. He has been a figure in parliamentary politics since the 1980s, when he won the Highland seat, centred on Fort William, where he grew up. He was leader of his party at 39, young even by today’s standards. Likewise, his young, untimely death at 55. But he packed a full political career into those years and he will never be thought of as a might-have-been.</p> \n<p>His private life was darker, and his problems with drink lay at the core of his failure to retain political power. His <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2010/aug/10/charles-kennedy-and-wife-sarah-separate\">marriage broke up</a> and his behaviour became unpredictable. He was always bitter about his overthrow. It meant among other things that he was unable to play the role for which he would otherwise have been ideal, as a leader of the anti-independence campaign in the 2014 Scottish referendum. That not even he was able to retain his seat in the May election said something about Scottish politics, something about the collapse of the Lib Dems and something about Charles’s diminished political allure. But there won’t be a single person in politics feeling anything other than sadness and loss today – and there are few political passings of which that can truthfully be said.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/ecc211b186fb8e7ef26549ec302a5a37791ac5a3/0_551_1388_833/1388.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":833,"width":1388,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Joe Partridge/REX Shutterstock/Joe Partridge/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Charles Kennedy","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Joe Partridge/REX Shutterstock/Joe Partridge/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-02T06:55:48Z","lastModified":"2015-06-02T07:24:52Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Martin Kettle","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733744076/MartinKettle.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/martinkettle"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Charles Kennedy","Liberal Democrats","Politics","UK news","Scottish politics","Scotland"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/charleskennedy","webTitle":"Charles Kennedy"},{"id":"politics/liberaldemocrats","webTitle":"Liberal Democrats"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/scotland","webTitle":"Scottish politics"},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Martin Kettle","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/martinkettle"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/charles-kennedy-lib-dems-truly-authentic-politician","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49daz","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/charles-kennedy-lib-dems-truly-authentic-politician","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/charles-kennedy-lib-dems-truly-authentic-politician"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/ecc211b186fb8e7ef26549ec302a5a37791ac5a3/0_551_1388_833/1388.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":833,"width":1388,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Charles Kennedy had the courage to oppose the Iraq war and was rewarded with the best election result the Liberal Democrats had ever seen.

Then, rescuers reported an additional five people rescued, though no details were given on those rescues, which brought the total number people who reached safety to 18. Many of the initial survivors swam ashore.</p> \n <p> The broadcaster said <strong>five people were confirmed dead</strong>.</p> \n <p> The overturned ship had drifted about 3km (almost 2 miles) downstream before coming to rest close to the river shore, where choppy waters made the rescue difficult. The location is about 180 kilometers (110 miles) west of the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan.</p> \n <p> The fact that the capsized ship drifted downstream was a good sign for rescuers because it meant there was enough air inside to give it buoyancy, and could mean there are enough air pockets for survivors to breathe, said Chi-Mo Park, a professor of naval architecture and ocean engineering at South Korea’s Ulsan University.</p> \n <p> “It all depends how much space there is inside the vessel,” Park said.</p> \n <p> The official Xinhua News Agency quoted the captain and chief engineer as saying the <strong>ship sank quickly after being caught in a cyclone</strong>. The Communist Party-run People’s Daily said the ship sank within two minutes. CCTV said the two were under police custody.</p> \n <p> CCTV said the four-level ship had been carrying 406 Chinese passengers, five travel agency employees and 47 crew members. The broadcaster said most of the passengers were 50 to 80 years of age.</p> \n <p> Many of the ships passengers started out in Shanghai, taking a bus to Nanjing for the departure to Chongqing. Relatives of passengers gathered in Shanghai at a travel agency that had booked many of the trips, and they later headed to a government office to try to get more information about the accident.</p> \n <p>The ship sank in the Damazhou waterway section, where the river is 15m deep, and drifted about 3km (almost 2 miles). <br /></p> \n <p> Several rescue ships were searching the waters, and divers had been deployed. The broadcaster said rescue personnel were trying to determine whether they could right the sunken ship.</p> \n <p><strong> More than 50 boats and 3,000 people were involved in search efforts.</strong></p> \n <p> The Eastern Star measured 251 feet long (76.5 meters) and 36 feet wide (11 meters) and was capable of carrying a maximum of 534 people, CCTV reported. It is owned by the Chongqing Eastern Shipping Corp., which focuses on tourism routes in the popular Three Gorges river canyon region. </p> \n <p>CCTV reported that 6 inches (150mm) of rain had fallen in the region over the past 24 hours. Local media reported winds reached 80 mph (130 kph) during the accident.</p> \n <p> Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is reported to be traveling to the accident site. Xinhua reported that President Xi Jinping had ordered a work team of the State Council, the country’s Cabinet, to rush to the site to guide the rescue work.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c72c93b6a14f6b68862e9d7c73b512bc1d9b0d41\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c72c93b6a14f6b68862e9d7c73b512bc1d9b0d41/0_0_3081_1850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rescuers save a survivor from the overturned passenger ship in the Jianli section of the Yangtze River.

The convention is not part of the EU, although many Eurosceptics regard the EU and the 47-strong council of Europe human rights watchdog, which oversees the ECHR, with equal suspicion.</p> \n<p>The delicate challenge faced by the prime minister on his EU renegotiations was highlighted when Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, said Cameron’s referendum was designed to “dock” the UK permanently in the EU. In an interview with <a href=\"http://www.sueddeutsche.de/\">S&uuml;ddeutsche Zeitung</a>, Juncker said: “Brexit is also a question that does not arise, it is not what the British are seeking. Cameron wants to dock his country permanently to Europe.”</p> \n<p>The remarks by Juncker will fuel fears among Eurosceptics that the prime minister is determined to keep Britain in the EU regardless of the outcome of his negotiations with his fellow leaders. </p> \n<p>Cameron sought to show that he will act in an even-handed way when he invited two of the strongest Eurosceptics on the frontbench to sit on a new cabinet committee that will oversee the EU negotiations. Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, and Sajid Javid, the business secretary, will be two of eight cabinet ministers on the committee that will also be attended by the Europe minister David Lidington.</p> \n<p>The committee will examine the legal advice to ministers that one of the prime minister’s key demands – imposing a four-year ban on EU migrants claiming in-work benefits – will need to be underpinned by treaty change. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, told the prime minister last week that treaty change would not be impossible.</p> \n<p>But Norbert R&ouml;ttgen, the chairman of the Bundestag’s foreign affairs committee, who is a Merkel ally, said it was unrealistic to envisage revising the Lisbon treaty in time for UK referendum. </p> \n<p>The prime minister is adamant that he will succeed in his EU negotiations. Downing Street would then press ahead with scrapping the Human Rights Act after the EU referendum following a consultation that will be launched by Michael Gove, the new justice secretary, by this autumn.</p> \n<p>In the first stage, Gove would deliver two goals outlined in the Conservative general election manifesto: scrapping the act and ensuring that the UK supreme court would have the ultimate say over human rights in the UK. <br /></p> \n<p>Downing Street clarified No 10’s thinking amid reports that Cameron had ruled out a UK withdrawal from the European convention on human rights.

We need an environment where people feel much more liberated to do desk standing.”</p> \n<p>Reviewing existing scientific evidence, which dictated the thresholds they set, the authors found that compared with those who sit the least, those who sit most are <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22890825\">more than twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease</a> and have a <a href=\"http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2091327\">13% and 17% increased risk of cancer incidence and mortality respectively</a>. </p> \n<p>Office workers spend 65% to 75% of their working hours sitting, half of which is in prolonged periods of sustained sitting, according to the study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/01/four-hours-standing-time-office-worker\">'I start to feel it in my knees' – working for hours while standing proves a tall order</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>British people sit for 8.9 hours each day on average and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23666019\">one study suggested</a> that, for those sitting more than seven hours a day, there is a 5% increased risk of premature death with each additional hour off their feet.<br /></p> \n<p>Bradley said some tasks, such as writing a paper or numerical analysis, were better done sitting but others such as meetings or going through your inbox were actually more productive when standing. </p> \n<p>To that end the study champions sit-stand adjustable desks, which only 1% of office workers in the UK have access to, compared with 90% in Scandinavia, according to research.<br /></p> \n<p>They typically cost hundreds of pounds each but the study says benefits are accrued through improved productivity, less absenteeism and reduced healthcare costs.</p> \n<p>However, <a href=\"http://news.cbi.org.uk/\">the CBI </a>responded cautiously to the study. “Companies will generally take a commonsense approach, and offices can be redesigned to encourage different ways of working, but ultimately firms will seek to balance the practicalities of time spent away from desks with the needs of the business,” a spokesman said. </p> \n<p>Professor Maureen Baker, chair of the Royal College of GPs, representing members of a profession who were <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g1558\">urged to stand up during consultations in an article in the BMJ last year</a>, said GPs tended to move about anyway but that the study “provides food for thought”. <br /></p> \n<p> She added: “In many cases – particularly for smaller organisations – the adjustments necessary to allow employees to stand for a significant proportion of the day might be unrealistic. It is, however, important that any employer recognises the responsibility they have to maintain their employees’ good health.”</p> \n<p>Bradley said staff should not feel shy about standing up at their desk, whatever the reaction of their employer or colleagues.</p> \n<p>“We are all sheep but as soon as the black sheep has his finger on the pulse and as soon as the shepherd or employer accepts that, they soon become a white sheep again,” he said. </p> \n<p>The study stresses that standing still for prolonged periods of time also carries health risks and warns that people who start standing more “could expect musculoskeletal sensations and some fatigue as part of the positive adaptive process”.<br /></p> \n<p>Dr Ann Hoskins, of Public Health England, welcomed the study but said “more research needs to be carried out before daily targets for work place activity are recommended”. </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433178678230/2f72b7f4-7f13-4e29-aaf1-b19f44c04469-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Office worker","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-01T22:30:00Z","lastModified":"2015-06-01T23:01:12Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":208,"contributors":[{"name":"Haroon Siddique","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/haroonsiddique"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Health & wellbeing","Health","Life and style","Society","Work-life balance","Work & careers"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"money/work-life-balance","webTitle":"Work-life balance"},{"id":"money/work-and-careers","webTitle":"Work & careers"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Haroon Siddique","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/haroonsiddique"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/01/office-workers-on-feet-standing-fours-hours-day-study-health","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ctn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/01/office-workers-on-feet-standing-fours-hours-day-study-health","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/01/office-workers-on-feet-standing-fours-hours-day-study-health"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433178678230/2f72b7f4-7f13-4e29-aaf1-b19f44c04469-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An office worker eats at her desk.

It’s outrageous that taxpayers are being taken for a ride by companies charging up to &pound;3,500 a shift for a doctor”, said Hunt. </p> \n<p>“The NHS is bigger than all of these companies, so we’ll use our bargaining power to drive down rates and beat them at their own game.” </p> \n<p>Hunt’s move was widely welcomed as a way of tackling the NHS’s growing financial problems and helping it deliver &pound;22bn of efficiency savings by 2020. Hospital bosses have become increasingly frustrated by what they see as agencies exploiting the NHS’s staffing problems. </p> \n<p>Some trusts have as many as 25% fewer nurses than the number they believe they need to deliver safe, high-quality care. </p> \n<p>However, some experts raised doubts about how Hunt’s initiative would work, given the health service’s chronic lack of many types of staff, including nurses, GPs, A&amp;E doctors and radiologists. </p> \n<p>Candace Imison, director of healthcare systems at the Nuffield Trust health thinktank, said: “There’s no doubt that the rising agency bill is an issue for hospitals up and down the country. But a cap on individual hospital trusts’ agency staff spending could put them between a rock and a hard place if they cannot meet minimum safe staffing levels without these workers.”</p> \n<p>Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: “Patient safety must always come first, so any plans for a cap on spending must ensure that it does not prevent trusts from providing safe staffing levels when there are no alternatives.” Reducing nurse training places was a “reckless and short-sighted” attempt to save money, he added. </p> \n<p>Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association, said the NHS’s greater reliance on agency staff “is a sign of stress on the system and the result of poor workforce planning by government”. </p> \n<p>Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said mistakes by the Conservatives had led to the expanded use of agency staff. <br /></p> \n<p>“Jeremy Hunt is trying to pull the wool over people’s eyes by acting as if the &pound;3.3bn agency bill is a problem he has suddenly discovered,” he said. <br /></p> \n<p>“The decision to cut 6,000 nursing posts in the early years of the last parliament, alongside big reductions in nurse training places, has left the NHS in the grip of private staffing agencies.” </p> \n<p>NHS Employers said that hospitals would continue to need to recruit permanent staff from abroad to fill vacancies. </p> \n<p> </p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a1d8770a754b4150f9d4e89c6fa2b31d9ed83ea8/0_0_3367_2021/3367.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2021,"width":3367,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter Byrne/PA","altText":"Embargoed to 0001 Thursday November 13\nFile photo 03/10/14 of a ward at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital as the NHS will have to use new technology to slash costs.
