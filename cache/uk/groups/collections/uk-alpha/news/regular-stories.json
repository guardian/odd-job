The Swiss saw off competition from his only challenger Prince Ali when the Jordanian withdrew after losing the first round of voting.</p> \n<p>Blatter’s departure will not be immediate, however, after he expressed an intention to stay on until an extraordinary meeting is organised between December this year and March 2016, at which point his successor can be elected.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d69b60e36574df05fb60efa2af09420af0165748/138_0_3134_1880/3134.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1880,"width":3134,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters","altText":"Sepp Blatter resigned as Fifa president on Tuesday in the face of a US-led corruption investigation that has plunged world football’s governing body into the worst crisis in its history.

But there is much work to be done","standFirst":"<p>Blatter’s resignation as Fifa president means world football is suddenly in a better place. But there is much work to be done</p>","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>Just when it seemed he had survived to serve another four-year term, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/live/2015/jun/02/fifa-calls-press-conference-amid-latest-corruption-claims-live\" title=\"\">he went</a>. The laws of politics trumped the laws of physics after all. Only a few days ago, it seemed the irresistible force of the FBI’s corruption probe into world football’s governing body had hit an immovable object in the shape of Sepp Blatter’s resistance to quitting as Fifa’s president. But four days’ reflection and doubtless some bitter argument behind closed doors have allowed wiser counsels and the force of reality to prevail. Mr Blatter was movable after all. And today he quit. He should have done it days, weeks, months, even years before now. But he has done the right thing by bowing to the inevitable.</p> \n<p>Now, though, he should go – really go. Long-serving and proud leaders who are forced from power often try to delay the final moment. Margaret Thatcher tried it in British politics, clinging on in the face of unavoidable defeat. Now Mr Blatter is trying to shape and control the future and the succession. He wants to delay a special congress at which his successor will be elected until December, perhaps until March next year, almost a year away. This is delusional and wrong, as ill-judged as the claim by <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/25/newsid_2542000/2542623.stm\" title=\"\">Nicolae Ceaușescu</a>, in his penultimate speech as Romanian dictator in 1989, that there would be no reform of his country until “apple trees grew pears”. Until&nbsp;Mr Blatter goes there can be no real progress on the root and branch reform of the whole governing superstructure of world football that is so urgently required to begin the process of rebuilding trust and confidence. He must hand over to an interim president, and go now.</p> \n<p>The immediate <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/02/why-has-sepp-blatter-resigned-as-fifa-president\" title=\"\">cause of his decision to resign</a> – only four days after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/29/sepp-blatter-reelected-fifa-president-fifth-term\" title=\"\">he was re-elected</a> on less than the required two thirds of the vote to serve a fifth term as Fifa&nbsp;president that would have seen him serve an unprecedented 21 years in the job – was not clear. But all day, rumours swirled of a link with a $10m bribe connected to the award of the South Africa World Cup, apparently with the knowledge of the Fifa secretary general J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Valcke and paid to the discredited former Fifa delegate Jack Warner. A letter emerged, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martynziegler/status/605660641374912512/photo/1\" title=\"\">most persuasive link</a> yet between the top echelon of Fifa and corrupt behaviour, and it appears to have spelt the&nbsp;end for Mr Blatter, despite confirmation that the Fifa president was not under investigation by the Swiss&nbsp;attorney general.</p> \n<p>The lessons of this protracted debacle will not all be immediately learned. But what is absolutely clear is that Fifa lacked any effective system of internal challenge. Repeated attempts for more than a decade to expel the guilty and clean up the organisation foundered on the power of an unembarrassable leadership to override all external advice, even when it arose from investigations commissioned by Fifa itself. That power rested partly on Mr Blatter’s support among football’s developing nations of Africa, Asia and South America. It is salutary that it was broken not by challenges from investigative reporters, nor by the repeated but ineffectual challenges of Uefa, but by the fact that the reach of the FBI extends to all dealings in US dollars wherever they happen, and most critically the support that was – eventually – forthcoming from the Swiss authorities. Bourgeois propriety finally triumphed over Swiss secrecy. It should not have taken so long.</p> \n<p>So Fifa 2.0 must have genuinely strong and effective internal safeguards built in. Even more radically, the business of the World Cup could be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/30/sepp-blatter-accuses-us-and-british-media-campaign-topple\" title=\"\">divorced from the charitable affair</a> of&nbsp;disbursing money to new footballing nations. What will require greater sensitivity is dealing with the perceptions that the Fifa president encouraged in order to safeguard his position. His claim that he was being <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/30/sepp-blatter-accuses-us-and-british-media-campaign-topple\" title=\"\">ambushed by a western conspiracy</a> will have resonated not only among Fifa clients who may now fear exposure, but also with ordinary delegates and football fans. Great&nbsp;care must be taken that this miserable, damaging affair does not stoke wider geopolitical tensions between the developed and developing world. The Qatari football association may well be feeling anxious tonight. So,&nbsp;more dangerously, will Russia where Putin has already characterised the challenge to Mr Blatter as the West v the Rest. But for now, as the FA chairman Greg Dyke put it, let’s celebrate. Football is the winner.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a72cf32f252ea6a5cb48956c889d0e8a4737b80a/0_59_2948_1767/2948.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1767,"width":2948,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom Jenkins for the Guardian","altText":"Sepp Blatter","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-02T18:56:12Z","lastModified":"2015-06-03T07:57:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Editorial","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/editorial"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Fifa","Football politics","Football","Sepp Blatter","World news","Switzerland","Europe","FBI","US news","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/fifa","webTitle":"Fifa"},{"id":"football/footballpolitics","webTitle":"Football politics"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"football/sepp-blatter","webTitle":"Sepp Blatter"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/switzerland","webTitle":"Switzerland"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"us-news/fbi","webTitle":"FBI"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Editorial","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/editorial"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/guardian-view-on-sepp-blatter-resignation-fifa","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49e5h","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/guardian-view-on-sepp-blatter-resignation-fifa","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/guardian-view-on-sepp-blatter-resignation-fifa"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-456989984","source":"Reuters","durationInSeconds":167,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/02/150602blatterfull_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/02/150602blatterfull.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/2/1433267303264/KP_258196_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for seppblatter","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for seppblatter","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for seppblatter"}}},"importance":0,"kicker":{"title":"The Guardian view"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[]}]},{"title":"Analysis / Addicted to power, but Blatter has accepted the inevitable","rawTitle":"Addicted to power, but Blatter has accepted the inevitable","item":{"type":"article","id":"football/2015/jun/02/sepp-blatter-lets-go-of-fifa-fbi-noose-tightens","title":"Sepp Blatter finally lets go of Fifa as FBI noose tightens","trailText":"After 17 years as virtual head of state, addicted to the power from ruling football’s top body, he accepted the inevitable and resigned – but he’s not going quite yet","standFirst":"<p>After 17 years as virtual head of state, addicted to the power from ruling football’s top body, he accepted the inevitable and resigned – but he’s not going quite yet</p>","byline":"Owen Gibson, chief sports correspondent","body":"<p><br />On Friday, Sepp Blatter stood before the 209 members of the “Fifa family” that have become his fiefdom and giddily beamed: “Let’s go Fifa!

Blatter has long been addicted to the power and prestige afforded him by his job and terrified of life beyond it.</p> \n<p>US investigators have been cooperating with Swiss prosecutors for months and Blatter is sure to have been in their sights. He must have felt the noose tightening.</p> \n<p>Existing in a bubble of private jets, five-star hotels and the endless, meaningless babble of Fifa – handshakes for peace, Nobel Foundation initiatives, Football for Hope and all – he clung on to power at all costs through a jaw-dropping succession of scandals revealed by dogged investigative reporters.</p> \n<p>At times he appeared divorced from the reality of his organisation as the rest of the world sees it and the dark heart of corruption among its most senior figures, so vividly outlined last week in a Brooklyn address by the US attorney general, Loretta Lynch.</p> \n<p>When he is not living the life of a head of state, Blatter has been salting away a salary never disclosed but which almost certainly totals more than $10m (&pound;6.5m) a year.</p> \n<p>To see the reasons for a dramatic U-turn in keeping with Blatter’s flair for the grand gesture, it is perhaps necessary to understand his desire to retain at least a modicum of control over the organisation he sees as his own.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456989984__\n</div> \n<p>He will want to go at a time of his choosing, giving himself a final six to nine months in which to dispatch enemies, settle scores and attempt to pass the organisation on to a chosen successor. Whether the FBI will afford him that privilege remains to be seen.</p> \n<p>Having joined in 1975 when it had just 12 employees, he created the model of kickbacks, patronage and pork barrel politics over a period in which Fifa’s revenues have soared – and turned a blind eye to the staggering greed among those afforded a piece of it.</p> \n<p>Blatter was ultimately undone by the things that had sustained him. In trying to pull the rug out from under Mohamed bin Hammam, his one-time ally who challenged him for the presidency in 2011, Blatter set in motion a chain of events involving Chuck Blazer and Jack Warner that ended in last Wednesday’s dawn raid on the Baur au Lac and that damning US indictment.</p> \n<p>The Uefa president, Michel Platini, another of Blatter’s former allies and heir apparent, will be one of those now considering his options.

The closest he came in his resignation speech to citing a reason was to say his re-election was “not supported by everybody”; a characteristically thick-skinned understatement, given 73 votes against him and the intense hostility towards him from many European football countries, including England’s Football Association.<br /></p> \n<p>Blatter will have been told by senior Fifa insiders, including Domenico Scala, the Swiss businessman effectively in charge of reform, that the US indictments have damaged Fifa’s credibility beyond any of the many previous scandals. Whether there is a more direct reason for Blatter stepping down, such as the spectre of the investigations focusing on him more personally, remains to be seen.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/02/sepp-blatter-fifa-president-resigns\">Sepp Blatter to resign as Fifa president after 17 years in role</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>What will happen to the presidency of Fifa?</strong></p> \n<p>For the first time since 1998, football’s world governing body can look for a president beyond Blatter, who has led Fifa to dramatic sporting, territorial and financial expansion, and unprecedented corruption scandals.<br /></p> \n<p>The promise at the news conference was that this will lead to fundamental reform, but the election will be open to any candidate putting themselves forward, and the outcome is necessarily uncertain. As Blatter’s bitterly contested re-election showed, Fifa is a deeply divided organisation, in which Europe’s rich and powerful football nations can often be viewed as arrogant and entitled by the football associations of many poorer countries. Winning an election on a more unified mandate and being able to impose real reform are Herculean tasks, made more difficult by the scandals and bitterness of the last week.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Where does this leave the planned World Cups of 2018 and 2022 in Russia and Qatar?</strong></p> \n<p>Greg Dyke, the English FA chairman, said immediately that Blatter’s resignation means the votes for the hosts of these two World Cups will be looked at more closely now and Qatar will be feeling uncomfortable. The stance of both countries has always been that they did not do or pay anything illicit to any of the then-Fifa executive committee members who voted, several of whom have now been proven guilty or stand accused of corruption.<br /></p> \n<p>On the same day as seven Fifa officials were arrested in Zurich last week, the Swiss attorney general announced a new investigation into the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar. Data and documents stored in computers at Fifa were seized, as well as “relevant bank documents at various financial institutes in Switzerland”.<br /></p> \n<p>All 10 executive committee members who voted on the 2018 and 2022 World Cups who were in Zurich last week are to be questioned, the attorney general said, “as persons providing information”, not as suspects.<br /></p> \n<p>The attorney general’s statement was explicit that “irregularities” and “unjust enrichment” are suspected in the allocation of the tournaments to Russia and Qatar, and suspicions that money was laundered through Swiss bank accounts.<br /></p> \n<p>Fifa sought to spin this extraordinary announcement last week as evidence of its own reforms proceeding, because in November it filed some criminal charges following its own internal investigation by the former US prosecutor Michael Garcia. The Swiss attorney general stated: “Therefore, the Swiss proceeding is aimed at persons unknown, with Fifa as the injured party.”<br /></p> \n<p>However the irregularities highlighted from the Garcia report by the Fifa ethics committee “adjudicatory chamber” chairman, the German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, were relatively minor, and Eckert found they did not damage the integrity of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding processes. The Swiss investigation, although it followed Fifa’s criminal complaint, appears more far-reaching, although given the questioning of all executive committee members, seems to be in its early stages.<br /></p> \n<p>Russia and Qatar will have huge legal claims against Fifa if the tournaments are removed from them and the votes re-run, without solid evidence that their bids, not Fifa’s own executives, were corrupt. That prospect remains a long way off, and the expensive preparations to host the tournaments in both countries are proceeding.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Are there likely to be more resignations?</strong></p> \n<p>With the Swiss investigation ongoing, and the US authorities promising more arrests to come, it is unlikely Blatter will be the only high-profile exit from Fifa in the coming months.<br

Act – live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The US Senate on Tuesday passed a bill to end the bulk collection of millions of Americans’ phone records, ushering in the country’s most significant surveillance reform since 1978 two years after NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden’s revelations to the Guardian. </p> \n<p>Senators voted 67-32 to pass the USA Freedom Act, which overwhelmingly cleared the House of Representatives. Hours later, Barack Obama signed the legislation, after saying he would “work expeditiously to ensure our national security professionals again have the full set of vital tools they need to continue protecting the country”.</p> \n<p>The passage of the USA Freedom Act paves the way for telecom companies to assume responsibility of the controversial phone records collection program, while also bringing to a close a short lapse in the broad NSA and FBI domestic spying authorities. Those powers expired with key provisions of the Patriot Act at 12.01am on Monday amid a showdown between defense hawks and civil liberties advocates.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/may/22/edward-snowden-nsa-reform\">Edward Snowden: NSA reform in the US is only the beginning</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The American Civil Liberties Union praised the passage of the USA Freedom Act as “a milestone” but pointed out that there were many more “intrusive and overbroad” surveillance powers yet untouched.<br /></p> \n<p>“This is the most important surveillance reform bill since 1978, and its passage is an indication that Americans are no longer willing to give the intelligence agencies a blank check. It’s a testament to the significance of the Snowden disclosures and also to the hard work of many principled legislators on both sides of the aisle,” Jameel Jaffer, the group’s deputy legal director, said in a statement.</p> \n<p>But the passage of the Freedom Act will mean the re-starting of the very program Congress voted to kill. </p> \n<p>The NSA, facing legal uncertainty after the Senate failed to pass the bill last month, shut down the bulk collection of US phone records at 8pm ET on Sunday 31 May. But since the bill calls for a grace period of six months to “transition” the program so the phone companies remain the repositories of metadata they generate, the dragnet is now set to relaunch just to be shut down again in December.</p> \n<p>A senior administration official told the Guardian the NSA was facing “a restarting process”.</p> \n<p>Oregon senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat on the intelligence committee who has railed against NSA surveillance for years, praised the breakthrough but said the work is far from complete.</p> \n<p>“This is the only beginning. There is a lot more to do,” Wyden told reporters after the vote. “We’re going to have very vigorous debate about the flawed idea of the FBI director to require companies to build weaknesses into their products. We’re going to try to close the backdoor search loophole – this is part of the Fisa Act and is going to be increasingly important, because Americans are going to have their emails swept up increasingly as global communications systems begin to merge.” </p> \n<p>He also pointed to a proposal in the House “to make sure government agencies don’t turn cell phones of Americans into tracking devices” as another target for NSA reformers.</p> \n<p>In a particular blow to Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, and Richard Burr, the intelligence committee chairman, the Senate rejected a series of amendments that were designed to weaken the surveillance and transparency reforms contained in the USA Freedom Act.<br /></p> \n<p>McConnell and Burr had led the effort in recent weeks to reauthorize the Patriot Act in its current form, ignoring the will of their colleagues in the House and a majority of the American public. </p> \n<p>Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for the Democratic leader, Harry Reid, criticized McConnell’s “toxic mix of poor planning, misguided bravado and stunning lack of communication with his fellow Republicans”. </p> \n<p>“The most remarkable thing about the events of the past week is that they were utterly and completely avoidable, but Senator McConnell failed to heed the many warning signs that flashed bigger and brighter than the marquees on the Vegas strip,” Jentleson said in an email. </p> \n<p>Despite support for the USA Freedom Act from the House, the Obama administration and the intelligence community, McConnell continued to fight changes to the Patriot Act and went from pushing a full renewal through 2020, to a short-term extension to avoid a lapse, to finally trying to water down the House bill. By the end of it all, the majority leader was left with no other option but to let the USA Freedom Act pass unamended.</p> \n<p>McConnell, who is typically known for his calm and collected demeanor, defended his position in a forceful speech on the Senate floor.</p> \n<p>The USA Freedom Act is “a resounding victory for those who currently plotted against our homeland”, he said. “It does not enhance the privacy protections of American citizens, and it surely undermines American security by taking one more tool from our war fighters, in my view, at exactly the wrong time.”</p> \n<p>Last year, an independent analysis <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-phone-record-collection-does-little-to-prevent-terrorist-attacks-group-says/2014/01/12/8aa860aa-77dd-11e3-8963-b4b654bcc9b2_story.html\">of hundreds of terrorism cases</a> in the US concluded that the NSA’s collection of phone records has had no distinguishable impact on preventing acts of terrorism. </p> \n<p>But McConnell accused the Obama administration’s record on foreign policy of undermining national security to make a last stand against reining in the government’s surveillance methods. In a rebuttal, Reid said McConnell was trying to “divert attention” from his own refusal to take up the NSA debate earlier while also dismissing the work of his Republican counterparts in the House.</p> \n<p>“He is in effect criticizing the House of Representatives for passing this Fisa bill, to reauthorize it in a way that’s more meaningful to the American people and makes us more safe,” Reid said. “Is he criticizing the speaker for working hard to get this bill reauthorized in a fashion that the American people accept? I don’t think any of us … need a lecture on why we are less secure today than we were a few days ago.”</p> \n<p>Among the amendments that failed were a measure that would weaken the USA Freedom Act’s establishment of a de facto privacy advocate to, in certain cases, argue against the government on behalf of privacy rights; an effort to allow the phone collection program to continue for a year instead of just six months, as proposed by the House bill; and another provision requiring the US intelligence chief to certify the implementation of the new phone-records regime.</p> \n<p>During the surveillance battle, McConnell miscalculated the lengths to which his colleague from Kentucky, Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul, would go to block any renewal of the Patriot Act without reforms. Paul has made his longtime opposition to the NSA’s surveillance dragnet a key tenet of his 2016 campaign and followed through on his pledge to let the Patriot Act expire – although he voted against the USA Freedom Act on Tuesday, arguing that it does not go far enough.<br /></p> \n<p>Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who is challenging Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Party’s nomination in 2016, also voted against the bill for similar reasons.</p> \n<p>“We must keep our country safe and protect ourselves from terrorists, but we can do that without undermining the constitutional and privacy rights which make us a free nation,” Sanders said in a statement. “This bill is an improvement over the USA Patriot Act but there are still too many opportunities for the government to collect information on innocent people.”</p> \n<p>Other presidential candidates in the Senate were in different camps: Texas senator Ted Cruz supported the USA Freedom Act, of which he was a co-sponsor, while the Florida senator Marco Rubio opposed the bill, arguing instead for a full Patriot Act renewal.</p> \n<p>New Mexico senator Martin Heinrich, another Democrat on the intelligence committee, praised the bill’s passage on Tuesday, saying: “Ben Franklin would have been proud of this outcome.”</p> \n<p>The US government’s bulk collection program was first <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/jun/06/nsa-phone-records-verizon-court-order\">revealed</a> two years ago by the Guardian, based on documents obtained from the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. A federal appeals court ruled the program illegal last month, all but ensuring its days were numbered. </p> \n<p>Snowden hailed the movements in Congress and the courts as “without precedent” in an <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/may/22/edward-snowden-nsa-reform\">interview with the Guardian</a> last month.<br /></p> \n<p>“The idea that they can lock us out and there will be no change is no longer tenable,” Snowden said. “Everyone accepts these programmes were not effective, did not keep us safe and, even if they did, represent an unacceptable degradation of our rights.” </p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/01/snowden-nsa-patriot-act_n_7485702.html\">Only recently</a> have many lawmakers begun to give Snowden credit for kickstarting the debate. “It is clear we wouldn’t be here without that information,” Republican senator Jeff Flake told the Huffington Post. </p> \n<p>For privacy advocates in Congress, the USA Freedom Act is just the beginning.</p> \n<p>Libertarian-minded Republicans in the House, who are <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/02/rand-paul-house-allies-surveillance-usa-freedom-act\">allies of Paul’s</a>, said on Tuesday they will attempt to use a must-pass defense appropriations bill as a vehicle to advance more surveillance reforms.

The broadcaster said most of the passengers were aged between 50 and 80.</p> \n<p>Relatives gathered in Shanghai at a travel agency that had booked many of the trips, and later went to a government office to demand more information about the accident before police broke up the gatherings.</p> \n<p>A group of about a dozen retirees from a Shanghai bus company were on the trip, said a woman who identified herself only by her surname, Chen.

They were released one at a time over a time period of four hours and lowered to the ground in order for a further assessment of their condition.</p> \n<p>“One of the 12, a male in his 20s, was treated for neck and abdominal injury and was taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital by land ambulance for further assessment and treatment.” </p> \n<p>The 16 occupants’ ordeal lasted over four hours, with their evacuation taking until until 6.35pm. <br /></p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456989565__\n</div> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Alton Towers rollercoaster crash\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en-gb&quot;&gt;\n &lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/altontowers&quot;&gt;@altontowers&lt;/a&gt; not what I expected to see today.. 2 carriage crashed into each other on the Smiler!!! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/notgood?src=hash&quot;&gt;#notgood&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/aX8mBDaX7K&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/aX8mBDaX7K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Helen Critchley (@princesshelen15) \n &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/princesshelen15/status/605726243288457218&quot;&gt;June 2, 2015&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p> Ian Crabbe, Alton Towers divisional director, admitted to reporters that he had not been alerted to issues that the Smiler reportedly suffered earlier in the day.</p> \n<p>He told reporters: “This ride has had its issues to start with, which is fairly normal for a big rollercoaster.</p> \n<p>“I think it would be unfair to reflect on those issues, which were originally part of the ride when we first opened it, and say they are connected to this incident, which I don’t believe they are.”</p> \n<p>The incident is not the first involving the Smiler, which has been closed on two occasions because of safety concerns since opening two years ago. </p> \n<p>The ride, which features a world record-breaking 14 loops, was closed in July 2013 after reports that a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2013/jul/23/alton-towers-rollercoaster-the-smiler\">bolt was seen to have fallen</a> from the ride and in November that year was closed after plastic guard wheels came loose and hit front-row riders. </p> \n<p>During a previous scare, 16 journalists were left stranded on the Smiler for around 30 minutes during a preview ride before it opened to the public in May 2013.</p> \n<p>A full investigation with the involvement of the Health and Safety Executive was last night underway at the park, whose owner was experiencing drops in its share price.</p> \n<p>Dorset-based Merlin Entertainments, which has run Alton Towers since buying out previous owner the Tussauds Group in May 2007, was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, with its shares down 3%. </p> \n<p>Nick Varney, chief executive of Merlin Entertainments said: “This has been a terrible incident and a devastating day for everyone here. </p> \n<p>Extending an apology to everyone who suffered injury and distress, he added: “The safety of our visitors is our primary concern. The park will remain closed until we understand better the cause of this dreadful incident.” </p> \n<p>An Alton Towers spokeswoman said that the park hopes to open again on Thursday and customers with tickets for Wednesday could seek a revalidation or a refund through the park’s website.</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433286429253/4d2570ee-0fd0-47c7-91a8-69eebc6b49b2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christopher Furlong/Getty Images","altText":"Air ambulance Alton Towers Smiler crash","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-03T06:30:20Z","lastModified":"2015-06-03T06:49:50Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ben Quinn","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/benquinn"},{"name":"Damien Gayle","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/damien-gayle"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["UK news","Theme parks"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"travel/theme-parks","webTitle":"Theme parks"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-456989565","source":"Kirsty Wild/Ben Jamming/Skootay/Lauren Letitia","durationInSeconds":43,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10419187&format=video/m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/02/150602altontowers_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/2/1433265600433/KP_258156_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Alton Towers ","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Alton Towers ","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Alton Towers "}}],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/03/alton-towers-closed-investigation-smiler-rollercoaster-crash","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49e72","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jun/03/alton-towers-closed-investigation-smiler-rollercoaster-crash","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/03/alton-towers-closed-investigation-smiler-rollercoaster-crash"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-456990093","source":"ITN","durationInSeconds":72,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/02/150602altonaerials.m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10419189&format=video/mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/2/1433268440398/KP_258242_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Alton aerials ","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Alton aerials ","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Alton aerials "}}},"importance":1,"kicker":{"title":"Rollercoaster crash"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[]}],"lastModified":"2015-06-03T08:20:33Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/uk-alpha/news/regular-stories","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/uk-alpha/news/regular-stories"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"uk-alpha/news/regular-stories/front"}
