Quite the opposite | Tom Baldwin</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Baldwin claimed that senior BBC executives and journalists faced repeated threats during that campaign about what would happen if they didn’t change their coverage. </p> \n<p>Baldwin makes the assertion in a Guardian article, one of the first comments on the much criticised campaign from Ed Miliband’s own team. His claim was roundly rejected by Conservative officials.</p> \n<p>Baldwin writes: “BBC executives and journalists have told me that there were regular, repeated threats from senior Tories during this election campaign about ‘what would happen afterwards’ if they did not fall into line.<br /></p> \n<p>He says: “It is a disturbing suggestion that a democratically elected government would seek to stamp on and silence dissent from an independent broadcaster.” </p> \n<p>But he claims there “has been a long-standing campaign by the Conservative party, fueled by the commercial interests of sections of the press, to attack the world’s most successful state-funded public service broadcaster as a giant leftwing conspiracy”.</p> \n<p>He adds that although he has his own frustrations with the BBC, he describes it as an organisation too precious to lose, contending “it has invested in fairness, seeks balance even when it is impossible to achieve, listens to and absorbs pressure from every political party”.</p> \n<p>A senior Conservative official said that Baldwin’s allegations were “complete and utter nonsense”.<br /></p> \n<p>John Whittingdale, who has been a critic of the licence fee system, has been appointed culture secretary, an appointment that has led some newspapers to claim the government is going to war with the BBC. Some unattributed briefings have suggested the Conservatives are unhappy at the stance taken by the BBC during the campaign, including over the handling of leader’s TV debates.</p> \n<p>Baldwin, in common with many of Miliband’s staff, is being made redundant and says responsibility for the defeat lies with him and all who took the decisions in the campaign. He had informed Miliband he would not have stayed beyond the transitional months in Downing Street if Labour had won.<br /></p> \n<p>Baldwin reveals one reason he feels confident that the BBC does not contain a leftwing bias is that he fought and lost a daily battle with the BBC about its coverage of the campaign.</p> \n<p>He writes: “Far from being in the pocket of Labour, the BBC was too easily swayed by newspapers that support the Tories and are heavily invested in Labour’s defeat.”<br /></p> \n<p>He discloses the party’s biggest dispute with the BBC during the campaign was over “the prominence it gave to the idea of a deal between Labour and the SNP that was never on the cards”.</p> \n<p>He writes: “After the first 237 incarnations on news bulletins, I struggled to see how this theme could be developed further, yet the BBC continued to lead with speculation about bizarre consequences of a Labour-SNP government for the economy, tax, and even road schemes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cce1dc0a0663f6c44f760d0c4b965766be861eb3\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/cce1dc0a0663f6c44f760d0c4b965766be861eb3/292_129_1604_962/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Baldwin, Labour Party spokesman, leaves from the party’s headquarters the morning after the election.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Baldwin, Labour Party spokesman, leaves from the party’s headquarters the morning after the election.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“At no stage was there an examination of David Cameron, Nicola Sturgeon and Nick Clegg’s motives in playing tag-team with almost identical messages on the same non-existent deal. It was a scare story based on a false premise and some badly flawed polls.”</p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2>Labour’s internal polling</h2> \n<p>Baldwin’s remarks about the polls suggests the Labour party was not overly influenced by internal party polling that was consistently less optimistic than national published polling.</p> \n<p>The party’s internal polling showed crossover – the point at which the Conservatives overtook Labour – occurred in the wake of the party conferences in October, but then Labour clawed itself back into the lead in the first few weeks of the short campaign, possibly by offering reassurance on the deficit and immigration. That lead disappeared in the final week, and its focus groups showed the party was being badly hit by the Tory warnings about the threat posed by the SNP. It tried to fight back in the final week with its own warnings about the threat to the NHS posed by a second Tory term, but the story gained little traction partly because the broadcasters had moved to a debate about how a new coalition would be formed, or whether Labour would form a minority government.</p> \n<p>Jim Messina, one of the Tory campaign managers, has agreed with Baldwin’s analysis that broadcasters in the UK unlike in the US are heavily influenced by the press. He told the Spectator’s <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/05/jim-messina-interview-how-the-pollsters-got-it-wrong-and-why-labour-lost/\">Coffee House blog</a>: “Our research showed when there were big stories or big moments, it was the press that drove that discussion and that is very different.” </p> \n<p>He also claimed on the basis of Labour’s polling that the party leadership knew for some time the Conservatives were on course to win more than 300 seats.</p> \n<p>In the Coffee House interview, Messina, a former aide to Barack Obama, said: “We predicted 312 seats that morning to Lynton [Crosby] and 316 was right in line with that, so it just kind of validated what we’d been seeing,” he says. “I had thought we were 306 with six days left. So that’s all pretty much in line with the exit poll.”</p> \n<p>He is scathing about the British polling industry listing several reasons why they make mistakes, including relying on a 2010 view of the electorate, failing to name the candidate in constituency polling, therefore failing to recognise the incumbency effect, too small sample sizes and failing to mix traditional phone polls with online polling. </p> \n<p>Messina said: “It was so clear – especially for the entire last month – that they were wrong, but none of them wanted to hear about it. So the first thing to fixing a problem is admitting you have one.”</p> \n<p>There is deep scepticism in the British polling industry that Labour and the Conservatives had private polls way out of line with what they were publishing. The polling industry has set up an independent inquiry into how it managed to get the result wrong. </p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2dba81f33c94d0d6020299668f4c286b4361f703/0_0_4592_2754/4592.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2754,"width":4592,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"REX Shutterstock","altText":"Tom Baldwin: ‘BBC executives and journalists have told me that there were regular, repeated threats from senior Tories during this election campaign about “what would happen afterwards” if they did not fall into line.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/cce1dc0a0663f6c44f760d0c4b965766be861eb3/292_129_1604_962/1604.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":962,"width":1604,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tom Baldwin, Labour Party spokesman, leaves from the party’s headquarters the morning after the election.

This has resulted in patients sometimes being offered treatments that have only minor benefit and minimal evidence, despite the potential for substantial harm and expense”, write the doctors. </p> \n<p>They warn that the NHS will not be able to cope with growing demand for healthcare unless over-treatment is banished. “This culture threatens the sustainability of high-quality healthcare,” they add. </p> \n<p>The NHS’s “tariff” system of paying hospitals for treatment incentivises them to undertake medical activity, as does the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2012/nov/13/gp-quality-outcomes-framework-indicators\">Quality Outcomes Framework system</a> under which GPs are rewarded for, for example, treating high cholesterol or high blood pressure, they say. </p> \n<p>“Defensive medicine, patient pressures, biased reporting in medical journals and a lack of understanding of health statistics and risk” have also contributed to some treatments being performed regularly, despite a lack of robust evidence showing they work, they add. </p> \n<p>The academy – whose 21-member medical royal colleges represent different types of doctors such as GP, surgeons and hospital physicians – has decided to introduce a policy called Choosing Wisely, which is already used in the US, Australia, Germany and other countries. It aims to get doctors to “stop using various interventions that are not supported by evidence, free from harm, and truly necessary”.</p> \n<p>By the autumn each of the medical royal colleges will have drawn up a list of the top five tests or procedures their members do which are of “questionable value”, giving a final list of about 100 interventions, and advise doctors to stop using them. </p> \n<p>The Patients Association criticised the plan. “For me, the concern is that I hope this is not the start of the road to widespread rationing of investigations and treatments, but I fear it might be,” said Katherine Murphy, its chief executive, who is a former NHS manager and former nurse.</p> \n<p>“We acknowledge that the NHS has to balance the books, but that should not be at the expense of treating patients appropriately. While not treating a cold or flu might be the best thing to do, I would be very concerned that [in future] a GP or hospital doctor might think twice about whether ordering an investigation for the patient to get a diagnosis, such as a scan or x-ray, is needed or not,” she added. </p> \n<p>But Bailey said: “The whole point of Choosing Wisely is to encourage doctors to have conversations with their patients and about the value of a treatment. It’s not, and never will be, about refusing treatment or in any way jeopardising safety. It’s just about taking a grown-up approach to healthcare and being good stewards of the resources we have.” </p> \n<p>Dr Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist and the academy’s consultant clinical associate, said: “We have unwittingly been complicit in creating an epidemic of misinformed doctors and misinformed patients contributing to considerable harm and great expense to our health systems and national economies.”</p> \n<p>Prof Maureen Baker, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: “If there is evidence to show that a particular intervention might be of little benefit to a patient, it is good practice that alternatives are explored. For example, mindfulness and talking therapies have been shown to have positive effects in some patients with recurring depression and anxiety, as opposed to taking antidepressants.</p> \n<p>“However, family doctors are often under considerable pressure to prescribe, or take some form of action, as a result of a patient consultation, so it is important that we work together to make people realise that drug or surgical treatment isn’t always the best way forward.” </p> \n<p>An NHS England spokesman said: “NHS England has been working as a partner with the Academy of Royal Medical Colleges to join the international campaign of Choosing Wisely to establish which interventions do not help patients in the care of their condition. </p> \n<p>“There is much evidence that there is significant overuse of some treatments such as antibiotics but when medicines are needed it’s important that patients receive them.”</p> \n<p>The Department of Health did not respond to requests for comment. </p> \n<p> </p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431458316518/6eaa6e1a-7050-4e30-9e2b-3481fbe134d6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter Dazeley/Getty Images","altText":"X-ray showing back ache","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter Dazeley/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-12T22:30:05Z","lastModified":"2015-05-13T11:51:59Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":692,"contributors":[{"name":"Denis Campbell","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/deniscampbell"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["NHS","Doctors","Health","Society","UK news","Antibiotics","Hospitals"],"tags":[{"id":"society/nhs","webTitle":"NHS"},{"id":"society/doctors","webTitle":"Doctors"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"society/antibiotics","webTitle":"Antibiotics"},{"id":"society/hospitals","webTitle":"Hospitals"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Denis Campbell","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/deniscampbell"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/may/12/doctors-to-withhold-treatments-in-campaign-against-too-much-medicine","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48pvk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/may/12/doctors-to-withhold-treatments-in-campaign-against-too-much-medicine","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/12/doctors-to-withhold-treatments-in-campaign-against-too-much-medicine"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431458316518/6eaa6e1a-7050-4e30-9e2b-3481fbe134d6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"X-rays for back pain may be more difficult to obtain under the new approach.

Most of the 65 people confirmed dead by Wednesday morning were in Dolakha district, located north-east of Kathmandu, the district’s chief administrator, Prem Lal Lamichane, said.</p> \n<p>“People are terrorised. Everyone is scared here. They spent the night out in the open,” Lamichane said, adding the administration was running out of relief material.</p> \n<p>He asked the government to send more helicopters and supplies, and said there were many injured people stranded in villages.</p> \n<p>Tuesday’s quake injured nearly 2,000 people, according to the home ministry’s latest count. But that toll was expected to rise as reports trickled in of people in isolated Himalayan towns and villages being buried under rubble, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456701300__\n</div> \n<p>Tremors radiated across parts of Asia. In neighboring India, at least 16 people were confirmed dead after rooftops or walls collapsed on to them, according to India’s home ministry. Chinese media reported one death in Tibet.</p> \n<p>The 7.8-magnitude earthquake that hit on 25 April killed more than 8,150 people and flattened entire villages, leaving hundreds of thousands homeless in the country’s worst-recorded quake since 1934. The US Geological Survey (USGS) said Tuesday’s earthquake was the largest aftershock to date of that destructive quake.</p> \n<p>Impoverished Nepal appealed to foreign nations for billions of dollars in aid, as well as medical experts to treat the wounded and helicopters to ferry food and temporary shelters to hundreds of thousands left homeless amid unseasonal rains.</p> \n<p>Search parties fanned out to look for survivors in the wreckage of collapsed buildings in Sindhupalchowk’s town of Chautara, which had become a hub for humanitarian aid after April’s quake.</p> \n<p>In Washington, Navy Captain Chris Sims said the missing Huey helicopter was conducting disaster relief operations near Charikot, Nepal.</p> \n<p>A nearby Indian helicopter heard radio chatter about a possible fuel problem, said US Army Colonel Steve Warren. The Huey, carrying tarps and rice, had dropped off supplies and was headed to a second site when contact was lost, he said, adding that there has been no smoke or other signs of a crash.</p> \n<p>Due to the rugged terrain, the helicopter could have landed in an area where the crew was unable to get a beacon or radio signal out, Warren said.</p> \n<p>Tuesday’s quake was followed closely by at least 17 strong aftershocks, according to the USGS.</p> \n<p>Frightened residents in the capital, who had returned to their homes only a few days ago, had to again set up tents on Tuesday night to sleep in empty fields, parking lots and on sidewalks.</p> \n<p>Forty-year-old produce vendor Ram Hari Sah said: “Everyone was saying the earthquakes are over ... Now I don’t want to believe anyone.”</p> \n<p>Extra police were sent to patrol ad hoc camping areas, while drinking water and extra tents were being provided, according to Kathmandu administrator Ek Narayan Aryal. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile, new landslides blocked mountain roads in the district of Gorkha, one of the regions hit hardest on 25 April, and previously damaged buildings collapsed with the latest quake.</p> \n<p>Residents of the small town of Namche Bazaar, about 50km from the epicentre of Tuesday’s quake and well known to high-altitude trekkers, said a couple of buildings damaged earlier had collapsed there as well. However, there were no reports of deaths or injuries.</p> \n<p>The earth also shook strongly in neighboring Tibet, unleashing a landslide that killed one person and injured three, according to China Central Television. Two houses collapsed, the state broadcaster said, quoting disaster officials of the regional Tibetan government.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0fe0dce38c427ad3cd4240549cb8c30b205ca847/0_0_4495_2698/4495.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2698,"width":4495,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jonas Gratzer/Getty Images","altText":"Residents of Kathmandu moved out in the open and set up temporary tents, following a second major earthquake on Tuesday.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jonas Gratzer/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T05:38:02Z","lastModified":"2015-05-13T06:57:37Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":16,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Nepal","South and Central Asia","Natural disasters and extreme weather","Mount Everest","Tibet","US news","India","Earthquakes"],"tags":[{"id":"world/nepal","webTitle":"Nepal"},{"id":"world/south-and-central-asia","webTitle":"South and Central Asia"},{"id":"world/natural-disasters","webTitle":"Natural disasters and extreme weather"},{"id":"world/everest","webTitle":"Mount Everest"},{"id":"world/tibet","webTitle":"Tibet"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/india","webTitle":"India"},{"id":"world/earthquakes","webTitle":"Earthquakes"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-456701300","source":"Camille Summers-Valli","durationInSeconds":90,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/05/12/150512NepalReport_2_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/05/12/150512NepalReport_2.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/5/12/1431443610586/KP_221463_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Nepal report","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Nepal report","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Nepal report"}}],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/13/nepal-earthquake-thousands-sleep-outdoors-amid-fears-of-further-disaster","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48p55","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/may/13/nepal-earthquake-thousands-sleep-outdoors-amid-fears-of-further-disaster","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/13/nepal-earthquake-thousands-sleep-outdoors-amid-fears-of-further-disaster"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0fe0dce38c427ad3cd4240549cb8c30b205ca847/0_0_4495_2698/4495.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2698,"width":4495,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Residents of Kathmandu moved out in the open and set up temporary tents, following a second major earthquake on Tuesday.
