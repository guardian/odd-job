On Friday, he visits the Polish prime minister, Ewa Kopacz, in Warsaw before flying to Berlin for talks with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor.</p> \n<p>The tour comes after the government unveiled its principle measure in the Queen’s speech – a bill to permit the first referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU since 1975. <br /></p> \n<p>The bill will confirm that the government has accepted the advice of the Electoral Commission on the referendum question. Voters will be asked: “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?” This contrasts with the question in the Tory private members’ bill in the last parliament which asked: “Do you think that the United Kingdom should be a member of the European Union?” The commission suggested that this question risked confusing some voters who might not have realised that the UK is already a member of the EU.</p> \n<p>The question means that the campaign to stay in the EU will be the yes side while the anti-EU campaign will be the no side, the reverse of the Scottish referendum in which the status quo – to remain in the UK – was the no side.</p> \n<p>The prime minister made clear that all members of his government would be bound by his negotiations as he hinted that ministers may also be expected to campaign on the same side in the referendum campaign. He told MPs: “The government have a very clear view, which is that we believe that the right answer is reform, renegotiation and referendum. We go into that believing that Britain will be successful. That is the view of all the government and every government minister.”</p> \n<p>As he prepared for his tour of EU capitals, Cameron was warned of the challenges ahead when French newspaper Le Monde reported over the weekend <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/25/germany-france-eurozone-integration-no-lisbon-treaty-change-david-cameron\">that Hollande and Merkel have agreed that reforms to the eurozone should be delivered under the EU’s current treaties</a>. The decision means that Cameron is unlikely to secure the “full-on” treaty change he demanded in January. British sources have suggested recently that he might press for a legally binding protocol. This could be attached to a future revision of the Lisbon treaty or to the next accession treaty for a new EU member state.</p> \n<p>The prime minister is planning to demand change in four broad areas. He wants to:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Bar unemployed EU migrants from claiming benefits and force EU migrants in employment to wait four years before claiming in-work benefits. This will be resisted in Warsaw.</li> \n <li>Hand the UK an opt-out from the “ever closer union” declaration.</li> \n <li>Ensure that EU member states outside the eurozone, such as the UK, could not have changes to the rules of the single market imposed on them by eurozone countries.</li> \n <li>Give national parliaments the right to club together to block new legislative proposals.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>A Downing Street source said: “The introduction of the EU referendum bill is a concrete step towards settling the debate about the UK’s membership of the EU. It will pave the way for the British people to have their say for the first time in 40 years on our place in the EU. And as the prime minister has said before, it will be an important choice about our country’s destiny. </p> \n<p>“Over two years ago, the prime minister made a commitment to give the British people a very simple choice in an EU referendum. He made clear then that this should not be on the basis of the status quo but on a reformed relationship with the EU that the PM is determined to deliver. With today’s bill, the PM has been true to his word. The question is clear. It will be for voters to decide whether to stay or leave.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/51adcc1fad48df950f670ae3684e486c9816bd5a/0_38_3798_2278/3798.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2278,"width":3798,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP","altText":"British Prime Minister David Cameron, right, speaks with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte during a round table meeting at an EU Summit in Brussels on Thursday, June 28, 2012.

Senior Tories have said that the prime minister will face a crippling rebellion unless he drops the threat, outlined last October by the former justice secretary Chris Grayling, to withdraw from the European convention on human rights if a series of changes were rejected.</p> \n<p>One senior Tory said: “If the prime minister wants these plans to work then he has got to remove the deeply offensive threat to withdraw from the ECHR. There is no way the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/conservatives\">Conservatives</a> can propose that – we wrote the convention for heaven’s sake. Think of David Maxwell Fyfe [the future Tory lord chancellor the Earl of Kilmuir who drafted the convention]. It is very simple. These plans will only pass if the prime minister wins the support of David Davis and Ken Clarke.”</p> \n<p>Michael Gove, the new justice secretary who is expected to outline his plans for the new British bill of rights in the autumn, regards the Grayling document as a starting point. Gove is making it clear that he is bound by the Tory manifesto which says the party will scrap the HRA and replace it with the bill of rights, which will “remain faithful to the basic principles of human rights which we signed up to in the original European convention on human rights”. But he is also saying he is not bound by the Grayling document.</p> \n<p>Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, led a group of senior Tories who warned of the dangers of withdrawing from the convention or even of distancing the UK from the document drawn up in the wake of the second world war. Grieve told MPs: “If we are in fact going to dilute those rights, and present the British public with something which is in fact the convention shorn of some of the protections it affords the citizens, then the consequences for the convention will be catastrophic. Other countries which have previously because of our leverage on them been willing to improve their human rights will cease to do it and one of the most powerful tools for improving human rights will be irrevocably damaged and I find it impossible to see how that can be in our national interest.”</p> \n<p>Andrew Mitchell, the former Tory chief whip who is leading negotiations to try and broker a deal between the government and the rebels, told MPs: “The government is absolutely right to proceed with caution on the human rights legislation as outlined today. I have to say that I never thought a British government, let alone a Conservative one, would ever have thought of withdrawing from the convention for which, of course, we were responsible.”</p> \n<p>The Queen’s speech also set out plans to introduce an <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/27/security-services-investigatory-powers-bill\">investigatory powers bill </a>that is far more wide-ranging than expected, including an extension of the powers of the security services in response to the surveillance disclosures by whistleblower Edward Snowden.<br /></p> \n<p>The prime minister signalled his plans for the Queen’s speech at the first meeting of the 1922 Committee after the election, when he waved a copy of the Tory manifesto. The 26 bills, which include plans for a tax lock to block rises in VAT, income tax and national insurance and the extension of free childcare, adhere closely to the manifesto.<br /></p> \n<p>Lord Lawson of Blaby, the former Conservative chancellor who has acted as something of a mentor to George Osborne, was highly critical of the tax lock. Lawson told the World at One on BBC Radio 4: “I don’t think it is a good idea to restrict the chancellor of the exchequer’s freedom of manoeuvre in this way. Nobody knows what economic conditions are going to be like, nobody knows what world conditions are going to be like. The public expenditure has to be financed. This was clearly done for electoral purposes, not for good government.”Other key bills in the Queen’s speech include:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>No income tax for those working 30 hours a week on the minimum wage.</li> \n <li>The extension of right-to-buy to housing association tenants.</li> \n <li>Further Scottish devolution and measures that will give English MPs more say over laws that only affect England.</li> \n <li>A counter-extremism bill to tackle radicalisation.</li> \n <li>A blanket ban on so-called legal highs.</li> \n <li>An increase in free childcare for three- and four-year-olds, to 30 hours a week.</li> \n <li>Reform of strike laws to require a higher turnout of union members.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Cameron said his legislative programme would mean “wherever you live, you can have the chance of a good education, a decent job, a home of your own and the peace of mind that comes from being able to raise a family and enjoy a secure retirement”.</p>","section":"Law","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b91d9ea6c7e85763ab7a4a654cba2c15267f0a92/0_193_4933_2960/4933.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2960,"width":4933,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"WPA Pool/Getty Images","altText":"Michael Gove with his predecessor Chris Grayling.

It felt directionless, but in truth everything was geared towards the EU referendum","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>A monotone monarch worked her way through <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/queens-speech-2015\" title=\"\">a long list</a> that had been handed to her, with the aim of convincing a country that its new government is pulsating with energy and purpose. The Queen’s speech didn’t succeed on that count: it wasn’t coherent enough. There was the odd good idea, as on childcare, and other moves, on devolution, which could work well if they get the details right. There was nasty party stuff on benefits and home affairs. And then there were laws – most notably a bill <em>not</em> to increase taxation – for which there is simply no practical need. The <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/news/latest/statement-response-queens-speech-may-2015\" title=\"\">Institute for Government seethed with quiet fury</a> at squandering time – which could be spent on getting useful laws right, or making real things happen – on creating “virtue by statute”.</p> \n<p>David Cameron’s blue-blooded talk of blue collar Conservatism could not impose convincing order on this <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/queens-speech-2015-background-briefing-notes\" title=\"\">rag-bag programme</a>. Sense can be made of it, however, through a story in three parts. The first, and most fateful, chapter began in January 2013, when – unable to resist backbench pressure any longer – a mid-term prime minister who hadn’t won a majority <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/eu-speech-at-bloomberg\" title=\"\">conceded a referendum on whether Britain should get out of Europe</a>. Mr Cameron is well aware that the Queen’s single line “early legislation will be introduced to provide for an in/out referendum” was the only onetoday that may merit a mention in the history books 100 years from now. He knows, too, that all hopes of making a success of the rest of his premiership now turns upon his handling of the renegotiation of terms with Europe, and the subsequent campaign to persuade his party and country that the haggling has achieved enough. Every other consideration is now subordinate to this task.</p> \n<p>One potentially useful ploy in managing the impossible expectations and “island nation” fantasies of the Conservative right and the Tory press was to open up a second front in the war to reclaim sovereignty, taking the fight from Brussels to the human rights court in Strasbourg. This is also the second chapter in the story of today’s speech. The European convention system is entirely distinct from the European Union, but therein lay the political attraction. If it is looking too tricky to get Berlin to increase the British rebate, or to wring privileged fishing rights from Madrid, then you can still be seen as battling bravely on the continent if you beat up on “unelected European judges”. Repealing the Human Rights Act or even quitting the convention it codifies seemed a cunning distraction from the messy compromises to come with the EU. Until, that is, the briefest thought is given to what ripping up the human rights framework would actually involve. Conservative lawyers had long warned of perverse consequences: restricting the freedom of British courts; and then – if we’re still in the convention – provoking a new rush of cases to Strasbourg; or – if we leave – setting an abominable example to the likes of Russia. It appears that Michael Gove, who is not without intelligence, glanced at the half-cocked, half-proposals that he inherited at the Ministry of Justice, and wisely decided he had better start with a blank sheet and consult. Her&nbsp;Majesty thus merely muttered that her government “bring forward” a new plan for rights down the line.</p> \n<p>With the immediate opportunity to shelter behind human rights confusion passed, we come to the Queen’s speech’s third and final chapter. As with Harold Wilson in 1974/75, ahead of his own in/out referendum, Mr&nbsp;Cameron is for the moment obsessed with managing his more Eurosceptic troops. Most, if not all, of these also happen to be rightwingers. So, with the easy avenue for Euro-bashing closed off, he has sought to give the same people things they would like in many other fields. There are gratuitous new restrictions on an already heavily curtailed right to strike, plans to rob the earnings of migrants who may work hard but lack the proper paperwork, and such a sweeping ban on legal highs that government lawyers could soon be fretting about accidentally criminalising sweets that give a sugar rush.</p> \n<p>It was then, from one point of view, a programme for government that is just about everything. But look again, and you can sport a programme that is about a European referendum, and nothing else at all.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/ce4ee798037c272ebed2c664b3dfc1cc35b113a9/0_345_2838_1702/2838.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1702,"width":2838,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"WPA

Scientists found that it produces holes in bone that provide fertile ground for the growth of spreading, or metastatic, cancer cells.</p> \n<p>But the process could be blocked, at least in mice, with bisphosphonate drugs that prevent bone loss and are used to treat osteoporosis.</p> \n<p>The drugs are already prescribed to men with advanced prostate cancer that has spread to the bones, to prevent pain and fractures.</p> \n<p>Dr Alison Gartland, from the University of Sheffield, who led the research, said: “This is important progress in the fight against breast cancer metastasis and these findings could lead to new treatments to stop secondary breast tumours growing in the bone, increasing the chances of survival for thousands of patients.</p> \n<p>“We are really excited about our results that show breast cancer tumours send out signals to destroy the bone before cancer cells get there in order to prepare the bone for the cancer cells’ arrival.</p> \n<p>“The next step is to find out exactly how the tumour secreted Lox interacts with bone cells to be able to develop new drugs to stop the formation of the bone lesions and cancer metastasis. This could also have implications for how we treat other bone diseases too.”</p> \n<p>Most breast cancers are hormone sensitive, meaning they are fuelled by the female hormone oestrogen. But it was non-oestrogen sensitive (oestrogen receptor negative, or ER negative) breast cancers that used the Lox mechanism to spread to the bones, the scientists found. Why this should be the case remains unanswered, but Lox production was linked to low-oxygen conditions in the primary tumour.</p> \n<p>Secondary breast cancer that has spread to the bones or vital organs such as the liver is the primary cause of the 12,000 deaths caused by the disease each year in the UK.</p> \n<p>An estimated 85% of secondary breast cancers involve bone metastasis.</p> \n<p>The findings are reported in the journal Nature. Study co-author Dr Janine Erler, from the University of Copenhagen, said: “Once cancer spreads to the bone it is very difficult to treat. Our research has shed light on the way breast cancer cells prime the bone so it is ready for their arrival.</p> \n<p>“If we were able to block this process and translate our work to the clinic, we could stop breast cancer in its tracks thereby extending patients’ lives.”</p> \n<p>Katherine Woods, from Breast Cancer Campaign and Breakthrough Breast Cancer, a new organisation formed from the merger of two leading breast cancer charities, said: “By unveiling the role that the protein Lox is playing, these results open up a whole new avenue for research and treatments that could stop breast cancer spreading to the bone. The research also adds weight to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of bisphosphonates in stopping secondary breast cancer in its tracks.</p> \n<p>“The reality of living with secondary breast cancer in the bone is a stark one, which leaves many women with bone pain and fractures that need extensive surgery just when they need to be making the most of the time they have left with friends and family.</p> \n<p>“Secondary breast cancer kills 1,000 women each and every month in the UK alone and yet we still don’t know enough about how and why breast cancer spreads to stop it.”</p> \n<p>Breast Cancer Campaign contributed funding to the research.</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/28/1432768662043/a2dfdffb-321d-4b48-98e7-d098c7eb11e2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Rui Vieira/PA","altText":"Consultant analysing a mammogram","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Rui Vieira/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-27T23:46:49Z","lastModified":"2015-05-28T00:08:24Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":41,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Breast cancer","Health","Science","Drugs","Cancer","Society"],"tags":[{"id":"society/breast-cancer","webTitle":"Breast cancer"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science"},{"id":"science/drugs","webTitle":"Drugs"},{"id":"society/cancer","webTitle":"Cancer"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/may/28/breast-cancer-scientists-enzyme-spread-bisphosphonates","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/499z7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/may/28/breast-cancer-scientists-enzyme-spread-bisphosphonates","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/28/breast-cancer-scientists-enzyme-spread-bisphosphonates"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/28/1432768662043/a2dfdffb-321d-4b48-98e7-d098c7eb11e2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Most breast cancers are hormone sensitive, meaning they are fuelled by the female hormone oestrogen.

In the lecture the former Labour frontbencher also launched into a stinging criticism of David Cameron’s foreign policy, and said Britain was politically “in retreat”.</p> \n<p>“The UK is one of the most open and globally engaged cultures in the world; DfID (the Department for International Development) is a world leader in aid programming but politically we are in retreat,” he said. “The defence budget is going down; there is a referendum coming on whether to stay in the EU.”</p> \n<p> Miliband expounded on his views on foreign policy and warned that international rivalries and deteriorating relations between powerful countries such as the US and Russia are hampering international peace.</p> \n<p>He said Syria had “descended into hell”, and said its demise highlighted the danger of not constructing a proper foreign policy. “Syria is where all the problems, and the absence of solutions, of modern foreign policy come together – so much so that the human consequences are losing their capacity to shock,” he said.</p> \n<p>“No, the truly shocking aspect of what is happening in Syria is the extraordinary absence of a political process to seek to solve the problem. Or even any impetus towards a political process. Instead Syria is declining amid a desperate and dangerous silence; and its problems are being exported to its neighbours.</p> \n<p>“Deteriorating relations between the US and Russia over Ukraine, the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and rifts between the backers of Syria’s fragmented opposition have sapped hope that a meaningful political process can take place. And, of course, the high price of the mistakes of the west in Iraq and Afghanistan have sapped confidence that western powers will do anything other than make things worse, and drained support for anything other than hand-wringing. That is the explanation for the UK’s almost complete absence from the political as well as military battlefield.”</p> \n<p>He said humanitarianism alone would not solve intractable conflicts and called for an international political solution.</p> \n<p>Miliband said he supported French proposals, which would mean permanent members of the UN security council should agree to suspend their right of veto in cases of mass atrocity.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/11/1431364702965/48c0d3bd-ec42-43bc-8656-208e0b898041-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lefteris Pitarakis/AP","altText":"Ed Miliband listens to David Miliband speak at the Labour conference in 2010 shortly after Ed defeated his brother in the leadership contest.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Lefteris Pitarakis/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-28T08:07:23Z","lastModified":"2015-05-28T08:26:43Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":18,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["David Miliband","Ed Miliband","Politics","UK news","Labour","General election 2015"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/davidmiliband","webTitle":"David Miliband"},{"id":"politics/edmiliband","webTitle":"Ed Miliband"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour"},{"id":"politics/general-election-2015","webTitle":"General election 2015"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/28/david-miliband-election-defeat-labour-party-ed","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ax9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/may/28/david-miliband-election-defeat-labour-party-ed","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/28/david-miliband-election-defeat-labour-party-ed"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/11/1431364702965/48c0d3bd-ec42-43bc-8656-208e0b898041-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ed Miliband listens to David Miliband speak at the Labour conference in 2010, shortly after Ed defeated his brother in the party’s leadership contest.

The timing of this goes hand in hand with the improvements in well-being that we have seen.”</p> \n<p>Another co-author, senior BCG economics advisor Enrique Rueda-Sabater, said: “It is actually a pretty positive story. They [Poland] are not improving well-being by sending everyone to the UK. Domestic job growth and their performance on our employment dimension confirms that.”</p> \n<h2>Norway: the best place to be in the world?</h2> \n<p>Norway was judged to be the country where citizens have the best wellbeing in the world followed by Luxembourg and then Switzerland.

This partially reflects big steps forward in health for countries in sub-Saharan Africa generally. </p> \n<p>Other than health and education, the dimensions analysed by the report are: income, economic stability, employment, infrastructure, income equality, civil society, governance and environment.

Leaders must now embark upon a new era and actively pursue well-being—not just GDP—as the primary goal. </p> \n<p>“They can and should measure well-being, and hold themselves against it. As one of the new leaders in well-being revealed in this year’s report, Poland shows that you don’t necessarily need high GDP growth to improve the lives of citizens, and that countries that focus on well-being seem to succeed on more fronts.”</p> \n<p>The report is being released before the conclusion of discussions in September to finalise what targets for economic and social outcomes by 2030 will succeed the Millennium Development Goals. </p> \n<p>In his foreword to the report, Nobel prize-winning economist A. Michael Spence said: “To pursue wellbeing effectively, countries need to achieve economic growth that is both socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. The importance of a decisive, broad-based effort in this regard cannot be overemphasised. It is very good and encouraging to see the kind of contribution that this report, developed by strategy experts focused on wellbeing, makes to that effort.” <br /></p>","section":"News","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432750874820/c9174246-3ba2-4109-b77b-e2ec38acd28d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alik Keplicz/ASSOCIATED PRESS","altText":"Warsaw, the capital of Poland.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alik Keplicz/ASSOCIATED PRESS"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-28T06:01:00Z","lastModified":"2015-05-28T07:11:44Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":254,"contributors":[{"name":"George Arnett","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/george-arnett"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["World news","Economic growth (GDP)","Business","Economics"],"tags":[{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"business/economicgrowth","webTitle":"Economic growth (GDP)"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"}],"section":{"id":"news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"George Arnett","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/george-arnett"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/datablog/2015/may/28/poland-outperforms-uk-in-education-and-health-report-finds","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4989h","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/news/datablog/2015/may/28/poland-outperforms-uk-in-education-and-health-report-finds","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2015/may/28/poland-outperforms-uk-in-education-and-health-report-finds"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432750874820/c9174246-3ba2-4109-b77b-e2ec38acd28d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Warsaw, the capital of Poland.
