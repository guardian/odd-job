In the case of 100 teachers asked to strike, the action would only be lawful if at least 50 teachers voted and 40 of them backed the strike.</p> \n<p>The double threshold would have to be met in any strike called in health, education, fire, transport, border security and energy sectors – including the Border Force and nuclear decommissioning.</p> \n<p>In further changes, Javid will:</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Require all unions, not just those affiliated to Labour, to ask each existing union member whether they wish to pay the political levy and then repeat the question every five years. The &pound;25m annual political fund income from 4.5 million political levy payers funds a wide range of political campaigning including being a chief source of funding for Labour.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Propose that unlawful or intimidatory picketing should become a criminal as opposed to civil offence and new protections should be available for those workers unwilling to strike. A named official will be required to be available at all times to the police to oversee the picket including the numbers on the line, currently set at six, in an existing code of conduct.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Compel unions to renew any strike mandate with a fresh ballot within four months of the first ballot and give employers the right to hire strike-breaking agency staff as well as require a union to give the employer at least a fortnight’s notice before the industrial action starts.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Empower the government to set a limit on the proportion of working time any public sector worker can spend on trade union duties.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Give the government certification officer powers to fine trade unions as much as &pound;20,000 for breaches of reporting rules including an annual audit on its protests and pickets. The certification officer will also have power to initiate investigations and will in future be funded by a joint levy of unions and employers<br /></p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Require a clear description of the trade dispute and the planned industrial action on the ballot paper, so that all union members are clear what they are voting for.</p> \n<p>The number of working days lost due to strikes was 704,000 in the 12 months to April 2015, but this is a far cry from the near 13m days lost through strike action on average in the 70s, the heyday of union militancy.</p> \n<p>The government says it feels forced to act due to the number of strikes called on the London underground, railways or in schools based on small turnouts or two-year-old ballot mandates.</p> \n<p>The leader of the train drivers’ union Aslef, Mick Whelan, has already likened the attack on union rights as resonant of fascist Germany.</p> \n<p>Paul Kenny, the GMB general secretary, warned the reforms would poison industrial relations in the UK since they removed all incentives for employers to heed their own workers and settle disputes. He said: “When workers jump through draconian hurdles for their vote for strike action to be lawful, the employers can then ignore the will of their own workers. Workers will have to give employers 14 days’ notice of strike action. That is more than enough time for employers to legally hire another workforce to break the strike.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/13/frances-ogrady-tuc-my-members-real-wealth-creators\">Frances O’Grady: ‘My members are the wealth creators, but don’t get a fair share’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The changes to the current system of contracting out of paying the political levy are also likely to be equally controversial since there had been an unwritten understanding at Westminster that no party would introduce partisan reforms to party funding without cross party consensus.</p> \n<p>Repeated attempts, notably by the former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, to reach cross party consensus on funding reform foundered when the Conservatives refused to accept a new lower individual donation cap and Labour resisted major changes to the political levy.</p> \n<p>The Javid plans, which were not clearly set out in the Conservative manifesto, are likely to blow a hole in Labour party funding because the number of union members who will proactively support paying the political levy will be much lower than those who pay the political levy through inertia.</p> \n<p>Kenny said: “It is clear the Tory party high command intend to make the Labour party bankrupt by cutting off the main source of funding that they have relied on since the 1930s. This is aimed at undermining political campaigning by unions on behalf of their members and communities.”</p> \n<p>He said the proposals were one sided since there were no parallel proposals to insert more democratic requirements on company donations to parties.</p> \n<p>Javid said: “Trade unions have a constructive role to play in representing their members’ interests but our one-nation government will balance their rights with those of working people and business.</p> \n<p>“These changes are being introduced so that strikes only happen when a clear majority of those entitled to vote have done so and all other possibilities have been explored.</p> \n<p>“This will deliver a key commitment we made in our manifesto.”</p> \n<p>The employment minister, Nick Boles, said: “People have the right to expect that services on which they and their families rely are not going to be disrupted at short notice by strikes that have the support of only a small proportion of union members.</p> \n<p>“These are sensible and fair reforms that balance the right to strike with the right of millions of people to go about their daily lives without last minute disruption.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436904720792/e198125a-c37a-4bc0-a403-eced5d0c8619-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dave Evans/Demotix/Corbis","altText":"PCS union members march in central London, October 2014.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dave Evans/Demotix/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-15T07:38:33Z","lastModified":"2015-07-15T07:38:35Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2949,"contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Wintour","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/4/1423058528318/Patrick-Wintour-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patrickwintour"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Trade unions","Conservatives","Sajid Javid","TUC","Politics","UK news","Employment law","Law","Public services policy","Society","Economics","Business"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/tradeunions","webTitle":"Trade unions"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"politics/sajid-javid","webTitle":"Sajid Javid"},{"id":"politics/tuc","webTitle":"TUC"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"law/employment-law","webTitle":"Employment law"},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law"},{"id":"society/policy","webTitle":"Public services policy"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Patrick Wintour","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/patrickwintour"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jul/15/trade-unions-conservative-offensive-decades-strikes-labour","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ak9g","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jul/15/trade-unions-conservative-offensive-decades-strikes-labour","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/15/trade-unions-conservative-offensive-decades-strikes-labour"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436904720792/e198125a-c37a-4bc0-a403-eced5d0c8619-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"PCS union members march in central London, October 2014.

The event culminated an initiative to survey the solar system that the space agency embarked upon more than 50 years ago. </p> \n <p>About 13 hours after its closest approach to Pluto, the last major unexplored body in the solar system, New Horizons phoned home, signaling that it had survived its 31,000 miles per hour (49,000 km/hour) blitz through the Pluto system. </p> \n <p>Managers had estimated there was a one-in-10,000 chance a debris strike could destroy New Horizons as it soared just 7,750 miles (12,472 km) –about the distance from New York to Mumbai – from Pluto. </p> \n <p>But right on time, New Horizons made radio contact with flight controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab outside Baltimore, sparking a wave of shouts and applause from an overflow crowd gathered to watch the drama unfold. </p> \n <p>With 99% of the data gathered during the encounter still on the spaceship, New Horizons’ survival was critical to the mission. </p> \n <p>“This is truly a hallmark in human history,” said <strong>John Grunsfeld</strong>, Nasa’s associate administrator for science. </p> \n <p>Scientists have many questions about Pluto, which was still considered the solar system’s ninth planet when New Horizons was launched in 2006.</p> \n <p>Pluto was reclassified as a “dwarf planet” after the discovery of other Pluto-like spheres orbiting in the Kuiper Belt, the region beyond the eighth planet, Neptune.

It now believes the debt ratio will still be 170% in 2022 after hitting a peak of 200%. </p> \n<p>The IMF has consistently urged deeper debt relief throughout the Greek crisis, but has met resistance from European finance ministers, who have been unwilling to make their taxpayers pay the cost of a write down. Tsipras has also insisted that debt relief must form an important part of the package, but a statement by Eurozone leaders on Monday said only that further measures might be taken provided Greece adhered in full to the reforms demanded by its creditors.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/13/alexis-tsipras-eurozone-bailout-plan-greek-parliament\">Alexis Tsipras aims to steer eurozone bailout plan through Greek parliament</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the leaked report, the IMF says that Greece’s debts threaten to be unsustainable for decades, and that its financing needs will rise so that they are above the 15% of national income level deemed safe. The IMF adds that unless European creditors agree to an extended grace period, they face the choice of either annual transfers to the Greek budget, or “deep upfront haircuts”, the term for the cancellation of part of the debt. IMF sources confirmed that an updated debt sustainability analysis had been prepared by staff and would be discussed by the organisation’s executive board.</p> \n<p>Unless the IMF can convince itself that Greece’s debts are sustainable, it would be forbidden by its own rules to put money into a new bailout. The assumption has been that the fund would provide €16.4bn – around 25% of the total – with the rest coming from the ESM.</p> \n<p>The European commission, one of Greece’s three creditors alongside the IMF and the European Central Bank, sought to play down the report. A commission spokeswoman said that the IMF and the commission had together signed off on a different debt sustainability document. This was the paper sent to eurozone finance ministers on Saturday and formed the basis for the bailout agreement signed off by eurozone leaders on Monday morning, she said. </p> \n<p>Reports of renewed IMF concerns came as Tsipras tried to convince dissident MPs in his own Syriza party to back another round of austerity. Ahead of the make-or-break vote in Athens’s parliament, Tsipras held back-to-back meetings as he attempted to rally support for measures at total variance with the rationale of his radical left party. Creditors have given the Greek government until Wednesday to push controversial reforms, including sales tax increases and pension reforms, through parliament. </p> \n<p>Appalled by Tsipras’s volte-face, an estimated 35 Syriza MPs signalled on Tuesday night that they would vote against the measures, arguing that the “recessionary policies” will only worsen the record levels of poverty and unemployment Greece has already suffered. Panagiotis Lafazanis, the energy minister who heads Syriza’s Left Platform, implored the prime minister to turn down the terms. He called the proposals the work of “economic murderers” intent on destroying Greece.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/14/history-shows-how-the-greek-crisis-could-pan-out\">History shows how the Greek crisis could pan out | Letters</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even if it was endorsed by the 300-seat House with the help of opposition parties – as seems likely – “it will never be passed by the people who effectively will eradicate it with their unity and struggles,” Lafazanis said. </p> \n<p>With Tsipras’ own position looking increasingly vulnerable, the country appears headed for fresh political tumult. On Tuesday night government insiders insisted the prime minister had no intention of standing down, saying he would probably attempt to clear the political terrain with a cabinet reshuffle on Thursday. <br /></p> \n<p>Tsipras told public television last night: “The worst thing a captain could do while he is steering a ship during a storm, as difficult as it is, would be to abandon the helm.” <br /></p> \n<p>But if losses are heavy, and he loses his parliamentary majority, the young leader might also be forced to from a cross-party government of national unity. </p> \n<p>“Political developments inside Syriza will be rapid and dramatic,” said professor Dimitris Keridis who teaches political science at Athens’ Panteion University.</p> \n<p> “But we will see a realignment in Greek parliamentary politics in support of the deal which, hopefully, will be cathartic and provide stability,” he said. “Tsipras is being asked to pay for the sins of a previous political class. The great irony is a radical leftist will now have to impose all the reforms that were never passed before, neo-liberal measures that he has always opposed.”</p> \n<p>The neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party quickly sought to capitalise on the popular anger that the deal is bound to unleash. “Golden Dawn will resist the new memorandum that the government of the left will sign with the complete support of New Democracy, To Potami and Pasok,” said the organisation’s leader Nikos Michaloliakos, referring to the opposition parties. “An avalanche of taxes is coming. New annihilating measures that will mainly affect the country’s youth, that will increase unemployment and hit farmers who are the soul of the nation, are coming. From every place in this land the battle will continue … so that the plans of foreign rule are not passed.” </p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/15/1436917052456/08b35d5b-dce4-4df8-b215-5c159a172e27-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Emilio Morenatti/AP","altText":"Butchers wait for clients in a meat market in central Athens.

Ritualistic cries of “Death to America” or “Death to Israel” do still ring out, though attention has focused recently on the talks over the country’s nuclear programme – and ending the sanctions imposed because of it.</p> \n<p> Security is tight as the crowds pour in from the nearby highway and metro station, Shahid Beheshti – one of many named after the martyrs of the 1979 revolution. Guards carry out brisk body searches; bags have to be checked into a makeshift cloakroom. Iran, after all, is one of few Muslim countries where mosques have not experienced terrorist bombings in the last few months, especially on a Friday. The Sunni fanatics of Islamic State have targeted Shia civilians in Iraq and the Gulf states. “If Daesh [Isis] can strike in<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/26/islamic-state-claim-responsibility-deadly-blast-kuwait-city-mosque\"> Kuwait</a>,” says one worried intellectual, “why not in Tehran?”</p> \n<p> Outside the mosque there are more troubling reminders of the violent neighbourhood Iran inhabits. It is normal to see little plastic boxes for <em>zakat</em> – Islamic charity contributions – for the poor, for orphans, and the old cause of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. But there are also appeals for the suffering people of Yemen, where Iran’s arch-rival Saudi Arabia is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/07/jihadis-likely-winners-of-saudi-arabias-futile-war-on-yemens-houthi-rebels\">carrying out air strikes against Houthi rebels</a>, as well as for Iraqis, “to help fight Daesh”.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457497033__\n</div> \n<p> Now that the nuclear marathon is over, encouraging hopes for a better relationship with its old American enemy, Iran is projecting itself as an island of stability in a sea of trouble and demanding to be treated as an equal. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, continues to excoriate “global arrogance”, as he always has, but has hinted clearly at cooperation with the US once sanctions end, and dignity – a recurrent word – has been restored. </p> \n<p> “We believe we have a constructive and positive role to play in the region, with or without an agreement,” said Amir-Hossein Abdollahian, the deputy foreign minister for the Middle East, a few days before the Vienna talks ended. “We understand that a good nuclear deal can have a good influence.” Iran’s support for Syria’s fight against “terrorism” was consistent with its backing for Hezbollah in Lebanon and opposition to Saudi attacks on Yemen, he said. “A positive nuclear outcome will have a positive outcome for relations with the west.” The only red line was Israel – “an illegitimate regime”.</p> \n<p> Neighbouring Iraq is the most likely theatre for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/03/iranian-foreign-minister-raises-prospect-of-joint-action-against-islamic-state\">joint, or at least coordinated action</a> – as happened in Afghanistan briefly after the 2001 US attack on al-Qaida and the Taliban – and before George Bush hastily incorporated Iran into his “axis of evil”. Now a US-led coalition is mounting air strikes against Isis, while Iranian Revolutionary Guards, under its Quds force commander, General Qasim Suleimani, are advising Iraqi Shia militias on the ground. But there is no coordination between Iran’s force and the US, Abdollahian was anxious to emphasise. Iran also makes no secret of its disdain for US efforts and especially its “double standards”.</p> \n<p> “Suleimani and the US could work together if there is a nuclear agreement,” suggested Mohamed Ali Vakil, editor of the reformist newspaper Ektebar, interpreting the government’s position more explicitly. “But it will take time, because the Americans believe their national security interests are in competition with Iran’s. After all, Isis is the ideological offspring of the Saudi regime and Turkish adventurism – both US allies.”</p> \n<p> The Tehran rumour mill points to another problem. Suleimani has been much <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/oct/14/suleimani-high-profile-to-publicise-irans-key-anti-isis-role\">photographed </a>on the frontlines in Iraq and Syria and profiled in the western media. But some of his powers are said to have been taken away, suggesting concern at the top about atrocities committed by Iraqi People’s Militia units in Sunni areas. It will be harder for Iran to blame the Saudis for “incubating” the Isis <em>takfiri</em> doctrine – sanctioning the killing of apostates – if its own Shia allies are behaving in a brutally sectarian way. Iran has its own minorities, including Sunnis, to worry about.</p> \n<p> Still, there is no mistaking the growing confidence engendered by Iran’s engagement in the nuclear talks and the disarray elsewhere in the Middle East. “The Arab world is in limbo and there is no real regional player except Saudi Arabia, which is playing an angry, reactive, violent game,” argues another senior adviser. “Iran is ascending and it is proving that it is able to solve a difficult problem through diplomatic means, that accommodation is more profitable than marginalisation. That’s why the Arabs and Israel react so violently to the nuclear issue.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3a8bc13cbd32b03d4393d173563bb31650ba996\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/15/1436919027569/ddca3ae4-e6b4-4fae-91ec-b2af3b5bffa6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"An al-Quds Day rally in Tehran\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mist of water hovers over Iranians at the annual pro-Palestinian rally marking al-Quds (Jerusalem) Day in Tehran this month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ebrahim Noroozi/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> But even after an agreement, the barriers to further cooperation with the US are obvious. The biggest is Iran’s profound hostility to Israel – “<a href=\"http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/07/06/419004/Iran-Israel-Quds-Day-Hossein-Dehqan\">the world’s centre of evil, espionage and warmongering</a>”, in the words of the defence minister, Hossein Dehghan. Al-Quds (Jerusalem) day is officially marked in Tehran more fervently than in any Arab capital. Iran’s strategic relationship with Hezbollah is solid. The idea of resistance that the Lebanese Shia movement embodies is fundamental to Iranian official thinking. It does not sit easily with even a limited rapprochement with the US. </p> \n<p> Hardliners are concerned about the implications. Hossein Sheikholislam, an adviser to the speaker of the Majlis, Iran’s parliament, acted as interpreter for the students who took US diplomats hostage in Tehran in 1979, and he does not trust Americans any more today than he did then – though many other former militants have since become reformists. In 1987, he recalls, the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/iran-says-1988-airliner-shootdown-is-why-u.s.-cant-be-trusted/article/2567526\">USS Vincennes </a>shot down a passenger plane that killed 290 Iranians and the captain was given a medal. “So why shouldn’t we call them Satan? Yes, it’s a long time, but time doesn’t change the essence. The change is that now we are sitting face to face and we are fighting over the table.”</p> \n<p> Supporters of the president, Hassan Rouhani, fear a crackdown at home after a nuclear agreement. And there is a risk too that when sanctions end, assets are unfrozen and oil exports double, the Revolutionary Guards will have more cash to enable them to act as a “spoiler” to an Iranian-western honeymoon. “The hardliners just want sanctions removed, but they don’t want the contagion of relations with the US to reach other areas like human rights and foreign policy,” says an independent analyst. “They fear western values and American corruption that could create the breeding ground for a velvet revolution.” </p> \n<p> Advocates of rapprochement with the US are more optimistic – though they do acknowledge the risks of wishful thinking. “I am not saying that the Revolutionary Guards are cleaning the windows of the old American embassy and getting ready to apologise,” quipped<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/apr/08/the-iranian-professor-who-dares-to-differ-on-nuclear-matters-and-israel\"> Sadegh Zibakalam</a>, a leading reformist commentator. “But at some point Khamenei has to choose between cooperating with the Americans and facing the prospect of Isis on our borders. Politics makes strange bedfellows.” </p> \n<p> Iran is keen above all to promote the notion that internationally, it deserves a seat at more tables than it is currently invited to – to play its part, and on its own terms, in resolving the multiple crises of its own tough neighbourhood. It seems to be making some headway. “None of the international processes on Syria or Iraq or on terrorism include the Iranians,” says one Tehran-based European diplomat. “If they were included and recognised as a regional leader, they would temper their ambitions. If they were treated with dignity, the supreme leader could defend a nuclear agreement on that basis. To us, dignity sounds like a bullshit concept; for them it’s serious.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/15/1436918902115/7d8a06b1-fbe6-4633-816e-0eac323691a3-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ebrahim Noroozi/AP","altText":"Celebrations in Tehran","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ebrahim Noroozi/AP"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/15/1436919029627/ddca3ae4-e6b4-4fae-91ec-b2af3b5bffa6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A mist of water hovers over Iranians at the annual pro-Palestinian rally marking al-Quds (Jerusalem) Day in Tehran this month.

This deal could help to restore that broken trust, he said. </p> \n<p>Hamidreza Jalaeipour, a Tehran University sociologist and a member of the reformist Participation Front, said Rouhani had fulfilled his campaign promise to resolve the nuclear issue, which was why millions voted for him in the 2013 presidential election. </p> \n<p>“This deal is positive by itself firstly because it shows that such a complicated issue could be resolved through patient dialogue,” Jalaeipour said. “It is also important because it was a collective effort. It wasn’t only the government pushing for it, but the main forces behind the state were also behind it, so were the people.”</p> \n<p>A minority of hardliners at home and abroad would remain unhappy with the success of diplomacy, Jalaeipour predicted. The fear is that they might refuse to admit defeat and instead attempt to sabotage the agreement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34c94d8aba9a0e0927124b393fc118836f657a2e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/34c94d8aba9a0e0927124b393fc118836f657a2e/0_164_4096_2459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iranians celebrate in the streets of Tehran\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iranians celebrate in the streets of Tehran.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Critics of the nuclear deal have often cited the statement of the founding leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomeini, that he drank from a “poisoned chalice” when accepting the end of the war with Iraq. They warn that his successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is doing the same now.</p> \n<p>Sadegh Zibakalam, professor of politics at Tehran University, and a rare critic of the nuclear programme, said: “In years to come, people will refer to the agreement as a landmark in modern Iranian history. Things are bound to change for the better economically. But on the political front things are more complicated.”<br /></p> \n<p> Zibakalam and other reformists believe the deal will not only boost Rouhani’s popularity but probably guarantee him a second presidential term in 2017. Before that, parliamentary elections for the Majlis next March are expected to be an opportunity for the reformist camp to make gains, though many prospective candidates are likely to be disqualified.</p> \n<p>“Rouhani has highlighted the nuclear issue as the key to success,” said Mohamed Ali Vakil, editor of the reformist newspaper Ebtekar. “No, there will not be strategic changes, but when sanctions are lifted the sense of optimism will create a more positive atmosphere and that will help.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c3e4a7ca73e4b28d577fad5f52110dc08ddab9e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436904214885/b3121ce4-22d4-4f77-9be4-0b2722d8bc22-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"An Iranian woman holds a flower and a poster of Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Iranian woman holds a flower and a poster of Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as she celebrates in the street of Tehran after nuclear talks between Iran and World powers ended in Vienna.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Rouhani’s government will have more legitimacy and that will weaken the hardliners and strengthen the progressives,” he said.</p> \n<p>But there are dangers ahead. “Some people think things will get harder because the small but powerful minority that does not like any rapprochement with the west will be violent,” suggested Mahshid, an independent businesswoman. “Historically, whenever reforms go too far, the conservatives create havoc. But you do hope it will be a landmark because by negotiating with the west and being open to a conversation as opposed to belligerence you are rejigging one of the tenets of the revolution.”<br /></p> \n<p>Iranians who oppose the agreement said they feared their leaders may suffer the same fate as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi: surrendering their nuclear capability and then seeing regime change. “The Libyans gave up their nuclear facilities but then Gaddafi was destroyed,” warned Qasem, who runs a stationery supply business near Tehran University.<br /></p> \n<p> Foad Ezadi, an academic and hardliner, said: “If there is a lasting agreement, you will see some change because the camp arguing for better relations with the west will be in a better situation.” </p> \n<p>But he was sceptical: “Imagine if the economic benefits don’t come.

Noting the coincidence of negotiations in Europe over both Iran and Greece, one Twitter user wrote: “Overworked western diplomats, under deadline pressure, agree to debt relief for Iran, nuclear programme for Greece.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48e75ea7ed4e49e614f1a7be8a7bac14576582ac\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436904139485/c8c21d75-2562-4d1d-94fa-2326fd07428c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Iranians celebrate in the street of Tehran after nuclear talks between Iran and world powers ended in Vienna, Austria.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iranians celebrate in the street of Tehran after nuclear talks between Iran and world powers ended in Vienna, Austria.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, a student leader involved in the infamous US hostage crisis in 1979, and now a reformist, tweeted: “One day Hitler ordered bloodshed from a Vienna balcony, today from another Vienna balcony diplomats closed path to war.”</p> \n<p>Not all Iranians viewed the nuclear accord as a triumph.

energy network is growing but additional measures will bolster capacity at peak periods</p>","byline":"Press Association","body":"<p>The UK faces a tighter energy crunch than last year, with more contingency measures needed to ensure the lights stay on, an assessment from National Grid has shown.</p> \n<p>The gap between total electricity generating capacity and peak demand would fall to just 1.2% without measures in place such as paying mothballed power plants to be ready to come online, and paying factories to be prepared to power down.</p> \n<p>With those extra steps in place for times of peak demand, the capacity margin rises to 5.1%, the assessment shows.</p> \n<p>Last year’s capacity margin was 4.1% without additional provisions, which raised the breathing space to 6.1%. </p> \n<p>But mild windy weather, high levels of electricity imports from the continent and greater than expected levels of available power plants meant the capacity margin was adequate, and extra help to meet demand was not needed, the report said.</p> \n<p>This winter the margins will be tighter, due to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2014/jan/22/eon-close-power-stations-blackout\">the closure of power stations</a>, requiring greater efforts to balance the system and

\n</aside> \n<p>Cordi O’Hara, National Grid’s director of market operation, said: “It’s clear that electricity margins for that coldest, darkest half hour of winter are currently tighter than they have been, due to power stations closures.</p> \n<p>“As system operator, we feel we’ve taken a sensible precaution again this winter to buy some extra services.</p> \n<p>“Together with the tools we already use to balance the network these additional services will significantly increase the energy reserve available this winter.”</p> \n<p>The energy minister, Andrea Leadsom, said: “Our priority is to ensure that British families and business have access to secure affordable energy supplies that they can rely on.</p> \n<p>“National Grid have confirmed that our plan to power the economy is working – and it means that the lights will stay on this winter as well as making sure our homes and businesses have the gas and electricity they need in the future.”</p> \n<p>National Grid has also released a series of four scenarios for how the UK’s energy system could look in the future. </p> \n<p>But of the scenarios, only one, in which green ambition is not restrained by financial limitations and new technology is embraced by society, will see the UK meeting its targets to cut emissions and tackle climate change.</p> \n<p>Under this “gone green” scenario, LED lights will be the only viable lightbulb option by 2030, renewable power output will be comparable to that of conventional power plants by 2026, and sales of air source heat pumps will top 300,000 a year by 2020.</p> \n<p>But under a “no progression” scenario focused on energy security at the least cost, gas output for electricity will rise 15% by 2036, while coal output will fall 89% to be matched by solar.</p> \n<p>In another scenario of slow economic growth where available money is spent on long-term solutions to tackling emissions, offshore wind could double every five years up to 2026 and annual sales of hybrid electric vehicles could exceed 50,000 by 2019.</p> \n<p>A final “consumer power” scenario of relative wealth and innovation meeting consumer needs would see more installations of gas combined heat and power units in commercial buildings, solar power capacity quadrupling by 2020 and small-scale generation such as household solar accounting for 40% of capacity by 2036. </p> \n<p>Roisin Quinn, National Grid’s head of energy strategy and policy, said: “The energy industry is changing rapidly and at National Grid we are right at the heart of that change.</p> \n<p>“We haven’t got a crystal ball, but our scenarios offer a glimpse into the future, using our unique insight into the trends shaping the energy landscape.”</p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3c388b93fc1a0fc3168305415f9b6b439f63a947/0_279_5616_3371/5616.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3371,"width":5616,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Oli

The average day fee is now more than &pound;13,000 a year – a 340% increase since 1990, or 150% after adjusting for inflation. <br /></p> \n<p>The proportion of a typical doctor’s disposable income accounted for by the costs of schooling is now 38%, compared with just 17% in 1990. A typical accountant would have 59% of his or her disposable income eaten by school fees, compared with 26% 25 years ago. Members of the clergy – who could once comfortably send their children to private schools – would have to give up about 80% of after-tax income to pay for independent fees today. For a family with two children boarding from the age of the 13, the combined cost in fees and other educational expenses will rise to nearly &pound;900,000 if fees continue at their current rate of increase.</p> \n<p>But the report concludes that a private school education may yet prove to be profitable if former private school pupils can <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/may/03/pwc-recruiters-say-a-level-results-unfairly-aid-private-school-pupils\">maintain their historic wage premium</a> over those educated in state schools, estimated by one study as 7% six years after graduation. “In this sense, private education seems to outperform other investments, which helps to explain why despite the rising fees, parents continue to choose it,” the report concludes.</p>","section":"Education","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7f903190df23ffc1f2ccc55ca245804e20ba5afa/0_139_3000_1799/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1799,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christopher Furlong/Getty Images","altText":"Pupils play netball","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-15T05:01:07Z","lastModified":"2015-07-15T05:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":243,"contributors":[{"name":"Richard Adams","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/richardadams"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Private schools","Schools","Education","Family finances","Money","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"education/private-schools","webTitle":"Private schools"},{"id":"education/schools","webTitle":"Schools"},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education"},{"id":"money/family-finances","webTitle":"Family finances"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"education"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Richard Adams","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/richardadams"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"education"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/jul/15/private-school-education-could-be-poor-investment-research-shows","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ak8f","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/education/2015/jul/15/private-school-education-could-be-poor-investment-research-shows","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/15/private-school-education-could-be-poor-investment-research-shows"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7f903190df23ffc1f2ccc55ca245804e20ba5afa/0_139_3000_1799/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1799,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The average day fee at private schools now tops £13,000 a year.
