Still, I could forgive that …","byline":"Stella Grey","body":"<p>Recently, a reply to a hello message that I wrote last autumn arrived out of the blue, apologising drily for the delay. It came from Miles, who is an academic and lives an hour away by train. Miles is round-faced with wild, grey hair and a wide smile. His profile picture, I recalled, was rather dapper (three-piece suit, tie; a picture probably taken at a wedding) and he’d come over as a Glass Three-Quarters Full person, consumed by enthusiasms. His only complaint about life was that there’s not enough time.</p> \n<p>After a brief flurry of mutually reassuring emailing, establishing that there was conversational potential, I was invited to lunch. After a morning of trying on and rejecting dresses, opting for jeans, boots, a T-shirt and blazer, careful, subtle makeup, big jewellery, I nervously took the train to his town, to meet at a restaurant he’d suggested.</p> \n<p>In fact, this was plan B. Originally, he had asked me to his house in a&nbsp;village a further short drive away. “Sod the protocol. Come to my place on Sunday and I’ll cook you lunch and&nbsp;we’ll walk across the fields in the afternoon,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>What seems normal and sensible to one person – a 10-minute lift from the station – is impossible to others. I’m unable to get into a strange man’s car unless it’s a taxi. Nor, needless to say, was I sure about going into a stranger’s kitchen. Miles thought I was being overcautious. Caution will gain us nothing, at this stage of our lives, he said. As he’s 59, about to be 60, this was perhaps a little over-inclusive. Maybe he could cook for me on the second meeting, I suggested. I had already checked his identity, online; academics are easy to validate, at least. His reaction to this idea was positive. Good plan, he said. Let’s do that. Then he sent another email, the night before we met, with pictures of his house – a newbuild, partly designed by him. Beneath the photographs there were thoughts about what he might cook me for lunch on our second date.</p> \n<p>We decided to meet at the restaurant. After that, we’d mooch; there was interesting mooching to be had. Stay for an early evening drink, he said, perhaps an early supper somewhere before heading home. By the time I got to the bistro, it was raining heavily.</p> \n<p>Miles texted to say he would be late. I texted back to say I was already at the table. When he arrived, the man striding towards me, the big smile evident, looked a bit different from the man in the profile picture, but then, no doubt, so did I. He was wearing a cotton polo neck and a giant, plaid shirt. He was broader, a decade older than in the picture, and balding. I wasn’t attracted to him, but I’ve learned not to make snap judgments. Sexual chemistry isn’t always immediate. Sometimes it builds softly and surprises you.</p> \n<p>We ordered and talked about being single in midlife. He’d been divorced for almost 10 years and in the past four, hadn’t had a relationship that lasted more than a month. Perhaps you’re too picky, I told him. My mother’s sure I am. He didn’t ask about my mother or my family or origins, or career. He wanted to talk about ideas, which was fun, if a bit exhausting.</p> \n<p>We ate fish and drank white wine – I&nbsp;drank almost all of it, as he was driving – and then he insisted on paying the bill. He was smiling broadly as he paid. “This has been fun,” he said. “It’s tremendous to meet new people.”</p> \n<p>As I rose from the table – the first time he’d seen me standing up – his eyes went to my hips and thighs, and his smile faltered. We stood in the porch of the restaurant, under its awning, the rain hammering on it. He had already made his decision. Miles, who is heavy, with a belly that I could have forgiven, couldn’t bring himself to see me again. He could give me a lift to the train, he said, but to be honest I’d be as quick to walk. Oh, I said, sounding obviously disappointed, you’re heading straight home? I thought …</p> \n<p>He had work to mark, he said, not looking at me, and it was raining, so best call it a day. He said goodbye and went over to a big silver car, unlocking it and raising a farewell hand, as I opened my umbrella and crossed the road towards the station.</p> \n<p>Stella Grey is a pseudonym</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/greystellagrey\" title=\"\">@GreyStellaGrey</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434734135272/couple-sitting-in-a-bar-c-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘We decided to meet at the restaurant.

But I am a chronic sufferer of chub rub, the stingy rash you get on your thighs when they chafe together in high temperatures. It can be debilitating, especially during long runs. So far, these pants have banished my chub rub almost completely. The little sack – officially called a Joey Pouch (I’m sorry) – sweeps up your privates, keeping them safe from unwanted skin contact. In addition, there’s also something called a No-Drip-Tip (I’m so sorry) that wicks away sweat. The result is that you quickly forget you’re wearing them, which is generally a good thing where pants are concerned.</p> \n<p><strong>Best and worst bit </strong>The best bit is the fact that they work. Being able to run in comfort on a hot day is a rare experience for me, and these are helping enormously. The worst bit is having to read all the durr-brained, over-masculine marketing copy about them.</p> \n<p><strong>Is it worth it? </strong>Sure, if you suffer from chub rub and have a high tolerance of infuriating branding.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434374996626/Is-it-worth-it-2undr-gear-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration: Photograph: Son of Alan for the Guardian","credit":"/Son of Alan for the Guardian","altText":"Is it worth it 2undr gear shift","cleanCaption":"Illustration: Photograph: Son of Alan for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434375136123/67248119-74b4-4268-af16-d95d54199f1c-424x600.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":600,"width":424,"orientation":"portrait","credit":"Illustration: Son of Alan for the Guardian","altText":"Is It worth it? 2UNDR gear shift","cleanCredit":"Illustration: Son of Alan for the Guardian"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-20T05:00:08Z","lastModified":"2015-06-20T05:00:08Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":16,"contributors":[{"name":"Stuart Heritage","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733749780/StuartHeritage.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stuart-heritage"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Health & wellbeing","Life and style","Fitness"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fitness","webTitle":"Fitness"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Stuart Heritage","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stuart-heritage"}}],"series":{"title":"Is it worth it?","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/is-it-worth-it"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/is-it-worth-it-2undr-gearshift-stuart-heritage","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ep7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/is-it-worth-it-2undr-gearshift-stuart-heritage","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/is-it-worth-it-2undr-gearshift-stuart-heritage"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":5,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434374996626/Is-it-worth-it-2undr-gear-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration: Photograph: Son of Alan for the Guardian","credit":"/Son of Alan for the Guardian","altText":"Is it worth it 2undr gear shift","cleanCaption":"Illustration: Photograph: Son of Alan for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"My son and I make a great team","rawTitle":"My son and I make a great team","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/my-son-and-i-make-a-great-team","title":"My son and I make a great team","trailText":"Phil Robinson on the special role sport can play in building bonds and, ultimately, a stronger relationship between fathers and sons","standFirst":"Phil Robinson on the special role sport can play in building bonds and, ultimately, a stronger relationship between fathers and sons","byline":"Phil Robinson","body":"<p>When one of my best and most trusted mates asked if I wanted my nine-year-old son to start cricket a few summers ago, I almost said no. As a kid, my first response to cricket was an amalgamation of boredom and terror. My father, on hearing that we’d be playing cricket at secondary school, had bought me a Sondico Clive Lloyd bat and set up a wicket at the end of the garden. The bat was rock hard and each nick of the ball sent knuckle-shattering vibrations up through my protective gardening gloves. These were the days before protective helmets and it only took a few of my six-foot father’s fizzing deliveries whumping the garden fence for my, and my twin brother’s, enthusiasm to drain away entirely.</p> \n<p>That September, I went to the local comp but we didn’t play one game of cricket in six years. The Sondico bat, which was far too nice for the beach, remained in a cupboard and cricket was done. My dad was too busy with work to persist at all this in the way we dads do now (looking on YouTube for the right way to do something) and I reverted to the core 1980s suburban pursuits of lollygagging and jumping my bike from unstable ramps made from scrap plywood. As a dad, I look back on these summers with mixed feelings. I loved killing time outside the Spar or riding up and down alleyways but I also remember feeling incredibly bored.</p> \n<p>I accepted my friend’s offer of joining the local cricket club and at Oscar’s first game I dozed off on a large white park bench while fluffy clouds tracked through a blue sky over the pavilion. This was my kind of parenting. As I watched him cut a ball to the boundary, I hoped that he’d at least give it a few more months before jacking it in.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It’s not about me being Oscar’s mate, but him seeing who I am beyond my dad role and me seeing him beyond his son role</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>At this point, I was a bit clueless about fatherhood and didn’t yet realise how important cricket would become to us as a way of spending more time together. In some ways, I was just like my father. For him, getting my brother and me into sport was probably as much about us acquiring social skills as it was about fitness or confidence. I suspect with my father there was also a class element. I asked for a BMX and I got a racer. I asked to do karate and I was signed up to a tennis academy. The final straw was the day he presented me with a set of secondhand Sam Snead golf clubs (my brother received a half set of Slazengers). Golf, we were informed, was a useful skill we could use in business. I think there was probably a big difference between knocking balls around PGA golf courses&nbsp;on the corporate days my dad attended and playing whack and walk around a thinly grassed gravel pit in outer London.</p> \n<p>We played golf with Dad a few times, but mostly he would just drop us off at the municipal course and we would get on with it. It was the same when we were enlisted in the local tennis academy. In the 1970s and 1980s there was a “them and us” thing with adults and kids: why would adults want to hang out with kids or vice versa? Didn’t we want to be independent, off on our own? This doesn’t feel right to me. Historically, boys would have been deeply connected to their fathers as mentors and guides – either as apprentices or, going much further back to the days of hunter-gatherers. Through urbanisation and industrialisation, this element to our relationships appears to have been&nbsp;lost.</p> \n<p>I feel now that all my best (and worst) days as a child were spent with my father – and it really didn’t matter what we were doing. Even though he was a director of an engineering firm, he was always heading off to someone’s house to fix their boiler for free. I loved going with him, holding a torch over his shoulder and passing him mugs of tea. On days like this, or on rarer trips to museums, I saw another, calmer, happier Dad, different to the exhausted guy I saw for a quick half an hour at night when he finally got home from work.</p> \n<p>As I got older, the times I liked him best were when we forgot our roles as father and son: like at college when he’d drop us off and stay for a few drinks in the pub with all the lads. Or even family barbecues where he’d also have a couple and the authoritarian mask would slip and I’d get to see how funny he was and how much people enjoyed his company. He loved to laugh – this is not something I’d see much when he had the proverbial foot on my neck to revise.</p> \n<p>As I had my own children, it seemed natural that I would spend more time with them than my father had spent with me. I tried to make up for the time that my father and I didn’t have by getting him along to see his grandsons play cricket, but even so it always seemed like he was always too busy: first with wrapping things up at work, then adjusting to retirement and then, finally, his illness. He died at just 62, from mesothelioma, related to asbestos he’d cleared from a building after his father sent him out to work at 16.</p> \n<p>A few months after he died, I realised that he hadn’t seen Oscar play cricket once. I was on the receiving end of the oldest lesson known to man: there is always something important to do, there is always later, until there is no later and it is too late. It’s not like I didn’t understand this or know it to be true, but some lessons have to be worn like a bruise to be understood. I felt deep down that there was no point me being a father if all my sons ever saw of me was this same old facade of stressed disciplinarian. It’s not that I wanted to be best mates with them – I just wanted our life on this planet to be about more than getting the right grades or getting into the right college.</p> \n<p>That summer, I signed up to manage the teams of my two younger sons – both of whom had picked up on their older brother’s enthusiasm and all wanted to play cricket. I probably help to run or attend about three or four games a week during the season. Oddly, one of the best parts is driving to the far-flung games. If we’re on our own I get a lot of hard-hitting questions, mostly about my life and stuff I’ve done in the past (Q: “Why was the old magazine you worked for called Loaded?” A: “Er …”)</p> \n<p>Running teams, you get a sense of the kids whose dads never come to games because they are working late during the week or going cycling at the weekend. I can’t understand this. These are the good times. Sometimes the kids wander up and tell you where their dads are, apropos of nothing. These are the times when they need a&nbsp;parent’s understanding, an arm round their shoulder to say, “I used to get out like that all the time! It’s a family tradition!”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"965041cb85d3beba2923820c19e9217d866327fb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434466963760/bb585244-1412-48f2-b495-6b399316c7d7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Phil and Oscar.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil and Oscar.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter /Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sometimes I think it’s great for them to look up and see Dad as part of their life, their group. Life can’t all be about turning up at the big moments – the 16th, 18th, 21st birthdays, university graduation and his wedding. I’d bet most kids would trade all that to have just had you there when they got a golden duck and some idiot laughed.</p> \n<p>After a couple of years of shuttling the kids around, one of my best friends pointed out that our sons were old enough to play in the same teams as we were. Being slightly too hopeless to play for a club, I decided to start my own village cricket team: the Muswell Maidens. The idea is that my friends and I will all be able to play games with our sons (most of whom are better than us anyway). We have had so much fun so far that we hope the team will be here after we’re gone, hopefully run by our lads to play with their own sons and daughters.</p> \n<p>I now play on and off with Oscar in a couple of teams and feel that this shared pursuit provides us with common ground outside of the competent authoritarian/clumsy kid role that I got stuck in with my own father. It’s not about me being Oscar’s mate, but about him seeing who I am beyond my dad role and me seeing who he is beyond his son role.</p> \n<p>The other day, a dad was telling me that he felt his son really didn’t like him. He’s a lovely, caring man, but the son simply got on better with his&nbsp;mother.</p> \n<p>This is what sport can do for men. Sport helps men, in particular, build bonds and relationships. This is stuff as a dad you can talk about. It gives me the opportunity to say to my son, yes I was terrible today and the world didn’t end. I know most of the fathers of my generation are looking for shared experiences with their children, beyond the litany of “do your homework” or “tidy your room” that we were raised on.</p> \n<p>The first time I batted with Oscar was at an indoor match at Lord’s. After my father died, I’d had this bug in my head about batting with Oscar – I didn’t want to repeat the same pattern. About two balls in to my fantasy moment, running a quick single, I fell flat on my face, a clattering heap of bat, helmet and pads. As I lie there catching my breath, feeling my knee swell, a 12-year-old hand hove into view. I look up at this face through the grill of this helmet thinking, didn’t I just bring you back from the hospital?</p> \n<p>“Get up, Dad,” he says, in a patient but impossibly deep voice. I took his hand and we continued on. At some point in our short innings, the best thing happened – the thing that has happened each time I have batted with him since: for a short time I forgot that he is my son and simply saw him as an equal – just another team mate batting down the other end and it’s what I always wanted.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434466576848/Phil-Robinson-and-his-son-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alicia Canter/Guardian","altText":"Phil Robinson and his son, Oscar, at the North London Cricket Club.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alicia Canter/Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434466965339/bb585244-1412-48f2-b495-6b399316c7d7-1360x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1360,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Phil and Oscar.

It’s late at night, and I’m standing in a hotel lobby, waiting for a lift to take me up to my room. In front of the lift there is a framed sign on a stand. My name is printed on the sign, above an arrow pointing to the stairs. Below that are some words in Spanish. From the context, it seems obvious to me that the sign says, “Tim Dowling is barred from the lift.” But I’m alone in the lobby, so when the door opens, I&nbsp;get in.</p> \n<p>In the morning, after breakfast, I ring my wife.</p> \n<p>“I was wondering when I might hear from you,” she says.</p> \n<p>“They took me out,” I say. “Sorry.”</p> \n<p>“What happens today?” she says.</p> \n<p>“Press conference,” I say. “Rueda de prensa. There’s a sign.”</p> \n<p>“Who comes to that?” she says.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know,” I say.</p> \n<p>When I try to put myself in the position of a Spanish reporter invited to put questions to a foreign journalist I’ve never heard of whose book has just been translated into Spanish, I can only imagine balling up the press release and throwing&nbsp;it away.</p> \n<p>Before the press conference, a hired photographer takes pictures of me in various locations: next to a wall; perched on a chair near a plant; on the pavement outside. I am, as always, eerily compliant.</p> \n<p>Afterwards, I follow the arrow on the sign with my name on it up the stairs. At the top there are 40 people milling about wearing name tags on lanyards, drinking coffee and eating free pastries. I find the woman from the publisher’s publicity department standing to one side.</p> \n<p>“Are all these people here for me?” I ask.</p> \n<p>Her eyes search the crowd as she processes my&nbsp;question into Spanish. “No,” she says. “They’re doctors.”</p> \n<p>About eight journalists have turned up for my&nbsp;press conference, which is taking place in a&nbsp;room off the mezzanine where the doctors are.&nbsp;Because&nbsp;I don’t speak any Spanish, an interpreter has been provided. She’s called Janine, and is seated at my right hand with a&nbsp;notepad. When the publisher begins his opening&nbsp;remarks, Janine immediately leans towards me and starts whispering in English. This&nbsp;is a little alarming – two people either side&nbsp;of&nbsp;me, speaking simultaneously. My concentration skips from one voice to the other.&nbsp;Then the talking stops, and everyone looks&nbsp;at me.</p> \n<p>“Buenas dias,” I say.</p> \n<p>I turn to Janine. “Is that right?” I whisper. Janine makes a face. Uh-oh, I think. Don’t piss off&nbsp;Janine.</p> \n<p>A journalist to my left asks a long question. “He&nbsp;is comparing your wife to the Guardia Civil,” Janine whispers. I can’t tell whether what she subsequently says about the Guardia’s&nbsp;historic reputation for brutality is part of the question or just a bit of background for my&nbsp;benefit.</p> \n<p>When everybody looks at me again, I begin talking in English. I make a joke that is greeted by&nbsp;complete silence. I glance towards Janine and&nbsp;I&nbsp;see that she is doodling – her pad is full of stick figures, letters and squiggles. Later, I will learn this is an abstract form of shorthand commonly used by interpreters, but at that moment I’m convinced she’s playing hangman to&nbsp;pass the time. Janine’s bored, I think.</p> \n<p>Eventually, I run out of breath. Janine starts speaking in rapid Spanish, crossing out stick figures as she goes. At one point, some of the journalists chuckle, but I can’t tell if they’re laughing at me or with me. Perhaps Janine has made a joke at my expense, I think. It occurs to me that I might find it easier to go outside and impersonate a doctor.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434447626267/Tim-Dowling-col-illo-2061-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration:  Photograph: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","credit":"/Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","altText":"Tim Dowling col illo 20/6/15","cleanCaption":"Illustration:  Photograph: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434447804128/9f94492b-6664-49b6-8033-f314a6ccb316-686x720.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":686,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian Photograph: Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","credit":"Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","altText":"Tim Dowling illo June 20","cleanCaption":"Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","cleanCredit":"Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-20T04:59:06Z","lastModified":"2015-06-20T04:59:06Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":26,"contributors":[{"name":"Tim Dowling","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733750190/TimDowling.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/timdowling"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Family","Life and style","Books","Culture","Spain"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"travel/spain","webTitle":"Spain"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tim Dowling","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/timdowling"}}],"series":{"title":"Tim Dowling's Weekend column","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/timdowlingsweekendcolumn"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/tim-dowling-book-launch-spain","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49npe","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/tim-dowling-book-launch-spain","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/tim-dowling-book-launch-spain"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":4,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434447626267/Tim-Dowling-col-illo-2061-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration:  Photograph: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","credit":"/Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","altText":"Tim Dowling col illo 20/6/15","cleanCaption":"Illustration:  Photograph: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"Ask Molly Ringwald: my friend is texting my boyfriend – should I be worried?","rawTitle":"Ask Molly Ringwald: my friend is texting my boyfriend – should I be worried?","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jun/19/ask-molly-ringwald-friend-texting-boyfriend","title":"Ask Molly Ringwald: my friend is texting my boyfriend – should I be worried?","trailText":"‘Maybe your jealousy is entirely unfounded, but I happen to think that the strong feelings you describe are there for a reason’","standFirst":"<p>‘Maybe your jealousy is entirely unfounded, but I happen to think that the strong feelings you describe are there for a reason’</p>","byline":"Molly Ringwald","body":"<p><strong>When I was first dating my boyfriend, he texted me one night saying he was going for a drink with my friend Lisa. They had bumped into each other at a work event. I immediately had a sick feeling in my stomach. Lisa is attractive and charming (most men I know like her or have slept with her). I didn’t say anything about my feelings at the time, but recently he got a text from Lisa and I got upset. I know we have a good relationship and I am probably overreacting, but I am wondering where these feelings are coming from and if I should listen to them. I trust my boyfriend, but these interactions with Lisa bother me a lot. What can I do?</strong><br />It doesn’t seem as if you trust your boyfriend much. If you did, he should be able to hang out with the goddess Aphrodite and that would be OK. Maybe your jealousy is entirely unfounded, but I happen to think that the strong feelings you describe are there for a reason. It could be the result of past experiences that you’re bringing to this relationship – but if something feels wrong, that voice is worth listening to.</p> \n<p>Every relationship has different rules and expectations that are best established at the beginning, rather than building on a foundation of distrust and resentment. Since Lisa is your friend (not an old friend of his), it doesn’t seem entirely appropriate for her to text your boyfriend and set up impromptu drinks meetings on a regular basis. Let your boyfriend know you don’t feel comfortable with it, and why, and come to an agreement about what is and isn’t OK with both of you. He might have some requests of his own with which you might not totally agree, but having a healthy relationship requires some compromises for the sake of your partner’s feelings, and that should be the priority here.</p> \n<p>As far as Lisa goes, she should know better. There are some women who tirelessly take on the femme fatale role, unsatisfied until they’re sure they have the attention of every man, whether or not he is taken. Maybe she’s one of these types, maybe not, but let’s just say that if she makes a habit of texting your boyfriend without including you – unless she’s advising him what to get you for your birthday or anniversary – I’d definitely lose darling Lisa.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Send your dilemmas about love, family or life in general to <a href=\"mailto:askmolly@theguardian.com\">askmolly@theguardian.com</a>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434375288591/Ask-Molly-20-June-2015-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"P Photograph: Franck Allais for the Guardian","credit":"/Franck Allais for the Guardian","altText":"Ask Molly 20 June 2015","cleanCaption":"P Photograph: Franck Allais for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T15:00:00Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T23:10:36Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":116,"contributors":[{"name":"Molly Ringwald","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/17/1410970326054/Molly-Ringwald-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/molly-ringwald"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Life and style","Relationships"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/relationships","webTitle":"Relationships"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Molly Ringwald","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/molly-ringwald"}}],"series":{"title":"Ask Molly Ringwald","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/ask-molly-ringwald"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/19/ask-molly-ringwald-friend-texting-boyfriend","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49em9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/19/ask-molly-ringwald-friend-texting-boyfriend","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/19/ask-molly-ringwald-friend-texting-boyfriend"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434375288591/Ask-Molly-20-June-2015-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Photograph: Franck Allais for the Guardian","credit":"Franck Allais for the Guardian","altText":"Ask Molly 20 June 2015","cleanCaption":"Photograph: Franck Allais for the Guardian"}},"importance":3,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434375288591/Ask-Molly-20-June-2015-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"P Photograph: Franck Allais for the Guardian","credit":"/Franck Allais for the Guardian","altText":"Ask Molly 20 June 2015","cleanCaption":"P Photograph: Franck Allais for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"A letter to … My dad, who didn’t live to see my sons","rawTitle":"A letter to … My dad, who didn’t live to see my sons","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/a-letter-to-my-dad-who-didnt-live-to-see-my-sons","title":"A letter to … My dad, who didn’t live to see my sons","trailText":"The letter you always wanted to write","standFirst":"The letter you always wanted to write","byline":"","body":"<p>My stomach still knots when I see the card shops advertising Father’s Day. I avoid looking at the cards or watching those lucky enough to have a dad, happily choosing which jokey one to buy. It’s just gone 18 years since you passed away. Too young, and scarcely retired, you fought the tumour for four years. I always thought you’d keep beating it, that it wouldn’t develop. And that you’d see my first son.</p> \n<p>You knew he was coming. You saw the six-week scan a few days before you left us. The night you died, you asked whether I’d prefer a boy or a girl. I felt sure you’d meet him; that you’d rally and come out of hospital. In my naivety, I thought a grandson would even help you live longer; that this could perhaps help you in to remission; that you might even see him grow up.</p> \n<p>We lost you that night and my son never met you. But he has your name as part of his identity and as a reminder that you missed each other by a mere seven months. He knows your face from photos and he knows that you saw his unborn shape in one grainy, long-ago hospital image. So in a&nbsp;way, you did meet each other.</p> \n<p>He knows your sense of humour from the pithy, funny Irish sayings that I’ve passed on from you to him. He has met your sisters and your brother and he met your wife, my mum. He knew and loved her until two and a half years ago when she, too, went too soon and from a vicious, unforgiving tumour.</p> \n<p>He saw my heartbreak and he shared it. But he is a strong young man and reassured me repeatedly that his nana would be so much happier now because she would be joining you. So you were there during that time of new grief because your name and your presence were evoked as something positive and a reason why my mum would find bliss. I hope so. I really want to believe that. If I could fully believe that, it would make these years and years of loss and longing so much more bearable.</p> \n<p>I now have three sons and they know all about you and who you were and where you came from. And because they knew their nana, they heard your name often and saw your photos all over her house. She was never the same person after you went. She was just 60 and full of vitality. And she made the best of it and got on with life. But the sadness was always there. Even in the midst of a party, I could see that she was looking for you, wanting to tell you something, to nudge you to laugh at something, to hold your sleeve for reassurance, to have a dance, to share a bottle of wine or a funny story.</p> \n<p>My boys have never seen their dad’s&nbsp;dad. And so on Father’s Day, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;the dad and I get the cards and that’s all very touching, but it always feels incomplete. I yearn for my boys to&nbsp;have known you and to have kicked a ball with you, or to have seen what an amazing golfer you were. I love to have seen them sitting on your lap, laughing with you, being tickled by you, cuddling you, hearing them say the word grandad.</p> \n<p>Your golf clubs still sit unused since you last played in March 1997. I&nbsp;want to use them and to teach your grandsons to use them, but I keep putting it off. One day soon, I&nbsp;will pull them out of the bag and take the boys to tee off, and we will&nbsp;think of&nbsp;you and talk of you and remember that you were a great golfer who won many trophies, but that you were also a&nbsp;humble man, a gentleman, an undemanding man, a kind and sensitive man, a humorous man. You were my dad. I loved you when I was a&nbsp;boy and a&nbsp;young man and I love you now, so many years later.</p> \n<p>And your grandsons love you, too. Though they will never hear your voice, they know who you were, and they know that, through them, you live on in their blue eyes, their robust humour,&nbsp;their sporting prowess and in&nbsp;their prayers and in their hearts. For&nbsp;ever.</p> \n<p><em>David</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-20T05:15:07Z","lastModified":"2015-06-20T05:15:07Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["Family","Grandparents and grandparenting"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/grandparents-and-grandparenting","webTitle":"Grandparents and grandparenting"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"A letter to ...","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/aletterto"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/a-letter-to-my-dad-who-didnt-live-to-see-my-sons","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49z8b","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/a-letter-to-my-dad-who-didnt-live-to-see-my-sons","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/a-letter-to-my-dad-who-didnt-live-to-see-my-sons"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":3,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[]}],"lastModified":"2015-06-20T05:45:07Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/9ff3-334c-b065-e792","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/9ff3-334c-b065-e792"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle/series/an-apple-a-day/front"}
