Recent incidents involving tacks scattered on roads and neck-high wire strung across cycle paths have taken the vilification of Lycra louts to a whole new level</p>","byline":"Peter Walker","body":"<p>On 14 June 2015, Alec James was taking part in the <a href=\"http://www.velothon-wales.co.uk/en/\">Velothon Wales</a>, a 90-mile mass bike ride on closed roads through countryside near Cardiff. The 28-year-old press officer, a keen cyclist, had invited along some London friends and was particularly proud to show them the region where he grew up.</p> \n<p>But his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AEWJ/status/610122967528415232\">day ended early.</a> “I was about 30 miles in, on a fast downhill stretch, and I saw one rider on my left go down,” James says. “I moved to avoid him and started to slow. Then my front tyre blew out and I went over. I rolled with the bike for a good few yards, bashed my head, breaking the helmet. I was doing about 30mph. I got deep lacerations on my leg. I couldn’t walk properly for a week.”</p> \n<p>After he struggled to his feet, James found a drawing pin in his front tyre, then saw a number of other tacks scattered on the road, at a point seemingly chosen to cause the most danger.</p> \n<p>A fortnight before this, police in Brighton <a href=\"http://www.sussex.police.uk/pressline/2015/05/29/danger-wires-warning-for-people-using-coldean-woods,-brighton\">had issued a warning</a> about wires strung between trees on a popular bike track through woodland, saying two such hazards had been spotted in as many days. A week earlier, in Dorset, <a href=\"http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/12955696.Cyclist_hurt_after_fishing_line_strung_across_path_at_Moors_Valley/\">a rider suffered cuts</a> after hitting 15 strands of fishing line stretched across a cycle path in a country park. On 23 June, mountain bikers in Cannock, Staffordshire <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Aebeebee/status/613462041391689728\">posted Twitter photos</a> of a neck-high wire between trees on a cycle trail.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f6b97f84a823fa1dbc35730a2070066120485805\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f6b97f84a823fa1dbc35730a2070066120485805/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"Alec James after his crash at the Velothon Wales..\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alec James after his crash at the Velothon Wales.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alec James</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the same week, several riders taking part in Redhill Cycling Club’s 70th anniversary road race, on back roads in the Surrey countryside, suffered punctures after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redhillcc/status/612288507516710912\">drawing pins were scattered on the route</a>. No one was hurt, but that was mainly down to luck, says Adrian Webb, the club’s chairman: “You can guess how dangerous it can be if you have an 80-man peloton and someone punctures unexpectedly. These guys have got slick tyres pumped up very strongly for a race – there’s every chance a tyre can explode. If a rider comes off, there could a mass pile-up.”</p> \n<p>Such incidents remain rare, and any such physical threat to cyclists is tiny when compared with the danger from other motor vehicles, especially lorries. One of the many paradoxical elements about cycling in Britain is that it is both far safer than many people think – numerous studies have shown it is many times more likely to lengthen a lifespan through increased exercise than shorten it – but notably more perilous than it could be.</p> \n<p>Annual government road casualty figures for 2014, released last week, show the number of seriously injured riders rose 8.2% against the year before, a bigger increase than that in the number of cyclists. In London, in particular, the focus is on the danger posed by lorries, especially construction trucks. On 24 June, thousands of protesting cyclists brought the busy road junction at Bank to a halt after 26-year-old consultant Ying Tao was crushed by a tipper truck two days earlier. She was the eighth cyclist killed in the city in 2015, seven of whom died in incidents involving lorries, six of the victims women.</p> \n<p>Another paradox is that even as cities such as London and Bristol are, finally, building segregated bike lanes, proven to be the best way to prevent such deaths, the tone of the debate around cycling has arguably become more polarised and poisonous than ever. Some campaigners worry that the sabotage incidents are linked to a public and media narrative in which cyclists are demonised equally as both anarchic lawbreakers and smug, humourless killjoys, sausage thighs squeezed into unsightly DayGlo Lycra.</p> \n<p>The debate around cycling occasionally bears comparison with the treatment of so-called societal outgroups, according to <a href=\"http://www.bath.ac.uk/psychology/staff/ian-walker/\">Dr Ian Walker</a>, a psychologist at Bath University. <a href=\"http://opus.bath.ac.uk/9332/\">One of his experiments</a> to research attitudes towards cyclists involved riding around his home town wearing a long brunette wig with an electronic distance gauge attached to his bike, to see whether drivers gave female cyclists more overtaking space than men. They did, even when the “woman” was 6ft tall and, for the drivers who happened to look in their rearview mirror, surprisingly hairy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a73debb964f202d5480a72db202d15349c1064c\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/9a73debb964f202d5480a72db202d15349c1064c/0_110_5020_3011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cycling in traffic in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cycling in traffic in London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Images Group/Getty Images/Universal Images Group</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“What you see in discourses about cycling is the absolute classic 1960s and 1970s social psychology of prejudice,” he explains. “It’s exactly those things that used to be done about minority ethnic groups and so on – the overgeneralisation of negative traits, under-representation of negative behaviours by one’s own group, that kind of thing. It’s just textbook prejudiced behaviour.”</p> \n<p>This is played out in the media, on television and radio and, most virulently, via social media and website comments. Under a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3136411/Eighth-cyclist-killed-London-2015-Oxford-graduate-26.html\">Daily Mail story last week</a> about Ying’s death, the most-recommended reader comment until it was deleted read: “Why not ban cyclists? They don’t pay road tax.”</p> \n<p>This is a particularly pervasive point, and one that ignores the fact that “road tax” – a car-based fund set aside for highway construction – was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23694438\">scrapped in 1937</a>. Vehicle excise duty, its replacement, is based on emissions, meaning cyclists, if liable, would be zero-rated anyway.</p> \n<p>Other comments under the piece surmised that such deaths happen because of rampant cyclist lawbreaking, notably jumping red lights. Again, this doesn’t bear scrutiny. An <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/15/cycling-bike-accidents-study\">analysis of police statistics</a> found a failure to stop at a red light or stop sign was a factor in just 2% of serious adult cycling incidents; in contrast, drivers were deemed solely to blame about two-thirds of the time.</p> \n<p>Lawbreaking is one of the difficulties of the debate for cyclists. The average person on a bike is arguably no more likely to break a law then their peer in a car. However, when they do so it’s more obvious, less normalised. People notice a cyclist pedalling through a red light, whereas speeding – which 80% of drivers <a href=\"http://www.ctc.org.uk/blog/roger-geffen/rac-says-%E2%80%9Cdrivers-need-help%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-and-they%E2%80%99re-right\">admit to doing regularly</a> – is often ignored, despite the immeasurably greater human cost this causes.</p> \n<p>Chris Boardman, the Olympic track cycling champion who is now <a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/campaigning/article/cam20130530-campaigning-Chris-Boardman-MBE-0\">policy adviser to British Cycling</a>, recalls appearing on a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05vy4kk\">recent episode of BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours</a> to discuss whether cyclists should be obliged to take out insurance, a discussion prompted in part by an incident where a pavement-riding cyclist struck a young child. This premise lacked context, Boardman argues: “When you put it into perspective, there’s 36 people killed on pavements by cars, buses and lorries every year – that’s just on pavements – versus about one every three years from a cyclist. It’s ludicrous the programme was even on. Nobody seems to feel obliged to look at any facts.”</p> \n<p>Elsewhere over recent years, there has often not been any attempt at balance, even in generally sober parts of the media. Several years before anyone thought of stringing wire across Brighton woodland, Times columnist Matthew Parris <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/matthewparris/article2044185.ece\">half-jokingly advocated</a> a similar idea in a piece titled: “What’s smug and deserves to be decapitated?”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f37c7a712158bc37f0b7763d22085e408181059\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/2f37c7a712158bc37f0b7763d22085e408181059/0_0_1999_3000/666.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Boardman.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Boardman.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Marsland/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In November 2013, the Spectator ran as its <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9073071/off-your-bike/\">cover story</a> a long rant by Rod Liddle at cyclists, describing them as oversensitive lawbreakers who deliberately hold up traffic while wearing “pompous little pointy plastic hats”. Even the Observer had <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2013/apr/28/stop-pampering-scottish-cyclists\">an article</a> in April of the same year by a regular columnist, Kevin McKenna, calling cyclists a scourge, complete with jokes about middle-class bike-riding fops and their “cous cous packed lunches”.</p> \n<p>BBC Radio Kent, meanwhile, ran a phone-in show about road safety last week under the banner: “Should cyclists be banned in cities?”</p> \n<p>A recent twist on this narrative is the idea of a two-wheeled versus four-wheeled “war” on the roads, typically illustrated by dramatic cyclist helmet camera footage. “Many road rage incidents have been prompted by the ongoing war between motorists and cyclists,” boomed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvthismorning/status/611899986352177152\">a promotional tweet</a> last week from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvthismorning/status/611899986352177152\">ITV’s This Morning</a> programme. “Whose side are you on?”</p> \n<p>Boardman is scathing about such hyperbole, not least because cyclists and drivers are very often the same people – British Cycling data shows 90% of its members also own cars.</p> \n<p>“You’ve got 2% of vulnerable road users versus 98% in two tonnes of steel,” Boardman says. “How can you possibly have a war? I think that’s called a massacre. What could a cyclist possibly do to somebody in a car?”</p> \n<p>He is, however, wary of connecting this media narrative with the idea of an increase in attacks and sabotage against cyclists: “There’s about 250,000 assaults on the streets a year. If we’re going to accuse other people of taking things out of context, we need to not do that. There are always going to be idiots and people who are evil or just plain stupid.”</p> \n<p>Others profess to see the hint of a connection, at least locally. Mark Strong, a transport consultant and cycling advocate in Brighton, says the debate about bikes in his home city has been increasingly toxic ahead of the wire-trap incidents, partly inflamed by the recently ousted Green-led council’s introduction of new bike lanes and parking restrictions.</p> \n<p>“There is an element of legitimisation towards dislike of cyclists from the attitudes of the press and politicians,” he says. “It’s almost an official endorsement to be anti-cyclist. And for everyone who thinks it’s now OK to shout at a cyclist, at the tip of the bell curve there will be somebody who think it’s OK to stretch wires across bike paths.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/aldred-rachel\">Rachel Aldred</a>, a Westminster University sociologist who studies transport issues, argues that British cyclists suffer because, unlike in countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark, bikes are seen as frivolous, compared with the serious, adult business of driving. She says: “It’s as if you’re doing something you shouldn’t be doing on the roads, almost like you’re playing in the street and getting in the way of the traffic, like you’re a child. There’s also this dual way you can be stigmatised as a cyclist – it was historically seen as something for people with no choice, but now it’s seen as something for people who have a choice. It’s a leisure or play thing that they shouldn’t be doing in this inappropriate place.”</p> \n<p>Aldred has also studied the environment cyclists face on the road, and her findings are alarming. In <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/11/female-cyclists-bad-driving-harassment-study-uk-women-men-near-miss\">a pioneering paper </a>published this month she finds cyclists experience on average one “very scary” incident involving another road user every week. Female riders suffer disproportionately more, thought to be because drivers are less patient with their slower average speeds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be44892e32680443df8bf6e54bfaec6d5c4e8b8a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/be44892e32680443df8bf6e54bfaec6d5c4e8b8a/0_696_4862_2919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman cycling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woman cycling.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Image Bank/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Do toxic anti-cyclist comments in newspapers or on social media contribute to this road environment? It’s impossible to prove. But some believe this is the case. “I’d be very surprised if that’s not happening,” says Walker. “It is acceptable to sit in a pub and say things like: ‘Bloody cyclists, we should run them off the road.’ Or to write things that are, literally, calling for murder. You can’t do that with other groups.”</p> \n<p>In 2013, <a href=\"http://opus.bath.ac.uk/37890/\">Walker led a study</a> that saw a co-researcher sent on to the roads on a bike in seven different outfits, with a gauge measuring the space drivers gave him overtaking. Four outfits made him look like a cyclist of varying experience, while three had bright yellow waistcoats with written messages. One read: “Novice cyclist: please pass slowly.” Another: “Polite: please slow down.” And finally: “Police: camera cyclist.”</p> \n<p>The data for 5,700 overtakes showed just one garb made an appreciable difference to driver behaviour: the one saying “police”. Here, the average passing distance was notably bigger, while the proportion of vehicles who passed very near the bike was significantly lower. In contrast, the tabard saying “polite” saw almost twice as many potentially dangerous passes.</p> \n<p>The lesson seems clear: drivers are perfectly able to distinguish between different types of rider, and to read the message. But rather than adjusting their driving to the cyclist’s apparent vulnerability, the only real trigger for them to take proper care is a possible legal sanction.</p> \n<p>Will things change? Bike campaigners hope London’s new network of segregated cycle “superhighways”, now being built, will increase the number of riders, and act as an example to other cities. Cycling as everyday transport, and cyclists whose progress is separated from that of motor vehicles, will, they hope, drain the poison from the debate.</p> \n<p>Such tangled considerations remain far from the mind of James, now back at work and again on the bike, though with a pedal-shaped chunk out of his thigh from his high-speed fall in South Wales: “It was the worst bike crash I’ve had by far, and all the more upsetting as it was nothing that I did. Perversely, I was quite lucky with the injuries I had. If this kind of sabotage continues, someone will get killed.”</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5befffe3bd8f3eb793c02c74178499b6524f450b/0_0_2582_1550/2582.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1550,"width":2582,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian imaging","altText":"Cyclist backlash","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian imaging"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f6b97f84a823fa1dbc35730a2070066120485805/0_0_2448_3264/2448.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3264,"width":2448,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Alec James after his crash at the Velothon Wales.

They are the conversational mainstay of fitness bores, who see food as fuel and wish meals came in pill form. <br /></p> \n<p>See, a “Nutriblast” is 50% greens, 50% whole fruits, plus a “boost” of seeds, nuts, matcha powder, unicorn shavings, whatever, all blitzed into an on-the-go meal replacement.

A sprig of mint for lift, and it’s a perfect summer refresher. Plus, a morning Nutriblast feels like finishing homework on Friday night: having got my five-a-day all at once, who’s to say I can’t just eat lollies for the rest of the day (apart from every nutritionist on the planet)? </p> \n<p>A blender this useful is too good to be co-opted by the spirulina snorters.

Here’s my list of five simple things good cooks almost always do, and that you should be doing if you want to cook better.</p> \n<h2><strong>Understand seasoning</strong></h2> \n<p>The easiest way to improve your cooking is to understand seasoning. In western cooking seasoning is often thought of as adding salt (and sometimes pepper), and in Asian cooking it’s finding a pleasant balance of salty, sweet, sour, bitter and umami flavours in a dish. Whatever your definition, just remember – don’t season to make food taste salty (or sweet, or sour etc), season to bring out the natural taste of your ingredients. Aside from salt, the most common seasonings I use (particularly in Asian cuisine) are soy sauce, rice vinegar, mirin, fish sauce and citrus juices.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cdb76dd343a586d9576f866fd4a16a92987a7ac\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435716240629/83b016f4-bccb-486f-8d9b-38a1f1c63edb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Salt and pepper shouldn't be your only seasoning options.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Salt and pepper shouldn’t be your only seasoning options.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Image Source</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Find the umami</strong></h2> \n<p>If you were confused by the word “umami” in the previous paragraph, let me set you straight: umami is the secret to making food taste good. It’s a taste perceived by your taste buds, just like saltiness or sweetness, and it’s everywhere. In Italy it’s in tomatoes and parmesan, France loves its stocks and jus, Vietnam can’t get by without fish sauce, and in Japan take your pick from kombu, miso or any of a dozen other sources of umami. Umami-rich foods are central to just about every cuisine in the world, and just a touch of any of these kinds of ingredients can be a big boost to flavour.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>Do you know where the umami in your food is coming from?<strong> </strong>Whenever I cook I always make sure that the dish has at least one source of umami, whether that umami is contained within the ingredients (browned meats, Chinese cabbage, kombu, parmesan, anchovies) or added as seasonings (miso, oyster sauce, fish sauce etc).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06ef0af8898018c864264a0863225925b2ff2207\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/06ef0af8898018c864264a0863225925b2ff2207/0_173_2500_1501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese food relies heavily on fish sauce. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vietnamese food relies heavily on fish sauce. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hoang Dinh Nam/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Sharpen your knife</strong></h2> \n<p>If you ask me what the best kind of knife is to have in the kitchen, my answer will always be “a sharp one”. Watch a butcher at work and you’ll see them honing their blade every few seconds, but yet at home some of us haven’t even sharpened our knives once since they came out of the box. There’s no point buying fancy knives if you’re not going to maintain them. A whetstone is best, but if you don’t know how to use one just get one of those wheel sharpeners and give your knife a few runs through it every day or two. How you cut your ingredients creates texture in your food, and it’s very hard to make good cuts with a blunt knife.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f293769a84966ee4e107b9394af118f695d937d1\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f293769a84966ee4e107b9394af118f695d937d1/0_55_5150_3089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"You’ve wasted your money on a fancy knife if you don’t sharpen it.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You’ve wasted your money on a fancy knife if you don’t sharpen it.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregor Schuster/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Make things from scratch</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>At some point in the past 50 years it’s like we all decided to trade taste for convenience, then promptly forgot we ever did it. Hardly anyone takes the time to make anything properly these days – we buy pre-made sauces, frozen meals, and pre-cut vegetables, and year by year the quality of our food gets worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even remember what good food tastes like anymore. <br /></p> \n<p>Joint your own chickens, slice your own vegetables, make jam or biscuits from scratch – it’s cheaper, it’s easier than you think, and it makes an incredible difference to flavour. At the very least, just throw some scraps into a pot and make your own stock, which brings me to …</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1f97ded87d9c8f6f9f6bc0892cbddd134055ce0e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/1f97ded87d9c8f6f9f6bc0892cbddd134055ce0e/0_76_5890_3536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joint your own chicken and then with the carcass, make your own stock. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joint your own chicken and then with the carcass, make your own stock. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Start with stock</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>Every good cook makes stock.

A short, sharp reminder that she can still be torn down at any moment. So it was at Glastonbury last weekend, when an audience member at Kanye West’s set chose to wave an enormous flag printed with a still image from a sex tape showing Kardashian performing oral sex on her former partner Ray J. The tape was leaked in 2007 <a href=\"http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20012494,00.html.\">without Kardashian’s consent</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/25/kanye-west-glastonbury-festival-2015-worlds-biggest-pop-star\">The enigma of Kanye West – and how the world's biggest pop star ended up being its most reviled, too</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kardashian, who is four months pregnant, was present, so she got to witness the moment the photo was displayed to her husband and a huge crowd of his fans. Printed on the flag were the words “Get Down, Girl, Get Head Get Down”, a play on the lyrics from West’s song Gold Digger. Luckily, a compassionate Twitter user immortalised the moment by posting a picture with a suitably disapproving caption:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JacobWTurner01/statuses/615070025079255041\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Someone printed kim k giving ray j head on a flag and waved it about as Kanye performed at Glastonbury ahahahaha <a href=\"http://t.co/QXrp1gedwL\">pic.twitter.com/QXrp1gedwL</a></p>— Jacob (@JacobWTurner01) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JacobWTurner01/status/615070025079255041\">June 28, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p> Many online were quick to share their glee, describing the flag as “the BEST Glastonbury flag ever”, “flag of the day”, “#BESTEVER”, “genius” and “hilarious”. The Lad Bible declared that it <a href=\" https://twitter.com/TheLadBible/status/615143949368471552\">“wins the internet”</a>. Just in case she hadn’t noticed the flag itself during her husband’s set, thoughtful users<a href=\"https://twitter.com/82BAnArsenalFan/status/615176002659074049\"> tweeted it into Kardashian’s mentions</a> to be sure the picture be waiting for her when she got home. </p> \n<p>The precise intent behind the stunt isn’t clear, though the idea that a man should be threatened or shamed by his partner’s past sexual history is as old as it is misogynistic. The use of West’s lyrics suggests it might have been intended to suggest that Kardashian is herself a gold digger, despite her own enormously successful media and business ventures. Is it possible that the flag waver was trying to make a point about sexism in West’s lyrics? At a stretch, yes. Is it likely? No. And even if that were the case, the ends wouldn’t justify the means, any more than they did when the person who threatened to leak naked photos of Emma Watson later claimed it was all in the name of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-emma-watson-nude-photo-leak-was-a-very-elaborate-hoax-9752810.html\">a campaign against the internet site 4Chan</a>. Thank goodness for these towering heroes of morality. </p> \n<p>Regardless of intent, the outcome was yet another very successful woman being reminded that no matter how high she climbs, she can always be torn down by a slut-shaming, misogynistic double standard. There are powerful echoes here of the blame and outrage directed at the victims of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/10/fbi-seizes-computers-in-hunt-for-celebrity-photo-hackers\">last year’s nude celebrity photo hacks</a>. These are women who we pressure to be hyper-sexualised when they are objects for public consumption, in magazines or films or on television. We love to squeal over their “barely there” dress or “plunging cleavage” when they’re walking the red carpet, packaged for an approving audience. But when they dare to take ownership of their own bodies, to have sexual agency, or even, heaven forbid, to enjoy sex for themselves, we are ready to scream shame and demand grovelling public apologies. What Kardashian was doing in that sex tape was private and consensual. The only piece of wrongdoing was the publication of the tape without her consent; one amplified by the flag bearer in revictimising her before a live audience. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/18/kim-kardashian-selfish-book-selfies\">Kim Kardashian's Selfish book snapped up by thousands</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> Though Kardashian is not the only A-lister to have suffered this publicising of her sexual past as a weapon against her, there are noticeable differences in the way she is treated. While there was an outpouring of sympathy and support for many of the photo hacking victims, it was noted at the time that there was a nasty streak of venom reserved particularly for Kardashian. </p> \n<p>There was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/11113789/Kim-Kardashian-naked-photo-leak-Why-the-hacking-of-Kim-Kardashian-deserves-our-sympathy.html \">a classist undertone of sneering</a>, as some suggested that she was “asking for it” because she often chooses to share revealing photographs with her fans, or that as a reality star she doesn’t really deserve to be treated as a celebrity. It is regularly suggested that she leaked the tape intentionally to find fame, though she <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/06/hulk_hogan_sues_gawker_celebrity_sex_tapes_used_to_thrill_us_now_they_trouble.single.html\">has made it very clear this was not the case</a>. </p> \n<p>It was the same classist sexism that saw the Duchess of Cambridge, pregnant with Prince George, praised for her pregnancy style and svelte silhouette, while Kardashian, pregnant at the same time with baby North, faced nasty memes comparing her to a whale, and <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2013/03/28/pregnant-kim-kardashian-succumbs-to-cravings-and-gorges-on-burger-and-chips-3564195/\">front-page stories about her “gorging” on fast food</a>. While the Duchess topped Vanity Fair’s<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2013/04/top-ten-best-dressed-pregnant-celebrities#1\">“best-dressed pregnant celebrities” list</a>, Kardashian<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2305066/Kate-Middleton-v-Kim-Kadashian-baby-bump-Duchess-Cambridges-maternity-style-oceans-apart.html\"> was described as “brash” and “trashy”</a>. </p> \n<p>We will praise women for being sexy, as long as it’s the right kind of sexiness. As long as they’re the right “kind” of woman. As long as they’re not in control. As long as we can remind them of their place at any moment.</p> \n<p>This wasn’t “banter”. This wasn’t a hilarious stunt. This was the very public shaming of a pregnant woman in front of her husband and a crowd of strangers. And if that sounds positively medieval, then it should tell you something about our “modern” attitudes towards women.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673442393/1b22908c-b8ac-4fa7-b26c-1bf046efeaff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lionel Cironneau/AP","altText":"Kim Kardashian … social media reacted with glee at the stunt.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Lionel Cironneau/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T15:06:46Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T15:36:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2150,"contributors":[{"name":"Laura Bates","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/3/1428058264790/Laura-Bates-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/laura-bates"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Kim Kardashian","Women","Celebrity","The Duchess of Cambridge","Life and style","Feminism","Glastonbury 2015","Kanye West","Glastonbury festival"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian","webTitle":"Kim Kardashian"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/celebrity","webTitle":"Celebrity"},{"id":"uk/duchess-of-cambridge","webTitle":"The Duchess of Cambridge"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"world/feminism","webTitle":"Feminism"},{"id":"music/glastonbury-2015","webTitle":"Glastonbury 2015"},{"id":"music/kanyewest","webTitle":"Kanye West"},{"id":"music/glastonbury","webTitle":"Glastonbury festival"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Laura Bates","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/laura-bates"}}],"series":{"title":"Laura Bates on everyday sexism","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/laura-bates-on-everyday-sexism"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a96k","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673442393/1b22908c-b8ac-4fa7-b26c-1bf046efeaff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kim Kardashian … social media reacted with glee at the stunt.

Go for small plates, refreshing ingredients and anything containing chilli, all washed down with salted lemonade</p>","byline":"Edward Smith","body":"<p>The default response to a Great British Heatwave is to pull tables and chairs outside, fire up the barbecue and pair the sunburnt lobster look with a charred meat feast. But we’re doing it all wrong. Because although we are drawn to al fresco dining, we should, in fact, be looking for shade and food that keeps us cool. You won’t find residents of countries with hot climates heading outside to eat a heavy meal; they seek little bites of cooling and refreshing ingredients. In the unlikely event that these temperatures are seen again, what can we learn from those with more experience? What should we be eating in the heat?</p> \n<p>Sarit Packer, one half of the Israeli chef/writer team behind the restaurant Honey &amp; Co in London, is adamant about eating light meals when temperatures soar. “I think the whole aspect of summer food in Israel is so different to the UK,” she says, noting that light, fresh salads and snacks are the way forward, and “occasionally you throw in a little grilled meat skewer or a few falafel balls”. Cold vine leaves with yogurt and mint “is the best midsummer snack ever”, she adds. Packer makes dolmades from scratch with pre-salted vine leaves in the Honey &amp; Co book, but describes them as “tortuous” to put together. Alternatively, pair good-quality bought stuffed vine leaves with a dip inspired by theirs <em>(see recipe below)</em>.</p> \n<p>The light bites thing makes sense. Eating large meals sends much of your blood to your stomach to help aid the digestion process. But in hot weather, it is better to have blood close to the surface of the skin to aid cooling – through the evaporation of sweat, if it’s really sticky.</p> \n<p>Grazing to stay cool might explain the appeal of meze in the Middle East and tapas in Spain. Of course, Spaniards have gazpacho as a weapon too: chef Jos&eacute; Pizarro reckons the “ice-coolness” of blitzed tomatoes and cucumbers is “the only thing that staves off the Extremaduran heat”. Is that, in part, because of the cucumber? This ingredient is a near-constant when thinking about refreshing dishes; all that water content helps us to hydrate, and, when it’s straight from the fridge, to keep the temperature down. Melon has similar qualities. Indeed, it is part of Packer’s “all-time favourite cooling salad” of ice-cold watermelon with feta and olive oil. Cantaloupe melons feature in many an Italian salad; many different varieties of the fruit are pressed into service in Thailand; and watermelons are mentioned again by Asma Khan, a Bengali cook who runs a pop-up restaurant in Soho, <a href=\"http://www.darjeeling-express.com/\">Darjeeling Express</a>.</p> \n<p>For Khan, <em>kakri</em> (Indian cucumbers) and watermelon sherbet are two things she would most regularly seek on a hot day in Kolkata. We should also cook dishes with chilli, she confirms, as the capsaicin within the peppers causes us to perspire and lose heat more easily. She refers to fresh dishes using plenty of herbs such as mint and basil as well as chilli, perhaps with yoghurt on the side, rather than rich, oily, classically British curries.</p> \n<p>If light meals, cooling ingredients and ingredients that warm us up yet chill us out aren’t enough, then the last resort for refreshment is surely a cold drink. I found bucket-sized G&amp;Ts infused with cinnamon bark and orange particularly good on a recent trip to Spain. But Kahn’s suggestion of <em>nimbu pani</em> – a salted lemonade – is probably a more sensible and hydrating suggestion.</p> \n<p>With all this in mind, could a light salad involving watermelon, cucumber, fresh herbs and chilli be the ultimate cooling dish? Served cold but with a definite kick, this Thai-style dish is certainly more appropriate for temperatures hovering around the 30s than a hotdog or burger. Khan’s <em>nimbu pani</em> also really hits the spot; the pinch of salt is superb.</p> \n<h2>Thai-style watermelon and cucumber salad</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"143153e3d2def3163f114e80ee161e358622aade\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/143153e3d2def3163f114e80ee161e358622aade/201_0_5559_3335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thai Watermelon and Cucumber Salad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Gordon/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong><em>(Serves 4)</em></strong><br /></p> \n<p><strong>1 tsp Sriracha chilli sauce</strong></p> \n<p><strong>4 tbsp fish sauce</strong></p> \n<p><strong>1 tsp grated ginger</strong></p> \n<p><strong>1 tsp granulated golden sugar</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Juice of 1 lime </strong></p> \n<p><strong>750g watermelon, cut into 3cm cubes</strong></p> \n<p><strong>200g cucumber, peeled and cut into pound-coin-thick crescents</strong></p> \n<p><strong>1 birdseye chilli, finely sliced</strong></p> \n<p><strong>10g fresh mint, rolled and chopped</strong></p> \n<p><strong>10g fresh basil (preferably Thai), torn</strong></p> \n<p><strong>25g toasted and roughly chopped salted peanuts</strong></p> \n<p>Ensure your ingredients are fridge-cold before preparing the salad.

Mix well and serve immediately, with the remaining herbs and nuts scattered over the top.
