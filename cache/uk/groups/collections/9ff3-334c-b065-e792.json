All this means is that I am extremely hairy and hate all men, both as individuals and collectively, with no exceptions. Nope. Not even Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen/Paul Hollywood/Ronnie Corbett/Trevor McDonald/David Attenborough or John Nettles circa Bergerac are good enough for me. </p> \n<p>I even hate Ban Ki-moon. It’s one thing to try to eradicate female genital mutilation and forced marriage, but Mrs Ban Ki-moon told me she can’t remember the last time her husband put the Hoover round. Or sprayed his own soiled pants with pre-wash Vanish. Feminism begins at home, Mr Ban, not at the UN. Huh! Ban Ki-hypocrite, more like.</p> \n<p>Feminists don’t like humour, except slapstick. Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Laurel and Hardy and Bottom are all very popular at feminist comedy nights. Anything that involves men being physically harmed always goes down very well with feminists. They also enjoy watching Tom and Jerry, Road Runner cartoons and war documentaries.</p> \n<p>Feminists never have sex and hate men opening doors for them, even into other dimensions.</p> \n<p>Christmas is banned in the “feminist community”, along with birthdays, wallpaper, nuance, giving people the benefit of the doubt and all music. Feminists only ever listen to one song, on a loop: kd lang’s Constant Craving.</p> \n<p>All feminists are lesbians. There is not a single heterosexual woman in the world who believes that women should have equal rights. Not one. If a feminist says she is heterosexual or bisexual or asexual, she is lying. They are all lesbians.</p> \n<p>Feminism is the sole cause of the recession, global warming, terrorism, pandemics, cancelled flights, volcanos, delayed trains and overly pedantic health and safety regulations. You can’t have hot drinks at work now because of feminism, or climb up small stepladders in libraries. You can’t eat a lobster without safety goggles now because of feminists. You can’t even open a door now because of all the feminists. You have to hurl yourself through plate-glass windows to get in and out of buildings now because of the feminists. All doors have been bricked up now because of feminists. It’s like the window tax of 1696 all over again, but with doors.<br /></p> \n<p>All feminists do all day is burn bras. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, without eating, sleeping or taking toilet breaks. A feminist would rather wet herself than leave a bra unburned. If you read the CV of a feminist, under “Occupation” it would say: “Bra-burner.” And under “Skills” it would say: “Very good at burning bras.” And under “Hobbies and interests” it would say: “Finding bras and burning them.”</p> \n<p>And under “My five-year plan” it would say: “To have burned loads of bras.” And under “My 10-year plan” it would say: “To have eliminated all the bras, by burning.”</p> \n<p>Feminists steal bras from wherever they can. From lingerie departments, barns and hay bales, the wardrobe department for The Benny Hill Show, the stage floor at a Tom Jones concert, milkmen’s pockets, James Bond’s glove compartment and Carry on Camping star Kenneth Williams’s face.</p> \n<p>Then they burn the brassieres in braziers, singing their politically correct nursery rhyme, which goes:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>Bra, bra, black sheep,</em></p> \n <p><em>Have you any bras?</em></p> \n <p><em>Yes, sir, yes, sir,</em></p> \n <p><em>Three bras full.</em></p> \n <p><em>One for the master,</em></p> \n <p><em>And one for the dame,</em></p> \n <p><em>And a tiny double-A one for the little girl who lives down the lane, who doesn’t need one yet, and won’t do for years to come, but who wants one because she saw an American Apparel advert, before it was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, for using gratuitous sexual imagery, involving underage-looking models on its website.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>That’s the end of the bra-burning bit now. Oh, did I mention? Feminists never actually burned bras “as a means of protest”. In 1968 and 1969, protesters demonstrated at the annual Miss America Beauty pageant in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The New York Radical Women were one of the earliest women’s lib groups in the country. They threw items they viewed as oppressive to women (high heels, girdles, women’s magazines, tweezers, bras, etc) into a “freedom trash can”. They applied for but didn’t get a permit from the police allowing them to burn the items (the protest was held on a wooden boardwalk), so they just binned everything instead.</p> \n<p>Nothing was ever burned. But the media said they burned everything and have been saying it ever since, and now twats and anti-feminists use the term “bra burners” as a way of trivialising the movement. Just thought I’d clear that one up.</p> \n<p>I am a feminist. This means I think that all men are rapists, without exception. Even paralysed men, who can only move one eyeball. All rapists. Even my seven-year-old son is a rapist, and that is how I introduce him to people. “Have you met my son? He’s seven. Rapist.” That’s what I think, because I am a feminist.</p> \n<p>Even dead men are rapists. A bit of soil and science doesn’t stop them. Mud and physics is just more bureaucratic nonsense for them to negotiate their way around, like CCTV cameras and sentencing.</p> \n<p>Even half the French language are rapists, all those masculine words, raping all the feminine ones. That’s what I think, because I am a feminist.</p> \n<p>Feminists never laugh at anything. They didn’t even laugh at that YouTube clip of babies in car seats going through tunnels that went viral. Or at that clip where someone called St Sanders has made Mick Jagger make funny noises. Even when Germaine Greer told her now legendary joke on feminist practice and post-structuralist theory, to a lecture hall filled with feminists, not a single feminist laughed. She even distorted her voice with helium and wore a funny Marx Brothers mask to encourage the feminists, but she got nothing at all.</p> \n<p>Mind you, she did mess up the punchline by forgetting it. And she got her Marxes mixed up. They were all probably trying to work out why Germaine Greer was doing a Joe Pasquale impression and was wearing a mask of a German revolutionary socialist.</p> \n<p>If a feminist is made to pull a cracker at Christmas, she quickly eats the joke so that she doesn’t have to tell it.</p> \n<p>Feminists only ever eat paper. Paper. And carpets.</p> \n<p>If a feminist is found to love her husband, enjoy cooking, having a facial or interacting with her own children, she is publicly flogged and thrown out of feminism by Julie Bindel and Julie Burchill, who go out undercover, posing as eyebrow-threaders, sugar daddies and John Nettles to try to trick us.</p> \n<p>So that’s feminism. I hope I’ve cleared that up for you.</p> \n<h2>What is a Tory feminist? </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70ad00a9b98843318ef9115f09c804c42cc5a974\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434985545766/46986582-163e-4aec-aba3-6febbc2d5321-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Theresa May.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tory feminist Theresa May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aenne Chene/Fawcett Society</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’m not entirely sure about women wearing a “This is what a feminist looks like” T-shirt. Or men, for that matter. It’s overstating the case a bit, isn’t it? It’s like wearing a T-shirt with “I am not a racist” on it. It makes me suspicious. I assume that most people’s default setting is feminist, until they do or say something that makes me think otherwise. If I went bowling with a friend, for example, and they took their coat off to reveal an “I am not a racist” T-shirt underneath, I don’t think I’d feel relieved at all. On the contrary, it would make me very on edge. I’d spend the whole night worried I was bowling with an ironic racist.</p> \n<p>A few years ago, because Tory feminists were in the papers all the time, talking about Tory feminism, it made me think about what Tory feminism was, which fed into the standup in my show War Donkey in Edinburgh in the summer of 2012. This is how it went:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“I’ve been trying to work out what a Tory feminist is, because I keep seeing photographs of female Tory MPs in the newspapers, wearing T-shirts with ‘This is what a feminist looks like’ on them. What, like a T-shirt? How can a T-shirt look like a feminist? A T-shirt looks like a T-shirt, doesn’t it? It should say, ‘This is what a T-shirt with “This is what a feminist looks like” written on it looks like.’</p> \n <p>That’s what it says on the front, anyway, of the Tory feminists’ T-shirts that they’re all wearing now. And on the back it says, ‘Not really, I’m a Tory, you gullible dick.’</p> \n <p>Then underneath that it says, ‘I axed the health in pregnancy grant. I closed Sure Start centres.’ That one’s got a smiley face next to it. ‘I cut child benefit and slashed tax credits. I shut down shelters for battered wives and children. I cut rape counselling and legal aid.’ Winking face.</p> \n <p>‘I cut funding for CCTV cameras and street lighting, making women much more vulnerable. I closed down all 23 specialist domestic violence courts. I cut benefits for disabled children.’ Sad face with sunglasses on. ‘I tried to amend the abortion act so that women receive one-to-one abortion counselling from the pope before they go ahead with it.’ Winking face with tongue out. The back is much longer than the front, by the way. It’s a tailcoat, basically. They’re wearing tailcoats.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Extracted from A Book For Her by Bridget Christie (Century, &pound;14.99, out on 2 July).

How could you say no?</p> \n<p>“If anything was difficult, it was having to schedule sex,” Brendan says. “You know: ‘Ugh, we have to do it now.’ Filling in a calendar was bothersome.”</p> \n<p>After sex, they had to fill in paperwork, recording all sorts of details for the <a href=\"https://cfhc.org/\">California Family Health Council</a> (CFHC), America’s top testing facility for experimental condoms: whether they were both sober, which partner put the condom on, what positions they took, if the condom made any noise, if pubic hair snagged, how long they lasted, if either had an orgasm (and how many), if anyone felt pain. Plus the obvious: how far the condom came down the penis. “It was a bit strange writing down the amount of time we had sex for. ‘Are we good at having sex or bad at having sex?’” Christina says. Was the paperwork a mood-killer? “Somewhat, but it’s not the worst mood-killer we’ve encountered,” Brendan says.</p> \n<p>Christina and Brendan, both 33, live in a house share in LA: she is an as-yet unpublished novelist, he is trying to make it as an actor. Christina had previously volunteered as a subject in a medical study that required her to lie in a hospital bed, donating blood, receiving intravenous drugs. “That made me feel like much more of a lab rat,” she says. “This time I felt as if I was actually doing something. It felt as if our opinions actually mattered.”</p> \n<p>Brendan and Christina are part of an accelerating race for better 21st-century contraception, perhaps among the closest to understanding what future safe sex might look and feel like. The bottom line is, there are problems with the condom: while it is 98% effective when used correctly, it is hugely unpopular – worn by an estimated 5% of men worldwide. This is a fatal flaw in developing countries, where an HIV diagnosis remains a death sentence, due to the high cost of antiretroviral drugs. Condom design, almost unchanged in 120 years, is ripe for a makeover.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/12/condoms-stop-me-reaching-orgasm-sex\">Condoms stop me reaching orgasm</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In 2013, Bill and Melinda Gates announced that <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation\">their Foundation</a> was making condom innovation a priority (alongside toilets, vaccines and neonatal care): they offered a $100,000 grant to any team with a strong proposal for a “<a href=\"http://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/Explorations/Topics/Pages/NextGenerationCondomRound11.aspx\">next generation condom</a> that significantly preserves or enhances pleasure, in order to improve uptake and regular use”.</p> \n<p>The Foundation received more than 800 submissions, which in 2013 they narrowed down to <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/11-innovative-condoms-awarded-grants-2013-11?IR=T\">11 winners</a>, announcing a further 11 winners of the grant in 2014. The successful proposals ranged from those using Nobel prizewinning materials (<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2013/nov/26/graphene-molecule-potential-wonder-material\">graphene</a>) to those with built-in applicators or lubricant. The Gates Foundation also gave money to simple behavioural studies, and to a shrink-to-fit condom dreamed up by the CFHC. Those proposals are now able to apply for phase two funding of up to $1m each – the winners will be announced later this year, with only a handful likely to be successful.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile many of them are in the testing phase. To be enrolled in an official “breakage and slippage” study for the CFHC, you need to have been in a monogamous relationship for at least six months. The woman also needs to be on the pill or have an IUD, to ensure she won’t become pregnant. (Unless it’s an “efficacy” study, in which case you have to be monogamous but happy to accept the chance of getting a baby out of the study instead of a $100 cheque.)</p> \n<p>Couples have sex for the CFHC between three and eight times with the experimental condom, then the same number of times with a placebo (a regular condom, still in its branded wrapping, which somewhat spoils the “double blind” study pretence). Immediately after the earth has moved (or even if the session ended disappointingly, with a lost erection or broken prototype), each of them studiously fills in a detailed questionnaire.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3c1efb15511e8a6d1269d15a60c817fec68b67e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434021936152/a3a93cd6-3a1b-4fe8-ab2b-ecdb3d165e98-460x349.jpeg\" alt=\"condom testers Christina Pederson and Brendan Weinhold\" width=\"460\" height=\"349\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’s not the worst mood-killer we’ve encountered’: condom testers Christina Pederson and Brendan Weinhold.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Schofield for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Brendan and Christina had been married for 10 years when they started testing, and had seldom used condoms. Christina had only ever been with Brendan. And, to my surprise, the other California condom testers I spoke to had also only had sex with each other. Could they really be the best judges?</p> \n<p>Amy and Max Hurwitz met in college and signed up to a CFHC study in their first year of dating. “Getting paid to have sex? Um, yes!” says Amy, over coffee in their West Hollywood apartment. Married with no children, they are an attractive couple: Max resembles a wholesome Clark Kent; Amy, young with curly brown hair, does most of the talking – which is fitting, as she did most of the testing work: inserting the rings, wearing diaphragms, sporting the cumbersome female condom. “We always thought of it as a good deed,” she says. “We called it ‘sex for science’. And because it was science, we always followed the rules – we weren’t going to fuck up science!”</p> \n<p>What has been their least favourite test? The female condom, by far. The best? The IUD. They disagree on an ultra-thin, polyurethane condom, which Max describes as “bag-like”. “It wasn’t terrible, it would have been an acceptable option,” he says. “But it had this weird texture.”</p> \n<p>“See, I liked it,” interjects Amy, “because it was clear and I could actually see his penis.”</p> \n<p>The couple have pooled the money they earn doing studies – $100 each per trial – into a savings account, earmarked for vacations. And there has been another unexpected bonus: normal sex has become even more thrilling. “You have to wait three days after unprotected sex to have condom trial sex – so we found ourselves thinking, a lot of the time, ‘Are we going to have Study Sex, or Sex Sex?’ It felt a little bit naughty.”</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>A 90-minute drive from Los Angeles, under bright studio lights, inventor and Gates Foundation grant winner Danny Resnic is working on a prototype that he hopes will revolutionise the condom. A solid grey, bullet-like phallus, ribbed vertically like a pleated skirt and nicknamed the Master, hangs above a mould, a white rectangular block of silicone with a circular hole at one end; the interior is a mirror image of the grey master.</p> \n<p>“When I first said two decades ago that I was inventing new kinds of condoms, people asked: what could be different?” Resnic says. “Nobody was capable of imagining anything else. We are all so accustomed to one concept, we haven’t challenged it. But consumers are looking for something that is safe, and that actually addresses their need for pleasure.”</p> \n<p>The reason we haven’t seen anything like this from the main condom manufacturers (Trojan, Durex, Skyn, Okamoto and Ansell, who account for 96% of the market), Resnic believes, is that the “oligopoly” has no incentive to change. They already control the market. “True change is going to have to come from outside the industry,” he says. “From the mavericks.”</p> \n<p>There have been several over the years: Dutch inventor Jan Vinzenz Krause caused a stir when he announced a “spray-on” latex version in 2006, inspired by the mechanics of a car wash. (The main problem: it took five minutes to dry, which was a mood killer.) Last year the designers of the <a href=\"http://galacticcap.com/\">Galactic Cap</a> – an elfin latex hat that fits over the tip of the penis – raised more than $100,000 on Indiegogo, and plan to release it in 2017.</p> \n<p>Resnic talks me through what he believes will be the condom of the future, an eccentric shape that has taken him more than 25 years to develop. Made of thick yellow latex, it resembles a squeaky dishwashing glove more than a condom. Yet, at this very moment, 28 South African couples – half heterosexual, half male homosexual – are road-testing his design. He’s testing it there, Resnic says, because the approval process was quicker and easier than in the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d75a86d6f17de3579ea3b40327015bd44e8e1cd2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434017649394/7a4b3de7-eab4-4c9f-9997-7c9543eb064b-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"condom designer Danny Resnic\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danny Resnic with his vision of the future: the Origami Internal Condom, an eccentric shape it has taken him more than 25 years to develop.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Schofield for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Flaring out like a trumpet, <a href=\"http://www.origamicondoms.com/#!female-condom/cxt7\">Resnic’s Origami Internal Condom</a> comes in both “male” and “female” versions, and if it passes the grade, it will become the world’s first device explicitly approved for anal sex. Resnic is talking to me in the lounge of his LA condo on a bright morning. Tall, bald, with flawless straight white American teeth, wearing casual slacks and a collared red cotton shirt (this counts as business attire in LA), he pulls out a heavy black suitcase containing his prototype.</p> \n<p>Using a veiny purple dildo, a translucent white Fleshlight (a masturbation toy about the size and shape of a torch, with a squishy interior) and a healthy amount of lubricant, Resnic illustrates how the condom would remain in place even with vigorous thrusting. When the superintendent of the building knocks on the door mid-demonstration, the familiar exchange suggests the super has seen this before.</p> \n<p>A former art book publisher and interior designer, Resnic first conceived of a very ribbed super-strong condom 20 years ago. He had watched the love of his life and his best friends die of Aids in the 1980s, and had adopted diligent safe sex practices. But in 1993, a condom broke during sex and he, too, contracted HIV.</p> \n<p>Condom breakage is rare: around four in 1,000 uses. Resnic was not just terrified, he was angry. How could he have used the best device available and still be handed what felt like a death sentence? “I had the idea for the Origami condom before I contracted HIV – but the diagnosis really gave me the motivation to pursue it,” he says. “I thought: there must be a better way to create safe sex.”</p> \n<p>Twenty-five years and $2.5m later, he’s nearly there. “If I had known then what I do now, I’m not sure I would have seen the idea through to the end,” he admits. “I honestly thought it would take a couple of years when I started.”</p> \n<p>But he couldn’t let go of the idea of a safe condom that enhances pleasure: a contraceptive that doubles as a sex toy – something that would make sex with a condom <em>better </em>than sex without one. “Having sex with a traditional condom is like trying to taste a lollipop with <a href=\"http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blsaranwrap.htm\">saran wrap</a> on your tongue,” he says, handling a latex condom. “It’s just never going to feel amazing.”</p> \n<p>Resnic went through many iterations. His idea was that the condom should have some movement, independent from the penis. His first models were folded like accordions, conjuring visions of sophisticated Japanese paper models.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Having sex with a traditional condom is like trying&nbsp;to taste a lollipop with clingfilm on your tongue</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>An earlier Origami condom, with its male and female versions, was pleated horizontally rather than folded and made from silicone, designed to move up and down the penis (conventional latex condoms stay put). Tests found that 67% of couples liked using the Origami female condom, compared with just 16% for the female condoms on the market. The latest version of the Origami condom has thick lengthwise ribs, which Resnic says will be more pleasurable than traditional ribbed condoms (which are ribbed horizontally), as they push against the flesh. “The pleats create reciprocating motion by buckling and unbuckling,” he explains. “The fluting allows for tissue to move within these grooves. With the penis pushing against it, you get this yin and yang thing going on.”</p> \n<p>Recently, he has made his most dramatic change: a switch from silicone to thick, opaque latex. Silicone turned out to be “too bulky”, and the latex condoms can be made by dip-moulding, which is much cheaper than injection moulding when it comes to mass production.</p> \n<p>Will Resnic’s otherworldly, ribbed, buckling and gripping design prove the breakthrough that the Gates are looking for? Will men who dislike clothing their erections in thin sleeves of latex prefer thick ribbed chambers? Handling Resnic’s sturdy, opaque, beige sleeve – so thick it can stand upright – feels distinctly unerotic, but my hands are not the body part that the Origami condom will need to please. Sadly, Resnic won’t let me take a prototype home – I’m not taking part in a clinical trial, and this isn’t yet approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But Resnic himself has used them, and assures me they do feel better than sex with a regular condom – and even better than sex without one.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Resnic has his detractors. He has been accused, in a series of articles on the rightwing Washington Free Beacon, of misspending his funding; <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/issues/origami-condom-inventor-has-to-pay-back-taxpayer-funds/\">the site has claimed</a> he is being investigated by the National Institutes of Health. According to the Beacon, a former employee of Resnic’s has provided them with proof that he spent his funding on plastic surgery, trips to <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/travel/costarica\">Costa Rica</a> and the Playboy mansion, plus a condo in Provincetown. Resnic denies the allegations, and tells me the spending is due to a case of credit card fraud involving an ex-employee which, after a counter suit, he decided to drop. “The district attorney determined that the stolen money had all been spent by [the employee] and we decided to drop the expensive civil case when there was no chance to recover any funds,” Resnic says.</p> \n<p>His design has its critics, too. “The Origami condom really is more of a sex toy that is inserted into somebody – as though you could stare your partner in the eyes while masturbating inside them,” says Mark McGlothlin, president of Apex Medical Technologies, whose lab is two and a half hours’ drive from Resnic’s, in San Diego. McGlothlin has worked in condom science for 35 years. “That doesn’t mean it’s bad sex,” he says of Resnic’s condom, “but it’s not the same thing. The point of a condom is to mimic natural intercourse.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2014/oct/23/sex-education-statutory-requirement-bill\">‘Today we’re talking masturbation’: sitting in on a sex education class</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Apex is another Gates Foundation winner. His, like almost every other team, is trying not to reinvent the wheel, but to make it lighter and sleeker, with materials that are thinner but stronger than latex. While some are going hi-tech (University of Oregon chemists are working with polyurethane, University of Manchester scientists with graphene), Apex is going back to basics with collagen, giving animal intestines a makeover.</p> \n<p>Lambskin condoms, fashioned from the intestines of slaughtered animals, have been used for centuries: the oldest sheep gut condom, recovered from a latrine in Dudley Castle in the West Midlands, was dated to around 1646. Today’s versions (such as <a href=\"http://www.trojancondoms.com/naturalamb.aspx\">Naturalamb</a>, available from chemists and online) are still fashioned from intestine, but sanitised with modern chemistry. They don’t account for a huge slice of the market and are used by those with latex allergies or who prefer the feel of genuine flesh over synthetic latex. McGlothlin thinks they are “disgusting”. “They stink like they came from an animal and they look like they came from an animal. Yet they still have wonderful properties.” The collagen in the skin, for instance, has far better heat transfer and water content properties than latex. People who use lambskin report that they do indeed feel more natural, but they are expensive, averaging &pound;4 each, and – more damagingly – are considered too porous to protect against HIV.</p> \n<p>Instead of using lambskin, McGlothlin’s proposal is to “upcycle” beef waste into reconstituted collagen. By grinding animal hide through a series of high-powered blenders and chemically treating the fluffy white fibres with a variety of plasticisers, surfactants and wetting agents, he is perfecting a condom that meets all the criteria: tactile, cheap and ready for the assembly line.</p> \n<p>On paper, it sounds perfect: thoughtfully traditional yet hi-tech, and made of recycled materials. Unless you’re a vegetarian, is there anything else you could want from a condom? In Apex’s sunny San Diego lab, handling the prototypes, I could feel the creases in my fingers and tiny bumps on my skin through the condom. And it did not smell or look as if it came from an animal. Apex’s offices, housed in a sunny industrial park 25 miles from the Mexican border, look like those of any other business, stacked with full ring binders, photocopy machines, strip lighting and desks overflowing with paperwork. But the labs next door, where the tinkering takes place, house all kinds of condom gadgetry crafted to put new designs through their paces, from pumps used to inflate condoms with air to test their strength, to a phallic mould made of pure Teflon; there is a “Coital Model” that tests condoms with the highest degree of accuracy before they come into contact with real human genitals.</p> \n<p>“We keep this under a cardboard box, because it might seem a bit obscene to our visitors,” says senior development engineer Scott Herrick, as he reveals a large and veiny plastic dildo on an air-powered pump, positioned across from a bright pink Fleshlight mounted on white plastic. Any experimental condom needs to undergo thousands of mechanical copulations before it’s considered safe enough for the real deal. Revved up, the simulator tests for strength. “How many thrusts do you think you get in one typical act?” Herrick says. A back-of-the envelope calculation: 300. “We want to be sure any prototypes we make are able to hold up and also to be able to compare them to other commercially available condoms. So we work with 500 thrusts, simulating a minimum of 13 minutes – somewhat of a guess, but probably not too far off.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7f0ab462514d6f0da1df93af5875acdf5131d024\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434040459917/babb39bf-2220-44e8-b83d-e7058317fa0d-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"condom tester\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Any experimental condom needs to undergo thousands of mechanical copulations before it’s considered safe enough for the real deal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Schofield for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It turns out that most condoms rip because the tip has worked its way down one side of the penis, until the pressure tears it. During the test I see, this condom remains resolutely in place as the coital replicator thrusts the dildo in and out of the Fleshlight, the air-powered pumps making an audible accompaniment, a bit like a steam engine. Herrick and I settle into a comfortable silence, enthralled by the spectacle.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>After years of being drip-dried on to dildos, scrutinised with tweezers and plunged thousands of times into a mushy imitation vagina, nascent condoms enter the main event: the bedroom. More than 25,000 couples are registered with the CFHC to test condoms, penis caps, a huge variety of polymers, hormone implants, contraceptive rings, pills, gels and every other form of contraceptive weaponry in their arsenal.</p> \n<p>“This is probably the weirdest thing we’ve worked with,” says Ron Frezieres, vice-president of research and evaluation at the CFHC. Standing on the fourth floor of an ordinary office block in downtown LA, he is holding up a pair of striped black knickers with an internally-fixed condom. The full-pelvis prophylactics – more chastity belt than sex aid – were designed by a Hawaiian woman who suffered from extreme herpes, ensuring any lover would not come into contact with her skin.</p> \n<p>The CFHC is also developing its own new condom with Gates funding. Its design is a polyethylene condom, not stretchy and thick, but firm and thin. Technical description: “ultra sheer wrapping condom”. Or somewhat like clingfilm. “Our manufacturer has begged us, ‘Oh God, don’t compare it to saran wrap – people will think we’re making sandwich wrappers’,” Frezieres says.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The big idea is to embed the super-material graphene into condoms, making them much thinner and stronger</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Unlike most new designs – modelled on the old roll-on concept – polyethylene condoms are not taut and phallic, but baggy. A bit roomy, they truly are one-size-fits-all, clinging and wrapping instead of squeezing and constricting. They are very thin, about a quarter of the thickness of latex, and the polymer is less likely to degrade in hot climates, such as warehouses in India, Africa and South America, where latex condoms have been known to break down.</p> \n<p>The donning method is easier: you roll it on like a sock using two pull tabs. “Zip and it’s on,” Frezieres says. No fumbling and fussing, no arousal-killing dithering – and a godsend if you live in an area without electric lights. Putting condoms on inside out (making them more likely to come off) is a serious issue in developing countries hit hardest by the HIV epidemic. Innovative, cheap and practical, is the CFHC design the Gates’s silver bullet?</p> \n<p>“In all our years of research with condoms, we have learned that there is no silver bullet,” Frezieres says. “Some like them clear, others go for coloured, some prefer bumps, others like them ribbed. There’s so much variation in taste. Some even like flavoured condoms. I don’t know what the magic mix is, but I don’t think there is one single solution. The great challenge is to develop a bunch of new and creative ideas that push the entire field forwards.”</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Pushing the field forwards sounds all well and good, but designs face several hurdles, from the sketchbook to the chemist, and not least the strict EU and US FDA safety regulations, some of which seem somewhat outdated. For example, a condom needs to be able to hold 16 litres of air before bursting. Apex’s collagen condoms fail this test. Is Herrick concerned that they won’t be what the FDA wants? “The FDA will only readily approve designs that meet the standards for latex condoms, which simply might not apply. Why should a non-stretchable condom have to hold 16 litres of air?”</p> \n<p>The product also needs to be equivalent to another device already on the market. “Don’t invent something that will contradict the current standards – and it will be a decade before the standards change.” Resnic sighs. “In my opinion, making something that is similar to existing products isn’t the definition of innovation.”</p> \n<p>One of Gates’s finalists isn’t redrawing the condom at all. “We decided not to use our money to develop our original condom design, but to do behavioural research in sub-Saharan Africa, to see what would really be practical for people in the places most hard-hit by HIV,” says Ben Strutt, head of design at the <a href=\"http://www.cambridge-design.co.uk/news-and-articles/articles/balancing-design-and-engineering-expertise\">Cambridge Design Partnership</a>. “There are so many practical reasons why it’s not easy to just drop thousands of condoms into the region and expect the epidemic to go away,” he says, talking to me on the phone from his laboratory. “Women don’t carry handbags, for example, so how can you expect them to have condoms with them at all times? We were faced with the decision of carrying on with our narrow, technology-focused approach – or to create a solution that is more realistic. Sometimes people become too attached to their idea because it’s their baby, their sacred cow. Sometimes you need to look at the bigger picture, and put the sacred cow down.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2663d1550870dab0e1a3dee161a5a17443494130\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434018589130/76a601b3-bd7b-4b76-872f-cbde95f27e1d-460x368.jpeg\" alt=\"making non-latex condoms\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glass moulds are dipped into a liquid beef compound, then dried, to make non-latex condoms.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Schofield for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Cambridge team is looking at 18 different prophylactic concepts in order to create a “holistic condom solution”. They have brought on board a specialist in the Japanese affective design philosophy of kansei, or considering the emotional aspects of a product as well as the functional. “Whatever we create can’t just be functional – it has to be deeply sensory as well,” Strutt says. “It can’t be greasy, oily, thick, or something that destroys the moment.”</p> \n<p>There have been some spectacular failures when it comes to this approach. A decade ago, there was an enthusiastic rush to create <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2005/nov/25/outlook.development3\">microbicides</a>: HIV-killing gels. The supposed holy grail of prophylactics, these would put women in control, and could be discreetly inserted like a thick lubricant. But <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2009/dec/14/anti-hiv-gel-trial-failure\">they proved ineffective</a>, and in some trials actually worsened HIV infection rates. At the University of Manchester, the big idea is to use graphene, the super material composed of only the element carbon that won Manchester-based scientists Andre Geim and Kostantin Novoselov the <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/\">Nobel prize in physics in 2010</a>. (Graphene is composed of the same element as diamonds and graphite, only arranged in a flat honeycomb lattice configuration.)</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jan/10/why-do-men-fake-orgasms\">Why do men fake orgasms? | Nichi Hodgson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/aravind/\">Dr Aravind Vijayaraghavan</a>, a lecturer in nanomaterials, initiated a research group to apply for Gates funding to investigate embedding graphene into regular latex condoms. The idea is that it would allow them to be made much thinner (graphene is just one atom thick) as well as stronger. Adding graphene to condoms won’t jack up the price by more than 10 or 20%: “It’s not like we’re adding gold,” Vijayaraghavan says. But what the condom actually feels like or looks like, he will not divulge. A patent is pending.</p> \n<p>Which of these new designs is most likely to disrupt the industry? William Potter is a British condom consultant who has overseen development in the R&amp;D departments of major condom manufacturers since 1985. “There’s a huge amount going on at the moment,” he says, talking on the phone from his office in Cambridge. “But most of it is kept strictly confidential – the industry isn’t keen to publicise what it’s been doing because there is so much competition.”</p> \n<p>The Gates initiative has galvanised awareness, he says, but there are many other schemes that get less attention. Personally, he is excited about one development on the horizon: a condom embedded with an anti erection-loss chemical, Zanifil. (This has been designed by a commercial manufacturer, for whom Potter is consulting.)</p> \n<p>What does he make of the Gates Foundation’s mavericks? “The initiative has succeeded in bringing in new ideas and more speculative projects than the industry would have been capable of or willing to support. Whether or not that is a good idea, we will have to wait and see.”</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Back in Glendale, southern California, I ask another condom-testing couple what they have learned from their years of homework. Tina and Don (not their real names) met in high school, have been together for 20 years and married for 10. The testing has been pretty good, they say, except for the female condom. “They are terrible and deserve their reputation,” Don says. “It’s like having sex with an artificial entity instead of a human being.”</p> \n<p>Tina? “It makes loud rustling noises. It slips in and out. It leaves an unsightly baggy ring outside you. There is nothing erotic about it.”</p> \n<p>But overall the trials have spiced things up. With jobs and two children, now aged five and seven, the couple found that sex was always falling to the bottom of their to-do list. After a day of work, picking the kids up from karate, cooking dinner and doing the laundry, intimacy was not a priority. Being guinea pigs – with “free birth control, the opportunity to contribute to science and get paid for it” – brought it back into the forefront of their minds.</p> \n<p>“Sure, it took away from the spontaneity – but we had more sex overall,” Tina says. “And especially when the trials had deadlines.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Zoe Cormier is the author of Sex, Drugs And Rock’n’Roll, published by Profile Books at &pound;12.99.

Half of women aged 16 to 21 would consider cosmetic surgery.</p> \n<p>Demand for cosmetic vaginal surgery has increased fivefold in the past 10 years; almost all women referred for this have genitalia that fit within a normal/expected range of size.</p> \n<p>I’m not judging those women. It is their vagina and they can do whatever they like with it, but I’m just going to offer up my alternative to surgery. I organised a naming ceremony for it. No one came. I burned some geranium oil and we shared a ham and tomato sandwich. I’ve felt much better about Brian ever since, and every man I’ve shown Brian to since that naming ceremony (mainly comedy critics and awards panel judges and bookers and promoters and comedy photographers and agents and TV commissioners who work in comedy) has felt better about it too.</p> \n<p>Labial surgery is like pollarding a tree. All the birds’ nests have gone, and the plastic carrier bags, and the wood pigeons. They go from being the trees of life to barren sticks. Leave them alone.</p> \n<p>Thirty per cent of female students aged 18 to 65 would be prepared to die younger for a “perfect” body; 10% were willing to trade between two and five years of life. And 1.6 million people in the UK are estimated to currently suffer from some form of eating disorder; 89% of these are female.</p> \n<p>Now those are the facts. But look. I’ve got two webbed toes on my right foot. Not fully webbed, just half webbed. It’s a family thing. I’m from a family of ducks. And we’re all very proud of our webbed feet. And yet, with these feet, I have managed to live a full and varied life. I even managed to have two children. Well, ducklings. I call them children. In many ways, not just psychologically, I’m damaged goods. And yet here I am, writing this (not with my toes, though. I am using my unwebbed fingers).</p> \n<p>The only thing I’ve had done is gum surgery. But that was because I was mugged and got my teeth knocked out (by a man! So we can add teeth-smashing to the list as well), so they needed a bit of straightening out. It wasn’t because I’d succumbed to the relentless bombardment of unrealistic images of women’s gums in the media.</p> \n<p>And I’m a mum now. My body doesn’t need to be perfect, it just needs to work. As long as I can pick up my children, throw them into a bin and run away really quickly, that’s all that matters. And I can’t do that with enormous mattress-filled breasts, bound feet or convalescing labia.</p> \n<p>If we don’t start valuing ourselves as more than just a commodity, and stop basing all our happiness and success on how we look, all the progress we’ve made will be a complete waste of time. What’s the point in holding up a mirror to female oppression if we can’t even look in it ourselves?</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Extracted from A Book For Her by Bridget Christie (Century, &pound;14.99, out on 2 July).

The headache was bad enough, but the nausea and lethargy made you feel as if you had been poisoned. Yet, when you had done the same thing two months before, it hadn’t felt this bad, even though you had drunk the same amount of wine and avoided the usual culprits (the spirits, such as brandy and whisky, with their particularly toxic chemicals). What was worse, your friend, who drank even more than you, felt fine. The usual excuse is to blame the after-effects on bad luck, or your genes, but could there be other culprits?</p> \n<p>Hangovers occur due to the side-effects of the chemical produced when alcohol is broken down. Alcohol itself is fairly harmless – but enzymes convert it to acetaldehyde, which does&nbsp;the damage. The longer the acetaldehyde hangs around, the worse you and your liver feel. Other enzymes help to clear the acetaldehyde away, but the rates at which both happen are extremely variable in different people.</p> \n<p>Many east Asian people carry a&nbsp;mutation in a gene that increases the&nbsp;speed at which acetaldehyde is formed. This means that, compared with Caucasians, they suffer more side-effects from boozing, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_flush_reaction\" title=\"\">flushing</a> and nausea. There are also more subtle gene variants that alter how much acetaldehyde an individual can produce and how fast they can eliminate it.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25098862\" title=\"\">A study of more than 4,000 twins in Australia</a> has shown that susceptibility to hangovers has a major genetic component. Other twins studies have shown that liking or disliking the taste of alcohol, the amount of drinking, and alcohol addiction are strongly heritable traits. So clearly the <a href=\"http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa18.htm\" title=\"\">genes that control these enzymes are important</a> – but they are not the whole story.</p> \n<p>Last year, <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096864\" title=\"\">a US study explored for the first time what binge drinking did to our microbes</a>. Twenty-five healthy volunteers who were not regular drinkers were given a wine glass of vodka. There was a wide variety in response: those with the worst symptoms and changes in blood tests had the highest levels of toxins coming from the cell walls of their gut microbes. These toxins (called LPS) had somehow leaked out of their intestines, as a result of the inflammation the alcohol had produced. Within their guts the alcohol produced a brief, but large increase in the microbe species that were pro-inflammatory, stimulating the immune system as if it were under attack and contributing to the general sick-feeling so typical of hangovers.</p> \n<p>Population studies, such as the American gut project, show that low to moderate alcohol intake can actually increase your microbial diversity, which is usually beneficial for your health. One of my own researchers (I’m&nbsp;a professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London) diligently experimented on her own microbes by&nbsp;drinking three pints of beer each evening for five days. Her 5,000 or so gut microbes overall did not change, but a few species increased markedly –&nbsp;one relatively unknown one called <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23606477\" title=\"\">Erysipelotrichia</a> increased five-fold. When she looked at its possible function from its genes, she found it could produce alcohol dehydrogenase – the enzyme that breaks down alcohol to acetaldehyde. So, as she was drinking her beer and feeling increasingly tired and lethargic, her alcohol-loving microbe species were busy reproducing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/apr/03/how-to-cope-with-if-not-cure-your-public-holiday-hangover-with-food\">How to cope with, if not cure, your public holiday hangover with food</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So, drinking too much alcohol actually causes toxins to be released from our microbes, as well as growing more microbe-loving alcohol species. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22405477\" title=\"\">Studies have also shown</a> that when mice are fed these toxins, they seek out more alcohol than normal mice, suggesting that the microbes, via their toxins, could actually be encouraging us to seek out even more alcohol and – worryingly – even lead to addiction.</p> \n<p>If our microbes are part of the problem – what happens if we eliminate them? Experiments making mice binge-drink like humans produced signs of liver damage – again because of the toxins, leaky gut and inflammation. <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/14/240\" title=\"\">When the researchers repeated the experiment</a> in mice lacking microbes, they found no evidence of liver damage. Going back to their normal binge-drinking mice, the scientists tried feeding them a high-fibre diet (enriched with pectin found in apples) as well as alcohol shots, and compared this to a low-fibre diet. The high-fibre-fed mice amazingly had virtually no obvious side-effects from the alcohol on their livers. <a href=\"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(14)00097-6/abstract\" title=\"\">Similar preventive effects were seen</a> on mice given probiotics containing beneficial microbes such as&nbsp;lactobacillus, found in cheese and yoghurt. Even <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25239591\" title=\"\">saturated fat counteracted the harmful effects</a> of the alcohol on microbes.</p> \n<p>Although the jury is still out on whether drinking small amounts regularly is beneficial, overdoing alcohol is obviously bad for you. It causes major disruption to your gut microbes directly – and heavy drinkers also tend to have poor diets. Liver damage is now on the increase, particularly in children and young women. As diverse a diet as possible is the best insurance to maximise your range of microbial species and therefore your immune defences.</p> \n<p>Now when you wake up feeling unwell after a night out, you can blame your microbes as well as your pushy friends. But the microbes could also be part of the solution. If you are still keen on binge-drinking occasionally, at least start the evening with a slab of smelly cheese or a glass of high-fat natural yoghurt and let your microbes reduce some of the pain and suffering.

You can look at some of the original documents that were created at the time when these people were living. They are the earliest records detailing people who were formerly enslaved. We get a sense of their voice, their dreams.”</p> \n<p>Gentry also said it could help people now find living relatives on their family tree, as well as records of forebears.</p> \n<p>“I predict we’ll see millions of living people find living relatives they never knew existed. That will be a tremendous blessing and a wonderful, healing experience,” Gentry said.</p> \n<p>The Freedmen’s Bureau made records that include marriages and church and financial details as well as full names, dates of birth and histories of slave ownership.</p> \n<p>They have been available for access by the public in Washington, but only in person by searching through hundreds of pages of handwritten documents.</p> \n<p>The project to put the documents online is a collaboration involving the Smithsonian, the National Archives, the Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society, the California African American Museum and FamilySearch. The last-named body is a large online genealogy organisation run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints – otherwise known as the Mormon church, based in Salt Lake City.</p> \n<p>Volunteers will help to digitise the handwritten records and they will be added to the website as they become available. The website is <a href=\"http://www.discoverfreedmen.org\">discoverfreedmen.org</a>.</p> \n<p>The announcement was made by FamilySearch and some of the project partners in Los Angeles on Friday, the 150th anniversary of “Juneteenth”, the oldest known celebration of the ending of slavery which commemorates 19 June 1865, the day when it is believed that the last slaves held in US ownership were told of their emancipation.</p> \n<p>Sharon Leslie Morgan, founder of Our Black Ancestry Foundation, an organisation that provides research for African American genealogical research, said the indexing was important for history and for today.</p> \n<p>“In order for us to deal with contemporary issues that we have today – racism, black boys being shot down in the streets – you have to confront the past,” she told <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/06/19/slavery-records-searchable-online/28921295/%20ends\">USA Today</a>.</p> \n<p>“The land was stolen from the Native Americans. The labour was provided for free by African slaves. The entire foundation of American capitalism is based on slavery, on a free labour market. People don’t want to deal with that, and you have to.”</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4e4e56218cb099538cc68b046d1cf63ce8acd7de/0_10_640_384/640.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":384,"width":640,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andrew J.
