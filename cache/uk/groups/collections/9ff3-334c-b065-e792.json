No meat, eggs or diary – nothing that comes from animals. Is there anything interesting left to eat? Yes, there’s lots – according to vegans – including chickpeas, kidney beans, fortified soy products, fruit and nuts. So this week’s research linking vegan diet and weight loss is a triumph for the tofu burger. Vegetarian diets have previously been linked with a reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and dying from pretty much everything. But, more importantly – at least as far as summer magazine issues go – vegan diets haven’t been strongly linked with weight loss. This is partly because studies on weight loss and varities of vegetarianism have been small, lasted varying amounts of time and the subjects studied haven’t stuck to their diets.</p> \n<h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2> \n<p>This new study, a meta analysis published in the <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-015-3390-7\" title=\"\">Journal of General Internal Medicine</a>, adds up the results of the best studies that compare weight loss in vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets, and also lacto-ovo vegetarians (who drink milk and eat eggs) and vegans. The studies included 1,151 dieters who had followed a regime for between nine and 74 weeks. The diets included the Atkins diet and those recommended by the <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/\" title=\"\">American Diabetes Association</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-pro/guidelines/current/cholesterol-guidelines/final-report\" title=\"\">US&nbsp;National Cholesterol Education Program</a>. Those who followed a vegetarian diet lost an average of 1.48kg more than those on other diets, while vegans lost 2.52kg more than the non-vegetarian dieters. The lead author, Ru-Yi Huang, says that wholegrain products that are rich in fibre may cause the stomach to delay in emptying and therefore delay feelings of hunger. Some of the individual pieces of research within the meta analysis had more dramatic evidence of weight loss – one study found a weight loss of 10kg at a year and 8kg at five years in vegetarians. A <a href=\"http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/2/e003505.full\" title=\"\">study in BMJ Open</a> of 39 overweight people found that an “Eco-Atkins diet” – a low-carbohydrate vegan diet (with protein from soy and nut products) – led to 6.9kg weight loss over six months as well as lower cholesterol levels.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts.pdf\" title=\"\">The British Dietetic Association</a> says that vegetarian and vegan diets are suitable for every stage of life as long as they are well planned. There are many ways to lose weight, all of which involve eating less or at least expending more energy than you take in. Becoming a vegan is usually a lifestyle choice rather a diet – one that people make for many reasons, and feeling better in a two-piece is perhaps not the most common one.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435933964817/Should-I-go-vegan-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A fibrous vegan diet could help delay feelings of hunger.

As vasectomy becomes less popular, could new methods including a testes-shrinking drug provide reliable, reversible birth control for men?</p>","byline":"Ann Robinson","body":"<p>There are, despite an ancient and colourful history, only three forms of male contraception: condoms, withdrawal and vasectomy. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23671357\" title=\"\">The first condoms were used by Pasiphae, wife of King Minos of Crete</a>, who used a goat’s bladder in her vagina to protect against his sperm, which was said to contain scorpions and serpents that killed his mistresses. The withdrawal method got bad press in the bible when Onan withdrew and spilt his seed rather than impregnate his widowed sister-in-law, Tamar. God was very displeased with this contraceptive method and killed him. Vasectomy was first offered to a man in&nbsp;Indiana in 1899 as a <a href=\"http://www.vasectomy-information.com/history-of-vasectomy/\" title=\"\">cure for his “excessive masturbation”</a> – an alternative to the more conventional treatment of castration. The vasectomy was a great success and the physician reported that the patient “became more of a sunny disposition, brighter of&nbsp;intellect and ceased to masturbate”.</p> \n<p>And we really haven’t progressed much since then. There is still no reversible male contraceptive, apart from condoms. Vasectomy – a surgical procedure, and by far the most reliable of the three – is also becoming less and less popular in the UK according to recent NHS statistics: rates fell from 30,000 NHS vasectomies in England in 2006/7, to 14,000 in 2012/13 (the most recent figures available). And, even if men do want one, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/vasectomies-being-given-the-snip-as-gps-in-essex-told-they-must-ration-number-of-procedures-10245407.html\" title=\"\">provision of vasectomies on the NHS is being rationed</a> in many areas.</p> \n<p>There is clearly a huge gap in the market. New technologies are being developed, but an acceptable, reliable, reversible solution remains elusive. The challenge is that men produce so many sperm – around 1,000 per second. Women, however, only produce one egg per month, so suppressing an egg is always going to be easier than stemming the flood of sperm. And if a decent male contraceptive pill, injection or implant does come along, will men use it? In a study of attitudes to a male pill by men and women, both sexes were positive – though, unsurprisingly, women were more enthusiastic than men. Men in stable relationships were more receptive than men in casual sexual relationships and men with healthy lifestyles were more positive than less healthy men.</p> \n<p>There’s still time for those men to change their minds, though, as it will be a while before this range of promising ideas will be fully developed:</p> \n<h2><strong>The injection</strong></h2> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.parsemusfoundation.org/vasalgel-home/\" title=\"\">Vasalgel is a polymer gel</a> injected into the vas deferens (sperm duct) via the scrotum. It blocks sperm but lets the rest of the fluid ejaculate through, so it doesn’t protect against sexually transmitted diseases. A second injection dissolves and flushes out the gel, offering a potentially permanent but reversible method. Vasalgel is similar to a compound called Risug (or “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance\" title=\"\">reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance</a>”) that is being trialled in India and appears to be safe and effective for humans, though Risug may never attract enough funding to come to market. Vasalgel has been tested on rabbits and primates and clinical trials are due to start in early 2016 – in the US, 26,000 men are on a waiting list to take part.</p> \n<h2><strong>The clean-sheets pill</strong></h2> \n<p>A drug is being developed in the UK based on phenoxybenzamine and thioridazine, which have been found to stop muscle contraction in the vas deferens so that sperm isn’t pushed forward. The rest of the ejaculate gets stalled, too, hence the “clean sheets”. The question is whether men would accept a dry ejaculate or, as one respondent to a survey put it, “all of the twitch, none of the spurt”. This method could also <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15893119\" title=\"\">reduce transmission of HIV</a> and deserves more attention but, again, funding is a problem. John Guillebaud, emeritus professor of family planning and reproductive health at University College London, says <a href=\"http://www.malecontraceptive.org/#!clean-sheets-pill/c1u8o\" title=\"\">the team needs funding for studies in rams</a>, then further trials if results are positive. “The fastest likely [development] is 10 years.” The idea is for a pill that men can take two to four hours before sex. “That’s fine for many,” says Guillebaud, but “might lead to conceptions when extra-frisky couples can’t wait that long” – they would be advised to use condoms until the pill kicks in. An implant version would give a longer-lasting effect, but normal semen would be restored within days of stopping the drug, but trials would be needed to test that.</p> \n<h2><strong>The herb</strong></h2> \n<p>This is a male contraceptive pill based on the active ingredient of <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/05/11/papua-s-humble-gendarussa-plant-may-provide-male-pill.html\" title=\"\">gendarussa, a shrub native to Indonesia</a>, where the drug has been developed. It works by blocking the enzyme that allows a sperm to penetrate an egg. Although further trials into effectiveness, dosage and safety are needed, trials involving about 300 men who took the extract for one to four months resulted in only one pregnancy.</p> \n<h2><strong>The implant</strong></h2> \n<p>A drug <a href=\"http://www.malecontraceptive.org/#!eppin/ck9h\" title=\"\">(anti-Eppin) binds to a protein on sperm (Eppin)</a>, and stops the sperm swimming towards the egg. Anti-Eppin could be delivered through an implant under the skin or orally. Tests assessing the drug’s safety are yet to be undertaken, but Dr Michael O’Rand, <a href=\"http://eppinpharma.com/about-us/\" title=\"\">president of EppinPharma</a>, the pharmaceutical startup developing the drug, says: “When we finish toxicology and non-human primate testing, we will be ready for a phase one human trial. However, this is several years away.”</p> \n<p>He adds: “I&nbsp;would definitely take it.”</p> \n<h2><strong>The genetic drug</strong></h2> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(12)00929-4\" title=\"\">JQ1 is a drug that turns off the BRDT gene</a> responsible for sperm production in the testes. In animal studies, the drug takes six weeks to achieve temporary infertility and one to three months for fertility to return when the drug is stopped. Testicular size is reduced, but hormone levels and mating patterns are unaffected. It remains to be seen whether it will make human testes shrink and whether men would mind if it does.</p> \n<h2><strong>The hormonal pill</strong></h2> \n<p>Pills that combine two sex hormones (androgens and progestogens) act on the brain to shut down natural hormones that stimulate the testes to produce sperm. Tests have proved effective but have raised side-effects such as liver damage and variable effectiveness, especially between different ethnic groups.</p> \n<h2><strong>The “bright” pill</strong></h2> \n<p>A compound that temporarily inhibits the reproductive capacity of sperm has been developed by Professor Haim Breitbart (the pill’s name is a play on his surname) of Bar Ilan university in Israel. The drug makes mice infertile for one to three months, depending on the dose, with no impact on sex drive. “The mice behaved nicely; they ate and had sex. They were laughing and everything,” said Breitbart to the online magazine Popular Science. However, the professor says there is little chance of further development for now.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435941872138/Colored-Condoms.-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"There is clearly a huge gap in the market and an acceptable, reliable, reversible solution remains elusive.

There comes a point in every child’s life when you reach the same level of maturity as one or both of your parents. It can take many years to appreciate that the dynamic has significantly altered and is often at the epicentre of other problems between you and your creators.</p> \n<p>Generally, once you’ve passed that critical juncture the disparity increases, and parents can feel like an increasing problem the older we (and they) get. Eventually it can feel like you’re dealing with bloody-minded toddlers, which is yet another of life’s little ironies. Once your paths have diverged, you continue becoming a more responsible adult and they become increasingly irresponsible, relying on you for everything you once needed from them.</p> \n<p>As with all relationships it’s entirely subjective and experienced at a different age and in disparate ways by each of us. As a phenomenon it’s curiously similar to the trauma experienced by parents when their children finally embrace independence and leave home, and offers further proof that we live not in a linear way but a circular pattern.</p> \n<p>For slow developers it can take well into your 40s or 50s before you catch up with Mum and Dad – some never do – while for others it can happen at a poignantly precocious point in childhood. I’ve seen serious little eight-year-olds trying to negotiate the responsibilities of caring for the unreliable adults in their lives. It’s heartbreaking to witness.</p> \n<p>Luckily you’ve managed to reach first base in terms of adulthood before having such unwelcome duties thrust on you, and while it’s not an easy burden to shoulder, there are definitely ways of making it less hard. You’re old enough to cope far better than the youngsters I just described.</p> \n<p>Plenty feel unfettered by genealogical lineage and focus purely on their own forward momentum. Personally, I’m for walking a middle line. There’s enough drama around us without whipping it up in your closest circle if it’s avoidable. Few of us don’t aspire to close relations with our families. That sort of solid familial ground to launch yourself into life from is enviable and surely merits reciprocal treatment when the baton is passed from the older to the younger hand. That’s in a perfect world, which this is not!</p> \n<p>For many of us the perils of our parents in close proximity are a torture, and tangible distance – emotionally and even geographically – is the only respite. Choosing to bring a child into this world and later giving them no option but to parent you is not a fair deal, but behaving magnanimously out of guilt, shame or expediency isn’t a healthy option either, and resentment takes a similar toll on all within its catchment.</p> \n<p>Many of us, once we surpass our parents’ ability to act like responsible adults, need to separate from them, even if it’s just to establish acceptable boundaries on both sides. Your story suggests it’s time for you to draw a line between your mother’s expectations and what you are prepared to offer. She needs to look beyond her computer screen and take responsibility for a life that’s not even half lived (hopefully).</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, your energies will benefit you both much better in the future if at present they are directed to your studies and the enriching experience of living life on your own terms. It will come as little surprise to you that your parent isn’t perfect. I suspect straight talking and direct action may be your best accomplices in achieving mutual understanding here.

It’s the no-nonsense, quick and relatively cheap approach to mental suffering – with none of that Freudian bollocks, and plenty of scientific backing. So it was unsettling to learn, from <a href=\"https://uit.no/Content/418448/The%20effect%20of%20CBT%20is%20falling.pdf\" title=\"\">a paper in the journal Psychological Bulletin</a>, that it seems to be getting less effective over time. After analysing 70 studies conducted between 1977 and 2014, researchers Tom Johnsen and Oddgeir Friborg concluded that CBT is roughly half as effective in treating depression as it used to be.</p> \n<p>What’s going on? One theory is that, as any therapy grows more popular, the proportion of inexperienced or incompetent therapists grows bigger. But the paper raises a more intriguing idea: the placebo effect. The early publicity around CBT made it seem a miracle cure, so maybe it functioned like one for a while. These days, by contrast, the chances are you know someone who’s tried CBT and didn’t miraculously become perfectly happy for ever. Our expectations have become more realistic, so effectiveness has fallen, too. Johnsen and Friborg worry that their own paper will make matters worse by further lowering people’s expectations.</p> \n<p>All this highlights something even stranger, though: when it comes to talk therapy, what does it even mean to speak of the placebo effect? With pills, it’s straightforward: if I swallow a sugar tablet, believing it to be an antidepressant, and my depression lifts, then there’s a good chance the placebo effect is at work. But if I believe that CBT, or any therapy, is likely to work, and it does, who’s to say if my beliefs were really the cause, rather than the therapy? Beliefs are an integral part of the process, not a rival explanation. The line between what I think is going on and what <em>is</em> going on starts to blur. Truly convince yourself that a psychological intervention is working and by definition it’s working.</p> \n<p>Perhaps every era needs a practice it can believe in as a miracle cure – Freudian psychoanalysis in the 1930s, CBT in the 1990s, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/11/julie-myerson-mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy\" title=\"\">mindfulness meditation</a> today – until research gradually reveals it to be as flawed as everything else.</p> \n<p>Or it could be that we’re changing as people. In 1958, a US psychoanalyst, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Wheelis\" title=\"\">Allen Wheelis</a>, published a book arguing that Freudian analysis had stopped working because the American character had altered. In Freud’s day, Wheelis argued, people didn’t understand why they felt sad; psychoanalysis gave them explanations, whereupon they found it easy to transform their lives. Modern people were better at self-understanding, but they lacked the gumption to do anything about it. “Lacking the sturdy character of the Victorians,” as Roy F Baumeister and John Tierney put it in their book <a href=\"http://www.splendidtable.org/story/willpower-rediscovering-greatest-human-strength\" title=\"\">Willpower</a>‚ “people didn’t have the strength to follow up on the insight and change their lives.”</p> \n<p>The old techniques weren’t completely wrong; they’d just outlived their usefulness. If the secret of happiness is hard to find, maybe that’s because the answer keeps changing.</p> \n<p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/6/30/1435660711660/Oliver-CBT-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","credit":"Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","altText":"Oliver: CBT","cleanCaption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T14:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T23:06:27Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":130,"contributors":[{"name":"Oliver Burkeman","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/11/4/1415112352678/Oliver-Burkeman-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/oliverburkeman"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Health & wellbeing","Life and style","Psychology","Sigmund Freud","Mental health"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"science/psychology","webTitle":"Psychology"},{"id":"books/sigmundfreud","webTitle":"Sigmund Freud"},{"id":"society/mental-health","webTitle":"Mental health"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Oliver Burkeman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/oliverburkeman"}}],"series":{"title":"This column will change your life","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/thiscolumnwillchangeyourlife"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/why-cbt-is-falling-out-of-favour-oliver-burkeman","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49pq8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/why-cbt-is-falling-out-of-favour-oliver-burkeman","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/why-cbt-is-falling-out-of-favour-oliver-burkeman"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435660805592/8d70cff8-9412-4881-8dd7-3099d7c11668-1020x425.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":425,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","credit":"Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","altText":"Oliver: CBT","cleanCaption":"Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian"}},"importance":4,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/6/30/1435660711660/Oliver-CBT-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","credit":"Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","altText":"Oliver: CBT","cleanCaption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"Grain-based packed lunch ideas","rawTitle":"Grain-based packed lunch ideas","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jul/05/packed-lunch-recipes-quinoa-barley-couscous-bulgur-cauliflower","title":"Grain-based packed lunch ideas","trailText":"<strong>The lunch box: </strong>Grains such as couscous, barley, quinoa and even whizzed-up cauliflower make a great packed lunch","standFirst":"<p>Grains such as couscous, barley, quinoa and even whizzed-up cauliflower make a great packed lunch</p>","byline":"Caroline Craig and Sophie Missing","body":"<p>Though many of us might wish we had the time and money for delicious meat and fish-based packed lunches every day, the reality is that hardy grain-based dishes are far better suited to a lunchbox, sitting happily under a desk for a few hours without refrigeration. Here are some combinations we’ve been enjoying recently.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Inspired by Hemsley and Hemsley’s delicious quinoa risotto in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/art-of-eating-well.html\">The Art of Eating Well</a>, we have been making batches of our own versions to take to work the next day– quinoa seems to hold its texture well and doesn’t go sloppy. Make some chicken or veg stock, then gradually add to a pan of quinoa and onion that’s been quickly fried in olive oil. Go green by adding lots of seasonal asparagus and broad beans, with tarragon, lemon juice and a cheeky grating of pecorino; or go red with halved cherry tomatoes; peppers, and red onion with a splash of white wine and some basil.<br /></p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Make some zingy couscous salads with avocado, feta, lime, cucumber, red onion and whole almonds. Fresh herbs are obviously a great addition, but if you don’t have any to hand, just make sure to add plenty of olive oil and lemon juiceand to your salads. Sliced olives or pomegranate seeds will add plenty of contrasting zing.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Barley is a grateful recipient of leftovers and revitalised fridge lurkers. Roast some red onion, peppers and carrot with honey and garlic until caramelised, then stir into cooked barley while warm. Other great combinations are is green beans saut&eacute;ed in butter and garlic, or flaked mackerel with cherry tomatoes.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Bulgur is also an excellent and filling base, working well to soak up the lovely rich juices produced from roasting veg. Tomatoes and peppers work especially well: just roast with olive oil, salt, pepper and a little thyme until caramelised, then mixed into your cooked bulgur (cook in boiling water for around 15 minutes, or until done). Alternatively, add frozen peas to your just-cooked bulgur (the residual heat will thaw them, so no need to cook) and a dressing of grated ginger, olive oil, a tiny splash of sesame oil, a more generous splash of soy sauce and lots of lime juice.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Sometimes it can be hard to hit your five-a-day: if you want every bit of your lunch to count towards your veg quota then you can fake it to make it. It’s not a grain, but if you roughly chop a cauliflower, then whizz it up in a food processor, it will sort of resemble one (credit and thanks to the genius Felicity Cloake for this idea). Fry your cauliflower ‘grains’ in a little olive oil until softened. You could do this with broccoli, or romanesco, too. Season and add lemon zest to taste. Top with a generous portion of spinach (or other seasonal greens), saut&eacute;ed with olive oil and sliced garlic, and a dollop of yoghurt or creme fraiche. A small sprinkling of chilli flakes or a squidge of chilli sauce would give a nice little kick as a finishing touch.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435838258847/695faecf-ac8c-454d-aead-eaccc88b5272-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Hennie Haworth for the Guardian","altText":"Grains: an illustration of some, in a bowl.

The table would be covered with a linen cloth and napkins, which she had woven from linen she had spun 35 years previously, as part of her bottom drawer. To start she would bring a steaming bowl of stracciatelle soup, the broth made from a free-range chicken. To follow, the boiled chicken would be served with extra-virgin olive oil, freshly ground black pepper and home-cured black olives, ulive strinate, a speciality of the Marche region. The freshly picked black olives are put in a sack with sea salt and hung outside for 40 days in the frosty weather. To serve they are washed, dried and quickly fried in extra-virgin olive oil with crushed garlic, chilli flakes and zest of orange.</p> \n<p>Serves 6<br /><strong>eggs</strong> 3<br /><strong>pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper<br /></strong><strong>fine fresh white breadcrumbs</strong> 4 tbsp<br /><strong>nutmeg</strong> freshly grated, a pinch<br /><strong>parmesan</strong> 4 tbsp, freshly grated<br /><strong>chicken stock</strong> 1&frac12; litres</p> \n<p>Beat the eggs in a bowl, add the remaining ingredients. Dilute the egg mixture with a cup of cold stock, blend in well.</p> \n<p>Bring the remaining stock to the boil, pour in the egg mixture, and stir roughly with a fork. Lower the heat, simmer for 2 minutes, breaking the egg up with a fork, so that it looks like little rags. (Stracciatelle means little rags.) Serve boiling hot with more parmesan cheese.</p> \n<p><em>From Leaves from The Walnut Tree: Recipes of a Lifetime by Ann &amp; Franco Taruschio (BBC Books, &pound;20). </em></p> \n<h2>Dino Joannides’s trenette with pesto</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a776342a8cb16653977efbe06e0ae8818b6c61b9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435676124529/de49ed10-27cb-4397-be64-d1ed226361d3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pesto trenette\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kris Kirkham</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Perhaps the most common way of eating pesto alla Genovese, this is also one of the most delicious. It’s a lovely way of celebrating good-quality basil, and for me is very much a summer dish. It makes a delicious first course or a one-plate meal, especially with the addition of French beans.</p> \n<p>Making pesto properly is another good case for slow food because it should ideally be made shortly before it is eaten. It is also one of the many recipes where you need to be very flexible in terms of quantities; tasting and adjusting them during preparation is a must.</p> \n<p>To my mind there is no substitute for pounding by hand, and I recommend using a marble pestle and mortar. Pesto made in a food processor tends to require extra olive oil and in my view, the machine is too harsh on the ingredients, making both the texture and flavour somewhat insipid.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>trenette or linguine</strong> 320-400g<br /><strong>basil leaves</strong> 4<br /><strong>french beans</strong> 200g, topped and tailed (optional)<br /><strong>pesto alla Genovese</strong> 8 tbsp (see below)<br /><strong>parmigiano reggiano PDO</strong> 60g</p> \n<p>For the pesto<br /><strong>fresh basil</strong> 4 bunches, ideally PDO Genoese, good Proven&ccedil;al or home-grown outdoors<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 1-2, preferably Imperia from Vessalico, or French pink or violet varieties, such as ail rose de Lautrec<br /><strong>pine nuts </strong>30g<br /><strong>coarse sea salt </strong>10g, ideally sale di Cervia<br /><strong>parmigiano reggiano cheese (aged 24 months)</strong> 30-40g, grated<br /><strong>fiore sardo (pecorino sardo) cheese </strong>40-50g, grated<br /><strong>PDO extra virgin olive oil from Liguria</strong> 50-70ml</p> \n<p>To make the pesto, wash the basil leaves in cold water and dry them on a tea towel but without rubbing. The following steps must be done as quickly as possible to avoid oxidation.</p> \n<p>Put the garlic and pine nuts in a mortar and pound with the pestle until smooth.</p> \n<p>Add a few grains of the salt and some of the basil leaves, then pound the mixture, using a light circular movement of the pestle against the sides of the mortar. Repeat this process until all the basil has been pounded.</p> \n<p>When the basil drips bright green liquid, add both cheeses and mix well. Pour a thin layer of the oil over the pesto and mix very lightly.</p> \n<p>Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling, well salted water until al dente. If you plan to add beans, put them in the water at the same time as the pasta. When ready, drain the pasta, then return it to the saucepan. Add 8 tablespoons of pesto and stir well so that the pasta is fully coated.</p> \n<p>Serve in pasta plates and place a basil leaf in the centre of each portion. Grate some parmigiano on top before eating.</p> \n<p><em>From Semplice by Dino Joannides (Preface Publishing, &pound;25). <a
