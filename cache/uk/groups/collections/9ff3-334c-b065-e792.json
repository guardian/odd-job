Neither did he reply to the second one, asking if we were still on for Sunday. He’d said, before we met, that he was going to make me the best chicken casserole I’d ever tasted, when I came to his for lunch, and the best apple strudel in the universe. That might sound far-fetched, he’d added, but it was accurate. He’d said that I should get a train mid-morning and he’d pick me up. We’d eat, and then walk through the fields and woods near his house. After that, he’d make cocktails – he had an incredible Shetland gin, he said, and grew limes in his conservatory. His excitement was sweet and lovely.</p> \n<p>But that was all before we met, and he caught sight of my arse encased in old jeans, and decided against it. He still hasn’t replied to either of my follow-up texts. Instead, he appears to have added me to a list for receipt of his daily email, an impersonal affair sent out every evening to 30 people, some of them with the same surname as his. It’s a bulletin detailing the ups and downs of the day, bloopers from exam papers, a miscellany from his life. I don’t understand what he thinks our relationship is. Is it really OK, in his world, in his mind, to see a woman once and never mention it again, as if it didn’t happen, and ignore her messages but treat her like a buddy for the rest of his life? Apparently so.</p> \n<p>I’d already had another invitation, from someone called Lee. Full name Leopold. Austrian, in fact, but based here for business. He’s 47, divorced, childless, and balances his “suit life” – the uniform and obligations of the working week – by having Sunday adventures on a huge muscly motorbike. Recently, he took a year out and saw the world on it, travelling alone.</p> \n<p>He wrote asking if we could meet for a drink. I should have said: “Yes, that’d be lovely, shall we say Friday at 7pm?” That’s how sane people respond. But I had to put Lee through the many hoops I have devised, the filters. We had to have an exhaustive, extensive email correspondence before we met. I had to feel as intellectually and emotionally safe as is possible via written word (admittedly, that’s often illusory) before risking another meeting.</p> \n<p>I acknowledge that I may be going through a sort of crisis. In fact it’s the return of an old one, in which I try to make the target male fall for me before we meet, so as to make my physical self a downside that is outweighed by my interesting mind. That’s the mechanism, one that seems safer than a blind date – but isn’t really safer. I’ve done it before and it didn’t work. In February, Peter and I talked ourselves into an intoxicated and mesmerised state via this sort of word magic, and met once, disastrously. Nonetheless, I’ve been attempting it again, partly because I’ve been so lonely. I’ve felt badly in need of email romance, after a spate of unromantic disappointments.</p> \n<p>My charm offensive appeared to work. “I have a good feeling about this,” Lee wrote, after we’d emailed solidly for four days. “I want to meet you as soon as possible. I hope this isn’t too forward.”</p> \n<p>I replied with “I’m available on Saturday for dinner, and then sex afterwards. That’s how you do too forward, hahaha.”</p> \n<p>I thought it was funny – I wasn’t serious, as I felt the need to point out in a second message – but online humour with strangers is always risky. Lee didn’t think it was funny. I’m only able to assume this, because he didn’t reply. I looked again at his profile, searching harder for warnings enmeshed in the prose. His pick would need to be 100% woman, he’d written. He’d used the word feminine three times. I intuited that my response hadn’t been very ladylike.</p> \n<p>I messaged him. “I’d like to play a game of Q and A with you. Let’s play Q and A! I’ll start. Scrabble: yes or no?” I waited, looking at my phone every five minutes, confident that a dull evening was about to be enlivened by wit. It wasn’t. Nothing. No response. Silence. I had a long bath and a soap bubble conversation with myself out loud in the echoey bathroom. Why are these men so bloody wet? I asked. Why are they so easily scared off? Can’t they rise to the challenge and at least be playful?</p> \n<p><em>Stella Grey is a pseudonym</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/greystellagrey\" title=\"\">@GreyStellaGrey</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434713865267/motorbikes-mid-life-ex-wi-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Leopold balances his ‘suit life’, the uniform and obligations of the working week, by having Sunday adventures on a huge muscly motorbike.

He is older than our daughter, but not by much. He is just walking, not yet talking – somewhere around a year, I’d guess. You are much younger than I am, a teenage mum, perhaps 15 years old. I must be twice your age. I couldn’t have considered being a mum at your age. But you are a mum, like me. And you care about your son, who is unwell and in hospital. I see you you playing with him, cuddling him.</p> \n<p>We’ve had a few talks since we’ve been on the ward. I teach girls your age. I enjoy talking to young people. I enjoy talking to other mums.</p> \n<p>We had a lot in common at that moment. Concerns and worries for the beautiful, tiny people we had had to bring to hospital.</p> \n<p>That is why I am sorry that I didn’t say anything. I should have backed up&nbsp;a fellow mum. I should have spoken&nbsp;up.</p> \n<p>I should have told the doctor to take you to an office or private room. I should have told him that a curtain drawn in a busy ward does not afford you any privacy. I should have told him I could hear the questions he was asking you. The questions that probed deeper into your life than the conversations we’d had about baby milestones and children’s centres. I could hear how his questions judged your choices. Judged your circumstances. Judged&nbsp;you.</p> \n<p>He may be a doctor. His job may be to conduct child protection interviews. But surely that should mean he thinks about your dignity. You should be the child protected. You <em>and</em> your son.</p> \n<p>I should have told him that I work with young people who have those interviews and that it is not OK to conduct them where members of the public can hear. It is not OK to excavate someone’s life in a public place, regardless of their situation. You deserved more.</p> \n<p>Instead I sat by awkwardly. I should have politely, but pointedly, told someone that I should not have access to that information about you. Instead I tried to look the other way; an uncomfortable eavesdropper.</p> \n<p>If I were in your position, I would have spoken up. I would have known that I could. I would not have accepted the authority of the white coat to expose my life to strangers. But those things are part of the reason that I am not in your position: my confidence, my education, my privilege.</p> \n<p>When you did not stand up for yourself, I did not stand up for you either. I let those in power treat you with so little respect. I let them devalue you, and the tiny little man you obviously loved so much.</p> \n<p>I am sorry I did not speak. I am sorry I listened. I am sorry that it was only in my head that I argued with that doctor in the white coat, for his lack of respect for your little family unit.</p> \n<p>I did write a letter. I sent it to the hospital. I’ve copied it to our local MP. I hope I’ve given you the voice you deserve. I hope that it helps other people to avoid the situation into which you were put. I wish I had spoken at the time, but the letter is a start – and next time, I will try to be the person I should be and speak <em>out.</em></p> \n<p>I hope that your son has recovered, as my daughter has. I hope that you are both well and enjoying life. I hope that he grows up to be a kind-hearted and friendly person like you seemed to be. I hope you are both content.</p> \n<p><em>The mum in the bed opposite</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-27T05:45:07Z","lastModified":"2015-06-27T05:45:07Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["Family","Life and style","NHS","Hospitals","Doctors","Nursing","Health","Health policy","Children","Teenage pregnancy"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/nhs","webTitle":"NHS"},{"id":"society/hospitals","webTitle":"Hospitals"},{"id":"society/doctors","webTitle":"Doctors"},{"id":"society/nursing","webTitle":"Nursing"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"politics/health","webTitle":"Health policy"},{"id":"society/children","webTitle":"Children"},{"id":"society/teenage-pregnancy","webTitle":"Teenage pregnancy"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"A letter to ...","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/aletterto"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/a-letter-to-the-teenage-mother-i-wish-id-defended-in-hospital","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avpb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/a-letter-to-the-teenage-mother-i-wish-id-defended-in-hospital","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/a-letter-to-the-teenage-mother-i-wish-id-defended-in-hospital"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":5,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[]},{"title":"What I’m really thinking: the divorce lawyer","rawTitle":"What I’m really thinking: the divorce lawyer","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/what-im-really-thinking-divorce-lawyer","title":"What I’m really thinking: the divorce lawyer","trailText":"‘Middle-aged divorced men warm to me.

You weep silently for a&nbsp;few moments, keen not to let it escalate, then brace yourself, lifting your head to continue the meeting. I&nbsp;offer you some water and a tissue. Soon, we are busily talking through the strategy and your hopes for the financial settlement.</p> \n<p>Disappointment and misery: I&nbsp;have an honorary degree in both. Sometimes, a client might mention some aspect of their failed relationship that triggers in my brain, making me wonder whether the same is true of my own marriage. A quick analysis ensues, but is usually dismissed as another red herring. Then I’m on to thinking of the next piece of advice, how much, how long, when. A constant list of to-do items are stacking up in my mind, while all the while trying to appear empathetic.</p> \n<p>Middle-aged divorced men warm to me: perhaps I represent the sane version of their “mad” wife, or they&nbsp;appreciate a female opinion on the divorce. Sometimes, I wish for their sake that they’d get back together – I can tell they are still in love with their ex.</p> \n<p>There aren’t many thank yous involved in divorce, the end result being a virtual decimation and division of their assets, and not a&nbsp;small fee for my help.</p> \n<p>But occasionally something better happens: when a client leaves a meeting visibly more confident and hopeful than when they arrived; when a client is reunited with their child after being prevented contact and they telephone me to share their joy; when a client turns a corner with their depression and their email correspondence becomes sparky and fun. These short&nbsp;moments of lightness make it&nbsp;worthwhile.</p> \n<p>I can go home, taking a heavy sigh myself, along with a large glass of pinot grigio, and feel satisfied that things are as they should be and that I helped things get there.

But still, I think, it’s nice to be here, all together, on a random Sunday.</p> \n<p>“Your father is staring into space,” my wife says. “Who’s going to volunteer to talk to him?”</p> \n<p>“I will,” the middle one says.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435143924660/Tim-Dowling-column-illo-2-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","altText":"Tim Dowling column illo 27/6/15","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435144086225/8077b3f9-4d30-4903-b24e-409b94c1a1d1-987x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":987,"orientation":"portrait","credit":"Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","altText":"Tim Dowling illo June 27","cleanCredit":"Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-27T05:00:09Z","lastModified":"2015-06-27T05:00:09Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":36,"contributors":[{"name":"Tim Dowling","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733750190/TimDowling.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/timdowling"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Family","Life and style","Parents and parenting","Father's Day","Marriage"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fathers-day","webTitle":"Father's Day"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/marriage","webTitle":"Marriage"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tim Dowling","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/timdowling"}}],"series":{"title":"Tim Dowling's Weekend column","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/timdowlingsweekendcolumn"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fathers-day-tim-dowling-family-outing","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a2jm","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fathers-day-tim-dowling-family-outing","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fathers-day-tim-dowling-family-outing"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":4,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435143924660/Tim-Dowling-column-illo-2-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","altText":"Tim Dowling column illo 27/6/15","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"Ask Molly Ringwald: My husband wants to ruin our wedding anniversary","rawTitle":"Ask Molly Ringwald: My husband wants to ruin our wedding anniversary","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jun/26/ask-molly-ringwald-wicked-campers-wedding-anniversary","title":"Ask Molly Ringwald: My husband wants to ruin our wedding anniversary","trailText":"‘I’m morally opposed to giving a penny to a company that thinks it’s OK to paint disgusting slogans about women all over its vans.

This is going to be our first holiday together in five years and I really want it to be special, with no drama. But does this have to mean I&nbsp;compromise on an issue I feel so strongly about?</strong><br />Nothing says romance like driving around in a camper van plastered with graffiti like “Drink till she’s pretty” and “I can already imagine the gaffer tape on your mouth”. Yuck. I don’t want to delve into a thorny discussion about the complexities of free speech – as a writer I’m explicitly for it – but a marketing campaign that’s founded upon <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/advertising-watchdog-upholds-complaints-against-wicked-campers-over-offensive-camper-van-slogans/story-e6frfq80-1226621001186\" title=\"\">misogyny, homophobia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au//national/bligh-attacks-racist-campervan-slogans-20080717-3gqj.html\" title=\"\">racism</a> is, in practice, pretty awful. Wicked Campers did issue an apology after a petition was signed by over 100,000 people in 2014, and publicly agreed to remove the offensive slogans. As of today, however, it still hasn’t done so.</p> \n<p>I’m also a big proponent of compromise, but to me, compromise means finding a solution that is agreeable to both parties, not just giving in to one. There are many other camper companies. If the additional expense really makes the trip unfeasible – and you can’t shorten the duration of the trip by a day or two (a simple way to cut costs) – then do something else this year and save your money for the next time you’re celebrating. Try to come up with three or four lower-priced options. If he refuses to budge, and is willing to completely disregard your feelings on the matter, I don’t really see much in your union to celebrate.</p> \n<p>Your conviction in not supporting a company that promotes violence against women is commendable, but you can’t just say it. As someone who lives in California, to me it’s like saying you want to help conserve water because of the drought and then going home and taking 30-minute showers. Don’t just pay lip service to your principles. Refuse to go. He’s not going to take off on an anniversary holiday alone — and if he does, then I can think of a number of alternative things for you to spray paint on the back of that tacky rental van.</p>

debate</a>, but I have spent more inspirational 90-minute periods waiting for dial-up internet to load, and that was in 1998, when all you got at the end of it was a search engine that looked as if it had been designed by a photocopier in conjunction with a hair slide. Which is, now I think of it, a pretty fair description of most of the leadership candidates, too.</p> \n<p>So I’ve been joining alternative leftwing groups, hoping for bright new solutions to political ennui, but the most spectacular thing about most of them is the speed with which they descend into the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb_qHP7VaZE&amp;noredirect=1\">People’s Front of Judea</a>. Everyone polices everyone else’s language to decide whose self-identification is subjugating whom. While this has, I hope, led to greater inclusivity, it has also made it a full-time job to check you haven’t oppressed anybody before you press send on a small thought you just had about primary schools. Meanwhile, somewhere over there on another page of the internet, Rome burns.</p> \n<p>Revolutionaries with an actual plan are thin on the ground, so I’m inspired to see that they might now be found in pop music: <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/taylor-swift\">Taylor Swift</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/charlotte-church\">Charlotte Church</a>, to be precise. If you are now groaning, unconvinced, then let me update you on what they are up to this month, in their different worlds. Swift, the 25-year-old multimillionaire from Nashville, one of the biggest stars in the world, has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/22/taylor-swift-forces-apple-climbdown\">stood up to Apple</a> and told them they can’t stream her music for free on its new service (they were not planning to pay artists during a three-month trial giveaway). <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/nov/04/taylor-swift-spotify-streaming-album-sales-snub\">She had already refused to let Spotify give away her music</a> on similar grounds. “This is not about me,” she wrote in an open letter that made Apple change its plans overnight. “Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew and entire management team by playing live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt.”</p> \n<p>All right, so it’s not quite Nelson Mandela’s last stand against the bloody jaws of apartheid, but in an industry not know for its trade unions, Swift is the safe voice that can represent the collective without putting the individual at risk. These principles echo well beyond music, too: they teach a generation of young fans that, with no art to fill the machines, there can be no more machines, and perhaps no more art.</p> \n<p>Then there is Charlotte Church, who last week made a speech at the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/live/2015/jun/20/anti-austerity-demonstrations-live\">anti-austerity demo in London</a>, described as the biggest rally in Britain for several years. The child with the voice of an angel is now the adult with the voice of sanity, and millions of people behind her. She spoke, to enormous cheers, about this country needing to save itself from “decades of yuppie rule”, and declared that the government wants to sell off our schools and hospitals. “And once it is done,” she added, “it will be very difficult to reverse. One aspect of this that really gets under my skin is that it’s all wrapped up in a proud-to-be-British package. I’m proud to be British because of our National Health Service, the welfare system and David Bowie. Not because of the union jack.”</p> \n<p>It’s not just the politics that interest me here, it’s the death of cute. Swift was always in control of her own destiny, always wrote her own music, forged her own career – but she had to stay cute as a button, too. Church was a child star. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/miley-cyrus\">Miley Cyrus</a> had to kill off her own child incarnation, Hannah Montana, by the most adult means possible, with sex and drugs, but also with her own political awakening: Cyrus is now digging deep into LGBT rights and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/10/proper-punk-miley-cyrus-madonna-sexuality\">talking openly about her experience of gender</a>, of not fitting the norms. It seems that cute is losing its appeal, to be replaced by substance, and arguments, and women with bigger, harder, stronger lives, all of which makes politics a bloody exciting place to be right now. Well, apart from the bits of it that involve actual politicians.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435142307973/Heawood-27-June-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Illustration: Nishant Choksi for the Guardian","credit":"Nishant Choksi/Guardian","altText":"Heawood 27 June","cleanCaption":"  Illustration: Nishant Choksi for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435144329170/c8ce7c94-08b6-4c1f-80fa-649c96950899-2060x1918.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1918,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Illustration: Nishant Choksi for the Guardian","altText":"Sophie Heawood column illo 27/6/15","cleanCredit":"Illustration: Nishant Choksi for the Guardian"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-27T04:59:06Z","lastModified":"2015-06-27T04:59:06Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Sophie Heawood","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/21/1421850753867/Sophie-Heawood-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sophieheawood"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Life and style","Politics","UK news","Taylor Swift","Music","Charlotte Church","Miley Cyrus"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"music/taylor-swift","webTitle":"Taylor Swift"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"music/charlotte-church","webTitle":"Charlotte Church"},{"id":"music/miley-cyrus","webTitle":"Miley Cyrus"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sophie Heawood","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sophieheawood"}}],"series":{"title":"Sophie Heawood's Weekend column","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/sophie-heawoods-weekend-column"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/sophie-heawood-taylor-swift-making-politics-exciting","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3bf","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/sophie-heawood-taylor-swift-making-politics-exciting","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/sophie-heawood-taylor-swift-making-politics-exciting"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":3,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435142307973/Heawood-27-June-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Illustration: Nishant Choksi for the Guardian","credit":"Nishant Choksi/Guardian","altText":"Heawood 27 June","cleanCaption":"  Illustration: Nishant Choksi for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"Children should steer clear of their parents’ sex lives","rawTitle":"Children should steer clear of their parents’ sex lives","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jun/26/children-should-steer-clear-of-their-parents-sex-lives","title":"Children should steer clear of their parents’ sex lives","trailText":"A reader is angry because her father is having an affair and and her mother seems to accept the situation.

Annalisa Barbieri gives her advice","byline":"Annalisa Barbieri","body":"<p><strong>A few months ago, my 68-year-old father gave me his old laptop. But he hadn’t logged out of an account, and I discovered he was declaring his love for someone not his wife/my mother. </strong></p> \n<p><strong>I challenged him, after which he informed my mum and brother that I was causing trouble. They believed me, although I have not had the best of relationships with either of them. </strong></p> \n<p><strong>After four weeks of insulting me, blaming my mum and everyone else, denial and obfuscation, he admitted he’d had unprotected sex with the woman, a supposed family friend he was helping, and that she is in prostitution. He also had an affair 35 years ago when my brother was a baby. </strong></p> \n<p><strong>My mum has decided not to take any action, but to carry on as they were because she can’t bear the stress of the upheaval and is worried about money and her home, despite our assurances that she would be OK. She is not a confident person, was depressed after the last known episode, and is quite isolated.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>I am livid at my father’s behaviour. I doubt very much he hasn’t been up to something in the intervening years. He had presented himself to me as a model, kind, caring man and I fear I have enabled his egotism over the years by being daddy’s girl. I never want to have any contact with him again. I am perturbed by my mum’s acceptance of the situation and by how much worse things could get if he carries on behaving this way. How can I support my mum but also not allow him to get away with what he has done?</strong></p> \n<p>I understand that you are hurt, that perhaps your father isn’t the man you thought he was. I understand you are angry at your mother for the things you see she has failed to do. But children should never get involved in the business of parents’ sex lives, and once the hurt and confusion fades I think you need to think about why your reaction is so extreme.</p> \n<p>Sure, be annoyed with your mum or dad for a myriad of other reasons but I think you are a bit confused about what is your business, and what isn’t. It’s their sex life, not yours. Talking of which, there was no mention in your letter of your own personal life.</p> \n<p>I consulted couples psychotherapist Joanna Rosenthall (<a href=\"http://www.bps.org.uk/\" title=\"\">bps.org.uk</a>), who wondered whether things might have got out of balance in your family. She thought you sounded almost as if you felt your dad had been unfaithful to you. She said these imbalances might be caused if a child hadn’t been helped to separate out and learn to be outside their parents’ relationship.</p> \n<p>For example, such a child may have been used as a confidante too often or too early in life or both. This demarcation – between your own life and your parents’ – is crucial to your own identity and not being recruited into a “couple” with one of them. “The couple relationship between two adults,” Rosenthall explains, “is very different to that between a parent and child, and there should be no confusion between the two.”</p> \n<p>Also if we over-identify with people, in this case your parents, when they let us down or we think we don’t know “who they are any more”, it rather makes us feel we don’t know who we are any more either. And I feel a little bit of that is happening here.</p> \n<p>I think it’s important to acknowledge that anyone would be upset by their father having an affair and taking risks, but that shouldn’t really lead to one becoming over-involved in what happens next. It really is between your mum and dad.</p> \n<p>You seem really angry with your mum for her choices but maybe, for her, they are the only ones she has. Just because your mum won’t do what you think she should do, doesn’t mean you can’t still support her if you choose.</p> \n<p>Rosenthall wondered if you were trying to parent your own parents: “Children sometimes have been invited into that position and it makes it very hard for them to develop a solid, separate identity of their own. There’s something terribly important about people feeling independent enough to make their own decisions and leaving their parents to make theirs.”</p> \n<p>When we get out-of-proportion angry with a situation, we need to look at why. You sound as if you feel “hoodwinked” by your dad and I wonder if that played out in your life – your experiences of other men perhaps? – and maybe that was making you extra angry.</p> \n<p>So, what can you do? “Support,” says Rosenthall, “is about doing just that – supporting, not judging. Applying pressure never feels supportive.”</p> \n<p>Adult relationships between a couple are sophisticated, multilayered. Often confusing to others looking in. I hope you can find a way of supporting your parents while at the same time realising they are not perfect – I know that’s an illusion-shattering moment.
