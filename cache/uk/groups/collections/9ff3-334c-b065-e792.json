If it is in crisis, Britain is in crisis. For reasons that may never be fathomed, the motoring show joins the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/may/20/marks-spencer-profits-jump-mark-bolland\" title=\"\">health of Marks &amp; Spencer sales</a> and the porosity of Manchester United’s back four as key indicators of Where We Are At as a&nbsp;country.</p> \n<p>Maddeningly, some people still haven’t got the memo. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02v7q9l/player\" title=\"\">Interviewing Tony Hall on his programme last Sunday</a>, Andrew Marr completely let the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/media/tony-hall\" title=\"\">BBC director general</a> off the hook, questioning him for what felt like a mere 37 minutes on the matter of Top Gear. Disappointing, Marr: I accept you&nbsp;asked 98.7% of all possible questions relating to the programme in&nbsp;its past and future incarnations, but you had a real opportunity to probe Hall on the precise clauses relating to hot-steak provision in Chris Evans’s contract, and you flunked it. Is it true that the DG personally ordered the destruction of all footage of the time James Spader and Rosanna Arquette did <a href=\"http://www.topgear.com/uk/track-guide?LapType=Kia-Ceed\" title=\"\">Star in a Reasonably Priced Car</a>, believing its depravity capable of destroying the corporation? It would have been nice if he had been asked.</p> \n<p>That said, could the current motoring show battle be any sexier? In&nbsp;the south, Jeremy Clarkson marshals his forces to unleash a rival programme, probably via <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/media/netflix\" title=\"\">Netflix</a>, while undermining his successor by claiming a BBC executive offered him his job back in&nbsp;the days before Chris Evans was announced as the new Top Gear host. In the north, Evans retaliates by alluding to “the voices” in Jeremy’s head. Then, purring up on the inside in&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://wackyraces.wikia.com/wiki/Penelope_Pitstop\" title=\"\">Compact Pussycat</a> comes Carol Vorderman, who says she was in the hotel bar where Clarkson met the BBC executive and that he told her the job offer story at the time. By Christmas, every British citizen will have had to pick a&nbsp;side – if you can’t choose, just do Eeny Meeny Miny Mo – and the country will erupt into cathartic civil war.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a4cea0ed0b8ec42c91ad8845d585d3377c0180f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435246255326/fbce44db-3ad0-43d5-8f69-c55b8fab92bb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The old guard: (left to right) Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May in Top Gear earlier this year.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The old guard: (left to right) Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May in Top Gear earlier this year.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC Worldwide Limited/BBC Worldwide Limited</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The main thing to realise is that it can only be this way. Like “desert mode” on a Range Rover Vogue, controversy comes as standard, because if you can’t use cars to examine the fissures in civil society, then what on earth is the point of cars? My feeling is that the breakaway Clarkson show will consider revisiting the segment in one of last year’s Top Gears when Richard Hammond revealed he had painted a confederate flag on the roof of his Toyota Corolla when he was 17. “Twelve Years a Hammond,” observed Clarkson, much to the delight of the studio audience. (I&nbsp;have a terrible weakness for the studio audience: where else can you see crowds of blokes gathered round a&nbsp;car, shifting slightly awkwardly from foot to foot and trying not to meet each other’s eyes? All right, where else apart from a&nbsp;secluded layby off the A404 of a&nbsp;Saturday night?)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3337e5ea50e3c5e14bc42f7cc10f8726a0c26e0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435246484207/d60ffdfc-6703-41ae-b643-9eb89dd8814c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Way to go?

When David Cronenberg tried something extremely similar with his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSsYUAKGQs4&amp;oref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DiSsYUAKGQs4&amp;has_verified=1\" title=\"\">brilliant movie Crash</a>, where did it get him? <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/crash-faces-ban-from-west-end-1351586.html\" title=\"\">Banned (shamefully) by Westminster council</a>. That, I’m afraid, is what market failure looks like, and it&nbsp;is to the eternal credit of the BBC that it realised the national broadcaster needed to step in and covertly service those given to lurking in motoring forums and typing “I would literally have sex with this car” under pictures of a blacked-out Audi RS5.</p> \n<p>Indeed, it is a tribute to the gossamer touch of the show’s production team that this surreptitious celebration of the other kind of auto-eroticism was possible for so long. It certainly required extensive misdirection. Biannual race rows, international diplomatic incidents: these were all wildly successful ploys to get the spluttering classes to look the other way while Clarkson &amp; Co took a hot hatch to the dark side.</p> \n<p>Clearly, both the Evans and Clarkson vehicles will now be looking for eye-catching initiatives to draw the headlines and ratings. Might Lost in&nbsp;Showbiz respectfully suggest a&nbsp;campaign for the decriminalisation of mechanophilia? Heaven knows how it is still possible in this day and age that those whose only crime is to have had it off with a car are still required to sign the sex offenders’ register if they’re caught – <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanophilia\" title=\"\">but it is</a>. In the name of sanity, let one or other of these vehicular warrior programmes use their immense power for good. Let’s end the stigma. Let’s get this show on the road.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435244403942/ab295bf9-08c5-4e33-89c6-9795f7470918-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Beretta/Sims/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Chris Evans (left), who will now be in the driving seat at Top Gear following the departure of Jeremy Clarkson.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Beretta/Sims/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435246256781/fbce44db-3ad0-43d5-8f69-c55b8fab92bb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The old guard: (left to right) Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May in Top Gear earlier this year.

Some friends and I wanted to recapture something of our childhoods, so took a trip to one of the only three remaining Sizzler restaurants in Sydney. In the new millenium, Sizzler restaurants had become outcasts, scattered out far away from Sydney’s CBD. </p> \n<p>For kids of the 90s, there are certain Sydney landmarks which held special meaning. For me, they were Sizzler, Wonderland, Old Sydney Town and, to a lesser extent, Sega World. Of those four, only Sizzler remained open, so it become the destination for our bittersweet journey. The nearest Sizzler to us was in Carramar, a suburb 30km from the city, which will now always be associated with my own endless salad bar version of the Last Supper.</p> \n<p>The door to the restaurant declared: “We request our guests maintain a neat, casual standard of dress. (Footwear MUST be worn)”. </p> \n<p>The words “all-you-can-eat” and “dress code” don’t always go hand in hand, but Sizzler was the exception. </p> \n<p>We surveyed the menu but, in truth, we were only there for the complimentary cheese toast. I don’t care to know what caused Sizzler’s demise but I think you have to wonder about the financial viability of a business whose flagship meal item – cheese toast – was free.</p> \n<p>You really can’t overstate the brilliance of <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/heres-the-sizzler-cheese-bread-recipe/story-fnkgdftz-1227415724258\">Sizzler’s cheese toast</a>. If Sizzler’s owners had any sense, they’d rebrand as a chain of restaurants called Just Cheese Toast. Sizzler’s version – crunchy on the top but soft on the bottom – is like butter chicken at an Indian restaurant: it’s really all we were there for.</p> \n<p>But don’t try to tempt me with the salad bar. Although it was described in advertising as “endless”, for me it was beginningless. Urban legends about bacteria and the sight of some customers choosing to ditch tongs in lieu of their own fingers made it a no-go zone.</p> \n<p>We left Carramar, pregnant with food and looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Junior.

I have a busy life and I’m reluctant to<br />sacrifice several hours for someone whom I don’t know anything about.<br />But persuading someone to write more than a few words at a time is<br />proving increasingly difficult. My standard reply to someone with a<br />blank page is: “Get back to me when you’ve filled in your profile.” I<br />used to think that this was a reasonable request but here’s a response<br />I received recently: “It’s going to take a long time I can’t type with<br />this little thing :(</em>”</p> \n<p><em>These days when I ask someone what they were up to on the weekend or<br />what type of music they’re into, I never hear from them again.<br />Presumably responding would be too much effort and maybe there are<br />plenty of other women who are flirtatious straight away and more fun<br />to chat to. Personally I find nothing more off-putting than inane<br />chit-chat, but I haven’t had a date in months and I’m losing hope. Now<br />that most people use their mobile phone to access dating sites, is it<br />unreasonable to expect whole sentences and even the occasional<br />paragraph?<br /></em><br />***<br />Hey, you,<br />Is it unreasonable to expect whole sentences and even the occasional<br />paragraph? No. Can you compel anyone to write you whole sentences and<br />even the occasional paragraph? Probably not.<br />Friend, I am totally in your camp about wanting a bit of a conversation before I meet someone. As I’ve said before, I’ve never had an <em tabindex=\"-1\">awful</em> experience meeting someone I’ve met online because I don’t meet up with anyone who can’t sustain a brief exchange and make me smile, or laugh, via message.Whether we will have chemistry IRL is, of course, a whole other kettle of fish, but passing the smile/chuckle test usually indicates that we’ll be able to sustain a conversation for the length of time that it takes to drink a cup of coffee.</p> \n<p>So, if you’re concerned that your lack of dates might be due to you having the much-maligned “high standards”, then rest assured, you don’t: just as some people might only want to go on a date with blondes or firefighters or cat owners, it’s not crazy for you to filter out people who lack the wherewithal to write a few friendly sentences using their thumbs.<br />That said: you say that you hate inane chit-chat, and yet you also tend to ask questions like what kind of music someone is into, or what they did over the weekend. These kinds of conversation starters tend to lead to inane chit-chat, and it may be that the kind of men who don’t respond are just the ones you’d like to meet – they don’t like boring conversation either!<br />In my experience, the best way to get a conversation going is to ask a pretty specific question about something in a potential date’s photos: where was s/he when s/he ate that sandwich, is that hat part of his/her work uniform, does that sleepy tiger live with him/her? </p> \n<p>It’s not about seeking real insight, but rather about signalling that you’re interested in the person in a personal way, rather than sending the same generic question to everyone. Will you get a response? There’s no guarantee, but I think you may find that your chances of getting someone to send you something with correct punctuation are dramatically increased. And as for the folks who are not filling out their profiles? Don’t worry about them. If they haven’t yet been inclined to put in the effort, it’s unlikely they ever will. <br />Love,</p> \n<p>Eva<br /></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/18/1424288200250/8482d09f-2079-4ce7-a9ba-f5e4e8723902-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Celine Loup","altText":"Swipe right","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Celine Loup"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-25T12:48:49Z","lastModified":"2015-06-25T14:06:59Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":28,"contributors":[{"name":"Eva","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/12/1423746169115/Eva-Anonymous.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/eva"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Life and style","Dating","Sex","Online dating"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/dating","webTitle":"Dating"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/sex","webTitle":"Sex"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/online-dating","webTitle":"Online dating"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Eva","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/eva"}}],"series":{"title":"Swipe right - online dating for the real world","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/swipe-right"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/25/tinder-online-dating-start-better-conversations","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a523","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/25/tinder-online-dating-start-better-conversations","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/25/tinder-online-dating-start-better-conversations"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/18/1424288200250/8482d09f-2079-4ce7-a9ba-f5e4e8723902-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Swipe right: online dating for the real world.

In Finland, it’s even illegal </p>","byline":"Sofija Stefanovic","body":"<p>If you want to start a fight in a dog park, mention crates and watch the pro- and anti- tempers rise. </p> \n<p>The process of crate training consists of keeping a puppy in a crate and letting it out to pee and poop. A dog won’t soil where it sleeps, so it will hold on until you let it outside. Many people continue using a crate throughout their dog’s adulthood to avoid destructive behaviors, or because they believe a crate makes a dog feel safe. </p> \n<p>Crate training supporters cite experts arguing that such dogs thrive. Opponents shout just as loudly (“Dogschwitz-Barkenau” is how a Jewish friend refers to the enclosure).</p> \n<p>I recently moved to the US from Australia with my two small dogs, and quickly learned that, unlike back home, many Americans are pro-crate. </p> \n<p>When we visited our new vet, the Village Veterinarian in New York City, practice manager Nina Torres told me their recommendation was to crate train. According to Torres, this allows dog owners to set boundaries, which results in less anxious dogs. “You confuse them if you allow them everywhere,” she says. According to Torres, about 80% of the clinic’s canine patients spend their days – when their owners work – in crates. </p> \n<p>When I asked John Parncutt in Australia (of John the Vet, our previous clinic) how many of his patients use crates, he said it’s a minority – and that the dogs are crated overnight, rather than during the day. “I probably hear from someone about once every couple of months saying they’re going to be crate-training their new pup.” </p> \n<p>The only person I knew in Australia to crate train a dog is Sheryl, an American living in Melbourne. In New York, Sheryl says, “everyone did it”. She decided to crate train her pup in Australia, putting Dizzy the schnoodle in a crate overnight (getting up every three hours to let her pee) and while she was at work, during which time a dog walker would come. That’s a total of about 16 hours a day in a crate. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f0e170bceda7b73ef5f8f01e09d8b93bc0096a0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435163599372/32a65656-2f01-4ec0-8236-47de6250aeda-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Americans\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ASPCA says crates are best as a short-term management tool.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sheryl was shocked by the reaction Australians had to it. “It’s the biggest fight I had with my mother-in-law” Sheryl says. “She thought it was cruel, that it was like the dog was in a circus.” </p> \n<p>At work, Sheryl’s colleagues sent her photo-shopped images of Dizzy, in prison garb. But with the help of the crate, Dizzy was housetrained in just three months. “After a year, we stopped locking her in,” Sheryl says. Now Dizzy’s crate stays open, and she goes voluntarily into it each evening. </p> \n<p>The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other organizations compare a crate to a den: a safe space that dogs are naturally drawn to. ASPCA says crates are “best used as a relatively short-term management tool, not as a lifetime pattern of housing”. This is where opinions divide. Nina Torres says it’s fine for most adult dogs to be in a crate “nine hours maximum” during the day (with a walk in the middle), and then eight hours at night – unless they are seniors or large dogs needing to stretch their joints.</p> \n<p>I work from home, so I observe my dogs’ behavior during the day. Though it is true that they sleep most of the time (as they would in a closed crate), they have their preferences. Sonia will often drag her blanket, mat and toy out and into a patch of sunlight. Natasha usually stays deep in her crate, under a blanket from where she yips every now and then as she dreams. </p> \n<p>In an experiment where I locked the crates, Natasha was content, while Sonia whined, working the latch with her claws, eventually opening it to escape (like the velociraptors in Jurassic Park). With the right training, would Sonia learn to love her crate, or is it just something that doesn’t appeal to her individual nature?</p> \n<p>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) has come out strong against this, claiming that wolves, dogs and other canids in the wild spend their first eight weeks in a den, and after that, they abandon it. “And since dens don’t come with a locked door, there is no true scientific comparison between crates and dens,” Peta’s website adds.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, in the US crates have taken off – with celebrity dog trainers like Cesar Millan, authors like The Monks of New Skete, and other professionals giving it the thumbs-up. </p> \n<p>Liisa Tikka, a dog trainer working in Helsinki, finds the trend disturbing. “We have trouble with some dog-training books written in the US promoting crating. People do not understand that it’s not considered an ethical solution here – and that it’s illegal.” </p> \n<p>Finnish law states than an animal can be in a crate only for “transportation, illness or other temporary and acceptable reason”. And if you want to keep your dog in an enclosed space while you’re at work, you have to follow strict and roomy guidelines – for example, a Labrador would need an enclosure approximately 37 square foot (in the US, the ASPCA asks a crate be large enough “so that your dog can lie down comfortably, stand up without having to crouch and easily turn around in a circle”). </p> \n<p>You can probably guess where Emma and Ray Lincoln, authors of Dogs Hate Crates, stand on the subject. “Americans have never been so in love with the concept of owning dogs while being so ill-equipped to give dogs the face-time, exercise, socialization and purpose in life they need,” Emma tells me. </p> \n<p>The Lincolns see crating as a “quick fix” for problem behavior. “People realized this is the easy way to deal with any behavior with a dog,” Ray Lincoln says. If a dog is chewing, peeing or being hyperactive, if you put it in a crate, “the behavior stops, because the dog can’t do anything, so he shuts down”.</p> \n<p>The Lincolns believe that prolonged confinement can be damaging – and they say some people lock pet dogs in tiny crates for up to 18–22 hours total per day. Over-crated dogs, they say, can suffer complications from “cage-rage”, to anxiety, fearfulness and depression.</p> \n<p>Tikka, who, as part of her Helsinki school runs a Canine Good Citizens course, says “I think crates are a good place to teach the dog to relax in a difficult stressful environment, like dog shows or competitions. I do not approve of its use in the house.” She adds: “The Finns are very practical and they do understand that a puppy is a puppy – and it will pee on carpets and chew the furniture and that’s life.” </p> \n<p>Wolves travel hundreds of miles and hunt prey in packs. My dogs live in New York City, where they hunt pizza crusts from sidewalks. Their life is a far cry from that of their ancestors. I keep them active by walking them, hiding treats in their Kongs, and playing videos of horses, which make them dance on two legs and howl like wild. And I’ve decided to keep their crates open.

Without Kickstarter, Crowdfunder, Crowdcube et al, the innovative schemes of countless chefs, restaurateurs and culinary inventors would have withered and died on the carpet tiles of a bank-manager’s office. But for every piece of culinary brilliance they’ve gifted us, there are the brain farts. The monkey tennis. The ones you wouldn’t waste the back of your fag packet on. Essentially, it’s like a global Britain’s Got Talent of food-based ideas, only some of them are good. Here’s our guide to the most weird and wonderful offerings out there right now.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/332642838/its-not-a-bread-knife-its-the-sandwich-knife\"><strong>The sandwich knife</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfc39cbd13e7b0e07f590d22b7edbd458531f160\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435155757371/35c93e4d-c71a-4d26-ba46-f4ed401ba32d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sandwich knife\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sandwich knife. Of course.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“It’s not a bread knife, it’s a sandwich knife,” claims the Kickstarter page for this product from Toronto. We’re looking at a serrated, two-bladed knife that uses one motion to slice two pieces of bread. According to the promo video, its USP is its “parallel and vertically offset blade configuration”. Or, as we might think of it, “the way it glues two bread knives together and tries to flog them to credulous chumps”.</p> \n<p><strong>Will it hit its target?</strong> Its goal is C$22,500 (&pound;11,600); with just hours to go, it has raised C$6,586. Will enough people consider saving the hassle of slicing twice to be worth C$25? I’d guess no.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/clear-coffee#/story\"><strong>Clear coffee</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3a4a422068b9902138aa172b1be7011ad7d824b6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435155912377/77ae4df9-dbd2-41e5-b12d-af976b48387a-366x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Clear coffee\" width=\"366\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tastes better than it looks, apparently.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Do we need coffee that looks like petrol? Entrepreneurs in the Slovakian city of Košice want to launch a see-through coffee, the main purpose of which is to “not negatively affect the whiteness of your teeth”. Actually, this isn’t a terrible idea, and judging by the promo video of it being taste-tested by random people on the street, it has exciting possibilities. Their lack of any scientific explanation is a worry, though.</p> \n<p><strong>Will it hit its target? </strong>I wouldn’t bet on it. It has taken 30 days to raise €327 (&pound;233) – 1% of the €35,000 required – with 24 days left to go.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dausage/the-dausage-a-cross-between-a-sausage-and-a-doughn\"><strong>The Dausage</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4cae79ab5512a3369bb530fbe716e7ad16b806c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435156018216/f093c7db-f43a-47b2-b669-f712ab45bbe0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Dausage\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jam plus sausage equals Dausage.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“A cross between a sausage and a doughnut,” excitedly exclaim the people behind this Welsh startup, attempting to muscle in on the cronut craze of years gone by. “There are no finer foods in the world than sausages and doughnuts, but they seldom appear together,” point out the would-be purveyors of the jam-filled meat tubes. The photos look grisly, with a botched-home-vasectomy aesthetic. The video shows jam oozing out as someone off-camera slits the sausage’s top end. Apparently, the combination of sweet and meat has gone down very well in extensive taste tests. I’m happy to take their word for it.</p> \n<p><strong>Will it hit its target?</strong> With five days to go, it’s stalled at just more than a third of its &pound;2,500 goal. Not a banger, then.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/489252126/beerdecoded-the-1000-beer-genomes?ref=category\"><strong>Decoded beer</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"109baf1161009806e42502092e470f2733ee2275\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435156113773/04b144ad-25a6-4a29-885e-c33903c4152a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Beer decoding\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Decoding some beer, presumably.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A “citizen science” project from Geneva that aims to map the flavours of beer. The idea is that each beer has a distinct genome, which they call “the beer’s DNA”, that these bods can plot on a big family tree of beer to provide a scientific categorisation of beer flavours. It sounds like it was devised after much sampling of beer genomes, but they do wear lab coats in the video, so maybe they know what they’re talking about. Beer and science, two of the internet’s favourite things: got to be a winner.</p> \n<p><strong>Will it hit its target?</strong> It already has, attracting €10,219 of its €10,000 goal with a few days left to go.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/232285519/the-worlds-first-petting-zoo-and-gourmet-chocolate?ref=category\"><strong>A petting zoo and gourmet chocolate shop</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcae4d398e4846133f7fe708cec91b80f500a019\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435156227957/05957927-29fc-476d-91b6-7d5b381a12c3-460x331.jpeg\" alt=\"Zebras\" width=\"460\" height=\"331\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some zebras.

Customers are chauffeured by horse-drawn carriage to pet real live zebras, emus, alpacas and a range of mini animals (pigs, cows, horses) while chomping champagne truffles. The money is for repairs and new pens, and investing will earn you boxes of chocs or an overnight stay.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"86bff8aa16a0ce23c69cb6ff6218ede567d56df1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435156428791/8f1eab31-f285-4758-90e2-5c2cccd8d052-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Before Elixir\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Magic juice for drinking.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Will it hit its target?</strong> With three days to go and $30,000 (&pound;19,100) to reach, it’s earned a grand total of zero. So probably not.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/pretty-fcking-good-toast/\"><strong>Mobile toast</strong></a></h2> \n<p>This is an attempt to raise cash to create a mobile street-food stall by sprucing up the knackered-looking bike of a chef in Hackney Wick with a pedigree in toasting sourdough bread. The solitary photo of what appears to be a gigantic DJ’s record box welded to the front of a bike suggests this is a very deserving case. Then again, the entirely detail-free write-up suggests that what they really need is some ideas.</p> \n<p><strong>Will it hit its target?</strong> He’s raised just &pound;100 of the &pound;3,500 he’s after. But. A street-food stall. On a bike. Sourdough bread. Hackney Wick. Essentially, it’s a ludicrous rollcall of hipster cliches. So – judging by <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/supper-tub-londons-next-hot-tub-thing-is-a-3course-meal-and-frozen-cocktails-10307549.html\">hot-tub-based restaurant Suppertub</a> and Cannabistro, the <a href=\"http://cannabistro.grubclub.com/\">weed-themed restaurant in Dalston</a>, both of which open on Friday – probably.</p> \n<p><strong> <br /></strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Those we backed</strong></h2> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/before-elixir#description\"><strong>Before Elixir</strong></a></h2> \n<p>A red beverage that apparently cures “alcohol flush reaction”, by which booze causes your skin to turn red and blotchy. Drink it before you imbibe and its blend of fruit, milk thistle and B vitamins will reduce the amount of toxins your liver produces in response to your attempts to pickle it.</p> \n<p><strong>How much did it raise?</strong> Almost 10% more than its target, $13,575.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2028227986/bocusini-worlds-first-plug-and-play-3d-food-printi/\"><strong>Bocusini</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"380c1c688a598b4460dbde1975fb39673fc1df87\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435156353040/ee7b6df4-0662-4b46-822d-f16826992b76-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Bocusini 3D printer\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bocusini printer. One day, you could be this happy.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>3D food printing is big in crowdfunding circles – this is at least the second successful venture in a year. Put a little food-filled cartridge into the machine, create a design on your computer and then, judging by the demo video, make a tiny maze from mortadella, a creepy, mashed-potato octopus or write someone a message in jam. Useless or utterly, bafflingly ingenious.</p> \n<p><strong>How much did it raise?</strong> €40,581 – over €10,000 more than they asked for. People really do enjoy playing with their food.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/crik-nutrition-delicious-cricket-protein-powder/x/10060804\"><strong>Cricket protein powder</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c1a939801e68075be736baeac493e3e8a6e7282\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435156586234/ac4c0c77-491a-49ff-9487-dd5ed7f34fc4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A cricket\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cricket protein powder, seen here in non-powder form.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Desperate for a muscle tone that says “unitard full of melons”, but worried that your insatiable bulk-lust is ruining the environment? This protein powder claims to assuage your conscience.
