She has zero money, is very deep into her overdraft and spends money on the most absurd things. I have to pay for her food out of my student loan, but she refuses to get a job. She just sits at her desk all day sharing junk on Facebook. I try to be polite and understanding, but whenever I say something about this she accuses me of being “verbally abusive”. She cannot take any criticism even though it is clearly constructive. I appreciate that it’s hard for a parent to receive advice from their 20-year-old son, but should I just leave her to wallow?</em></p> \n<p><strong>Mariella replies</strong> I have a theory. There comes a point in every child’s life when you reach the same level of maturity as one or both of your parents. It can take many years to appreciate that the dynamic has significantly altered and is often at the epicentre of other problems between you and your creators.</p> \n<p>Generally, once you’ve passed that critical juncture the disparity increases, and parents can feel like an increasing problem the older we (and they) get. Eventually it can feel like you’re dealing with bloody-minded toddlers, which is yet another of life’s little ironies. Once your paths have diverged, you continue becoming a more responsible adult and they become increasingly irresponsible, relying on you for everything you once needed from them.</p> \n<p>As with all relationships it’s entirely subjective and experienced at a different age and in disparate ways by each of us. As a phenomenon it’s curiously similar to the trauma experienced by parents when their children finally embrace independence and leave home, and offers further proof that we live not in a linear way but a circular pattern.</p> \n<p>For slow developers it can take well into your 40s or 50s before you catch up with Mum and Dad – some never do – while for others it can happen at a poignantly precocious point in childhood. I’ve seen serious little eight-year-olds trying to negotiate the responsibilities of caring for the unreliable adults in their lives. It’s heartbreaking to witness.</p> \n<p>Luckily you’ve managed to reach first base in terms of adulthood before having such unwelcome duties thrust on you, and while it’s not an easy burden to shoulder, there are definitely ways of making it less hard. You’re old enough to cope far better than the youngsters I just described.</p> \n<p>Plenty feel unfettered by genealogical lineage and focus purely on their own forward momentum. Personally, I’m for walking a middle line. There’s enough drama around us without whipping it up in your closest circle if it’s avoidable. Few of us don’t aspire to close relations with our families. That sort of solid familial ground to launch yourself into life from is enviable and surely merits reciprocal treatment when the baton is passed from the older to the younger hand. That’s in a perfect world, which this is not!</p> \n<p>For many of us the perils of our parents in close proximity are a torture, and tangible distance – emotionally and even geographically – is the only respite. Choosing to bring a child into this world and later giving them no option but to parent you is not a fair deal, but behaving magnanimously out of guilt, shame or expediency isn’t a healthy option either, and resentment takes a similar toll on all within its catchment.</p> \n<p>Many of us, once we surpass our parents’ ability to act like responsible adults, need to separate from them, even if it’s just to establish acceptable boundaries on both sides. Your story suggests it’s time for you to draw a line between your mother’s expectations and what you are prepared to offer. She needs to look beyond her computer screen and take responsibility for a life that’s not even half lived (hopefully).</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, your energies will benefit you both much better in the future if at present they are directed to your studies and the enriching experience of living life on your own terms. It will come as little surprise to you that your parent isn’t perfect. I suspect straight talking and direct action may be your best accomplices in achieving mutual understanding here. Good luck.</p> \n<p><em>If you have a dilemma, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk\">mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk</a>.</em></p> \n<p><em>Follow Mariella on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mariellaf1\">@mariellaf1</a></em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435665583901/The-back-of-a-student-wit-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'It’s time for you to draw a line between your mother’s expectations and what you are prepared to offer': Mariella advises a student.

Will the same now happen to brilliant comedian Amy Schumer?</p>","byline":"Eva Wiseman","body":"<p>A group of men sit round a table and make one of the most memorable bits of TV I’ve seen. In a perfect remake of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2013/nov/26/juror-view-twelve-angry-men\"><em>12 Angry Men</em></a>, Paul Giamatti, Jeff Goldblum, and Dennis Quaid argue furiously across an episode of Comedy Central’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/feb/09/inside-amy-schumer-judd-apatow\"><em>Inside Amy Schumer</em></a>, their shirts becoming increasingly rumpled. But instead of debating the innocence of a boy accused of murdering his own father, the jurors must decide whether or not comedian Schumer is hot enough to be on TV. “Look, we’ve all at some point in our lives gotten a semi for a girl with a pillowy stomach or Muppet tits,” the Fonda stand-in sweats, attempting to persuade his peers that comedian Schumer, while not hot, is still “bangable”. “And that’s all the system demands for us to acquit Amy.” The room becomes claustrophobic. A man breaks down. This is probably the best, most political comedy sketch to feature duelling dildos that you’ll see all year.</p> \n<p>There’s a scene in <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/tina-fey\">Tina Fey</a>’s memoir <em>Bossypants</em> where <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/culture/amy-poehler\">Amy Poehler</a> is practising a new joke on her <em>Saturday Night Live</em> colleagues, and Jimmy Fallon shouts: “Stop that! It’s not cute! I don’t like it.” “I don’t fucking care if you like it,” Poehler replies, with dark-eyed calm. “With that exchange, a cosmic shift took place,” Fey recalls. “Amy made it clear that she wasn’t there to be cute.” Like the 12 Angry Men – real-life incarnations of whom you can find right now commenting below-the-line – much of Schumer’s comedy (the second season of <em>Inside Amy Schumer</em> is out in the UK this summer) is the embodiment of this exchange. Fey cameos in an episode, along with Patricia Arquette and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/culture/julia-louis-dreyfus\">Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a>. Schumer stumbles across them having a picnic – they’re performing a Viking funeral to celebrate what the media have decided is Julia’s “last fuckable day”.</p> \n<p>Schumer’s genius is in delivering a message as a hilarious joke. She pierces female stereotypes, Hollywood beauty standards, body-image issues and misogyny without ever using the words “female stereotypes, Hollywood beauty standards, body image issues” or “misogyny”. But the trouble with becoming a feminist icon, as we’ve seen with heroes such as <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/culture/lena-dunham\">Lena Dunham</a>, whose fearlessness became too much for her critics to handle, is that the higher we hold them, the further they fall. In our culture, when we find a feminist star we love, we hype them all the way to an inevitable backlash. Like Lennie and the puppy, we stroke their talent sometimes to death.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba58765f95dae422a6367e12c92dc132a2c30d71\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435937498506/046fde80-57f9-48d1-8c23-b15ae3e38b92-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Amy Schumer and Dennis Quaid in 12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Schumer and Dennis Quaid in 12 Angry Men Inside Amy Schumer</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>With Dunham, the first wave of backlash came with the note that she hadn’t represented women of colour in <em>Girls</em>. The second with reports of the $3.5m fee for her memoir. The third, when her book was released, came with its own natty hashtag – #DropDunham – after a right-wing website published an extract and headlined it “Lena Dunham Describes Sexually Abusing Her Little Sister”. Despite child development experts (and her sister) defending her, she cancelled the European leg of her book tour and issued a formal apology. Some of the outrage was warranted, some really, really not, but to every criticism she responded thoughtfully and with elegance. And each time I worried that she wouldn’t, that the weight of the outrage would crush her. So as Amy Schumer (with her upcoming Judd Apatow-produced film) goes mainstream I wonder how, <em>how</em>, will the world organise to bring her down? Will <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/\">Jezebel</a> publish a photocopy of a marriage certificate proving her comedy of casual sex makes a mockery of her single fans? Will she fail to reply to a tweet from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/05/caitlyn-jenner-from-olympic-hero-and-reality-tv-star-to-transgender-heroine\">Caitlyn Jenner</a> and thus spark a civil war between radical feminists and the trans community? Will <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/?country=uk\">Buzzfeed</a> trace the provenance of her human hair extensions or ivory nails?</p> \n<p>Why do we demand that our favourite women are not just great artists but perfect role models, too? Part of me wants to scream Amy Schumer quotes in caps lock all day, but the rest of me wants her name firewalled from the UK to prevent another female star from being felled by a single domestic mistake. Or for failing to speak for every woman everywhere. Call this a preemptive strike, a deep sigh heard from space. No outrage this time. Hype needn’t lead to humiliation.

Then it turned up out of the blue only to disappear again, months later …","byline":"Adrian Turpin","body":"<p>This is the story of an engagement ring that was lost. Nothing so odd about that, one might think. Rings go missing all the time, prey to the sink trap or the Hoover bag. A moment’s inattention is all it takes. Sometimes disappearing rings even come back.</p> \n<p>At the bleakest moments when my wife, Pru, and I thought we had lost her engagement ring for ever, I was reminded of the story from Herodotus’s Histories in which Polycrates, the king of Samos, is encouraged to throw away a precious emerald ring in order to experience what loss and hardship feels like, only to rediscover it in the belly of a fish brought to him as tribute. What we didn’t know was that our moment of rediscovery would be almost as strange. Days after we have still been unable to come up with a rational explanation.</p> \n<p>Pru knew it was the right ring the first time she saw it in the window of a slightly-beyond-my-pay-bracket London jewellers. The lozenge of black diamonds, set on a rose gold band, has an understated bling. It is contemporary but it looks old, with a hint of 20s glamour. My daughter calls it the “sweet” ring because of its resemblance to a fruit pastille. (I almost wrote “called it”, so sure was I that it was lost for ever).</p> \n<p>Its behaviour was not so “sweet”. It had form on the disappearing act. One morning, not long after we were married in 2010, the ring made its first bid for freedom. One minute it was there, in a little bowl next to the bed, an hour later it wasn’t on Pru’s finger. We began searching calmly, less so as dread rose that it had really gone. Internet appeals were issued, drawers were emptied, furniture moved; restaurants and Transport for London were rung, all with no result.</p> \n<p>We each spent a lonely summer afternoon retracing routes to the shops and the nursery. Every can top and piece of mica in the gutter sparked momentary hope. It was weeks before I could walk down the road without casting my eyes downward.</p> \n<p>We tried to be philosophical. I’ve always loved the Elizabeth Bishop poem One Art, which begins: “<em>The art of losing isn’t hard to master / so many things seem filled with the intent/ to be lost that their loss is no disaster.</em>”</p> \n<p>Yet this did feel like a disaster and I am ashamed to write that the feelings of loss– partly financial but mainly for what it signified – were accompanied by flashes of anger at my wife. How could she be so careless, so thoughtless even? It was a petty way to behave, but that’s how it felt. And if a ring is meant to be a symbolic, then perhaps it’s not so odd that there is confusion between the symbol and what is symbolised? At least that’s my excuse.</p> \n<p>Then, one morning, about a month later and at the same time after this first disappearance, the ring reappeared with no notice, twinkling enigmatically in the middle of the bedroom carpet about a foot from where it had last been seen. We whooped and hollered and danced round the house. Pru put it back on and waved her hand around manically to show the impossibility of it having come off of its own accord.</p> \n<p>Yet, for all our surprise, we weren’t amazed. My daughter called it a “naughty ring”, instinctively endowing this most mysterious of inanimate objects with a life of its own. Yet we knew there must be a reasonable explanation, it was just that we had missed something. The laws of physics had not been broken. We speculated about it being caught in bedding, while a colleague suggested that our pre-school children might have played a part. None of it mattered: we would never be so careless again.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b74d1e7cc7f86dc9624541b5429cf8389ee8c34\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435587883151/0c72d95b-c892-4afd-8794-ba3dff7f00fe-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Adrian Turpin engagement ring\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pru’s engagement ring, safely back on her finger.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was a thought that would come back to haunt us in January this year. The morning after a night at the movies came the sudden realisation that the ring wasn’t there. But how long had it not been there? Second time round, the recriminations and the sadness were worse because the ring’s absence pointed accusingly to our own foolishness.</p> \n<p>Depressingly, it wasn’t just in losing the ring that we had failed to learn from experience. We (or more accurately, I) had also learned nothing about how to deal with the loss. Amid a largely ritual emptying of bins and shaking of sheets, even harsher words were exchanged than the first time. How could anyone make the same mistake twice? I asked furiously. Why the hell wasn’t it insured?</p> \n<p>When we cleared the room for decorating a couple of months later and it still hadn’t turned up, we concluded that our luck had finally run out.</p> \n<p>We rang the jewellers, in the slightly pathetic hope that they might take pity on us and give a huge discount on a new one, which would at least be some consolation. But the cost of a replacement was prohibitive. It seemed particularly bitter – and another sign of our lack of attention – that we didn’t even have a decent picture of the thing. It hadn’t just been lost but eradicated from our shared history, the ring that never was.</p> \n<p>Or so it seemed. One Sunday evening in April, Pru was taking out empty coat-hangers from our bedroom wardrobe. She placed them on the bed, turned round and there it was: the unfamiliar but oh-so-familiar ring, threaded inexplicably on to the question mark of a metal hook. It was like the conclusion to a conjuring trick to which we never knew we’d been party.</p> \n<p>This time we were too shocked to scream and shout. It made no sense. The cupboard was on the other side of the room, too high for small hands to reach. The duvet was clear and uncluttered. The idea that the ring could have fallen on to a hanger and then been unknowingly stowed three months before seemed preposterous.</p> \n<p>Pru is a practical sort. She was delighted to get the ring back. The mystery was secondary. I am not the kind of person to believe in the supernatural. But the mischievousness of the ring’s dematerialisations and rematerialisations make it hard not flirt with the idea of a poltergeist or at least to ascribe some kind of agency to the “naughty ring” itself.</p> \n<p>Seeing the unfamiliar but oh-so-familiar piece of jewellery on its coathanger hook, I thought again of Polycrates and his ring saved by a fishing hook.

I should delete your account … and your phone number, email address and all sorts of other aspects of your online life. I sit and wonder if other people you were connected to have deleted your profile. And I stare out the window wondering if I should try to call you again.</em></p> \n<p>My husband, Iain, and I met at school when we were 17, dated in the sixth form, went our separate ways at university, then got back together and married in a flurry of excitement in 2008. Iain worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office so we lived, worked and adventured together for seven years in Delhi and Geneva. In October 2013, Iain was diagnosed with a brain tumour, and on 7 December 2014, he died in our bed at home. On that morning, my husband, our hoped for family and my future roadmap of work and travel for the next 40 years, all vanished in one shuddering breath. We were both 33.</p> \n<p>Six months along this single-track pathway, I’m repeatedly aware I have to rebuild and reshape my life – a life I can’t remember distinct from Iain. If your partner dies, a lot of admin also comes your way. And, these days, people die a digital death alongside their physical one, which creates a whole new world of admin that didn’t pass the radar of grieving widows 50 years ago. Those 20th-century widows would have had a box of love letters and a few hard copy photos; I have Facebook messages, professional videos on YouTube, personal videos on my iPhone, email histories, recorded Skype chats, WhatsApp conversations, text messages and digital photos – photos galore. And all this from a marriage with someone who never really liked spending time online. He set out his stall at 18 announcing that he wouldn’t be getting a mobile phone because they “seem pretty annoying, I doubt they’ll catch on”.</p> \n<p>I’ve found at least one blog that tries to make sense of it all. <a href=\"http://www.thedigitalbeyond.com\" title=\"\">The Digital Beyond</a>, which offers a “go-to source for archival, cultural, legal and technical insights, to help you predict and plan for the future of your online content”. Along with “scatter tubes” – tubes with a perforated lid for transporting and scattering ashes – and bespoke jewellery made from ashes, it’s another blossoming industry I never knew existed.</p> \n<p>The blog lists 54 online companies that deal specifically with aspects of dying or, more commonly, the legacy of memories online. I’m slightly spooked by the number of websites that help you send posthumous messages to your friends and relatives. <a href=\"http://tolovedones.com\" title=\"\">ToLovedOnes</a>, for example, will send letters after your death, calculating the dates they are posted “with 95% accuracy from public records”. Which just leaves me worrying about the 5% of people who receive the letters when their relative is still alive.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://knotify.me/\" title=\"\">Knotify.me</a>, meanwhile, is a free app that answers the question you never knew you had; “What happens to all my online accounts if I get amnesia, Alzheimer’s or if I leave this world?” It helps you set future notifications for your family or yourself, so “nothing of your digital life will be wasted”. <a href=\"http://www.rememberedvoices.com\" title=\"\">Remembered Voices</a> lets you record your voice and play it back to people after you’ve died, <a href=\"http://www.cirruslegacy.com\" title=\"\">Cirrus Legacy</a> stores digital assets in a single place online, so your executor can access them easily. That would have been helpful, in fact. Terry Pratchett was in the know – his recent death was announced in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terryandrob\" title=\"\">a series of tweets from his own account</a>.</p> \n<p>Just as we’re playing catch up with technology, the technology developers themselves are in the same position. Dying, understandably, didn’t feature highly in Facebook’s early risk registers. Which might be why it was in trouble recently for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32193923\" title=\"\">locking a grieving mother out of her teenage daughter’s Facebook account</a>, despite having her daughter’s permission to use it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I hadn’t anticipated the outpouring of love from around the world. There were messages from Japan, Pakistan, Chile …</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>When someone dies, Facebook tends to “memorialise” their account – freeze them so they can be viewed, but providing no access to past messages. I read that and panicked: I didn’t want that to happen, so grabbed my laptop and logged in urgently as Iain. Once in though, I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do – it didn’t feel right reading personal messages to and from other people. They weren’t for me. If he’d left a box of letters, would I have read those? People store important letters, but online messages are kept just because we don’t press delete. Should I read his emails? I didn’t. But I read and reread our text message conversations, which lifted me up so high it felt like we were actually chatting. Then when I got to the end and there were no more, it was a bad, long fall from there. So I decided memorialising was OK.</p> \n<p>Facebook also offended a fair number of bereaved people with its Year in Review clips, in which photographs that attracted the most comments were automatically selected to reappear on your timeline under the words “Here’s what your year looked like”. The problem was that for some, these were pictures of dead loved ones. And, however comforting photos and associated memories can be, out of the blue and at the wrong moment on your computer screen they can cause havoc if you are grieving.</p> \n<p>The bereaved: an oversensitive minority population, you may think, but the numbers involved are bigger than you may realise. Based on Facebook’s growth rate, and the age breakdown of its users over time, probably 10 to 20 million people who created Facebook profiles have since died. Even if Facebook closed registration tomorrow, the number of deaths per year will continue to grow for decades, as the 2000-2020 school generations grow old. And the peak? <a href=\"http://www.webpagefx.com/blog/internet/happens-online-presence-die-infographic/\" title=\"\">Nasa physicist turned full-time cartoonist Randall Munroe </a>estimates that if Facebook falls out of favour with young generations, as many social media sites do, the point at which there will be more users who have died than are living is around 2060. And if Facebook continues to thrive, that’s more like 2130.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"446d2d3ace6429d1c51d5f64623022c365f95944\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435683664595/a89fcfc8-bc81-4bb2-9d8f-6c76c959b4e4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Caroline and Iain in 1999, when they were still at school.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline and Iain in 1999, when they were still at school.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the hours and immediate few days after Iain died, I turned to the memorial website built overnight by a kind colleague to celebrate my man’s life. A bewildered and floundering group of Iain’s closest friends and family immersed ourselves in a world of photos and memories and words and purpose. Three days later, all within half an hour, the website went live, an email to the worldwide Foreign and Commonwealth Office workforce went out and I put a “global announcement” on Facebook. “Informing friends of the deceased”, 21st-century style. I changed my profile to black, shut my laptop and left the house; the internet did its thing – with speed, breadth and a rush of wildfire.</p> \n<p>I hadn’t anticipated the outpouring of love from around the world. Within minutes there were messages from Japan, Pakistan, Chile … the inhabitants of our interconnected world, suddenly spinning inwards to be connected by shock and grief, then spinning out again to their own physical pockets around the world.</p> \n<p>Today, one of the things I cherish most is an eight-second video of Iain telling me he loves me. There’s something about seeing him as if in real life and hearing his voice, that is just quite incredible. The only downside is that it’s far too short. And it’s all I’m going to get now. I wish I had more videos – they are by far the hardest thing to look at right now, but I sense that one day they will be some of the most precious things I have.</p> \n<p>Otherwise a huge comfort and unity online has come from a network for younger people whose partners have died – <a href=\"https://www.widowedandyoung.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Way (Widowed and Young)</a>. In the past month, I’ve got to know some of the 1,500 people in that group by seeing their biggest fears, their “smallest” achievements, their practical worries and their rallying strength posted online in a closed group. A sub-set of our society, normal people living normal lives that suddenly know tragedy and are thrust together in their confusion and loneliness and upset.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I've discovered that when you cry lying on your back, your tears slide into your ears, which fill up and feel strange</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I don’t use the rest of Facebook so much now – I posted a positive few things early on and hadn’t expected so many instantaneous likes and messages saying I was “amazing”. It was too surreal to be told that when you’re barely able to hold a conversation in real life, and it made me feel strange. I’m certainly not going to start covering Facebook with the reality of the new world I have found myself living in since Iain’s death – people don’t go there to see the truth if it’s not pretty.</p> \n<p>So, after I put my phone aside each evening and disconnect myself from my online communities, the moment just after my head hits the pillow is when the reality of my sadness becomes so stark. The moment I go from being exhausted to somehow feeling wide awake, when I feel so, so solo. I look over at Iain’s side of the bed and just his picture grins back at me. I poke my toe over the cold sheet and I wonder how it can be that he was right there, and now he’s not. I think about friends in their homes, with their favourite people breathing quietly beside them. I think of people listening out for babies in other rooms. For their children stirring. I want to say, “Imagine none of those people are in your house now, imagine that silence. And imagine it’s for always.” That’s how alone it feels.</p> \n<p>As I lie there I wonder, have I fallen off the end of the world? I’ve discovered that when you cry while you’re lying on your back, your tears slide into your ears, which fill up and feel strange. I shake my head. And at some point I fall asleep. And then I wake up too early and feel the same.</p> \n<p>As I take the commuter train, I look at everyone on their smartphones. I imagine there are others also scrolling through pictures of their families, just as I am with photos of Iain. I see a message from a lady, a new friend, whose husband also died of a brain tumour a few days before Iain – we’ve never met but have shared such a similarly traumatic story that we’re linked to each other now. As I go to reply, I’m aware that we’d never have connected if this had been 1915, not 2015.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/\" title=\"\"><em>thebraintumourcharity.org</em></a></p> \n<p><em>Caroline Twigg has written a book to help bereaved children.

Annalisa Barbieri advises a reader","byline":"Annalisa Barbieri","body":"<p><strong>I am 43 and have been with my husband since I was 18. We have two primary-age children. Since the birth of our youngest, we’ve had sex maybe three times per year – intimacy was/is a very rare occurrence and not enough for me, so I raised this (finally!) five years ago.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>My husband agreed to go to the GP to rule out any physiological problems, but said he did not raise the problem of his libido. After yet another talk about the situation, he said he has been depressed, and after gentle nagging, he went to the GP again. He was given mild antidepressants and, although this&nbsp;seems to have made him realise he has a problem, he has not taken the tablets. He is in better form these&nbsp;days, but there still is no intimacy.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Bottom line: My husband’s libido is down because he’s been depressed and I’m getting depressed/sad/angry because my libido’s flat-lining. I don’t feel any sensual/warm feelings towards him any more. And the clincher: Although you&nbsp;can’t currently&nbsp;tell, I have multiple sclerosis. I enjoy sex, and don’t want&nbsp;to find one day that I am immobile because of MS and have missed my chance to enjoy a full sex&nbsp;life. I don’t want to break up my family with a divorce (although this isn’t a deal breaker, my parents divorced, the consequences of which I am still feeling some 20 years later), but I don’t feel desirable any more.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>I feel that we will get through this,&nbsp;but in the meantime – in case my&nbsp;MS gets worse – should I take a lover? Pay for sex (I did enjoy a few&nbsp;tantric massages, but this is not a long-term solution so I stopped)? Divorce? Have an open relationship? Two or three times a year just isn’t&nbsp;enough.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>I get it that I’ve been talking about&nbsp;me, but I will not take responsibility for my husband’s depression. I do support him and wish he wasn’t so hard on himself, but his depression is not my responsibility – my sense of self-preservation is quite&nbsp;strong.</strong></p> \n<p>Some people are married and have affairs (secret or otherwise), some people have open marriages, some have great partnerships but no or little&nbsp;sex, and others have great sex and&nbsp;not much else. So you have choices&nbsp;– it’s up to you to work out what will and won’t work in your relationship.</p> \n<p>It is perfectly possible (although perhaps not fashionable)to see sex for the self-contained act it can be, but, paradoxically, it can also take a lot of work to keep it self-contained and I’m not sure if it will give you what you’re really looking for.</p> \n<p>I consulted the psychotherapist Chris Mills (<a href=\"http://www.ukcp.org.uk/\" title=\"\">ukcp.org.uk</a>). He thinks that “Intimacy has always been a problem for both of you. So focusing on sex and intimacy as if they are the same could be a bit of a red herring. You’ve never learned to be intimate.”</p> \n<p>This brought me on to asking what he meant by intimacy – because it can mean different things to different people. Mills told me about a definition&nbsp;he heard some years ago with which he disagreed at first but now thinks is spot on. “Intimacy means constantly keeping the other person informed about where you are in relation to them.”</p> \n<p>So it’s not about sex or even, necessarily, being physically close all the time, it’s about something else entirely. Mills says that sex can just as&nbsp;easily be used to avoid intimacy as it can to create it. He also recommends&nbsp;Googling <a href=\"http://www.estherperel.com/\" title=\"\">Esther Perel</a>, who has a lot of interesting things to say about intimacy, sex and desire for your partner in long-term relationships.</p> \n<p>Whatever you decide to do, the one thing you and your husband need to learn to do is talk to each other – I know it won’t be easy and that it’s not the answer you were looking for. I don’t think therapy is always the answer, but I think it could help you two and that you may be surprised where it leads you.</p> \n<p>I know you’re not in the UK but your GP is a good place to start for a therapist. (I will also send you a link&nbsp;to&nbsp;help you find a reputable private&nbsp;therapist in your country.) But,&nbsp;as Mills points out, “You have two&nbsp;children together and you have MS&nbsp;– there’s a lot you two are going to need to talk about in the coming years.”</p> \n<p>Your husband may be depressed because he has a low libido, or he may have a low libido because he’s depressed. He may also be having sex elsewhere (how would that change what you do/how you think, I wonder?) Also, says Mills, “Your husband may not have brought it up with the doctor&nbsp;because libido itself may not be the problem.”</p> \n<p>I note that you and your husband have been together since you, at least, were a teenager. You must have done a lot of growing in that time and perhaps who you were and what you wanted at the beginning of the relationship isn’t the same as now.</p> \n<p>Either way, you need to find a place and a way to talk to your husband because something isn’t going to magically happen to make this OK. I wonder, also, if you are getting emotional support for your MS (<a href=\"http://www.mssociety.org.uk/\" title=\"\">mssociety.org.uk</a> has good information).</p> \n<p>“The preoccupation with sex,” says Mills “is important, but maybe it’s just one rather obvious symptom of a bigger problem left unexplored for all these years: a difficulty in communicating about what’s really going on. The idea that good sex always equates with good intimacy is&nbsp;mistaken.”</p> \n<p>I’d be interested to hear what others have done in similar situations.</p> \n<h2>Your problems solved<br /></h2> \n<p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email annalisa.barbieri@mac.com.

But would they have let him in?</p>","byline":"Jay Rayner","body":"<h2>The Green, Saltwood, Hythe, Kent (01303 237 800). Meal for two, including drinks and service: &pound;50-&pound;100<br /></h2> \n<p><br />I have always associated the village of Saltwood near Hythe in Kent with a certain kind of agreeable louchness. This is because it is home to Saltwood Castle, inhabited by the late Alan Clark MP until his death in 1999, when he insisted on being buried in its grounds. Politically, Clark was to the right of Genghis Khan, and could say things that would make your bottom jaw fall so slack it seemed to have become dislocated from the rest of your skull. Referring to Africa as “bongo-bongo land” sticks in the memory. Racism aside, he did rather add to the gaiety of nations. In 1992 he retired as an MP and published his diaries, but missed the Commons so much he stood again for election in 1997.</p> \n<p>As a candidate he could no longer write his diaries. Instead, throughout the election, <a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435228006702/JayRayner-23-March-1997-001.jpg\">I wrote them for him</a> for this newspaper, which meant I pursued him around Kensington and Chelsea for a month. It was an eventful campaign. Halfway through, a retired judge turned up from South Africa looking to “horse whip” Clark because it transpired he’d shagged both his wife and his daughter. Clark’s birthday fell during the campaign so the <em>Observer</em> gave him a present – an academic treatise on the objectification of breasts, because we knew he appreciated those (breasts, not academic treatises.) The cover, featuring a dozen photographs of its subject, was the only racy thing about it. He passed the package to his long-suffering wife Jane to open. Apparently she was not amused.</p> \n<p>I like to think Clark would have approved of <a href=\"http://www.saltwoodrestaurant.co.uk/\">Saltwood on the Green</a>, the restaurant that not long ago opened close to the castle. As both a small and big C conservative, he might have mourned the fact that it occupies the site that was once the village general store. Then again, as the only minister ever to have been accused of being sloshed while at the dispatch box, I suspect he might have seen the benefits of being able to drink there in a way he never could when it was the local shop. There’s the modestly priced wine list, the changing roster of cocktails at &pound;7 a pop and, best of all, the local ciders by Jake’s Orchard, flavoured with nettles or strawberries which, on a muggy summer’s day, are just the thing, in a glass so heavy with ice it’s practically frosted. </p> \n<p>The last reminder of the shop is the magnificent piece of wooden shelving and drawers, once used by the store for everything from flour to spices to balls of string, which fills a whole wall. Otherwise it’s a pleasing whitewashed, airy space. Viewed through the prism of its lunchtime menu, it ticks all the boxes marked useful: there’s scrambled eggs and fishcakes, soup of the day and cheesecake. It’s where laydees come to natter. It’s when you start looking at the evening menu that you sense a greater ambition at work. The head chef is American <a href=\"http://www.saltwoodrestaurant.co.uk/team.html\">Jeff Kipp</a>, who worked at Charlie Trotter’s in Chicago before coming to London to work with Gordon Ramsay and, later, at the estimable <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/02/duck-and-waffle-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">Duck and Waffle</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e7d7a4b3fdb57142e415ceacce9e6d014386f7f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435678905597/c8480254-a553-4402-ab71-10d26c0cacb5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A triangle of warm cornbread smothered at one end with sticky tomato jam and  a curl of soft goat’s cheese\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The clearest sign of head chef Jeff Kipp’s American roots are in the nibbles: warm cornbread with sweet, sticky tomato jam and goat’s cheese,’ says Jay. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The clearest sign of his American roots are in the nibbles: a delicious warm cornbread with a sweet, sticky tomato jam and a curl of soft goat’s cheese; an absurdly moreish soft pretzel, with a dish of liquid Welsh rarebit topping for dredging through, and dredging through again. Elsewhere it’s clear that Kipp is most energised by the ambitious and lightly tweezered. On the one hand, a smoked fishcake is a puck of far more potato than fish, as though he’s thinking about the lunchtime bottom line rather than the end product. It feels like something he knows he has to have there and, at &pound;7, bulking up with potato is the only way to make it work.</p> \n<p>By contrast &pound;9 for three good-sized scallops feels like value. They are perfectly seared and come draped with thin slices of lardo, the cured back fat of the pig, melting to translucence so you can see the sear marks beneath. There are curls of crackling to up the pig quotient, which can never be a bad thing, and thin batons of Granny Smith apple to give all that fat and caramelisation a bit of life.</p> \n<p>From the list marked “big plates”, a title which has a whiff of “Alan Partridge at the breakfast buffet” about it, a chicken dish is quite the piece of work. Yes it’s &pound;18, but boy do you get a lot for your money. There are thumping pieces of skinless breast from a bird that could clearly have taken you down with one punch. More impressive than the size is the fact that it tastes so deeply of chicken and is soft without feeling like cotton wool. There are small planks of smoked mushroom, bronzed cylinders of potato, and then a load more chicken that has been braised, shredded, spun through with fresh herbs and reformed into what fancy restaurants like to call a “tian” before being topped with crumbs made from crisp chicken skin. Try saying all that without taking a breath. Bring a friend.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8c95affc95e240f37038187cf7ff3825b5c0ebf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435678742577/7f3c8df7-69b7-408e-92bf-f6d0782a66e6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Two slices of lamb loin next to a raviolo made with lamb's liver and crisped sweetbreads\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The lamb loin accompanied by a raviolo made with lamb’s liver and crisped sweetbreads.

The pasta used to form the ravioli is a bit heavy, and the filling dense; the sweetbreads are cut so small they have seized up a touch in the oil. It’s one of those dishes where you can see exactly what they’re getting at, without quite being able to applaud the end result.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"217602bada5e85ad0564c707399e10848ac1a85e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435678446029/98048041-5184-435d-9adc-163063a92fa3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rectangle of pollen cream with honeycomb on a round plate\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sweet nothings: the pollen cream – ‘merely a lightly aromatic mousse’. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There’s something similar in the desserts, which have been placed on the plate just so. They look as if they have been plated for Instagram rather than with the diner in mind. A rectangle of set pollen cream is merely a lightly aromatic mousse, though the accompanying nuggets of cinder toffee lift the dish. The piece of honeycomb reads nicely, however, but is a hit of sweet too far. A strawberry cheesecake is dependent on a disc of gel which is a little too much sweet and not enough fruit.</p> \n<p>To be fair I think these criticisms are judging Saltwood on the Green by its own standards. For all its laidback chic, this is a serious kitchen keen to punch above its weight. Often it succeeds. Certainly Alan Clark would have been very happy here. Whether they would have been happy to have him is another matter entirely.</p> \n<h2>Jay’s news bites</h2> \n<p>■ For another smart bistro punching above its weight, try Digby Chick in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis. At lunchtime it can do you paninis and fishcakes, because it must to survive. But come the evening it’s beef fillet with local scallops, or pistachio and sesame-crusted monkfish (<a href=\"http://digbychick.co.uk\">digbychick.co.uk</a>).</p> \n<p>■ One of the most beautiful dining rooms in London may get a new operator after the Criterion Restaurant on Piccadilly Circus went bust. The extraordinary gold-tiled vault of the Criterion was run by Charles Forte for many years, but more recently by a Georgian entrepreneur. In my 2010 review I declared it my worst meal of the year, even though it was only January.

The student recommended Steve to help a cyclist with a mental health issue and he turned him round remarkably quickly.</p> \n<p>I was immediately impressed by Steve’s approach. He’s very strict, not fluffy; he challenges you strongly, tells it like it is. I had to work very hard to persuade him to come out of NHS practice and university, but he did.</p> \n<p>He has this knack of making people respond positively. He is fair and pragmatic, and by helping you look in the mirror he provides insight into people’s psychology, helping them optimise their behaviour and performance.</p> \n<p>I was in my late 30s then, and bullish. Steve made me stop in my tracks and analyse my own behaviour. Even though we’re very different people, his ideas chimed with me. His notion of empowerment and ownership balanced with accountability, responsibility, commitment, hunger and conflict resolution struck a strong chord, and the neutral sounding board he provided was fundamental in the success we have enjoyed.</p> \n<p>Steve’s a kind, warm person. He’s witty and good company and he has this neutrality that means he’s brilliant to disagree with because he doesn’t get annoyed. So you’re free to put all your cards on the table and look at things from a different angle. When we’re approaching a big event like the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/tourdefrance\">Tour de France,</a> the dynamic intensifies. I’ll lead, but we’ll collectively ponder: “Is the mood right? Is the culture right? Is the mindset right? Are there any unresolved issues?” then it’s into battle and executing the ideas.</p> \n<p>Steve has been a great educator in my career and my life. We’ve been through several Olympic Games, some big moments. We’ve learned together and he’s just as open to learning as I am. That’s been the fun part of it. </p> \n<p><em>Follow Team Sky on Twitter at the Tour de France, 4-26 July, </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/teamsky\"><em>@TeamSky</em></a></p> \n<h2>HIS STORY <em>Professor Steve Peters, 62, consultant psychiatrist</em></h2> \n<p>Since I came on board with Dave our relationship has built up gradually and the thing we’ve shared – in addition to getting the best out of elite athletes including Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton and Bradley Wiggins – is that we’re both mavericks in the sense of thinking outside the box and being willing to take risks.</p> \n<p>Dave is the type of person who, when he comes to a river, doesn’t dip his toe in and measure the temperature. He makes a calculated risk, jumps, and if it is deep he just starts swimming. I told him early on that he needed to surround himself with like-minded people because that would bring out the best in him, whereas if he surrounded himself with people who keep measuring the temperature of the water and dipping their toes in he was going to get frustrated.</p> \n<p>When we have brainstorming sessions approaching an event, like the Tour De France, the focus and fine-tuning ramp up significantly. Dave will always ask: “Am I missing something?” I like to optimise performance and to know that whoever I’m working with will get the best out of themselves. Dave has a similar outlook.</p> \n<p>Dave’s insightful, driven and intolerant of second best. He just won’t accept it and he gets frustrated with complacency, which I do too. If that happens he’ll step on whatever the difficulty is to put it right; he won’t sit back on his laurels. Dave is constantly searching for what he calls “marginal gains” – the small percentages that add up to a big difference. Coupled with his energy and organisation, this is what gives him that X factor.</p> \n<p>Outside the velodrome we are different people socially. Dave enjoys keeping fit and he leads a more solitary life whereas I’m a people person who has lots of friends around. Dave is more of an individual. His accolades and achievements haven’t changed his character. That shared desire to optimise potential still unites us.</p> \n<p><em>Steve Peters’s </em>The Chimp Paradox <em>is published by Vermilion.
