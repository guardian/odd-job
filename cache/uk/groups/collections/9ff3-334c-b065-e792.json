In the tiny square picture icon, you are there in your blue T-shirt, leaning over the table and smiling at the camera. Next to your name it says, “Hear me now”. </em></p> \n<p><em>That drove me mad; you’d sit there and repeat, “Hear me now?

Even just once. </em></p> \n<p><em>I press the little video camera icon to see if I can get through. But it doesn’t even give me the satisfaction of ringing. Instead the screen says “ended” and the call hangs itself up. Guess that’s fair. That’s when I realise it says “offline”. “nyctwigg offline”. Also fair. I should delete your account … and your phone number, email address and all sorts of other aspects of your online life. I sit and wonder if other people you were connected to have deleted your profile. And I stare out the window wondering if I should try to call you again.</em></p> \n<p>My husband, Iain, and I met at school when we were 17, dated in the sixth form, went our separate ways at university, then got back together and married in a flurry of excitement in 2008. Iain worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office so we lived, worked and adventured together for seven years in Delhi and Geneva. In October 2013, Iain was diagnosed with a brain tumour, and on 7 December 2014, he died in our bed at home. On that morning, my husband, our hoped for family and my future roadmap of work and travel for the next 40 years, all vanished in one shuddering breath. We were both 33.</p> \n<p>Six months along this single-track pathway, I’m repeatedly aware I have to rebuild and reshape my life – a life I can’t remember distinct from Iain. If your partner dies, a lot of admin also comes your way. And, these days, people die a digital death alongside their physical one, which creates a whole new world of admin that didn’t pass the radar of grieving widows 50 years ago. Those 20th-century widows would have had a box of love letters and a few hard copy photos; I have Facebook messages, professional videos on YouTube, personal videos on my iPhone, email histories, recorded Skype chats, WhatsApp conversations, text messages and digital photos – photos galore. And all this from a marriage with someone who never really liked spending time online. He set out his stall at 18 announcing that he wouldn’t be getting a mobile phone because they “seem pretty annoying, I doubt they’ll catch on”.</p> \n<p>I’ve found at least one blog that tries to make sense of it all. <a href=\"http://www.thedigitalbeyond.com\" title=\"\">The Digital Beyond</a>, which offers a “go-to source for archival, cultural, legal and technical insights, to help you predict and plan for the future of your online content”. Along with “scatter tubes” – tubes with a perforated lid for transporting and scattering ashes – and bespoke jewellery made from ashes, it’s another blossoming industry I never knew existed.</p> \n<p>The blog lists 54 online companies that deal specifically with aspects of dying or, more commonly, the legacy of memories online. I’m slightly spooked by the number of websites that help you send posthumous messages to your friends and relatives. <a href=\"http://tolovedones.com\" title=\"\">ToLovedOnes</a>, for example, will send letters after your death, calculating the dates they are posted “with 95% accuracy from public records”. Which just leaves me worrying about the 5% of people who receive the letters when their relative is still alive.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://knotify.me/\" title=\"\">Knotify.me</a>, meanwhile, is a free app that answers the question you never knew you had; “What happens to all my online accounts if I get amnesia, Alzheimer’s or if I leave this world?” It helps you set future notifications for your family or yourself, so “nothing of your digital life will be wasted”. <a href=\"http://www.rememberedvoices.com\" title=\"\">Remembered Voices</a> lets you record your voice and play it back to people after you’ve died, <a href=\"http://www.cirruslegacy.com\" title=\"\">Cirrus Legacy</a> stores digital assets in a single place online, so your executor can access them easily. That would have been helpful, in fact. Terry Pratchett was in the know – his recent death was announced in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terryandrob\" title=\"\">a series of tweets from his own account</a>.</p> \n<p>Just as we’re playing catch up with technology, the technology developers themselves are in the same position. Dying, understandably, didn’t feature highly in Facebook’s early risk registers. Which might be why it was in trouble recently for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32193923\" title=\"\">locking a grieving mother out of her teenage daughter’s Facebook account</a>, despite having her daughter’s permission to use it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I hadn’t anticipated the outpouring of love from around the world. There were messages from Japan, Pakistan, Chile …</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>When someone dies, Facebook tends to “memorialise” their account – freeze them so they can be viewed, but providing no access to past messages. I read that and panicked: I didn’t want that to happen, so grabbed my laptop and logged in urgently as Iain. Once in though, I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do – it didn’t feel right reading personal messages to and from other people. They weren’t for me. If he’d left a box of letters, would I have read those? People store important letters, but online messages are kept just because we don’t press delete. Should I read his emails? I didn’t. But I read and reread our text message conversations, which lifted me up so high it felt like we were actually chatting. Then when I got to the end and there were no more, it was a bad, long fall from there. So I decided memorialising was OK.</p> \n<p>Facebook also offended a fair number of bereaved people with its Year in Review clips, in which photographs that attracted the most comments were automatically selected to reappear on your timeline under the words “Here’s what your year looked like”. The problem was that for some, these were pictures of dead loved ones. And, however comforting photos and associated memories can be, out of the blue and at the wrong moment on your computer screen they can cause havoc if you are grieving.</p> \n<p>The bereaved: an oversensitive minority population, you may think, but the numbers involved are bigger than you may realise. Based on Facebook’s growth rate, and the age breakdown of its users over time, probably 10 to 20 million people who created Facebook profiles have since died. Even if Facebook closed registration tomorrow, the number of deaths per year will continue to grow for decades, as the 2000-2020 school generations grow old. And the peak? <a href=\"http://www.webpagefx.com/blog/internet/happens-online-presence-die-infographic/\" title=\"\">Nasa physicist turned full-time cartoonist Randall Munroe </a>estimates that if Facebook falls out of favour with young generations, as many social media sites do, the point at which there will be more users who have died than are living is around 2060. And if Facebook continues to thrive, that’s more like 2130.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"446d2d3ace6429d1c51d5f64623022c365f95944\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435683664595/a89fcfc8-bc81-4bb2-9d8f-6c76c959b4e4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Caroline and Iain in 1999, when they were still at school.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline and Iain in 1999, when they were still at school.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the hours and immediate few days after Iain died, I turned to the memorial website built overnight by a kind colleague to celebrate my man’s life. A bewildered and floundering group of Iain’s closest friends and family immersed ourselves in a world of photos and memories and words and purpose. Three days later, all within half an hour, the website went live, an email to the worldwide Foreign and Commonwealth Office workforce went out and I put a “global announcement” on Facebook. “Informing friends of the deceased”, 21st-century style. I changed my profile to black, shut my laptop and left the house; the internet did its thing – with speed, breadth and a rush of wildfire.</p> \n<p>I hadn’t anticipated the outpouring of love from around the world. Within minutes there were messages from Japan, Pakistan, Chile … the inhabitants of our interconnected world, suddenly spinning inwards to be connected by shock and grief, then spinning out again to their own physical pockets around the world.</p> \n<p>Today, one of the things I cherish most is an eight-second video of Iain telling me he loves me. There’s something about seeing him as if in real life and hearing his voice, that is just quite incredible. The only downside is that it’s far too short. And it’s all I’m going to get now. I wish I had more videos – they are by far the hardest thing to look at right now, but I sense that one day they will be some of the most precious things I have.</p> \n<p>Otherwise a huge comfort and unity online has come from a network for younger people whose partners have died – <a href=\"https://www.widowedandyoung.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Way (Widowed and Young)</a>. In the past month, I’ve got to know some of the 1,500 people in that group by seeing their biggest fears, their “smallest” achievements, their practical worries and their rallying strength posted online in a closed group. A sub-set of our society, normal people living normal lives that suddenly know tragedy and are thrust together in their confusion and loneliness and upset.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I've discovered that when you cry lying on your back, your tears slide into your ears, which fill up and feel strange</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I don’t use the rest of Facebook so much now – I posted a positive few things early on and hadn’t expected so many instantaneous likes and messages saying I was “amazing”. It was too surreal to be told that when you’re barely able to hold a conversation in real life, and it made me feel strange. I’m certainly not going to start covering Facebook with the reality of the new world I have found myself living in since Iain’s death – people don’t go there to see the truth if it’s not pretty.</p> \n<p>So, after I put my phone aside each evening and disconnect myself from my online communities, the moment just after my head hits the pillow is when the reality of my sadness becomes so stark. The moment I go from being exhausted to somehow feeling wide awake, when I feel so, so solo. I look over at Iain’s side of the bed and just his picture grins back at me. I poke my toe over the cold sheet and I wonder how it can be that he was right there, and now he’s not. I think about friends in their homes, with their favourite people breathing quietly beside them. I think of people listening out for babies in other rooms. For their children stirring. I want to say, “Imagine none of those people are in your house now, imagine that silence. And imagine it’s for always.” That’s how alone it feels.</p> \n<p>As I lie there I wonder, have I fallen off the end of the world? I’ve discovered that when you cry while you’re lying on your back, your tears slide into your ears, which fill up and feel strange. I shake my head. And at some point I fall asleep. And then I wake up too early and feel the same.</p> \n<p>As I take the commuter train, I look at everyone on their smartphones. I imagine there are others also scrolling through pictures of their families, just as I am with photos of Iain. I see a message from a lady, a new friend, whose husband also died of a brain tumour a few days before Iain – we’ve never met but have shared such a similarly traumatic story that we’re linked to each other now. As I go to reply, I’m aware that we’d never have connected if this had been 1915, not 2015.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/\" title=\"\"><em>thebraintumourcharity.org</em></a></p> \n<p><em>Caroline Twigg has written a book to help bereaved children.

Perhaps we should meet, he said, though he felt he had to be upfront and say he had reservations about me. Oh, I said. What are those? Is my sense of humour not feminine enough? It’s true that I was deterred by your apparent offer of sex on our first date, he said, and though you assured me you were joking, I’m not sure that you were joking, entirely. I like to take things really slowly, he&nbsp;said.</p> \n<p>So do I, as it happens, I told him, (instantly defensive, not really clocking his pomposity). In the last relationship I almost had, I felt rushed into bed, way too soon. I’m still ashamed of myself for not insisting on waiting, for not seeing that it wouldn’t work earlier, and walking away. The whole thing became embarrassing, I said; I’d found it hard to assert myself and my needs.</p> \n<p>So we should meet and have that dinner, he said. Let’s meet and see if we hit it off. I don’t know if you really want to get into anything, even a 90-minute encounter over steak and chips, with someone who objects to their humour being critiqued as “unfeminine”, I said. Femininity is important to me, he said, and it probably is to you too. We’re just using language in different ways. Bear in mind that I’m Johnny Foreigner (smiley emoticon). So let’s have dinner. Okay, I said. Dinner would be nice; we’ll go Dutch, which will be another nationality brought into the equation. Sorry, he messaged back – Dutch? What do you mean? It’s an expression, I assured him. It means I’ll pay half. Oh God, he said. You’re not going to insist on paying half are you? I stared at the screen, my mouth twitching. What do you mean by “femininity is important to me”? I asked him. We can discuss this over dinner, he said. It will make for a lively 90 minutes over steak and chips, though it’ll be chicken for me as I don’t eat red meat any more. Let me just say this, in case you misunderstand me, he added. I’m a feminist, modern man who loves women. But I am not attracted to women who exhibit male traits, and who are dominant. Perhaps I should also mention that I’m turned off by women who are dominant in bed.</p> \n<p>At this point, I was sure I didn’t want to meet Lee more than once, but I was curious, and I was bored and lonely, and mildly freaked out by recent events, so I agreed to dinner. Shortly after, I received an email from Miles, apologising for the withdrawal of the invitation to lunch at his house. This will sound shallow, he wrote, but I have a certain physical type, and I just wasn’t attracted to you, but I hope we can be friends.</p> \n<p>I messaged Lee. Let’s play Q and A before our date, I said, trying again (I need playfulness). I’ll go first and we’ll alternate with random questions. Here’s my first. How do you feel about Ikea? His reply said “Why are you doing this? I don’t want to answer your questions.” What do you mean, I asked him? It’s just fun. If you don’t have the time or don’t feel like it, just say so, but there’s no need to be cross about it. “This is some pretty weird shit,” he said in his reply. I said that we should probably cancel our dinner arrangement, and he said that he already had.</p> \n<p>I was really irritated. I couldn’t let it go without a bit more of a fight. I wrote asking if a question about Ikea was interpreted as some sort of an assumption that I was preparing to go house hunting with him. It was, of course, a joke but he replied saying the subconscious was a powerful thing. I couldn’t believe it. So, I said, the first Q&nbsp;and A I attempted with you – the question about Scrabble – was that my&nbsp;subconscious wanting to rush ahead and buy our first marital boardgame? You see, he said, you’re thinking about marriage. You used the&nbsp;word.</p> \n<p>I frowned at the screen. Are we joking? I asked him. I think we’re joking with one another, but I’m just not sure. Either we’re joking or you’re deeply strange. It isn’t me who’s strange, he said. You’re the one who wants to dominate a total stranger with your demands for information. Oh, I said. I see. Was that unfeminine of me? This conversation is over, he said. Please don’t email me again.</p> \n<p><em>Stella Grey is a pseudonym</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/greystellagrey\" title=\"\">@GreyStellaGrey</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435588383055/IKEA-store-interior-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"I asked him how he felt about Ikea and he said: 'why are you doing this?'

But I have an employee who is stunningly beautiful. She is 24; I’m 40. I cannot take my eyes off her and when she is in the room I have palpitations. I respect her work and abilities very much, and if I could turn off my intense attraction to her, I would. We have a good working relationship, there is no flirting on either side, but I sometimes have to sit there with my eyes closed. My reactions feel entirely involuntary and very troubling. I don’t feel guilty, exactly, although being married I often wonder whether I should; but it is very distracting and upsetting. I can’t reassign her to work with other people as she is essential to the projects we work on together, but I need this to stop. </strong></p> \n<p>There’s no reason to feel guilty about being attracted to your stunning employee. We’re all susceptible to beauty and charm. In an ideal world, this situation would be something you could talk about with your wife. Unfortunately, she’d probably feel pretty bad hearing you’re shutting your eyes because this woman has such a powerful effect on you – though she’d feel much worse if you acted upon this infatuation.</p> \n<p>I would suggest you first speak with someone who is impartial. When your hormones are firing, the only way that you can stop it is to step away from the situation.</p> \n<p>Consider a couple of visits to a therapist or, if for some reason that’s unfeasible, talk to a close friend who has proven himself to be both decent and discreet. (What you don’t need is a hooting hyena cheering you on; when struggling with temptation, people often unconsciously seek out the voice of unreason.) Remember, you haven’t done anything wrong: in fact, the point of talking about it (with the right person) is to ensure that you don’t.</p> \n<p>Then try, if you can, not to work so closely with your colleague. You said she’s essential – but so is your marriage. If you continue to be around her, chances are you’ll eventually act on your feelings. Not everybody does, of course, but it’s a foolish risk to take.</p> \n<p>Limit your contact with her as much as possible – and that includes work parties.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Send your dilemmas about love, family and life in general to <a href=\"mailto:askmolly@theguardian.com\">askmolly@theguardian.com</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/6/30/1435660918138/Molly-workmate-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Photograph: Franck Allais for the Guardian","credit":"Franck Allais for the Guardian","altText":"Molly: workmate","cleanCaption":"  Photograph: Franck Allais for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T16:34:49Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T23:06:21Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":552,"contributors":[{"name":"Molly Ringwald","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/17/1410970326054/Molly-Ringwald-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/molly-ringwald"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Life and style","Relationships"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/relationships","webTitle":"Relationships"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Molly Ringwald","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/molly-ringwald"}}],"series":{"title":"Ask Molly Ringwald","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/ask-molly-ringwald"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/ask-molly-ringwald-attracted-to-workmate","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49pzk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/ask-molly-ringwald-attracted-to-workmate","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/ask-molly-ringwald-attracted-to-workmate"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/6/30/1435660918138/Molly-workmate-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Photograph: Franck Allais for the Guardian","credit":"Franck Allais for the Guardian","altText":"Molly: workmate","cleanCaption":"  Photograph: Franck Allais for the Guardian"}},"importance":4,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/6/30/1435660918138/Molly-workmate-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Photograph: Franck Allais for the Guardian","credit":"Franck Allais for the Guardian","altText":"Molly: workmate","cleanCaption":"  Photograph: Franck Allais for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"Tim Dowling: the glue that binds us","rawTitle":"Tim Dowling: the glue that binds us","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jul/04/tim-dowling-broken-shelf-metaphor-for-family-life","title":"Tim Dowling: the glue that binds us","trailText":"‘The broken shelf in our fridge seems perfectly illustrative of our dysfunctional domestic operation.

A&nbsp;bolt of anger shoots through me, then subsides.</p> \n<p>The mess seems perfectly illustrative of our dysfunctional domestic operation. Someone opens a jar of olives, eats three, then puts the jar on the top shelf, where it sits for six years. Over time, it is joined by some capers, a tin of condensed milk inexpertly lidded with foil, and various bottled condiments. Older foodstuffs are not culled, but shoved to the back. Jar is stacked upon jar, and tin upon tub. Because it happens by degrees, everyone is blind to the impending crisis. Then, one day, the shelf breaks under the weight of it all, and it becomes my problem.</p> \n<p>“What’s all this?” my wife asks, pointing to the array of damp jars and tins on the kitchen table.</p> \n<p>“Eat or bin,” I say, staring into the tool cupboard. “You must decide.”</p> \n<p>“How depressing,” she says. “What are you looking for?”</p> \n<p>“Glue,” I say. “I can’t find any.”</p> \n<p>“I’m surprised you can find anything in there.”</p> \n<p>“What happened to my glue collection?”</p> \n<p>“I haven’t touched your fucking glue collection,” she says.</p> \n<p>“Don’t swear at me,” I say. “I’m the victim here.”</p> \n<p>“Sorry,” she says. “I’ve got rage again.”</p> \n<p>Two days later, I ring her from the supermarket. “They haven’t got the glue I need,” I say.</p> \n<p>“Did you honestly just ring me to&nbsp;tell me that?” my wife asks.</p> \n<p>“I just thought, if you were passing a DIY shop, you could pick some up.”</p> \n<p>I hear a huff of fury at her end. “Yes, OK, maybe,” she replies.</p> \n<p>“Thank you,” I say. “It’s the epoxy&nbsp;resin, the kind that comes in two tubes.”</p> \n<p>“Epoxy resin,” she says.</p> \n<p>“Setting time isn’t important,” I&nbsp;say. “As&nbsp;long&nbsp;as…”</p> \n<p>“Ring off, caller.”</p> \n<p>The next afternoon, my wife finds me lying on the sofa. “You need to cut that wisteria,” she says. “It’s growing through a crack in the glass into the kitchen.”</p> \n<p>“I’m busy,” I say.</p> \n<p>“You’re watching <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rhg2r\" title=\"\">Pointless</a>,” she says.</p> \n<p>I hold up my hands to show that I’m also pressing two halves of a&nbsp;refrigerator shelf bracket together while the glue sets. She turns, emits a&nbsp;low growl, and leaves.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, my wife is sitting at the kitchen table, chatting to the oldest one and his girlfriend while I&nbsp;add medicine to the old dog’s food. From the corner of my eye, I can see the wisteria taking a turn around the&nbsp;radiator.</p> \n<p>“I told the doctor about my rage,” my wife says. “He seemed to think it was normal in the&nbsp;circumstances.”</p> \n<p>“Rage is normal,” I say. “I have rage.”</p> \n<p>“You’ve got an enlarged prostate,” my wife says. “The doctor says every man your age has an&nbsp;enlarged prostate.”</p> \n<p>“It was the vet who told you that,” I say. After setting down two dog bowls, I find I have half a&nbsp;tin of food left over.</p> \n<p>“So it was,” my wife says. “Anyway, he didn’t give me any rage pills.”</p> \n<p>“The vet?” the oldest one’s girlfriend asks.</p> \n<p>“The vet is a woman,” my wife says.</p> \n<p>“The trick with rage,” I say, “is to tuck it all safely away somewhere. Push it right to the back.”</p> \n<p>“How long does that work?” the oldest says.</p> \n<p>“Indefinitely, so far,” I say.</p> \n<p>I open the fridge and see the newly repaired top shelf sitting snugly on its rails, a little teardrop of&nbsp;epoxy resin hanging from one corner.

But the tweets carried on, and people were trying to find me, so I asked a friend to <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=dancing+man+found&amp;biw=2009&amp;bih=1274&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U2SJVcjnGOKv7Abb9oHwBQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCAQsAQ#imgrc=ploI4Q7Zyptr-M%253A%3Blw-YzrfsSUPwbM%3Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fpbs.twimg.com%252Fprofile_images%252F573983561457528832%252FNRdOaAbz.jpeg%3Bhttps%253A%252F%252Ftwitter.com%252Fdancingmanfoun1%3B400%3B400\">post a picture of me on Twitter</a>. People were thrilled to have found me, but there were other people claiming to be me, too, so they needed proof. It’s a fantastic irony that people actually wanted to be me: a 47-year-old single, fat Liverpudlian who’d been ridiculed online by an anonymous troll. So I sent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALOn0SJBEHM\">Cassandra</a>, one of the Californian women, a photo to prove who I was.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/25/dancing-man-fat-shamed-cyberbullies-hollywood-party\">'Dancing Man' fat-shamed by cyberbullies gets own back at Hollywood party</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I assumed I was going to meet up with her and a few friends, to go clubbing. It turned out that 1,700 women were going to pay for me to fly to LA, and in that first weekend, they raised $40,000. They also started the <a href=\"http://dance-free.squarespace.com/\">Dance Free Movement</a> to publicise it, and to find people who’d been bullied because of their gender, disability or weight.</p> \n<p>I never thought it would turn into such a momentous occasion. A big club got in touch to offer us a venue for the party. Moby offered to DJ. Once celebrities were interested, the whole thing escalated.</p> \n<p>I was gobsmacked. It felt crazy that something so harmful and personal could turn so quickly into something positive. I realised we could take a stance against this kind of bullying. My boss arranged for me to have some media training with a pal who worked in TV, and gave me time off. There was soon enough money for the party, with plenty left to donate to various anti-bullying charities, including <a href=\"https://www.kidscape.org.uk/\">Kidscape</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cybersmile.org/\">Cybersmile</a> in the UK, who were delighted when I approached them.</p> \n<p>I flew to the US with my brother and mate, to New York first, to go on the Today show with Meghan Trainor. I thought there would be a few of us interviewed, but it was just <a href=\"http://www.today.com/popculture/dancing-man-today-show-defies-bullies-dances-meghan-trainor-t22501\">me, dancing with her as she sang</a>. I had dinner with Monica Lewinsky, who does a lot of campaigning against cyber-bullying. She was lovely.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456904410__\n</div> \n<p>Then it was off to LA for the party. We got to the club to find TV crews from all over the world setting up. Later on, we found a small bar, where we could talk about the journey so far and how much we were looking forward to the party. Back at the club, there were people queueing up outside, cheering me as we got nearer. When we got in, my mind went blank. I’d had no idea the experience would be that intense.</p> \n<p>Cassandra and I had a dance, and then I made a speech. I’d been panicking about it, but decided to just speak off the cuff. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/25/dancing-man-fat-shamed-cyberbullies-hollywood-party\">Then the party started</a>, and I danced all night. The next day, <a href=\"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/05/24/dancing-man-takes-anti-bullying-pitch-literally-to-dodgers-stadium/\">I pitched the first ball</a> at the LA Dodgers game.</p> \n<p>I have never thought about the people who posted the original images of me. They must have their own insecurities, to put the spotlight on someone else so maliciously. It was done anonymously, and I like to think that indicates the shame they must have felt. I’m large. I’m distinctive. But I’ve got broad shoulders and a bit of confidence. I can cope with negative attention. And I guess I was lucky – I was blissfully unaware of all the trolling at first. If I’d seen the hurtful words, it could have been soul-destroying.</p> \n<p>In fact, the whole journey has been completely positive. I’m an average bloke, but if I can help people be kinder to each other, that’s got to be a good thing, hasn’t it?</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> As told to Camilla Palmer.
