First came 92-year-old <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/01/harriette-thompson-92-oldest-woman-complete-marathon-san-diego\">Harriette Thompson</a>, the oldest marathon finisher on record and a grandmother of ten. At a rather brisker pace, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/jessica-ennis\">Jessica Ennis</a> chested the tape to qualify for next year’s Olympics. The words “inspirational” and “supermum” haven’t been bandied about with such abandon since <a href=\"http://joannepavey.com/\">Jo Pavey</a> won gold in Glasgow and earned herself a million new Twitter followers from the Mumsnet generation in the process.<br /></p> \n<p>We mothers and grandmothers in Lycra have come a long way. Although we were banned for years from competing in strenuous distance events in case our wombs dropped out, once we showed we could channel the same strength it takes to push out a baby into athletic prowess, mums of steel started to stride into the sports pages. </p> \n<p>In 1991, <a href=\"http://www.britishathletics.org.uk/e-inspire/hall-of-fame-athletes/liz-mccolgan/\">Liz McColgan</a> attracted opprobrium and admiration in equal measure when she won the world cross-country championships three months after giving birth to her daughter (she was first woman in her debut New York City marathon later that same year). Sixteen years later, the news that <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/paularadcliffe\">Paula Radcliffe</a> was back out training 12 days after her first child was born might have made most raddled new mothers wince, but her tenacious attitude won approval – and an NYC marathon gong of her own.<br /></p> \n<p>Nowadays most forms of exercise, including running, are recommended in most cases throughout pregnancy and into new motherhood . Indeed, pressure and research group Tommy’s, which aims to halve the number of babies that die during pregnancy or birth by 2030, have a campaign, <a href=\"http://www.tommys.org/page.aspx?pid=363\">Upbeat</a> which recommends structured exercise for pregnant mothers. </p> \n<p>Most devoted runners in my club continued running as close to their due date as they could comfortably manage, as did, indeed, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2013/mar/20/run-while-pregnant-strangers-advice\">Amelia Hill</a>.</p> \n<p>However, it is coming back to running after the baby arrives that presents the biggest challenge for ordinary mortals. Even once you’ve managed to exchange the posset-stained dressing gown for something approaching PE kit, the issue of childcare often derails fitness ambitions. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We advise women not to start classes too soon after the birth – most show up when the baby is a couple of months old</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Professional athletes, and the wealthy, may be able to afford a nanny to mind the baby while they sweat out the post-partum blues with their personal trainers, but the rest of us have to rely on local leisure centre creches, friends or family. Sometimes arranging childcare proves too taxing, and it’s just easier to wander around aimlessly with the buggy, and kid yourself you’re wandering back to fitness. </p> \n<p>That’s why outdoor fitness classes, where the baby comes along, too, have proved such a boon for new parents in recent years. I wish they’d existed 25 years ago, when I had my first child, and seemed to spend inordinate amounts of time being hauled out of aerobics classes to settle him in the creche. </p> \n<p>Now that I’m a runner of mature years, my love of the sport has led me to train as a <a href=\"http://www.runengland.org/page.asp?section=38\"><strong>running coach,</strong></a> so that I can lead <a href=\"http://www.greenwichpilates.co.uk/buggyrunners.aspx\"><strong>buggy-runner classes</strong></a> in my local parks. It gets me out of the office, and does my heart good to see women take their first power-walking steps to postnatal fitness. It’s a baby-steps approach, literally. </p> \n<p>The women (and it is usually women that come to our classes, although fathers and male carers are welcomed) have to fill out a health questionnaire. We advise women not to start classes too soon after the birth of their baby – most show up when the baby is a couple of months old. Those mothers who have had a caesarian section are monitored carefully and given alternative exercises to the more taxing core work that forms the final section of the class. </p> \n<p>Runners don’t have to invest in a swanky, three-wheeled, all-terrain buggy for the class. Most modern prams are robust enough for our hilly local park.</p> \n<p>The hour-long sessions start with power-walking and power-talking. The workouts are as much about getting together and comparing notes as about easing back into running. From the warm up, the buggy-runners move into dynamic drills, running drills, hill running, then finish with core work and stretches. </p> \n<p>Everything is done with your baby in tow. Sometimes, the buggies are parked up for the runners to practise their hill-sprints or step-ups unencumbered, which is when this coach puts on her nanny hat. For me, this is extra-gratifying. I love babies, but it’s a while since I had mine. Indeed, I’m a little broody, having just become a grandmother whose little <em><a href=\"http://www.dict.cc/german-english/Enkel.html\">enkel</a></em> lives in Berlin. </p> \n<p>So I get to cuddle babies, pass on words of wisdom and guide new parents to their first 5K race. Some buggy-runners treat the class as a social event, repairing to the park cafe for cappuccino and cake every week; others decide to join our Saturday running group or Sunday long-running marathon group. Some end up loving running so much they join a club and win trophies (one ex-buggy-runner is now a sub three-hour marathoner). </p> \n<p>From my vantage point as Old Mother Coach and club runner, I’ve witnessed at first hand the so-called <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/aug/12/jo-pavey-gold-european-athletics-championships-zurich\">baby boost</a> effect. Many women, like Jo and Paula, go on to run even more strongly after having children. That might be because of better lung capacity after running around with about 26lb extra weight in pregnancy, or a more relaxed mental attitude – nothing, not even winning, is more important than your children – or better organisation (you become a more focused, more efficient runner if you’re on a strict deadline imposed by parenting duties). </p> \n<p>Whatever causes baby boost, it’s worth having a go at harnessing it. Who knows, a gentle jog with your baby under the encouraging eye of a veteran runner, mother and granny like me may not make an elite athlete of you, but it could at least result in podium glory in the mother’s race at some future school sports day.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435166482040/08a619d4-33a9-4425-9c9d-180b110d86bf-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chloe Johnson / Alamy/Alamy","altText":"Keep on running … Latest guidance says most women can exercise while pregnant","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Chloe Johnson / Alamy/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-25T05:35:09Z","lastModified":"2015-06-25T05:39:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":18,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Fitness","Running","Life and style","Pregnancy","Parents and parenting"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/fitness","webTitle":"Fitness"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/running","webTitle":"Running"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/pregnancy","webTitle":"Pregnancy"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/jun/25/pregnant-new-mum-nows-the-time-to-get-jogging","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49h3f","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/jun/25/pregnant-new-mum-nows-the-time-to-get-jogging","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/jun/25/pregnant-new-mum-nows-the-time-to-get-jogging"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435166482040/08a619d4-33a9-4425-9c9d-180b110d86bf-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Keep on running … Latest guidance says most women can exercise while pregnant.

The first brownie recipes popped up in the late 19th century, but chocolate didn’t make an appearance until 1906 – until that point, the brownie was the dense, fudgy, butterscotch-flavoured bar known to modern cake cognoscenti as the blondie.</p> \n<p>Although the lesser-known blondie is similar to its more famous younger sibling in texture, the principal flavour is brown sugar, rather than chocolate – rather like a classic chocolate-chip cookie minus the chips. Or sometimes with the chips – the blondie, like Harry herself, resists definition, but never, ever disappoints.</p> \n<h2>Flour versus oats</h2> \n<p>Like brownies and most other cakes, blondies are generally made with flour. <a href=\"http://www.scarletscorchdroppers.com/2011/01/11/todays-baking-nigella-blondies/\">In Kitchen, however, Nigella Lawson also uses oats</a>, creating a kind of blondie/flapjack hybrid which, while delicious, feels far foo chewy and wholesome here. The blondie is not a slow-release carb kind of treat.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"848b38b3208cc085a2e832877dd11a6c55080bfc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435069575281/a9b05993-f635-42c0-bed5-060f15c9a251-460x298.jpeg\" alt=\"Nigella Lawson blondie\" width=\"460\" height=\"298\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigella Lawson’s chewy blondie, featuring oats.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Raising agent</h2> \n<p>Lawson is also the only one to use bicarbonate of soda in her brownies, at least on its own; the US magazine Cooks Illustrated and Annie Bell’s Baking Bible use baking powder, while <a href=\"http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2006/11/blondies-for-a-blondie/\">American blogger Deb Perelman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.marthastewart.com/336484/blondies-with-chocolate-chips-and-walnut#Brownie%20and%20Blondie%20Recipes|/275401/brownie-and-blondie-recipes/@center/276956/cookie-recipes|336484\">American domestic goddess Martha Stewart</a> eschew raising agents altogether.</p> \n<p>Cooks Illustrated, which has conducted extensive research on this point, observes that the majority of blondie recipes fall into two camps – “light and cakey” and “dense and buttery” – and that “tasters preferred [the] latter”. This chimes with my own experience; the fluffier blondies of Bell and Lawson proved less popular than flatter, more gooey versions, but some ingrates complained – while eating them – that the latter were “a bit rich”. This suggests adding a little baking powder, enough to allow a little rise, is a good idea.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d25259ef966f4c1982563bd7eaf43b0d92a4ecf0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435069731092/af17c053-95e8-4285-a67b-972248c1ab87-460x335.jpeg\" alt=\"Deb Perelman's blondie\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Deb Perelman’s blondies, made with dark muscovado sugar.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Sugar</h2> \n<p>Sugar is the predominant flavour here and, as such, of paramount importance. Everyone uses a brown variety of some kind to maximise the butterscotch factor, with Perelman going as far as the treacly dark brown sort in her most recent recipe. Lawson mixes soft light brown sugar with condensed milk; Stewart cuts it with granulated sugar, which gives her blondies a pleasingly grainy texture; and Bell goes for a gloriously gooey combination of soft light brown sugar, golden syrup and honey “for an even stickier cake”. However, although this is generally desirable, it is not actually what most testers want in a blondie. The same goes for Perelman’s dark muscovado, which tastes a little too bitter and sophisticated for what is, in essence, the love child of two very simple treats: the chocolate-chip cookie and the brownie. The white chocolate flavour of Lawson’s condensed milk, meanwhile, seems better savoured for the chips. On this basis, caramelly light soft brown sugar and crunchy demerara seems the ideal combination.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2ff91b418362518e3ff07c85bf2a2dc0bcbd931\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435069888610/27297dbc-adbf-4ba8-9637-97c184d12a3b-460x299.jpeg\" alt=\"Martha Stewart blondies\" width=\"460\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blondies &agrave; la Martha Stewart.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Butter</h2> \n<p>Melting the butter – rather than creaming it into the mixture, as with a conventional sponge cake – helps provide the satisfyingly dense texture. Browning it first, as Perelman suggests, is a stroke of genius, given that one of the few things to taste better than butter is nutty, toasted butter. That said, if you’d prefer to skip this step in order to get a blondie in your mouth five minutes sooner, they’ll still be pretty delicious.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5979635b602feea79e985503dee62602803c309\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435069992309/26f3db00-db19-4bfe-ba4f-3d1414c0d2a6-460x312.jpeg\" alt=\"Annie Bell's blondies\" width=\"460\" height=\"312\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Honeyed blondies by Annie Bell.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Extras</h2> \n<p>Blond or non-blond, this business demands chocolate of some sort, but the bitter cocoa of Stewart and Lawson’s dark chocolate chips overwhelms the butterscotch flavour of the cake itself. Bell’s white chocolate variety seems far more in the spirit of things. Nuts are another must, as much for the textural contrast between them and the soft, dense batter as for their lovely flavour. Stewart goes for the tannic walnut, which I also favour in brownies, but the sweeter flavour of pecans works better here. Regular readers annoyed by my one-woman campaign against the kneejerk use of vanilla in baked goods should be gratified to learn that it was made for this recipe – there is no better partner for butter and sugar. Finally, a good pinch of salt, although not quite as much as Stewart or Perelman suggest, helps balance the other flavours; I’d err on the side of caution and add a few flakes on top to finish.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"069588c57837014466b94d84e5fcdc9cc7ac2951\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435070123018/c56ba942-ff06-429a-81b9-2ca55640f51a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cooks Illustrated blondies\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cooks Illustrated blondies.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Baking</h2> \n<p>As with brownies, it is always better to undercook rather than overcook a blondie – I take Stewart’s out halfway through their cooking time after reading comments online that 45 minutes at 180C left them “brick hard” (thank God for the internet). Half that time, as Cooks Illustrated suggests, seems more reasonable, but, as ever, keep an eye on them and trust your own judgment over the clock.</p> \n<h2>The perfect blondies</h2> \n<p><em>(Makes 1 x 20cm tray)</em></p> \n<p>165g butter, cubed <br /></p> \n<p>75g pecans, roughly chopped <br /></p> \n<p>225g plain flour <br /></p> \n<p>1 tsp baking powder <br /></p> \n<p>&frac12; tsp fine salt <br /></p> \n<p>175g light brown sugar <br /></p> \n<p>50g demerara sugar<br /></p> \n<p>2 eggs, beaten <br /></p> \n<p>1 tsp vanilla extract <br /></p> \n<p>170g white chocolate, roughly chopped <br /></p> \n<p>Sea salt flakes, to top (optional)</p> \n<p>Melt the butter in a wide, light-coloured pan over a medium-low heat, swirling to help it along. Once the foam has died down, watch it like a hawk; as soon as the solids at the bottom turn from white to toasty brown and the butter smells almost nutty, tip into a bowl to cool until barely warm.<br /></p> \n<p>Toast the pecans in the same pan until they, too, smell nutty, then set aside.<br /></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark six and grease a square baking tin roughly 20cm in size. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl, then stir the sugars into the cooled butter. Stir in the eggs and vanilla, then gently fold the wet ingredients into the flour, along with the white chocolate and nuts, until just combined, being careful not to overmix.</p> \n<p>Pour into the tin and bake for 22-25 minutes, until set on top. Meanwhile, prepare a shallow sink of iced water; when the blondies are cooked, plunge in the tin, being careful not to drown the blondies, and allow to cool. Cut into squares and eat.</p> \n<p><strong>The blondie: the brownie’s paler and less-interesting cousin, or its more subtle and sophisticated older sister?

From the present you buy because it is the last thing on the list to the outfit you’ll never wear again, we reveal the hidden costs when friends tie the knot","byline":"Homa Khaleeli","body":"<p>It’s the chance to watch two people celebrate their love, make a lifelong commitment and be cheered on by their closest family and friends - if you can stomach the &pound;377 bill. According to a survey of 2000 people by the Nationwide building society, the average wedding guest will shell out hundreds of pounds for each invitation they accept this year. The survey has factored in pre- and post-celebration additions including hen nights, stag dos, new outfits, travel and hotels, with men spending &pound;51 more per happy couple. But how has the price of hearing a couple say “I do” crept up so high? I blame the hidden costs.</p> \n<h2><strong>All the towels are gone</strong></h2> \n<p>You’ve clicked on the gift list too late, all the sensibly priced presents have been bought and you are stuck with two options: pay an extra &pound;20 for the only thing left that looks like an actual gift, or swallow your pride and stick to your budget. This will probably be two silver forks that you could have nicked from the posher wedding you went to last weekend.</p> \n<h2><strong>Unwanted, one-wear-only clothes</strong></h2> \n<p>When it comes to weddings, your normal clothes suddenly look insufficiently dressy and you start panic buying silky dresses, metallic high heeled sandals or – shudder – nude tights. If you come to your senses and refuse to buy a tiny cardigan you will never wear again, you will freeze through the church service. Whatever you buy, you will have to pay extra for a taxi home because you can’t walk in those stupid heels. Men might think a suit will save them, but post-wedding breakfasts have their own strange dress code: brightly-coloured chinos and blazers don’t come cheap.</p> \n<h2><strong>Extra food</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes I know you aren’t paying for the wedding breakfast – but it’s not until 3pm. How can you not sneak off to buy something to plug the gap? And that’s without forking out for any pre-wedding dinners.</p> \n<h2><strong>Blowing away the competition</strong></h2> \n<p>Maybe the bride is an ex. Maybe you had a crush on the groom, maybe you are single, haven’t been given a plus one, and will be looked at with pity by family members all night. Consider it a tax on your ego because sometimes you just need to look amazing; this will definitely tip you over budget.</p> \n<h2><strong>Keeping up with the other guests</strong></h2> \n<p>If your friends’ friends are richer than you, you’re in trouble. One colleague says the first thing he was asked at the stag do was to pay his share for the stripper – his weekend’s budget gone in two seconds. “I remember having to walk for hours back to the campsite I was staying at. I stopped going to stag dos after that.”</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435075484775/What-price-being-there-fo-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"What price being there for their special moment?

In NSW, riders carrying a child under 10 years as a passenger or being towed in a trailer are allowed on a footpath, while South Australia is developing laws to allow all cyclists to ride on the footpath.</p> \n<p>The main reason respondents and stakeholders gave for wanting the footpath rules changed “was to allow riders to gain a better understanding of the road rules before sharing the road with other vehicles”, the review said.</p> \n<p>Those opposed to the change argued that extra riders on footpaths could create a danger for pedestrians, the review said.</p> \n<p>Stakeholders interviewed, including Bicycle Network Victoria, Transport Accident Commission and Vision Australia, unanimously agreed that laws requiring cyclists to wear a helmet should not be repealed.</p> \n<p>The Bicycle Network chief executive, Gary Brennan, told ABC radio on Thursday the review was needed due to an “explosion” in the number of bicycles on the streets.</p> \n<p>“We have had a huge change to the on-road environment in recent years with so many bikes, so it’s fit and proper that we look at the rules and ask ourselves the question: do they match up with what we see today?” he said.</p> \n<p>VicRoads manager for road user access and mobility, Robyn Seymour, said the report found cyclists were most concerned about a perceived lack of respect from others on the road, a varied understanding of road rules and a need for more bicycle infrastructure.</p> \n<p>The public would be able to provide feedback on the review in October, she said.</p> \n<p>In the decade to 2013, there were 29,181 crashes involving cyclists in Victoria, with 84 people killed and 4,447 seriously injured, the review found. </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/088b73946ef0ad5acb236784245fe8d9f3494add/0_491_3263_1957/3263.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1957,"width":3263,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Miranda Forster/AAPIMAGE","altText":"A rider cycles past street art in Southbank, Melbourne, Friday, Sept. 12, 2014.
