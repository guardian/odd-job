It’s the no-nonsense, quick and relatively cheap approach to mental suffering – with none of that Freudian bollocks, and plenty of scientific backing. So it was unsettling to learn, from <a href=\"https://uit.no/Content/418448/The%20effect%20of%20CBT%20is%20falling.pdf\" title=\"\">a paper in the journal Psychological Bulletin</a>, that it seems to be getting less effective over time. After analysing 70 studies conducted between 1977 and 2014, researchers Tom Johnsen and Oddgeir Friborg concluded that CBT is roughly half as effective in treating depression as it used to be.</p> \n<p>What’s going on? One theory is that, as any therapy grows more popular, the proportion of inexperienced or incompetent therapists grows bigger. But the paper raises a more intriguing idea: the placebo effect. The early publicity around CBT made it seem a miracle cure, so maybe it functioned like one for a while. These days, by contrast, the chances are you know someone who’s tried CBT and didn’t miraculously become perfectly happy for ever. Our expectations have become more realistic, so effectiveness has fallen, too. Johnsen and Friborg worry that their own paper will make matters worse by further lowering people’s expectations.</p> \n<p>All this highlights something even stranger, though: when it comes to talk therapy, what does it even mean to speak of the placebo effect? With pills, it’s straightforward: if I swallow a sugar tablet, believing it to be an antidepressant, and my depression lifts, then there’s a good chance the placebo effect is at work. But if I believe that CBT, or any therapy, is likely to work, and it does, who’s to say if my beliefs were really the cause, rather than the therapy? Beliefs are an integral part of the process, not a rival explanation. The line between what I think is going on and what <em>is</em> going on starts to blur. Truly convince yourself that a psychological intervention is working and by definition it’s working.</p> \n<p>Perhaps every era needs a practice it can believe in as a miracle cure – Freudian psychoanalysis in the 1930s, CBT in the 1990s, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/11/julie-myerson-mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy\" title=\"\">mindfulness meditation</a> today – until research gradually reveals it to be as flawed as everything else.</p> \n<p>Or it could be that we’re changing as people. In 1958, a US psychoanalyst, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Wheelis\" title=\"\">Allen Wheelis</a>, published a book arguing that Freudian analysis had stopped working because the American character had altered. In Freud’s day, Wheelis argued, people didn’t understand why they felt sad; psychoanalysis gave them explanations, whereupon they found it easy to transform their lives. Modern people were better at self-understanding, but they lacked the gumption to do anything about it. “Lacking the sturdy character of the Victorians,” as Roy F Baumeister and John Tierney put it in their book <a href=\"http://www.splendidtable.org/story/willpower-rediscovering-greatest-human-strength\" title=\"\">Willpower</a>‚ “people didn’t have the strength to follow up on the insight and change their lives.”</p> \n<p>The old techniques weren’t completely wrong; they’d just outlived their usefulness. If the secret of happiness is hard to find, maybe that’s because the answer keeps changing.</p> \n<p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/6/30/1435660711660/Oliver-CBT-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","credit":"Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","altText":"Oliver: CBT","cleanCaption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T14:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T23:06:27Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":153,"contributors":[{"name":"Oliver Burkeman","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/11/4/1415112352678/Oliver-Burkeman-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/oliverburkeman"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Health & wellbeing","Life and style","Psychology","Sigmund Freud","Mental health"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"science/psychology","webTitle":"Psychology"},{"id":"books/sigmundfreud","webTitle":"Sigmund Freud"},{"id":"society/mental-health","webTitle":"Mental health"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Oliver Burkeman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/oliverburkeman"}}],"series":{"title":"This column will change your life","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/thiscolumnwillchangeyourlife"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/why-cbt-is-falling-out-of-favour-oliver-burkeman","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49pq8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/why-cbt-is-falling-out-of-favour-oliver-burkeman","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/why-cbt-is-falling-out-of-favour-oliver-burkeman"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435660805592/8d70cff8-9412-4881-8dd7-3099d7c11668-1020x425.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":425,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","credit":"Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","altText":"Oliver: CBT","cleanCaption":"Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian"}},"importance":5,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/6/30/1435660711660/Oliver-CBT-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","credit":"Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","altText":"Oliver: CBT","cleanCaption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"Tinder matches want to drool over my hobbies.

Food.” </p> \n<p>This is a sample of the things people say they like on the awful dating app Tinder. But it’s also representative of things people say in real life. People like things. People are “into” things. People have hobbies.</p> \n<p>That’s great. It’s just I ... don’t.</p> \n<p>You hear it all the time. People like 17th-century architecture. People are obsessed with Italian noir fiction. People grow plants or love to cook.</p> \n<p>I don’t like doing any of those things. What’s more, I don’t go to the cinema. I don’t go to gigs. I haven’t read any of the latest books, heard any of the latest albums, seen any of the latest art exhibitions. Obviously I don’t go to the theatre. I have travelled, a bit (New Jersey counts, right?) but I wouldn’t feel comfortable calling it a passion.</p> \n<p>You can feel inadequate when you haven’t got a hobby. It can make meeting new people a stressful experience. It’s not just dating. It’s encountering anyone new. I dread in-depth conversations about music, or running a bee colony, or making plaster casts of people’s genitalia.</p> \n<p>Most of all I dread the question: “So what do you do in your free time?”</p> \n<p>It is terrifying. “What do I actually do in my free time?” I ask myself. “What have I been doing with myself while Ben was learning to crochet? Did I waste five years while Amanda was going to Italian classes?” </p> \n<p>How did I get to 29 years old without having an all-encompassing passion for woodwork or Nietzsche or ketamine? Or Swedish films in black and white or pottery or Spanish classes or dogging?</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/20/jason-statham-action-hero-spy\">I like Jason Statham</a>, but that’s hardly a hobby.

Nothing to expert level. Nothing that involves taking a class or spending money. </p> \n<p>But somehow, even without hobbies, I manage to fill up the days. Watching Peep Show over and over again takes up time. Eating the same meal (chicken breast with salad) three times a week takes up time. So does meeting up with the same friends in the same locations to talk about the same things. (Relationships. Work. That rash that won’t go away. The weather.)</p> \n<p>Maybe the point is that you don’t have to occupy every second of your free time to have a contented life. Maybe my feelings of inadequacy are misplaced.</p> \n<p>Because, in the end, I think I’m happy with my mundane existence. There is a simple pleasure in going with the flow. Of not having your weekends or evenings booked up. You don’t have to be devoted to something. You can wait for someone who can include you in their hobbies. Drink someone else’s fancy whiskey, smoke someone else’s crack.</p> \n<p>I live in New York. It is not a boring life. There is lots to do. Who cares if I do hardly any of it? I can stand in bars next to the cool, interesting, passionate people. Ride the bus with them. Ogle them in the park. </p> \n<p>It’s just that I’m not one of them.</p> \n<p>I’m boring. I don’t really do anything in my free time. And you know what?

Standard food vocab isn’t applicable: there’s no succulent, or juicy, or perfectly cooked, or fresh. The best feedback you can hope for is “Mmm, that’s dry. That’s really dry.” Still, the idea of home-desiccated strawberries, apricots and mushrooms is appealing, as a way to posh up yoghurt or flavour-inject a casserole. Lakeland’s circular dehydrator is plastic but not inelegant, with cobwebbed tiers vaguely reminiscent of the Galactic Senate from Star Wars, or at least the interior of the Welsh Assembly. There are five trays on which to array any fruit, veg and herbs you fancy; all you need do is slice and switch on. In practice, the process is not so cut and dried. Have you ever hand peeled 25 cherry tomatoes? It’s hard not to feel like life is passing you by. Slice size is a minefied, too. Too thin, you’ll end up with flavourless, disintegrating brittle. Too thick and you’ll be waiting for the rest of time. The listed drying time for a slice of banana is eight to 38 hours, a window so large you could put it on a cathedral. Luckily, I found everything was done in about seven (maybe I am good at this). Unstacking and inspecting the shriveled treasures feels less like cooking, more like pressing flowers or collecting beetles. Every specimen is shrunk to essentiality. You’re encouraged to box and label them, like a junior explorer. On tasting, the flavours are a revelation: tomatoes tangy, mushrooms more mushroomy, kale chips less annoying than expected.

There’s even an international chain dedicated to them. So, are they worth adopting?</p> \n<h2>The preparation</h2> \n<p>If you buy your chicken wings whole, you’ll need to separate them into the rather winsome sounding drumettes and flats. Drying them before cooking, preferably for a few hours in the fridge, as <a href=\"http://www.eburypublishing.co.uk/editions/the-chicken-book-the-definitive-cookbook-every-chicken-recipe-youll-ever-need/9780091959722\">Catherine Phipps suggests in her book Chicken</a>, or, if you don’t have the time, at least drying them with paper towels just before cooking, will help the skin to crisp up (and a chicken wing, given the scanty meat involved, stands or falls on its skin). I don’t think the wings require seasoning with salt and garlic powder, as Phipps recommends, though; although this gives them a good flavour when eaten au naturel, it clashes with the spicy, intensely savoury sauce they are tossed in later, which may be why she admits to a weakness for the odd handful “as is”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c96019d2be265cd45012dee276677b6c8cfbb78e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436351593692/f877aa18-8ee2-4987-ad52-51494c228925-460x381.jpeg\" alt=\"Catherine Phipps’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"381\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Phipps’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The coating</h2> \n<p>Early recipes don’t include any coating – the chicken is just fried as is. The Joy of Cooking, however, coats the wings with seasoned flour, while <a href=\"http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/1858-buffalo-wings\">Cook’s Illustrated goes for cornflour</a> for “an even crispier exterior”. They’re delicious, but turn flabby and disappointing far more quickly than the plain variety, especially when doused in hot buttery sauce.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9abf4f1c08123836d631888fd03cf68568dca763\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352238844/f59dfc50-8373-4def-867d-6216d7c206c7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Joy of Cooking's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Joy of Cooking’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The cooking</h2> \n<p>True bar buffalo wings are deep-fried, but many home recipes shy away from this – as Phipps perspicaciously observes: “The coating makes the wings literally drip in butter anyway, I prefer to bake them.” Alton Brown, <a href=\"http://altonbrown.com/buffalo-wings/\">the scientifically minded American television chef</a>, avoids deep-frying on the basis that “most American cooks lack access to commercial fryers” – though, presumably, they do have saucepans and stoves, which is all you need to deep-fry something. He steams them first, “to render out a lot of the fat”, then cools them to “tighten the skin” before baking. I’m impressed at how crisp both baked versions are, but the meat inside is undeniably dryer than the deep-fried wings from Saveur, The Joy of Cooking and Cook’s Illustrated. If you’re really against frying, however, Phipps’s recipe is considerably less faff than Brown’s, and works just as well – bake at 220C for 20-25 minutes on each side.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"350e244f2af06922443b5aad7220937a38de25b7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352329320/5147c0f8-59d7-4048-94e2-cba2e2869d9c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alton Brown's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alton Brown’s buffalo wings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The sauce</h2> \n<p>The original recipe is as simple as you’d expect for something allegedly knocked up on the spur of the moment in a bar: hot sauce and butter (or margarine if you’re to believe Saveur, though I can’t bring myself to give it a try because I really don’t want to eat deep-fried chicken smothered in tasteless fat). Brown adds garlic, which I really like, and Phipps, The Joy of Cooking and Cook’s Illustrated all stick some vinegar in there, too, which accentuates the natural edge of the sauce and balances the richness of the butter nicely.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41820286efa3aef3ce1d626b1ed2e0aedeaeebe9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352431066/f92fef42-2111-4a2f-9d45-8550cd403cdf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Saveur's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saveur’s buffalo wings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most recipes call for a specific brand of hot sauce: <a href=\"https://www.franksredhot.com/\">Frank’s</a>, which is a sour, piquant condiment made from cayenne peppers in Missouri, but, though it is available in this country, I think you can use whichever one you happen to like. Indeed, Cook’s Illustrated found that most of its tasters found Frank’s rather mild, so they mix it with something “a little more dynamic” but, as long as it’s hot and sour, it will work. That said, I do like the pinch of dark brown sugar the magazine adds to “round out the flavours” – but, as these depend on which sauce you use, I’d recommend tasting and adjusting to suit your palate. And, though it’s sacrilege, I’d also suggest drizzling the dressing over the wings, rather than tossing them in it – they stay crisper that way.</p> \n<h2>The blue-cheese sauce</h2> \n<p>And what’s the natural accompaniment for spicy deep-fried chicken wings? Why, a rich, salty blue-cheese dip, of course – and it should be intensely savoury, which is why The Joy of Cooking’s roquefort works better than Phipps’s stilton or Cook’s Illustrated’s mild, creamy blue. Mayonnaise supplies body, and sour cream or creme fraiche the requisite tanginess; buttermilk is too runny here, pleasingly American as it sounds. A dash of vinegar accentuates the tang, along with just a splash of sweet and intensely savoury Worcestershire sauce.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1b0378c48309d07d7d2b47f74070fcb405d7518\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352561594/2eda6752-809a-4fd9-988b-8ee0eeb598eb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cook's Illustrated's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cook’s Illustrated’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’m not keen on raw onion or dried garlic powder (the other flavours are harsh enough), and parsley, though pretty, is distractingly fresh and peppery, unlike the more harmonious chive.</p> \n<p>Serve with carrot and celery sticks and pretend it’s healthy.</p> \n<p><strong><em>(serves 4 with sides)</em></strong><br /><em>For the wings</em><br />16 wing pieces (or 8 whole wings)<br />Neutral oil, to fry<br />40g butter<br />2 garlic cloves, crushed<br />120ml sour hot sauce, eg Frank’s <br />2 tsp cider vinegar<br />1 tsp dark brown sugar<br />2 carrots, peeled and cut into batons<br />2 celery sticks, destringed and cut into lengths</p> \n<p><em>For the blue-cheese sauce</em><br />100g crumbled roquefort<br />6 tbsp sour cream or creme fraiche<br />2 tbsp mayonnaise<br />2 tsp cider vinegar<br />1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce<br />Small bunch of chives, finely chopped (optional)</p> \n<p>If you have time, remove the wings from their packet and put them on a rack above a bowl or tray in the fridge for between 1 and 12 hours.

The number of married people rose 700,000 in the last three years but an increase in the overall UK population means the percentage dropped.</p> \n<p>Harry Benson, research director of Marriage Foundation, a thinktank that promotes marriage, said: “On our own current estimates, 90% of 60-year-olds have married at some stage, whereas only 50% of today’s young adults will do so. If we want more of our young two-parent families to succeed as couples, the older generation have got a lot of encouraging to do.”</p> \n<p>But the figures also showed divorce rates were highest among older couples. More people aged 50-64 were divorcing than younger age groups.</p> \n<p>The number of divorcees was close to its 2011 peak, with 8.2% of the population having dissolved marriages or civil partnerships.</p> \n<p>Despite a drop in the proportion of people in civil partnerships – down 0.2% year-on-year, attributed to same-sex couples now opting for marriage – some campaigners are convinced <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/dec/03/civil-partnerships-for-everyone-heterosexual-couples\">civil partnerships for opposite-sex couples</a> would be a way to give legal protection to partners who are wary of traditional marriage.</p> \n<p>The Equal Civil Partnerships For All campaign is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/dec/02/couple-challenge-ban-heterosexual-civil-partnerships\">fronted by Charles Keidan and Rebecca Steinfeld</a>, who have mounted a high court challenge to the law restricting civil partnerships to same-sex couples.<br /></p> \n<p>Ava Lee, the group’s campaigns manager, said comparable legislation in other countries had led to an uptake in cohabiting couples opting for legal protection via civil partnership equivalents, and had not had any effect on the numbers choosing traditional marriage. </p> \n<p>For some couples, Lee said, marriage was “an institution that they do not feel comfortable with being a part of”.</p> \n<p>She said: “Preventing these couples from accessing civil partnerships denies protections under the law: no rights to ownership of each other’s property, no rights to inherit the other’s estate, and no rights to tax benefits provided to married couples. There is no real justification for upholding this strange anomaly in the law and stopping opposite-sex couples from forming civil partnerships.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Marriage graphic\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1436428483310/marital_status.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436375510929/449d313f-3760-4183-bbf0-ca4daf36b04d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Image Source/Corbis","altText":"Newlyweds cutting a cake","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Image Source/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-08T20:48:12Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T08:05:11Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1,"contributors":[{"name":"Jessica Elgot","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/6/26/1435313719448/Jessica-Elgot-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jessica-elgot"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Marriage","Civil partnerships","UK news","Office for National Statistics","Life and style","Family"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/marriage","webTitle":"Marriage"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/civil-partnerships","webTitle":"Civil partnerships"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk/office-for-national-statistics","webTitle":"Office for National Statistics"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jessica Elgot","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jessica-elgot"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/08/record-number-england-wales-never-wed-marriage","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4afc8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/08/record-number-england-wales-never-wed-marriage","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/08/record-number-england-wales-never-wed-marriage"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436375510929/449d313f-3760-4183-bbf0-ca4daf36b04d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Newlyweds cutting a cake.
