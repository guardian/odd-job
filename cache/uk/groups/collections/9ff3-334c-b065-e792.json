How can I&nbsp;help him get over what happened to him? How can I uncomplicate sex in his mind?</strong></p> \n<p>Unless you are an experienced, trained psychotherapist, you can’t. People who have experienced sexual trauma typically have difficulty feeling safe in subsequent intimate situations and, unfortunately, their abusers continue to hurt them with powerful fears and memories. Ideally, your boyfriend should seek expert help with the healing process. In the meantime, try to let him be the one to initiate, to chose when and where, to decide on the style and so on. This might be difficult for you – and you must certainly stop him if he oversteps your boundaries – but it may initially help to soothe his anxiety and fear.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/08/intimacy-with-my-boyfriend-feels-like-having-sex-with-my-brother-depression\">Intimacy with my boyfriend feels like having sex with my brother</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For now, try not to assume positions of physical or emotional power during lovemaking sessions. Encouraging him to talk about what happened, and listening empathically, may help, but he may not want to discuss it with you. Do not push. If he does open up to you about it, remember to simply listen without advising. Psychotherapeutic work can help, and could make it possible for him to have a healthy sexual relationship. Without it, he will probably continue to be challenged by terrifying memories in any sexual situation.

You put your head round my office door, and introduced yourself. Your obvious intelligence, your voice and your laughter – that normal part of your conversation – were captivating. The sound of your voice still has, will always have, a profound effect on me. Although I didn’t realise it until much later, it was a moment that changed the direction of my life.</p> \n<p>After that first meeting, we worked together for a year. The weeks and months passed, as I wondered whether everyone who you knew and met felt the same way about you. Whether they felt the same pleasure, the same thrilling chemistry, just being near to you. You quickly became my closest friend, as we spent more and more time together. Then, one summer evening, I hugged you and you kissed me. You say now that you were in love with me even before that. But for me, that was the moment the world changed for ever.</p> \n<p>We were both happily married. Neither of us had ever had affairs or even thought of being unfaithful. It was something that neither of us planned or expected, but it felt … unstoppable.</p> \n<p>We grew closer and closer as our friendship deepened and we became lovers. Now, seven years later, I long to be openly with you; the most unique, the most demanding, the most desirable woman I have ever met.</p> \n<p>We can count the number of nights we have spent together in that time on our fingers. But the stolen hours spent talking, eating, reading, laughing – just being together – are uncountable. We have shared triumphs and tragedies, professional and personal.</p> \n<p>More than once, my behaviour has hurt you badly and yet we are still very much together, each feeling that life without the other would be simply unbearable. The happiest and most intense hours of my entire life have been spent with you.</p> \n<p>There are times when the desire and the sadness that we are not together become completely overwhelming. I know that you love me. But I also know that you want me in your life alongside everything you already have. Alongside your husband. I know and understand that your situation is much more complicated than mine. My daughter is 19 now and will leave home this year, but your children are much younger. Leaving your husband for me would cause them real harm and plunge you into an international custody battle.</p> \n<p>I know that you will stay with him, whatever happens, for the sake of your children. I know that you feel he is one of your children too; that you will beg him to stay with you if our relationship is exposed. You have been honest about that. I know that you will not be with me, even if I am alone.</p> \n<p>Other people bear seemingly unbearable things in their lives all the time, so I must endure this. I have no other choice, except the living bereavement of a life without you. I have fallen in love with a woman I cannot have, and who cannot be with me. Perhaps in a few years, when your daughter has left home and your son is older, being openly with me will become a possibility for you.</p> \n<p>Until then, I will wait for you, want you, and love you.</p> \n<p><em>Anonymous</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-11T05:30:04Z","lastModified":"2015-07-12T11:36:25Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["Relationships","Sex","Life and style","Family"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/relationships","webTitle":"Relationships"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/sex","webTitle":"Sex"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"A letter to ...","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/aletterto"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/11/a-letter-to-the-woman-i-love-but-can-never-have","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4adfg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/11/a-letter-to-the-woman-i-love-but-can-never-have","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/11/a-letter-to-the-woman-i-love-but-can-never-have"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":5,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[]},{"title":"Five exercises to make you a faster, stronger runner","rawTitle":"Five exercises to make you a faster, stronger runner","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/faster-stronger-runner-plyometric-exercises","title":"Five exercises to make you a faster, stronger runner","trailText":"Paula Radcliffe and Mo Farah aren’t just fast – they’re strong, too.

Warm up thoroughly but don’t do these after a run – you should have fresh legs. “The key is keeping good form, so limit the repetitions to how many you can perform correctly and do plyometrics no more than twice a week,” says Nick. “For all the exercises, stand tall and stay light on your feet.” Build up repetitions as you get stronger.</p> \n<h2>Jumping lunges</h2> \n<p>Start in a lunge position, with right leg forward bent at a 90˚ angle (ensure that your knees don’t extend beyond toes) and left leg trailing behind with knee almost on the floor. Jump up and switch legs mid-air to land with left leg forward and right leg back. Pump your arms back and forth as you do when running. Focus on control and stability as you land – you shouldn’t be moving forward or sideways. Activate your gluteal (buttock) muscles to achieve this. Aim for 8-10 repetitions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fbac0b65b002521349651e8fc8f5c190d0fe8910\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436266884280/124333e4-584c-4329-8d82-dfb57f3ea6e0-460x459.jpeg\" alt=\"toe taps\" width=\"460\" height=\"459\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toe taps</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Toe taps</h2> \n<p>Stand facing a box, park bench or stairs. Lift your right leg and tap your right toes on the platform. As you bring the foot back down, spring up with your left foot to tap it on the platform, and keep repeating with alternate legs.

Stand with feet slightly apart and start jumping up and down. The key, though, is to barely bend your knees and use the ankles and calves to propel you into the air. So your legs should remain almost straight throughout, but not locked. At the top of each jump, your ankle should be fully flexed and toes pointing downwards. Keep up a rapid rhythm, taking off again as soon as your feet land. Aim for 15-25 jumps.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436266744177/9e3baeac-d7a6-4944-b3ab-52e3567bedbd-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"www.sarahmlee.com","altText":"Jumping lunge","cleanCredit":"Photograph: www.sarahmlee.com"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436266884050/bda5930c-7c0e-4899-996d-c9d1f145e4eb-620x618.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":618,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Toe taps","credit":"www.sarahmlee.com","altText":"toe taps","cleanCaption":"Toe taps"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436266992826/9e9b6884-6978-42cd-afe6-09d37fcc48ca-680x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":680,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"High skips","credit":"www.sarahmlee.com","altText":"High skips","cleanCaption":"High skips"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436267098951/4c379241-4a8f-477b-8300-8db986e3a950-620x615.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":615,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bench jumps","credit":"www.sarahmlee.com","altText":"Bench jumps","cleanCaption":"Bench jumps"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436267281226/6760c819-b6b6-4332-a47b-5db615d3c7ae-680x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":680,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Calf drives","credit":"www.sarahmlee.com","altText":"Calf drives","cleanCaption":"Calf drives"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-12T08:00:03Z","lastModified":"2015-07-12T14:37:44Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Lisa Buckingham","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/lisabuckingham"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Running","Health & wellbeing","Life and style","Fitness"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/running","webTitle":"Running"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fitness","webTitle":"Fitness"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Lisa Buckingham","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/lisabuckingham"}}],"series":{"title":"Do Something active","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/do-something-active"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/faster-stronger-runner-plyometric-exercises","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4av9d","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/faster-stronger-runner-plyometric-exercises","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/faster-stronger-runner-plyometric-exercises"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436266744177/9e3baeac-d7a6-4944-b3ab-52e3567bedbd-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jumping lunges: the key to these exercises is keeping good form, so limit the repetitions to how many you can perform correctly.

Pity it didn’t sink on the way…</p>","byline":"Jay Rayner","body":"<h2>Adelphi Building, John Adam Street, London WC2 (020 7321 6007). Meal for two, including drinks and service: &pound;225<br /></h2> \n<p><br />Cooking a steak well is tricky, because you cannot see inside the meat. It takes experience and knowledge. Cooking chips is easy: use the right potatoes, give them a couple of runs through the hot oil, make sure they’re the right colour, perhaps even taste a couple. The job is done. At <a href=\"http://www.smithandwollensky.co.uk/\">Smith &amp; Wollensky</a>, the new London outpost of a well-known small American steakhouse chain, we sent back the chips because they were tepid and under-cooked. They returned to us hot and undercooked. And in that one example of carelessness and lack of attention to detail, you know all you need to.</p> \n<p>But I had to sit through the whole damn meal so I don’t see why you shouldn’t, too. This US business has swaggered into London like it thinks it’s the bollocks. The description is almost right, if you remove the definite article before the reference to testicles. It is about as shoddy an operation in separating people from inexcusable amounts of their cash as I have seen in a very long time.</p> \n<p>But first a little context. Until about a decade ago Britain was crying out for a proper steakhouse on the American model; one that knew how to source beef, cut steaks thick enough and char them properly. Endless feeble attempts came and went. Then we got both <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/08/goodman-restaurant-london\">Goodman</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/18/jay-rayner-restaurant-hawksmoor-air-street\">Hawksmoor</a>, the latter adopting all the tropes of the US steakhouse, but giving them a pronounced British accent. It put prime cuts of British beef centre stage.</p> \n<p>And now comes Smith &amp; Wollensky (hereafter S&amp;W), which bellows loudly about importing US Department of Agriculture beef from Iowa, but which is backed by a consortium from Ireland, a country which produces some of the best beef in the world. They have spent a reputed €10m, and you can see where every cent has gone. The conversion of the basement and ground floor space of the 1930s New York pastiche Adelphi Building just behind the Strand is an orgy of leather and wood, of brass rail and tasteful mural. It can seat 300 people. Across 14 services a week I calculate they will need to find roughly 4,000 people able to pay the prices required to return that investment.</p> \n<p>Cocktails are &pound;13. That buys me an insipid Moscow Mule served in a stupid brass mug with a thin plastic straw. Five pleasant enough medium-sized seared scallops with shards of crisp bacon are &pound;18; four jumbo prawns are &pound;14. Except they don’t call them prawns, because despite the London setting the place must have a transatlantic drawl. So prawns are shrimps and all steaks are listed in imperial measurements. The USDA cuts include a 24oz bone-in ribeye and a 21oz sirloin. The prices for these are astonishing. The former is &pound;65, the latter &pound;62. To put this in context, at Hawksmoor the bone-in sirloin is &pound;5.60 per 100gm. At S&amp;W it’s &pound;10.42 per 100gm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a3922ec825662746ea984ba69e4d6269da1bc46\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436282247183/365ed920-9950-4831-86eb-17acddbf07a7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Smith &amp; Wollensky's bone-in ribeye steak next to sauces in pots and a knife\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The char is feeble, the overwhelming taste is of salt, and the texture is floppy’: Smith &amp; Wollensky’s bone-in ribeye steak. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Is that simply because it has travelled? Not if the fillet steak prices are anything to go by, because S&amp;W have sourced those from the UK. At Hawksmoor fillet is &pound;11.33 per 100gm; at S&amp;W it’s &pound;14.55. Both the menu blurb and the waiting staff bang on about this being the best steak you will ever have. The menu also mentions a list of blackboard specials – T-bones and so on – all of which have run out by 8.20pm. We order the bone-in ribeye. The char is feeble and the overwhelming taste is of salt. Worse is the texture. It’s floppy. Part of this, I think, is a cultural difference; Americans like to celebrate steaks based on tenderness, as if being able to cut a piece of dead animal with a butter knife is an aspiration. I think that if you’re going to eat beef, you want to know it has come from an animal that has moved. This steak slips down like something that has spent its life chained to a radiator in the basement.</p> \n<p>The sauces are dire. A b&eacute;arnaise is an insult to the name, lacking any acidity or the anise burst of tarragon. An au poivre sauce is just a shot of hot demi-glace. A side salad is crisp and well dressed. We take comfort in it. Many other sides are priced for two which is a quick route to higher profit margins and greater food waste. The &pound;9 battered onion rings are good; the &pound;10 truffled mac and cheese is dry and tastes not at all of truffle. Those terrible chips come in the kind of mini-chip-fat-fryer-basket used at chain pubs.</p> \n<p>Service is omnipresent. Twice we ask to keep our bread and side plates when they attempt to remove them. When a third waiter lunges in I finally admit defeat. Take them if you’re so bloody desperate. How hard is it to communicate a table’s wishes to the half dozen people working a corner of the floor, especially when a meal is going to cost more than &pound;100 a head?</p> \n<p>Our waitress, an escapee from Hawksmoor, is lovely – efficient, charming and utterly wasted here. She has been sent out on to the floor in a jacket she admits is about three sizes too large for her and is already stained. Either the management gives a damn about the dignity of its staff or it really doesn’t. Still, she speaks fluent Smith &amp; Wollensky, intoning the oft-repeated figure that theirs are the best 2% of all USDA steaks. God help the other 98%. We try to love it, really we do, but we just can’t. Clearly the poor animal died twice: once in the slaughter house, once on the grill. We give up and hope she doesn’t look too distraught. Curiously, the menu announces in small print that items “may” be cooked to order. May? Only <em>may</em>? Don’t put yourself out, guys.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"faa1e2dd4f50f351a89e80aff4e195ec43eb42ed\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436282525577/f84b8aea-cfaa-4466-8df4-f2be77471b1b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Slice of rich layered chocolate cake next to a cow-shaped biscuit, some cream and raspberries, blueberries, strawberries\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The chocolate cake – ‘an obscenity’, according to Jay.

It comes with a mini milk urn full of chilled lightly whipped and sweetened cream. That cream is by far the best thing we eat all night. The cake is an obscenity, a foul, brusque monolith of heavy sponge and cack-handed mousse almost a foot high. It tastes of fat and sugar and disdain. It eats like those showpiece cakes that have sat for years in coffee shop windows look. We are told there is an option to take left-overs home. We choose not to. The last thing we want, as we walk out the door, is to take any part of the dreadful Smith &amp; Wollensky experience with us.</p> \n<h2>Jay’s new bites</h2> \n<p>■ At the other end of the expense scale, Grillshack on London’s Beak Street serves a quick-seared piece of flattened rump, with shoestring potatoes and smoked butter for just &pound;9.95.

But all the support is aimed at women. One desperate man set out to change that</p>","byline":"Andrew Shanahan","body":"<p>Britain has a weight problem that no number of subtly oversized black T-shirts can hide. The scale of the issue is daunting: 67% of men and 57% of women are either overweight or obese, and by 2030, those figures are predicted to rise to 74% and 64% respectively. But while the majority of reports focus on the nation’s gradual slump towards obesity, those same figures reveal another, seldom-told story. Namely, that weight is more of an issue for men, yet very little is being done to help them. A recent freedom of information request by the charity <a href=\"http://www.menshealthforum.org.uk\" title=\"\">Men’s Health Forum</a> revealed that 110,324 women had received weight-loss help from their local authorities in 2013/4, but just 29,197 men. In other words, you are 277% more likely to get help with weight loss if you are a&nbsp;woman.</p> \n<p>“These figures are pretty shocking,” explains Martin Tod, CEO of Men’s Health Forum. “We want to see local councils making much bigger efforts to design their services to work for men. This is particularly important because men comprise three-quarters of premature deaths from coronary heart disease – and middle-aged men are twice as likely as women to&nbsp;get&nbsp;diabetes.”</p> \n<p>There are 20.7 million overweight men in the UK, and the local authorities charged with helping them are reaching just 0.1% of that figure; for women, it’s a scarely better 0.6%. The <a href=\"https://www.conservatives.com/~/media/files/green%20papers/a%20healthier%20nation.ashx?dl=true\" title=\"\">Conservatives have made encouraging noises</a> about enshrining preventative action at the heart of healthcare, but with cuts wiping millions from precisely the budgets where these interventions come from, it becomes hard to see how we are going to tackle the issue.</p> \n<p>I confess, I have an extremely vested interest in this topic, both as a formerly fat man and as an entrepreneur who runs a business delivering men-only weight-loss groups. My own history neatly illustrates why more men aren’t engaged with weight loss. In 2012, I&nbsp;weighed nearly 17 stone and was desperate to lose weight. I was amazed at the struggle I had to find anyone who could offer to help (relatively) normal blokes like me. On a visit to my GP, he tutted earnestly at my expansive gut, handed me a pamphlet and wished me luck. There was no weight-management group to support me, or relevant interventions&nbsp;of any kind.</p> \n<p>This left me at the mercy of a&nbsp;commercial diet industry that has jettisoned the idea that men might be an area worth focusing on. Typically, groups such as Weight Watchers and Slimming World are more than 90% female and, as profits shrink, there seems to be little appetite to do anything other than focus on what they see as their core audience. At my heaviest, I remember sitting in a&nbsp;Weight Watchers meeting listening to how my period could cause bloating, wondering how many other men were being similarly let down. As <a href=\"http://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/118180/FullReport-hta18350.pdf\" title=\"\">Professor Alison Avenell pointed out in her excellent research</a> into men and weight management, the perception of dieting as a “feminised realm” has damaged men’s relationship with weight loss, and left them disenfranchised from this vital area of health. When you see that Diet Coke is marketed at women and Coke Zero is marketed at men, you begin to see the scope of the issue.</p> \n<p>Incredibly, a misguided perception that men aren’t actually that interested in dieting persists. Someone should really tell the 44% of men who tried to diet in 2013. Compare that to the 25% who dieted in 2003, and guess which way this trend is going: it doesn’t take a genius to see that weight loss is becoming a major issue for men. Yet despite this, the help offered to men about losing weight is practically nonexistent – we just get fobbed off with the fitness industry’s “get a six pack in six weeks” nonsense.</p> \n<p>For me, it took a long time to get to a&nbsp;place where I could apply the “eat less, move more” mantra and lose more than 60lbs. After failing to find any real support, I started a&nbsp;crowdfunding campaign to launch <a href=\"http://www.manvfat.com\" title=\"\">manvfat.com</a>, a project that offers free support to men who want to lose weight. We raised 102% of our &pound;9,000 target and got support from Jamie Oliver and many of the weight-loss organisations. Perhaps more importantly, we discovered thousands of men from every corner of the world who had the same ambition and problems I did – they wanted to lose weight but were struggling to find support. This is the “not optimal” situation that Avenell’s research describes; however, if you look hard enough, and squint slightly, there are signs of optimism.</p> \n<p>Perhaps most importantly, Avenell’s research has been distilled into a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.menshealthforum.org.uk/best-practice-weight-loss-programmes\" title=\"\">best-practice guide by Public Health England</a> and Men’s Health Forum. Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at Public Health England, <a href=\"http://manvfat.com/eatwell-plate-change-professor-kevin-fenton-interview-exclusive/\" title=\"\">has spoken with real enthusiasm</a> about how more needs to be done on the issue. For their part, local authorities seem keen to deliver the sort of services that could see more male lives being saved. At Man v Fat, we are already working with North Somerset to deliver free weight-management programmes following the best-practice guidelines, and our plan is to work with more authorities, and do our bit to make the situation better for those 20.7 million men who simply want to lose some weight. Ultimately, if we want to lower the &pound;5.1bn cost of treating obesity-related conditions – and save lives – it will mean accepting that 0.1% is not good&nbsp;enough.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436369259893/ac21ddcd-afb7-4761-8971-36969e499327-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"There are 20.7 million overweight men in the UK.

Being a mother was acceptable if it wasn’t one’s raison d’&ecirc;tre – as a side mention it was passable, as a passion it indicated only a lack of capacity and imagination.</p> \n<p>In the west, this perception is now almost universal. Nurturing a child is considered to be squandering the time and talent of the educated. Female high-achievers now hunger for “challenges” in place of connections; the chancellor of the exchequer said recently that mothers who stay at home to look after their children are making a lifestyle choice, as if it were on a par with nudism or polyamory.</p> \n<p>This is reinforced by the behaviour of women in public life. A week after giving birth to her third son, the actor Cate Blanchett was addressing a summit. Rachida Dati, a former minister in the French cabinet, returned to parliament, in heels, five days after a Caesarean section.</p> \n<p>Such behaviour is not surprising given the menial status of motherhood. Our cultural take on success and heroism – the ideals of any&nbsp;civilisation&nbsp;– reflect a prejudice that is staggering. Throughout human history, heroism has almost exclusively been attributed to men. Although heroism pivots on courage, self-sacrifice and the preservation of other lives, the billions of mothers who have&nbsp;died in childbirth are forgotten.</p> \n<p>In 2013, four times as many women died giving birth around the world than there were casualties in the Syrian conflict, yet there were no headlines, crisis bulletins, aid packages or expressions of public outrage. The 293,000 women who die in pregnancy and childbirth every year (and the seven to 10 million who suffer severe or chronic illnesses caused by pregnancy-related complications) do so without public recognition of any kind. Heads of state do not stand in silence for the mothers who have fallen.</p> \n<p>The seriousness of childbirth on every level – emotional, spiritual, physical – for mothers is not only ignored, but derided. “Congrats! You’ve had the baby … now what?” fitness magazines ask, before suggesting “the general rule of thumb is to head back to the gym six weeks after birth”. Implicit in such advice is the understanding that having a baby is an event like any other, that a mother’s instinct to place her infant’s needs before her own is old hat, and that it is not only acceptable but correct for a mother to separate from her baby.</p> \n<p>A mother’s attachment to her child begins in hospital, where mothers are made to feel inferior to professionals in relation to their infants, then separated from them for examinations, bathing etc. One mother who gave birth in an elegant private hospital told me her son “was whisked off to neo-natal intensive care without me even having had a chance to greet him.” Despite having had a C-section, she staggered three floors down to see him, only to be forbidden to touch him. “They told me that he was too fragile and it was too much trouble to move all the equipment. Bonding, love and warmth had no value to them.”</p> \n<p>John Krystal, professor of psychiatry and neurobiology at the Yale School of Medicine, cites the recent discovery that the autonomic activity (heart rate and other involuntary nervous system activity) of two-day-old sleeping babies is 176% higher during maternal separation. “This is a major physiological stressor for the infant,” he concluded. Human beings are the only mammals to separate mothers from their infants. Scientists have, for decades, separated newborn animals from their mothers to study the damage to the evolving brain. But little has changed. Children are still placed in childcare and then go to school while adults work themselves into cardiac arrests. What’s lost in the wash is love.</p> \n<p>We are scripting simple happiness out of our lives. Throughout history, the most brutal cultures have been distinguished by maternal-infant separation. That earliest relationship is the very foundation of our ability to love and bond in later life but it requires quiet, calm, sustained proximity to one’s baby. Despite this, we continue to in effect bully mothers into returning to the workforce before the uterus has had time to shrink.</p> \n<p>The magnitude of childbirth is minimised for economic purposes, blighting an experience that could otherwise be infused with the purest bliss. At the most vulnerable time of their lives, mothers are repeatedly failed by the community. The post-partum confinement period – a 30 to 40-day tradition throughout China, Greece, India, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam – allows mothers not just to recuperate after birth, but to adjust to motherhood at a pace conducive to maternal-infant bonding. Hurried through the process, women in their millions are failing to give birth without intervention and to breastfeed.</p> \n<p>The joy and pleasure in new motherhood has been de-emphasised – and there is a cost. Our culture has come to be defined by adrenaline. From the way we wake up (strong coffee, blaring alarms, television, radio) to the way we mate (Tinder, Grindr, Blendr, Tingle and so on), the bar is set by technology: jarring, bright, instant. But babies cannot be jump-started and the acceleration of life as it’s lived now is toxic in terms of parenting. Life comes at us, and we react. Intimacy, on the other hand, is quiet, slow. There is no expediting love. And it is precisely at this point that our culture has started to fall apart.</p> \n<p>The fact that there is a need to specify attachment in relation to parenting tells us everything we need to know about the rupture between 21st century man and his heart.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a8d3f91456cc50e62d2e1634a846d5d683d3938d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436197335004/1150271c-fdf7-41d0-a440-4f6fab8d9ab3-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"John Bowlby, who wrote that it is crucial for the mental health of the child, to 'experience a warm, intimate and continuous relationship with his mother.'\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Bowlby, who wrote that it is crucial for the mental health of the child, to ‘experience a warm, intimate and continuous relationship with his mother.’</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Attachment theory began taking shape during the second world war, when Anna Freud, the founder of psychoanalytic child psychology (and Sigmund’s daughter), observed children separated from their families for safe-keeping during the blitz were suffering developmental problems. Despite sometimes receiving superior physical and intellectual care, these children were subject to fits of aggression, emotional withdrawal, headbanging, bed-wetting and soiling, tantrums, regression and other behavioural disturbances. Freud wrote movingly of “the depth and seriousness of this grief of a small child” when their attachments were disrupted.</p> \n<p>This laid the groundwork for the psychiatrist John Bowlby’s exploration of the issue. In 1951, he published a monograph describing how essential it is for the mental health of the infant and young child to “experience a warm, intimate and continuous relationship with his mother (or permanent mother-substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment. Given this relationship, the emotions of anxiety and guilt, which in excess characterise mental illness, will develop in a moderate and organised way.”</p> \n<p>Parental devotion has an irreversible impact on children. Only 20-25% of the brain is complete at birth and, even then, only in terms of autonomic function (heart rate, breathing, etc); the rest of the brain is formed by the infant’s experience of love or by its absence. The first three years of life in particular are critical in shaping both the capacity to form loving relationships in adulthood and the stability that makes happiness possible.</p> \n<p>“Empathy, caring, sharing, inhibition of aggression, capacity to love and a host of other characteristics of a healthy, happy and productive person are related to the core attachment capabilities which are formed in infancy and early childhood,” noted Professor Bruce Perry, the renowned child mental health researcher. Given that this is the case, the current epidemic of disconnection makes it clear that our current child-rearing methods do not equip us with the capacity to sustain intimacy.</p> \n<p>If a child’s early experiences of care-giving are inconsistent, insensitive or indifferent, certain biochemical systems – the stress response and emotional systems among them – can be affected. To be abandoned by mother in infancy – and the neonatal brain is wired by evolution to interpret being left alone even briefly as abandonment – not only damages our ability to connect with others, but creates the self-loathing that can destroy a life.</p> \n<p>Effective mothering requires not only a sustained investment of energy by the mother, but an equal investment of energy into the mother by her partner, family and community. The change we need demands a revision of priorities. We need to rally round mothers, enabling them to bond with their babies so that the next generation does not suffer the same wounds.</p> \n<p>Critically, we need to understand that far from being drudges, mothers are, in fact, creating the very course of our species’ future.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Mama Love, Motherhood and Revolution by Antonella Gambotto-Burke is published by Pinter &amp; Martin, &pound;11.99.

We were close when I was a child (I’m 23 now) and I drifted away from him during adolescence. I cannot put my finger on why, except perhaps I became more girly and less relatable to him. I am an only child and am very close to my mum. I am often a disappointment to him, but I cannot see my mistakes coming. I’m envious when my friends’ dads say they look lovely or when I see how tenderly the fathers of the children I babysit treat their wives and kids. Dad refers to my mum as bonkers, hopeless, waste of bloody space, mad bat, bloody useless, or just “ya mum” (“Where’s ya mum gone now?!”) or often just “woman”…</em></p> \n<p><strong>Mariella replies </strong>He’s a charmer! As you’ve made clear, your dad doesn’t wear his heart on his sleeve. How sad that the two of you are both trapped in patterns of behaviour that lock each other out. It’s guesswork my end, but it ’s no understatement to say that your father struggles with his emotional side. He’s not alone among his sex in finding it an embarrassment to let down his guard, particularly with the two women in his life. If he treated you more tenderly he’d be showing you he cares about you, and what a Pandora’s box that would open, eh?!</p> \n<p>Your father is a perfect stereotype of unreconstructed manhood, illustrating why there is much to do in furthering the male/female balance in today’s world. Despite some 70 years of full-on feminist rhetoric, we still bring up boys to be emotionally buttoned up and girls to remain painfully vulnerable to any emotional undercurrent. This male inability to express vulnerability, admit to weakness or talk honestly about feelings is the greatest obstacle to real emancipation and pervades the corridors of power and politics across the globe. How can we resolve the biggest issues of our time when the world is primarily run by a gender that struggles to communicate basic emotions? Love, fear, affection, sadness, depression and isolation are buried under a veneer of ability and control. It must be as exhausting for men as it is for the opposite sex.</p> \n<p>Responding to this pervasive cultural pressure to behave in a “manly” manner, my small foundation <a href=\"http://www.thegreatinitiative.org.uk/\">thegreatinitiative.org.uk</a> created a pilot project in London devoted to encouraging young men to see women as friends, not foes; to showing that an emotional life is a far richer one, and that women’s ability to show weakness, far from being worthy of disparagement, can actually be a strength. <a href=\"http://www.great-men.org/\">Great Men Value Women</a> works in schools training class ambassadors to host group talks where boys get to discuss their real feelings. Early findings suggest that it’s not only popular but creating positive change, and the most common emotion expressed by the boys in the pilot project is relief at being allowed to “open up”.</p> \n<p>That’s no help to your dad, who’s beyond their impressionable age. He’s your full unreconstructed behemoth, and when you are judging his feelings towards you it’s very important that you keep that in mind. Every term he uses about your mum is an emotionally distancing one. That doesn’t mean he doesn’t love her; in fact it makes it far more likely that he does. He simply can’t express himself in anything other than isolating, self-protective terms. I’m sure your dad also loves you, but he really doesn’t know how to manage or express it. He’s a product of his time and an example of why we need to make the world a more female-shaped place.</p> \n<p>Society accepts fathers who are “soft” on their little girls, so he was more comfortable back then, but as you’ve become a mature adult that dynamic has changed and he’s clueless how to bridge what appears an insurmountable divide. The only way to cross that Empty Quarter is to improve communication – and that is going to be up to you. Would it help to think of him as a foreign language speaker, a person with whom just a little tutoring could open up a whole new world? Your dad won’t know he’s got a problem, let alone how to fix it. To develop a relationship between you that’s even half as rewarding as the one you have with your mum, you’ll have to soften him up. He’s like some tragic caged gorilla destined forever to be segregated from his family. For every gruff word he utters, respond with a welcoming one; encourage him towards you by expressing yourself to him in the way you’d like him to respond. Knowing that underneath that Billy Goat Gruff exterior lie all the emotional undercurrents you yearn for will hopefully make it worth the initial arduous steps.</p> \n<p>You are definitely not unique, and watching other families from the outside very rarely gives a true picture – my husband and I were once so impressed by the caring, affectionate behaviour we witnessed in a visiting family that we resolved to end our incessant low-level bickering and behave in the manner of our guests. I’m afraid we failed, but as they separated within months of the visit their tenure as role models also ended! I haven’t the slightest shred of doubt your father is crazy about you and your mother; he just needs you to walk towards him with your arms open so he feels secure enough to tell you.</p> \n<p><br />If you have a dilemma, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk\">mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk</a></p> \n<p>Follow Mariella on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mariellaf1\">@mariellaf1</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436274892601/d4920f6b-79c9-456a-a91b-b2dad7b86021-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":207,"width":345,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"SCPhotographie/Getty Images","altText":"Father holding daughter in lake, seen from the back","cleanCredit":"Photograph: SCPhotographie/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-12T04:59:00Z","lastModified":"2015-07-12T04:59:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":451,"contributors":[{"name":"Mariella Frostrup","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/13/1421154121982/Mariella-Frostrup-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/mariellafrostrup"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Family","Parents and parenting","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Mariella Frostrup","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/mariellafrostrup"}}],"series":{"title":"Dear Mariella","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/dearmariella"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/dad-never-show-love-respect-mariella-frostrup","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aeex","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/dad-never-show-love-respect-mariella-frostrup","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/dad-never-show-love-respect-mariella-frostrup"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436274892601/d4920f6b-79c9-456a-a91b-b2dad7b86021-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":207,"width":345,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Society accepts fathers who are “soft” on their little girls, so your dad was more comfortable back then.
