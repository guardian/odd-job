Some simply live in hope that one day, some lover will figure it out for them (“Some day my prince will make me come!”).</p> \n<p>Vibrators are too intense for many women, but you either need that intensity to fully stimulate your genital nerve endings, or have become habituated to it. Either way, it would be best to relax and accept that it is simply your style of reaching orgasm.

I’ve joined the 78% of women who wear them almost daily, despite them causing pain, on average, after one hour and six minutes. High heels are perceived to be worth the pain because they make legs look taller, feet smaller and the body thinner.

Usually that change is small. But wear high heels and it is larger, and the strain goes more through the tendon joining the muscle to the bone, as it usually does. The Achilles tendon at the heel can shorten and get stiff. Cronin says women who wear heels for years develop such chronically short muscles and tendons that when they try to wear flat shoes again their calves hurt. Studies have also suggested high heels increase the risk of arthritis, but it’s difficult to prove. So should you stick to flats?</p> \n<h2><strong>The solution</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>It’s hardly news that you can fall over in high heels but the evidence of ankle instability suggests some care is needed. Cronin advises thicker heels (wedges anyone?) as they help balance, and keeping heels to 4cm or below. Wearing soft insoles can reduce pressure on your knees. You should alternate with flats (Cronin advises limiting high heels to two to three days a week) take them off if you sit at work and do stretching exercises for your feet and calves (for example, pick up a pencil from the floor with your toes). Or not walk in them at all.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434720143455/What-damage-are-high-heel-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"What damage are high heels doing to your feet?

The headache was bad enough, but the nausea and lethargy made you feel as if you had been poisoned. Yet, when you had done the same thing two months before, it hadn’t felt this bad, even though you had drunk the same amount of wine and avoided the usual culprits (the spirits, such as brandy and whisky, with their particularly toxic chemicals). What was worse, your friend, who drank even more than you, felt fine. The usual excuse is to blame the after-effects on bad luck, or your genes, but could there be other culprits?</p> \n<p>Hangovers occur due to the side-effects of the chemical produced when alcohol is broken down. Alcohol itself is fairly harmless – but enzymes convert it to acetaldehyde, which does&nbsp;the damage. The longer the acetaldehyde hangs around, the worse you and your liver feel. Other enzymes help to clear the acetaldehyde away, but the rates at which both happen are extremely variable in different people.</p> \n<p>Many east Asian people carry a&nbsp;mutation in a gene that increases the&nbsp;speed at which acetaldehyde is formed. This means that, compared with Caucasians, they suffer more side-effects from boozing, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_flush_reaction\" title=\"\">flushing</a> and nausea. There are also more subtle gene variants that alter how much acetaldehyde an individual can produce and how fast they can eliminate it.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25098862\" title=\"\">A study of more than 4,000 twins in Australia</a> has shown that susceptibility to hangovers has a major genetic component. Other twins studies have shown that liking or disliking the taste of alcohol, the amount of drinking, and alcohol addiction are strongly heritable traits. So clearly the <a href=\"http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa18.htm\" title=\"\">genes that control these enzymes are important</a> – but they are not the whole story.</p> \n<p>Last year, <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096864\" title=\"\">a US study explored for the first time what binge drinking did to our microbes</a>. Twenty-five healthy volunteers who were not regular drinkers were given a wine glass of vodka. There was a wide variety in response: those with the worst symptoms and changes in blood tests had the highest levels of toxins coming from the cell walls of their gut microbes. These toxins (called LPS) had somehow leaked out of their intestines, as a result of the inflammation the alcohol had produced. Within their guts the alcohol produced a brief, but large increase in the microbe species that were pro-inflammatory, stimulating the immune system as if it were under attack and contributing to the general sick-feeling so typical of hangovers.</p> \n<p>Population studies, such as the American gut project, show that low to moderate alcohol intake can actually increase your microbial diversity, which is usually beneficial for your health. One of my own researchers (I’m&nbsp;a professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London) diligently experimented on her own microbes by&nbsp;drinking three pints of beer each evening for five days. Her 5,000 or so gut microbes overall did not change, but a few species increased markedly –&nbsp;one relatively unknown one called <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23606477\" title=\"\">Erysipelotrichia</a> increased five-fold. When she looked at its possible function from its genes, she found it could produce alcohol dehydrogenase – the enzyme that breaks down alcohol to acetaldehyde. So, as she was drinking her beer and feeling increasingly tired and lethargic, her alcohol-loving microbe species were busy reproducing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/apr/03/how-to-cope-with-if-not-cure-your-public-holiday-hangover-with-food\">How to cope with, if not cure, your public holiday hangover with food</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So, drinking too much alcohol actually causes toxins to be released from our microbes, as well as growing more microbe-loving alcohol species. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22405477\" title=\"\">Studies have also shown</a> that when mice are fed these toxins, they seek out more alcohol than normal mice, suggesting that the microbes, via their toxins, could actually be encouraging us to seek out even more alcohol and – worryingly – even lead to addiction.</p> \n<p>If our microbes are part of the problem – what happens if we eliminate them? Experiments making mice binge-drink like humans produced signs of liver damage – again because of the toxins, leaky gut and inflammation. <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/14/240\" title=\"\">When the researchers repeated the experiment</a> in mice lacking microbes, they found no evidence of liver damage. Going back to their normal binge-drinking mice, the scientists tried feeding them a high-fibre diet (enriched with pectin found in apples) as well as alcohol shots, and compared this to a low-fibre diet. The high-fibre-fed mice amazingly had virtually no obvious side-effects from the alcohol on their livers. <a href=\"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(14)00097-6/abstract\" title=\"\">Similar preventive effects were seen</a> on mice given probiotics containing beneficial microbes such as&nbsp;lactobacillus, found in cheese and yoghurt. Even <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25239591\" title=\"\">saturated fat counteracted the harmful effects</a> of the alcohol on microbes.</p> \n<p>Although the jury is still out on whether drinking small amounts regularly is beneficial, overdoing alcohol is obviously bad for you. It causes major disruption to your gut microbes directly – and heavy drinkers also tend to have poor diets. Liver damage is now on the increase, particularly in children and young women. As diverse a diet as possible is the best insurance to maximise your range of microbial species and therefore your immune defences.</p> \n<p>Now when you wake up feeling unwell after a night out, you can blame your microbes as well as your pushy friends. But the microbes could also be part of the solution. If you are still keen on binge-drinking occasionally, at least start the evening with a slab of smelly cheese or a glass of high-fat natural yoghurt and let your microbes reduce some of the pain and suffering. Perhaps salt-and-microbe crisps could be the drinking partners of the future?</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> You can get your gut microbes tested and help research by signing up to the crowd funding project <a href=\"http://www.Britishgut.org/\" title=\"\">Britishgut.org</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434721422417/An-artists-impression-of--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An artist's impression of human intestinal microbes.

However, it wasn’t the results of their brilliant experiment that interested one newspaper reporter so much as its location. Oh, the irony that such a breakthrough should be made in Islington, a place he referred to as “<a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/manukas-magic-nothing-but-a-sweet-myth-children-prove/story-fnb64oi6-1227385766130\">Britain’s spiritual home of nonsense health fads”.</a> How on earth, he wondered, were the locals going to take this news? After all, don’t their corner shops sell little else? Those he interviewed were obliging, their tongues reaching immediately for their cheeks. “It’s deeply subversive,” said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SellaTheChemist/status/606107178051768321\">Andrea Sella</a>, a UCL chemist and parent at the school involved. “Islington may never be the same again.”</p> \n<p>Ho ho, I thought as I read this story, perched at my kitchen table in – yes – downtown Islington. I wasn’t, at that particular moment, much in the mood for tedious cracks about the price of Ottolenghi’s butternut squash with tahini. I was trying to take a breather. Plus, I had a little irony of my own to hand, what with having just come from the Tube, a walk that inevitably requires me to wade through pile after pile of discarded takeaway boxes and flattened Coke bottles, and what with the certain knowledge that I would soon have to head out in the other direction, a journey that would take me past a local restaurant that is called, enticingly, Chick-Pizz. (No, its speciality is not chickpeas. It is, I believe, a one-stop shop for the purchase of fried chicken and pizza.) All I wanted, you understand, was to be able to enjoy a swift Crunchie and a strong cup of PG Tips in peace and quiet without any recourse to – or even thoughts of – kale, gluten-free bread or overpriced honey from New Zealand.</p> \n<p>But I digress. In truth, I was unreasonably pleased to hear that manuka appears to do a person no more or less good than any other kind of honey (perhaps this is why the reporter’s tone irked me so). Even before you get to the cost – a 340g jar of Steens “cold process extraction” New Zealand manuka with an “anti-bacterial rating” of 20+ <a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Steens-Raw-Manuka-Honey-20/225482011\">will set you back a loopy &pound;33.95</a> – its bitter taste has always seemed to me to be the very opposite of what honey should be, which is to say sweet and comforting.</p> \n<p>I also have an inbuilt loathing of any foodstuff that comes trailing celebrity fans (Gwyneth Paltrow, joyless Twiglet that she is, believes in manuka, and so does Scarlett Johansson, who rubs it into her face – here’s the science bit – to <a href=\"http://www.style.com/beauty/people/2011/im-not-the-kind-of-person-that-just-slops-around-in-sweatpants-scarlett-johansson-on-why-beauty-is-a-daily-commitment\">“pull out the impurities”</a>). Most of all, though, there is just the simple fact that there are so many other, more delicious honeys out there in the world to be enjoyed. And I should know. When it comes to honey, those smart aleck kids have got nothing on me.</p> \n<p>The best I’ve ever tasted came from Yemen, a country famed across the Middle East for its honey, which is made from the flowers of the sidr tree, aka Christ’s thorn, the jujube or the lote. In 2008, I bought two combs in Wadi Hadramawt, a lonely and magical place that it would be impossible to visit now, and transported them back to Britain in a couple of tins, one for me, and one from my honey-addict friend, Nick. All I can tell you is that it was magnificent: floral without being cloying (though the Yemenis, I read, mix it with carrot seed and claim it as an aphrodisiac – so it could, in theory, be cloying in other ways).</p> \n<p>On these shores, sea lavender honey is notable both for its mildness and its lovely pale yellow-green colour – though it’s difficult to track down (you can sometimes find it at farmers markets in London and East Anglia). I also like the honey produced by Steve Benbow at the<a href=\"http://www.thelondonhoneycompany.co.uk/\"> London Honey Company</a>. He sells all sorts: borage, ling heather, Isle of Purbeck (the latter is made mostly from hawthorn blossom, which to me gives it extra romance). But my best treat would be a comb of his distinctive London honey, the work of urban bees. The thought of their hives, high on tower-block roofs and other out-of-the-way places, relieves the low moods brought on by knee-deep litter and fried chicken joints. Spread the city on your toast, and it begins to seem sweet once again.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434469666975/2cb2744d-848d-4cbb-97f9-85a5966dad49-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Marc O.

I don’t have friends to call my own and I work so hard all day and most of the evening as a teacher that I can barely cope with the workload. I was in a relationship for three years (bearing in mind I am still young, 26 next week), but he left me a year and a half ago. I now realise he left because he couldn’t stand that I was such a loner and had no one but him. I see people on Facebook going out all the time, going to hen dos and meeting people, and I wonder to myself why I am the odd one out.</em></p> \n<p><strong>Mariella replies</strong> Join the club. Judging your own life in contrast to those apparently being led by others, whether on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter is a mistake we are all increasingly guilty of. Such edited excerpts don’t offer an accurate communication, but they do have the capacity to make anyone with a pulse feel inadequate and despairing of their own lacklustre, unPhotoshopped existence.</p> \n<p>There are days when all those perfect people with their ceaseless socialising, sexy lifestyles, designer homes, impeccable children, wonderful vacations and fabulous work opportunities are simply too much to bear. Even when you can acknowledge you are being served only the highlights of other peoples lives, it’s difficult not to be depressed by how far you’re failing in the newly required skills of lifestyle bragging and follower flaunting. It’s enough to turn any sensible mortal into a sociopath wanting only to curl up in a corner and read Kafka.</p> \n<p>These days everyone can give their lives the sort of superficial gloss once reserved for the rich, famous and powerful. We may once have aspired to the elevated heights of the Brangelina lifestyle, but Brad and Ange seem positively suburban compared to the freeze-frame fabulousness served up by Instagrammers. The other day I looked at an old friend’s online profile and found myself confronted by a total stranger whose entire existence was packaged under #Blessed and bore no resemblance to the struggling, lonely and hard-pressed single parent of my acquaintance. A recent holiday confirmed this sense of parallel lives when I found myself among serial Instagrammers who spent more time inside on Wi-Fi sending and receiving photos than they did by the pool.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Social media makes much of its ability to create a global village, yet many people feel marooned</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Clearly you need to take back control of your life and stop the demands of work – and your fear of engagement with others. But first develop a realistic picture of what your life could be. So much of the emotional despondency you are expressing is at epidemic levels. If shared experience remains the key to quality communication you’d be surprised how many friends you actually have, people desiring exactly the same visceral connection as you. The mythology of social media makes much of its ability to create a global village, yet more and more people feel marooned and alone in their bedrooms.</p> \n<p>As a teacher you have a hefty workload, but it’s up to you to say when enough is enough. Being busy is another 21st-century vice that detracts from our ability to engage with the world around us. Women in particular seem to be bad at marking out their territory. One of the great skills men have acquired over millennia is to compartmentalise. It’s something my own sex could do with brushing up on.</p> \n<p>Be clear about your professional availability and then use the time you free up to find a pursuit that interests you: a hobby, sport, dance class, charity, political party… anything you fancy really, so long as it involves other people. Putting yourself in the path of human encounters is a far more fruitful way of finding friends than playing bystander to the lives of others on the internet.</p> \n<p>One good friend is as valuable as a million Facebook followers and a good life doesn’t need to be overpopulated. Start sniffing out adventures that await you outside the door. There’s only one person who can change your life, but plenty of others who can contribute to the quality of it once you’ve made that first move.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434538655154/Brad-Pitt-and-Angelina-Jo-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Even Brad and Ange seem positively suburban compared to the freeze-frame fabulousness served up by Instagrammers': Mariella Frostrup.

I am a bad person.</p> \n<p>Now I’m thinking about him because it is Father’s Day. An American invention, the day <a href=\"http://www.fathersdaycelebration.com/fathers-day-history.html\">isn’t that much older</a> than my father, who was born in 1936. Now we have cards and gift experiences featuring Ferraris, and all my friends join the throng at Euston station to travel home and deliver Old Spice by hand. Is that how it goes?

My friend and I were sat cross-legged on her bedroom floor, and when her mother burst into the room doing a good impression of Munch’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream\">The Scream</a>, I thought she’d rumbled the fact we were up to no good (planning a list of things to steal for a treasure trunk, I think).</p> \n<p>Then it was all police with radios that bleeped. Paramedics in yellow jackets. Kitchen. Funeral. I was a tomboy and had nothing to wear. I’m pretty sure I wore black Adidas tracksuit bottoms. She’s nine, what can you do? Her dad just died, let her wear what she wants.</p> \n<p>A half-brother and sister – must be in their late 40s now – I’ve never seen since. At least there’s that – my father and mother were not together, didn’t live together. I have friends whose mothers now set one less place at the table. That must be harder, and I suppose it must be more difficult to lose a parent as an adult. Is it? To have memories soldered down, ones that don’t shift and change like a <a href=\"http://www.magiceye.com/\">Magic Eye</a> painting.</p> \n<p>We don’t talk about him much: Alan Hugh James. But I have learned. I’ve learned from awkwardly asking my mother, once every five years maybe. By torchlight, as a 15-year-old, flicking through old papers in a spare bedroom.</p> \n<p>He’d been married three times. His first wife ran off with his lab technician when he was a research scientist at Cambridge. Later, he was the headmaster of an approved school. He loved rock climbing. His <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilda_James\">great aunt</a> was a silver medal-winning Olympic swimmer in 1920. He met my mother when he went into social work.</p> \n<p>Other things I know first-hand: I know that I imagined myself as a writer when I tapped away at his collection of old typewriters. Or that when my sister and I went to stay we watched Neighbours on a black and white television – in 1995. I first read Roald Dahl’s <a href=\"http://www.roalddahl.com/roald-dahl/stories/1980s/the-twits\">The Twits</a> on a camping trip together. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You lose a parent young and you feel like half a person</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>He loved art, photography and technology – he had computers before computers were a thing. He taught me how to clean keys with cotton buds soaked in TCP. I know his views on life and philosophy and academia, because he would write me 20-page letters about all these things. </p> \n<p>But I don’t really know him. You lose a parent young and you feel like half a person. There were things in those old papers that I didn’t agree with, or don’t understand, or which made me laugh, or which hurt me. Father’s Day breaks an anchor and brings it all to the surface – with added <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.moonpig.com/uk/?adid=GUKBRAND1&amp;gclid=CPWjlZGUm8YCFQnItAod_1kA1Q\">Moonpig</a>.</p> \n<p>What’s to be done?

Suddenly your headache becomes a brain tumour and your cough a sign of cancer. So we should all walk away from our keyboards, right?</p> \n<p>Not so, say some doctors, and with good reason. Last week, a&nbsp;grieving mother told reporters that her daughter – who feared that her rare form of liver cancer (<em>fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma</em>) was returning – was told to “stop Googling” by her doctors. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/healthcare-network/2015/jun/19/google-search-doctor-diagnosis-imperfect-balance-bronte-doyne-cancer\" title=\"\">Bronte Doyne had already had part of her liver removed</a> after being diagnosed in 2011. When she felt her symptoms coming back, she researched the condition and found there was a high chance the illness would recur. Doctors dismissed her fears, and she died in March 2013. The NHS trust responsible for her treatment admitted they needed to “embrace the internet age”.</p> \n<p>Craig Seymour, a London GP agrees. He says that most doctors welcome a patient who is well informed. But a critical eye is vital when dealing with online information. Here are six rules for Googling your symptoms safely:</p> \n<h2><strong>1. Don’t actually Google.</strong></h2> \n<p><strong> </strong>That’s madness. Instead, Seymour suggests using reputable websites such as <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Pages/HomePage.aspx\" title=\"\">NHS Choices</a>, which has a “symptom checker”, or <a href=\"http://patient.info/\" title=\"\">patient.info</a>. Charities and associations for specific conditions are also a good information source, he adds. For instance, check the Alzheimer’s Society website, <a href=\"http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/\" title=\"\">alzheimers.org.uk</a>, for information on dementia. And if in doubt, NHS England has a <a href=\"http://www.england.nhs.uk/tis/our-members/certified-organisations/\" title=\"\">list of certified organisations</a> to consult when looking for accurate information.</p> \n<h2><strong>2. Try to be specific.</strong></h2> \n<p><strong> </strong>Vague search terms will result in frightening answers, says Seymour – and practically any symptom can be read as a sign for cancer or some other horrible illness.</p> \n<h2><strong>3. Try not to worry.</strong></h2> \n<p>Rare conditions are rare, and minor symptoms often resolve themselves in time. If you have more worrying symptoms, including bleeding from anywhere (unless you have haemorrhoids), or if your symptoms are changing or progressing, then visit your GP.</p> \n<h2><strong>4. Try going offline.</strong></h2> \n<p><strong> </strong>Pharmacists are medically trained and you don’t need an appointment to get their advice, points out Dr Hamed Khan. Friends and family might also be able to offer sensible help with minor illnesses such as coughs and colds.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. Be open to being wrong. </strong></h2> \n<p>When you see your GP be open to a discussion about the research you have done – your symptoms may have other causes, says Seymour, and other treatments may be more appropriate.</p> \n<h2><strong>6. Don’t hand over money.</strong></h2> \n<p><strong> </strong>Or at least, don’t buy tests or medicines from websites without checking with your GP beforehand. And definitely don’t treat yourself without checking with your doctor first. “I just had a patient today with diarrhoea who thought drinking Coca-Cola would help her,” says another GP. “If anything it made things&nbsp;worse.”</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434733258838/Am-I-dying---and-other-qu-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Am I dying?' … and other questions never to put into Google.
