A short, sharp reminder that she can still be torn down at any moment. So it was at Glastonbury last weekend, when an audience member at Kanye West’s set chose to wave an enormous flag printed with a still image from a sex tape showing Kardashian performing oral sex on her former partner Ray J. The tape was leaked in 2007 <a href=\"http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20012494,00.html.\">without Kardashian’s consent</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/25/kanye-west-glastonbury-festival-2015-worlds-biggest-pop-star\">The enigma of Kanye West – and how the world's biggest pop star ended up being its most reviled, too</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kardashian, who is four months pregnant, was present, so she got to witness the moment the photo was displayed to her husband and a huge crowd of his fans. Printed on the flag were the words “Get Down, Girl, Get Head Get Down”, a play on the lyrics from West’s song Gold Digger. Luckily, a compassionate Twitter user immortalised the moment by posting a picture with a suitably disapproving caption:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JacobWTurner01/statuses/615070025079255041\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Someone printed kim k giving ray j head on a flag and waved it about as Kanye performed at Glastonbury ahahahaha <a href=\"http://t.co/QXrp1gedwL\">pic.twitter.com/QXrp1gedwL</a></p>— Jacob (@JacobWTurner01) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JacobWTurner01/status/615070025079255041\">June 28, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p> Many online were quick to share their glee, describing the flag as “the BEST Glastonbury flag ever”, “flag of the day”, “#BESTEVER”, “genius” and “hilarious”. The Lad Bible declared that it <a href=\" https://twitter.com/TheLadBible/status/615143949368471552\">“wins the internet”</a>. Just in case she hadn’t noticed the flag itself during her husband’s set, thoughtful users<a href=\"https://twitter.com/82BAnArsenalFan/status/615176002659074049\"> tweeted it into Kardashian’s mentions</a> to be sure the picture be waiting for her when she got home. </p> \n<p>The precise intent behind the stunt isn’t clear, though the idea that a man should be threatened or shamed by his partner’s past sexual history is as old as it is misogynistic. The use of West’s lyrics suggests it might have been intended to suggest that Kardashian is herself a gold digger, despite her own enormously successful media and business ventures. Is it possible that the flag waver was trying to make a point about sexism in West’s lyrics? At a stretch, yes. Is it likely? No. And even if that were the case, the ends wouldn’t justify the means, any more than they did when the person who threatened to leak naked photos of Emma Watson later claimed it was all in the name of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-emma-watson-nude-photo-leak-was-a-very-elaborate-hoax-9752810.html\">a campaign against the internet site 4Chan</a>. Thank goodness for these towering heroes of morality. </p> \n<p>Regardless of intent, the outcome was yet another very successful woman being reminded that no matter how high she climbs, she can always be torn down by a slut-shaming, misogynistic double standard. There are powerful echoes here of the blame and outrage directed at the victims of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/10/fbi-seizes-computers-in-hunt-for-celebrity-photo-hackers\">last year’s nude celebrity photo hacks</a>. These are women who we pressure to be hyper-sexualised when they are objects for public consumption, in magazines or films or on television. We love to squeal over their “barely there” dress or “plunging cleavage” when they’re walking the red carpet, packaged for an approving audience. But when they dare to take ownership of their own bodies, to have sexual agency, or even, heaven forbid, to enjoy sex for themselves, we are ready to scream shame and demand grovelling public apologies. What Kardashian was doing in that sex tape was private and consensual. The only piece of wrongdoing was the publication of the tape without her consent; one amplified by the flag bearer in revictimising her before a live audience. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/18/kim-kardashian-selfish-book-selfies\">Kim Kardashian's Selfish book snapped up by thousands</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> Though Kardashian is not the only A-lister to have suffered this publicising of her sexual past as a weapon against her, there are noticeable differences in the way she is treated. While there was an outpouring of sympathy and support for many of the photo hacking victims, it was noted at the time that there was a nasty streak of venom reserved particularly for Kardashian. </p> \n<p>There was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/11113789/Kim-Kardashian-naked-photo-leak-Why-the-hacking-of-Kim-Kardashian-deserves-our-sympathy.html \">a classist undertone of sneering</a>, as some suggested that she was “asking for it” because she often chooses to share revealing photographs with her fans, or that as a reality star she doesn’t really deserve to be treated as a celebrity. It is regularly suggested that she leaked the tape intentionally to find fame, though she <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/06/hulk_hogan_sues_gawker_celebrity_sex_tapes_used_to_thrill_us_now_they_trouble.single.html\">has made it very clear this was not the case</a>. </p> \n<p>It was the same classist sexism that saw the Duchess of Cambridge, pregnant with Prince George, praised for her pregnancy style and svelte silhouette, while Kardashian, pregnant at the same time with baby North, faced nasty memes comparing her to a whale, and <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2013/03/28/pregnant-kim-kardashian-succumbs-to-cravings-and-gorges-on-burger-and-chips-3564195/\">front-page stories about her “gorging” on fast food</a>. While the Duchess topped Vanity Fair’s<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2013/04/top-ten-best-dressed-pregnant-celebrities#1\">“best-dressed pregnant celebrities” list</a>, Kardashian<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2305066/Kate-Middleton-v-Kim-Kadashian-baby-bump-Duchess-Cambridges-maternity-style-oceans-apart.html\"> was described as “brash” and “trashy”</a>. </p> \n<p>We will praise women for being sexy, as long as it’s the right kind of sexiness. As long as they’re the right “kind” of woman. As long as they’re not in control. As long as we can remind them of their place at any moment.</p> \n<p>This wasn’t “banter”. This wasn’t a hilarious stunt. This was the very public shaming of a pregnant woman in front of her husband and a crowd of strangers. And if that sounds positively medieval, then it should tell you something about our “modern” attitudes towards women.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673442393/1b22908c-b8ac-4fa7-b26c-1bf046efeaff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lionel Cironneau/AP","altText":"Kim Kardashian … social media reacted with glee at the stunt.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Lionel Cironneau/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T15:06:46Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T15:36:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1547,"contributors":[{"name":"Laura Bates","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/3/1428058264790/Laura-Bates-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/laura-bates"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Kim Kardashian","Women","Celebrity","The Duchess of Cambridge","Life and style","Feminism","Glastonbury 2015","Kanye West","Glastonbury festival"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian","webTitle":"Kim Kardashian"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/celebrity","webTitle":"Celebrity"},{"id":"uk/duchess-of-cambridge","webTitle":"The Duchess of Cambridge"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"world/feminism","webTitle":"Feminism"},{"id":"music/glastonbury-2015","webTitle":"Glastonbury 2015"},{"id":"music/kanyewest","webTitle":"Kanye West"},{"id":"music/glastonbury","webTitle":"Glastonbury festival"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Laura Bates","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/laura-bates"}}],"series":{"title":"Laura Bates on everyday sexism","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/laura-bates-on-everyday-sexism"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a96k","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673442393/1b22908c-b8ac-4fa7-b26c-1bf046efeaff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kim Kardashian … social media reacted with glee at the stunt.

Here’s my list of five simple things good cooks almost always do, and that you should be doing if you want to cook better.</p> \n<h2><strong>Understand seasoning</strong></h2> \n<p>The easiest way to improve your cooking is to understand seasoning. In western cooking seasoning is often thought of as adding salt (and sometimes pepper), and in Asian cooking it’s finding a pleasant balance of salty, sweet, sour, bitter and umami flavours in a dish. Whatever your definition, just remember – don’t season to make food taste salty (or sweet, or sour etc), season to bring out the natural taste of your ingredients. Aside from salt, the most common seasonings I use (particularly in Asian cuisine) are soy sauce, rice vinegar, mirin, fish sauce and citrus juices.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cdb76dd343a586d9576f866fd4a16a92987a7ac\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435716240629/83b016f4-bccb-486f-8d9b-38a1f1c63edb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Salt and pepper shouldn't be your only seasoning options.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Salt and pepper shouldn’t be your only seasoning options.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Image Source</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Find the umami</strong></h2> \n<p>If you were confused by the word “umami” in the previous paragraph, let me set you straight: umami is the secret to making food taste good. It’s a taste perceived by your taste buds, just like saltiness or sweetness, and it’s everywhere. In Italy it’s in tomatoes and parmesan, France loves its stocks and jus, Vietnam can’t get by without fish sauce, and in Japan take your pick from kombu, miso or any of a dozen other sources of umami. Umami-rich foods are central to just about every cuisine in the world, and just a touch of any of these kinds of ingredients can be a big boost to flavour.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>Do you know where the umami in your food is coming from?<strong> </strong>Whenever I cook I always make sure that the dish has at least one source of umami, whether that umami is contained within the ingredients (browned meats, Chinese cabbage, kombu, parmesan, anchovies) or added as seasonings (miso, oyster sauce, fish sauce etc).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06ef0af8898018c864264a0863225925b2ff2207\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/06ef0af8898018c864264a0863225925b2ff2207/0_173_2500_1501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vietnamese food relies heavily on fish sauce. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vietnamese food relies heavily on fish sauce. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hoang Dinh Nam/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Sharpen your knife</strong></h2> \n<p>If you ask me what the best kind of knife is to have in the kitchen, my answer will always be “a sharp one”. Watch a butcher at work and you’ll see them honing their blade every few seconds, but yet at home some of us haven’t even sharpened our knives once since they came out of the box. There’s no point buying fancy knives if you’re not going to maintain them. A whetstone is best, but if you don’t know how to use one just get one of those wheel sharpeners and give your knife a few runs through it every day or two. How you cut your ingredients creates texture in your food, and it’s very hard to make good cuts with a blunt knife.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f293769a84966ee4e107b9394af118f695d937d1\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f293769a84966ee4e107b9394af118f695d937d1/0_55_5150_3089/1000.jpg\" alt=\"You’ve wasted your money on a fancy knife if you don’t sharpen it.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You’ve wasted your money on a fancy knife if you don’t sharpen it.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregor Schuster/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Make things from scratch</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>At some point in the past 50 years it’s like we all decided to trade taste for convenience, then promptly forgot we ever did it. Hardly anyone takes the time to make anything properly these days – we buy pre-made sauces, frozen meals, and pre-cut vegetables, and year by year the quality of our food gets worse and worse, to the point where we can’t even remember what good food tastes like anymore. <br /></p> \n<p>Joint your own chickens, slice your own vegetables, make jam or biscuits from scratch – it’s cheaper, it’s easier than you think, and it makes an incredible difference to flavour. At the very least, just throw some scraps into a pot and make your own stock, which brings me to …</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1f97ded87d9c8f6f9f6bc0892cbddd134055ce0e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/1f97ded87d9c8f6f9f6bc0892cbddd134055ce0e/0_76_5890_3536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joint your own chicken and then with the carcass, make your own stock. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joint your own chicken and then with the carcass, make your own stock. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Start with stock</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>Every good cook makes stock. If you don’t make your own stock, you should start immediately. There’s no better way to extract the full flavour of the foods you’re using, save money, and reduce waste all at the same time. Stock isn’t just for soups and stews. Use it for sauces, wok-fried dishes, pasta sauce, anything at all really. It’s not called the foundation of food for nothing.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435721989042/47e72f10-c32c-4323-8bcd-2bbf9e1c0cf9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Supplied.","altText":"Adam Liaw","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Supplied."}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435716242004/83b016f4-bccb-486f-8d9b-38a1f1c63edb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Salt and pepper shouldn’t be your only seasoning options.

You see, Ramez in Control is a prank show, and its latest prank involved tricking Paris Hilton into believing that she was moments away from <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3141930/Pranked-Screaming-Paris-Hilton-thinks-s-going-die-Egyptian-TV-convinces-heiress-plane-going-revealing-s-joke.html\">dying in a fiery aeroplane crash</a>. She was in a plane, the engine stopped, it plummeted towards the ground and she started screaming and weeping hysterically, powerless against the certainty of her imminent demise.</p> \n<p>While the clip of the prank is systematically being wiped from the internet as quickly as possible – perhaps because even the internet has some standards – it’s still worth watching if you can find it. Because chances are you won’t think, “LOL, look at Paris Hilton pleading for her life like a massive loser”, but “Oh, so that’s how I’d react if I thought I was going to die in the next few seconds.”</p> \n<p>Unquestionably, the prank overstepped the mark by some distance, but it isn’t the first to do so. A few years ago on holiday, I watched a Maltese hidden-camera prank show where a succession of terrified passers-by were tricked into thinking that they’d just witnessed a drive-by shooting, exploding blood squib and all. Between all the desperate panic and horrified shrieking, I started to become quite nostalgic about <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/jan/31/yourfliesareundonebeadles\">Beadle’s About</a>.</p> \n<p>It’s relatively difficult to draw a comprehensive line between playing a simple prank and just being an arsehole. The man who <a href=\"http://abc7chicago.com/society/viral-prank-dad-throws-son-off-the-balcony-in-front-of-mom/420214/\">pretended to throw his young son off a balcony</a> in front of his wife? Arsehole. The electronics firm that fooled people into thinking the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3XRq0wJcYE\">floor was falling out of their lift</a>? Probably just pranksters. The Cambodian TV show that tricked a 13-year-old girl into believing that she was <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2015-05-12/tv-show-apologises-for-cruel-prank-on-girl-13-who-thought-she-was-about-to-meet-her-long-lost-mother/\">about to meet her long-lost mother</a>? Complete arseholes. That time someone pretended to kidnap David Beckham? Actually that one turned out to be Rio Ferdinand, for an <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/430743/beckham-out-wits-his-kidnappers\">ITV show called World Cup Wind-Ups</a>? </p> \n<p>And yet, despite this, the Paris Hilton prank still seems like the worst one of all. It might be that all plane crashes are legitimately horrific, or it might be the length of time that the prank is allowed to continue, but it’s completely unsettling and absolutely not funny. Hopefully Paris will soon be able to release another horrible single, and then the joke will be on her again.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435588049499/f91b48e2-23ea-47ab-8674-72e735c009f5-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"YouTube","altText":"Paris Hilton fails to see the funny side during Ramez in Control's plane crash prank.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: YouTube"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-29T17:20:51Z","lastModified":"2015-06-29T23:00:49Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":242,"contributors":[{"name":"Stuart Heritage","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733749780/StuartHeritage.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stuart-heritage"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Paris Hilton","Life and style","Egypt","Middle East and North Africa","Africa","World news","Television","Culture","Television & radio"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/paris-hilton","webTitle":"Paris Hilton"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Stuart Heritage","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stuart-heritage"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/jun/29/paris-hilton-plane-crash-tv-prank-egyptian-trick","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a883","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/jun/29/paris-hilton-plane-crash-tv-prank-egyptian-trick","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/jun/29/paris-hilton-plane-crash-tv-prank-egyptian-trick"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435588049499/f91b48e2-23ea-47ab-8674-72e735c009f5-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Paris Hilton fails to see the funny side during Ramez in Control’s plane crash prank.

It started badly, and ended in hot-tongued outrage</p>","byline":"Rebecca Nicholson","body":"<p>Urban Dictionary <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Hipster+Tabasco\">calls it “hipster tabasco”</a>. When it looked as if its Los Angeles <a href=\"http://time.com/57086/sriracha-public-nuisance-irwindale/\">factory might be closed</a> as a public nuisance, there were jokes with an air of panic about an international shortage. </p> \n<p>Sriracha hot sauce, which originated in eastern Thailand, is a mix of garlic, sugar, chillis, vinegar and salt. It may be derided as a modish condiment, but it is extremely tasty, and sparks the kind of devotion that prompts fans of the bright red bottle to buy T-shirts with it on the front and say things like: “Oh, I have it with everything.” Now, you <a href=\"http://www.dudeiwantthat.com/gear/food-drink/refillable-sriracha-keychain.asp\">can get a keyring-friendly mini-pack</a>, meaning that it can be on hand at all times.

At the weekend, it gets slathered on scrambled or poached eggs, like ketchup that punches you on the inside of your mouth. But that seems too easy, and I already know it’s lovely. So I stick with porridge. Unsweetened, watery porridge. Usually I’d blob some honey on top, but I’ve heard of savoury oats and I’ve eaten grits, which must be similar-ish, so I decide this will liven it up just fine. However, it looks like jam, which means I’m anticipating sweetness even though I know it will be spicy and savoury, which makes for a confusing mess of sensations. Plus, there’s a reason salty chilli porridge is not a thing – it’s disgusting.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f99a930774baa77b15184a09c4edf216f1b7f54\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435230486357/72a92e6f-6f61-457e-b3bc-cabec45a6875-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"Banana with Sriracha sauce turns out to be surprisingly moreish.\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Banana with Sriracha sauce turns out to be surprisingly moreish.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Nicholson/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Snack</h2> \n<p>I go for a mid-morning banana, and remember that I need to put garlicky chilli sauce on it. Scarred by the porridge slop, I think about trying again tomorrow. The keyring of heat did not let me down, though. Chilli goes with banana. It brings out the sticky sweetness, and it’s surprisingly moreish. But I’d forgotten just how punchy the garlic was. “I’m going to stink of garlic,” I say to a colleague. “Going to?” she replies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e13cbfc23f108964d8ab0ff6595bbfa14e3eafcd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435230607451/36ebdabb-ba2e-40af-bcbc-513d93bf9ee3-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"Sriracha makes a decent sandwich even better.\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sriracha makes a decent sandwich even better.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Nicholson/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Lunch</h2> \n<p>Pret A Manger’s<em><a href=\"https://www.pret.co.uk/en-gb/532-baguettes-jambon-beurre.aspx\"> jambon beurre</a></em>, its slightly fancy ham sandwich, is my comfort lunch of choice, and I feel as if I’ve earned something nice. Since I’ve already breached the garlic barricades, I put loads of Sriracha in between the butter, gherkins and ham, and it reminds me of what I love about it: it’s hot, salty – saltier with the butter and ham – and makes a decent sandwich taste even more decent. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We dab it on the pig’s eyes until it looks like a grinning demon, and chuck it down the hatch</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>My friends say this is too safe. One produces a bag of Percy Pig sweets. “I tried to think of something truly horrible,” she says. So we dab it on the pig’s eyes until it looks like a grinning demon, and chuck it down the hatch. It tastes like vomit. “That is genuinely the worst thing I’ve ever tasted. I feel sick,” says another friend, who may not be a friend for much longer. I wonder if it’s too late to start the 5:2 diet today.

I dot the sauce all over it with a heavy heart, angry at every dollop. My mouth is annoyed at me for making it eat chilli all day. I start reading an article on my phone: ‘The molecule that tells you when you’ve used too much Sriracha.” I am probably not dying.</p> \n<p>But I am sick of Sriracha. I do not eat it again for two weeks.

On 13 April, 2003, Paula Radcliffe gave us such a moment, when she won the London Marathon in two hours, 15 minutes and 25 seconds. Her time was not only a massive world record, beating her own previous world record of 2:17:18, which she set the previous October in Chicago, but it moved her three minutes and 22 seconds ahead of the next fastest female marathoner in the world, Catherine Ndereba. In the professional marathon, in the modern era, that distance is not a gap: it’s a canyon.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/27/sub-two-hour-marathon-ed-caesar\">Fast times: what will it take to run the marathon in under two hours?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> Radcliffe’s 2003 London Marathon still baffles and thrills aficionados of athletics. At the time, Dave Bedford, the London race director and former 10,000m world champion, called it “the greatest distance-running performance I have seen in my lifetime, it ranks in my mind with the impact of Bob Beamon’s long jump in 1968.” But if anything, Radcliffe’s achievement has swollen since then. In the ensuing 12 years, no other woman has finished a marathon within three minutes of her world record. Radcliffe also continues to hold the three fastest women’s marathon times ever recorded.</p> \n<p> For the past four years, I’ve been considering where the limits of the men’s marathon might lie. <a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/books/two-hours/9780670921898/\">My book, <em>Two Hours</em>,</a> is about the quest to reach one of the last great barriers in athletics: the sub-two-hour marathon. (The world record, held by Dennis Kimetto of Kenya, is 2.02.57.) But, throughout the writing of the book, it occurred to me that we might have already witnessed the equivalent of a sub-two marathon: Radcliffe’s 2003 world record.</p> \n<p>This is not an original thought. Last year, Mike Joyner, a polymath from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, argued this point with vigour. (Joyner wrote the original 1991 paper on the feasibility of the first sub-two-hour marathon, in which, somewhat famously in academic circles, he posited an “ultimate” time for the men’s marathon of 1:57:58.) Last year’s paper for the Journal of Applied Physiology, co-authored by Joyner, Sandra Hunter and Andrew Jones, contended that the “sex difference” between men and women – the relatability of performance between the genders because of differences in body shape, heart size, lung capacity and so on – could be calculated at around 12% or 13%. Not co-incidentally, that percentage difference was what you got if you looked at the 100 best marathon times for men and women, but excluded Radcliffe’s three fastest times. In other words, the fourth best women’s marathon time would be roughly equivalent to the men’s world record now (2.02.57). The authors argued that the best women’s time – Radcliffe’s – is equivalent to a men’s 1:59.</p> \n<p>How did a woman from Cheshire with a seemingly awkward gait destroy the world record in a sport dominated by East Africans?</p> \n<p>One contentious and frequently cited aspect of her world record performance in London is that she ran the marathon alongside two men. Pacemakers can be important to fast times. For manifold reasons, it’s tiring to front-run alone. Pacers not only shoulder some of the psychological burden of pacing the race, they can physically shield an elite runner from the wind. Men pacing women is an ethical tangle, because male pacers with good personal bests can generally be more flexible than male pacers in men’s races, who must run flat-out. In an effort to untangle the rules, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) later brought in a clause for the women’s world record that it must be run in an “all-women” race, and Radcliffe’s record was rescinded for a period, before being reinstated. </p> \n<p>In my mind, the pacers are a side issue. Almost all of the recent men’s world records have been paced. Haile Gebrselassie was occasionally shielded by a team of pacers, who surrounded him like a gaggle of migrating geese. Why shouldn’t Paula have received the same assistance? In fact, she says has always insisted that she raced the men who accompanied her, rather than using them in a traditional role as pacemakers.</p> \n<p>It’s more interesting to look at how Radcliffe prepared. Her pain threshold was legendary. Gerard Hartmann, Radcliffe’s long-time physiotherapist, who lived with her for weeks at a time during training, told <em>The Guardian</em> in 2013: “I’ve worked with 63 Olympic medallists and there was nobody, from Haile Gebrselassie to Kelly Holmes, who on the treatment table could ever take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. She would actually break me down because I’d have to go so deep into the sinews, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards I was in such pain.”</p> \n<p>Radcliffe, however, was no mere pain junkie. She was always working not just to be fitter, but to be better. One of the most instructive statistics about Radcliffe is that she improved her running economy by about 15% over the course of her career. Running economy is the measure of how much energy it takes to power an athlete down the road, and it’s one of the vital facets of one’s success or otherwise in elite distance running. Radcliffe may have looked ungainly, but she conditioned herself to be miserly with her fuel. In automotive terms, her miles-per-gallon ratio was exceptional.</p> \n<p>The most important part of her body, however, was her head. I had a fascinating conversation with Radcliffe two years ago in which I asked her what time she had aimed to run the first half of the London Marathon of 2003. She told me she didn’t know. Her broad aim in marathons was to run a “negative” split – that is, to get faster in the second half. But, beyond that, she never chained herself to a schedule of splits throughout the race.</p> \n<p>“I ran how I felt,” she said. “I had a mantra of ‘no limits’ throughout my career … So I never really ran to try and hit certain times at halfway, or whatever. The big thing was: Why would we set a limit? What if you felt better than that? What are you going to do? Slow down?”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/apr/19/paula-radcliffe-london-marathon-rousing-send-off-final-race\">Paula Radcliffe deserves rousing send-off in 2015 London Marathon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This idea of ‘no limits’ sounds like common sense. But it is the very opposite of what happens in most marathons. I have sat in the meeting rooms of mid-range business hotels in Europe and America on the day before major races, as the organiser has set out his schedule of how fast the pacemakers will run the first half of a race, the first 30km, the first 35km. Two dozen elite East African runners with astonishing personal bests have nodded along. And, almost invariably, the plan has gone awry on race day – in large part, I always think, because most Kenyans and Ethiopians want to run as Radcliffe ran: on feel, not splits. Indeed, in Boston in 2011, when Geoffrey Mutai and Moses Mosop recorded what were then the two fastest marathons ever (2:03:02 and 2:03:06), Mutai says he had no idea how fast he was running, or what his split times were. He was just trucking. </p> \n<p> Radcliffe’s legacy in the marathon is profound. 2:15:25 may not sound as sexy as 1:59:59, but it is just as earth-shattering a performance. In my view, it will be a decade before her record is broken. The performance has its own wisdom to impart, particularly in the men’s marathon, where the landmark two-hour marathon approaches. If the male elite have taken anything from Radcliffe, they will throw their stopwatches away and tattoo ‘no limits’ above their hearts. </p> \n<p><em>Two Hours: The Quest To Run The Impossible Marathon, by Ed Caesar, is published next month by Viking at &pound;16.99.
