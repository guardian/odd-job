Until now, everything that <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/paris-hilton\">Paris Hilton</a> touched has been hilarious. Her <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2006/aug/11/popandrock.shopping8\">singing career</a>? Hilarious. That perfume she created called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Paris-Hilton-Fairy-Dust-Parfum/dp/B0020MMD0G\">Fairy Dust</a>? Hilarious. Her speaking voice, sense of entitlement and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2007/jun/08/usa.danglaister\">time spent in prison</a>? All completely hilarious.</p> \n<p>But now Ramez in Control has managed to put Paris Hilton in her first ever unapologetically non-hilarious situation. You see, Ramez in Control is a prank show, and its latest prank involved tricking Paris Hilton into believing that she was moments away from <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3141930/Pranked-Screaming-Paris-Hilton-thinks-s-going-die-Egyptian-TV-convinces-heiress-plane-going-revealing-s-joke.html\">dying in a fiery aeroplane crash</a>. She was in a plane, the engine stopped, it plummeted towards the ground and she started screaming and weeping hysterically, powerless against the certainty of her imminent demise.</p> \n<p>While the clip of the prank is systematically being wiped from the internet as quickly as possible – perhaps because even the internet has some standards – it’s still worth watching if you can find it. Because chances are you won’t think, “LOL, look at Paris Hilton pleading for her life like a massive loser”, but “Oh, so that’s how I’d react if I thought I was going to die in the next few seconds.”</p> \n<p>Unquestionably, the prank overstepped the mark by some distance, but it isn’t the first to do so. A few years ago on holiday, I watched a Maltese hidden-camera prank show where a succession of terrified passers-by were tricked into thinking that they’d just witnessed a drive-by shooting, exploding blood squib and all. Between all the desperate panic and horrified shrieking, I started to become quite nostalgic about <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/jan/31/yourfliesareundonebeadles\">Beadle’s About</a>.</p> \n<p>It’s relatively difficult to draw a comprehensive line between playing a simple prank and just being an arsehole. The man who <a href=\"http://abc7chicago.com/society/viral-prank-dad-throws-son-off-the-balcony-in-front-of-mom/420214/\">pretended to throw his young son off a balcony</a> in front of his wife? Arsehole. The electronics firm that fooled people into thinking the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3XRq0wJcYE\">floor was falling out of their lift</a>? Probably just pranksters. The Cambodian TV show that tricked a 13-year-old girl into believing that she was <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2015-05-12/tv-show-apologises-for-cruel-prank-on-girl-13-who-thought-she-was-about-to-meet-her-long-lost-mother/\">about to meet her long-lost mother</a>? Complete arseholes. That time someone pretended to kidnap David Beckham? Actually that one turned out to be Rio Ferdinand, for an <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/story/430743/beckham-out-wits-his-kidnappers\">ITV show called World Cup Wind-Ups</a>? </p> \n<p>And yet, despite this, the Paris Hilton prank still seems like the worst one of all. It might be that all plane crashes are legitimately horrific, or it might be the length of time that the prank is allowed to continue, but it’s completely unsettling and absolutely not funny. Hopefully Paris will soon be able to release another horrible single, and then the joke will be on her again.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435588049499/f91b48e2-23ea-47ab-8674-72e735c009f5-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"YouTube","altText":"Paris Hilton fails to see the funny side during Ramez in Control's plane crash prank.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: YouTube"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-29T17:20:51Z","lastModified":"2015-06-29T23:00:49Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":189,"contributors":[{"name":"Stuart Heritage","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733749780/StuartHeritage.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stuart-heritage"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Paris Hilton","Life and style","Egypt","Middle East and North Africa","Africa","World news","Television","Culture","Television & radio"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/paris-hilton","webTitle":"Paris Hilton"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Stuart Heritage","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stuart-heritage"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/jun/29/paris-hilton-plane-crash-tv-prank-egyptian-trick","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a883","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/jun/29/paris-hilton-plane-crash-tv-prank-egyptian-trick","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/jun/29/paris-hilton-plane-crash-tv-prank-egyptian-trick"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435588049499/f91b48e2-23ea-47ab-8674-72e735c009f5-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Paris Hilton fails to see the funny side during Ramez in Control’s plane crash prank.

If the weather allows, we cook it on an open fire – you are rewarded with an amazing smoky aroma. This paella recipe is the fruit both of my own investigations and those of top Valencian chefs and grandmothers. Follow this recipe and I guarantee you will soon be tasting the best paella. Buen provecho!</p> \n<p>Serves 6<br /><strong>globe artichokes</strong> 2-3 (depending on the size), cleaned and trimmed<br /><strong>saffron</strong> 1g<br /><strong>salt</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>Spanish olive oil</strong> 8 tbsp<br /><strong>chicken pieces (on the bone) </strong>400g<br /><strong>rabbit pieces (on the bone)</strong> 400g<br /><strong>runner beans</strong> 200g, trimmed and cut into 2&frac12;cm pieces<br /><strong>broad beans or fresh white butter beans </strong>100g<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 4, finely chopped<br /><strong>tomatoes</strong> 1 large or 2 small, grated<br /><strong>sweet piment&oacute;n</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>water or light chicken stock</strong> 2 litres<br /><strong>Spanish rice</strong> 500g, such as calasparra or bomba<br /><strong>rosemary</strong> 1 sprig</p> \n<p>First prepare the artichokes. Trim the stalks and peel away the outer leaves so you are just left with the artichoke hearts. Scrape away any furry choke with a teaspoon, then run a lemon half over the hearts so they don’t discolour.</p> \n<p>Wrap the saffron in foil and toast it for 30 seconds on each side in a paella pan over a medium heat. Remove from the pan and set aside.</p> \n<p>Increase the heat to the maximum and season around the edges of the pan with the table salt. Wait until the pan is really hot and then drizzle with the olive oil. It should start smoking immediately; at this point throw in the pieces of chicken and rabbit (the meat needs to absorb the salt at this early stage). Fry the meat until nicely browned on all sides (this will add to the flavour of the paella).</p> \n<p>Add the runner beans and broad beans and stir together for 1 minute before adding the garlic. Cook for 1 minute and then add the grated tomatoes (discarding the skin), piment&oacute;n and toasted saffron. Cook for 4 minutes, stirring all the time, until you can see that the tomatoes have lost most of the juice and changed colour.</p> \n<p>Add the water or chicken stock and leave to simmer for about 20 minutes, allowing the bits of caramelised chicken and vegetable on the bottom of the pan to dissolve so you get a rich stock. If you use chicken stock instead of water you will only need to simmer for 5 minutes. Check the seasoning but bear in mind that the rice will absorb a lot of saltiness, so it’s okay if it tastes quite salty at this stage.</p> \n<p>Cut the artichokes into quarters and add to the pan – if you add them any earlier the entire paella will turn dark in colour. Add the rice, spreading it evenly over the paella pan and stir just once. Cook on the highest heat for about 10-12 minutes before reducing the heat right down and cooking for a further 5-7 minutes. Once you have added the rice and given it a good stir you shouldn’t touch the pan with a spoon again. You need to keep the film that develops on the top of the stock from breaking, otherwise the steam will escape and the rice won’t cook evenly.</p> \n<p>When the water is at a lower level than the rice itself, add the rosemary sprig. If the layer of rice on the top starts to look a bit crispy, cover the paella pan with a layer of newspaper for the last 5 minutes of cooking. This will help to steam the grains on top while the bottom gets crispy. In Spain this crispy bottom layer, the ‘socarrat’, is the most valuable part of the paella. Once the paella is finished it should look like a completely flat layer of rice. Leave to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</p> \n<p><em>From Tapas Revolution by Omar Allibhoy (Ebury, RRP &pound;20). </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/tapas-revolution.html\"><em>Click here to buy a copy from Guardian Bookshop for &pound;16</em></a><em>; </em><a href=\"http://www.tapasrevolution.com\"><em>tapasrevolution.com</em></a></p> \n<h2>Colman Andrews’s prawns with garlic and paprika</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ef74bbb0398420a0def21a2cbbe6b8bc9be0cff\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435158614551/768b73b4-337b-47e0-8879-b6cbc2633335-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Prawns with garlic and paprika\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This particular dish, served at one of the better traditional restaurants in Valencia, El Plat, is made with llagostins, a variety of prawn known scientifically as Penaeus caramote – a particularly large and meaty species.

You can prepare the croquettes ready for frying the day before and keep them in the refrigerator.</p> \n<p>Makes about 30 croquettes<br /><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 75g<br /><strong>onion</strong> &frac12; large, peeled and finely chopped<br /><strong>jam&oacute;n serrano or other raw dry-cured ham </strong>200g, finely chopped (this can be done in the food processor)<br /><strong>nutmeg</strong> freshly grated, a pinch<br /><strong>whole milk</strong> 725ml<br /><strong>plain flour</strong> 150g<br /><strong>salt</strong> if necessary<br /><strong>fine matzo meal or breadcrumbs</strong> about 100g<br /><strong>medium matzo meal or breadcrumbs</strong> about 125g<br /><strong>eggs</strong> 2 large<br /><strong>sunflower or olive oil </strong>for deep-frying, enough to cover the croquettes</p> \n<p>In a large pan, melt the butter and gently saute the onion over a low heat until it is soft. Add the ham and cook, stirring for a minute or so. Then stir in the nutmeg and about half the milk and bring to the boil.</p> \n<p>Beat the flour with the remaining milk using an electric mixer until any lumps have disappeared. Then pour into the pan, stirring vigorously, and cook, continuing to stir constantly, for 8-10 minutes until the mixture has the consistency of a thick paste that comes away from the bottom of the pan. Add salt if necessary – it might not need it because the ham is salty. Chill for at least 2 hours or overnight.</p> \n<p>To make the croquettes, cover a large plate with plenty of very fine matzo meal or breadcrumbs and a second plate with medium matzo meal or breadcrumbs. Beat the eggs lightly in a soup plate. Two large spoons greased with oil are normally used to shape the croquetas into an oblong. But you may find it easier, as I do, to take lumps of the thick bechamel paste the size of walnuts and roll them into balls between the palms of your hands. You can rub your hands in oil if you do not want the paste to stick. As you make them, drop the balls into the fine matzo meal or breadcrumbs. Roll a batch of the balls in the fine meal until well covered all over, then roll them in the beaten egg, and then in the medium matzo meal. This will give them a nice thick crust.</p> \n<p>To deep-fry the balls in batches in a frying pan, heat the oil until it is only medium hot (until a piece of bread dropped in sizzles immediately but does not turn dark quickly). Carefully lower the croquettes into the oil and fry over a medium-low heat for 5-6 minutes until lightly browned, turning them over once. If the oil is too hot they will burst.</p> \n<p>Lift them out with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. They are best eaten right away.</p> \n<p><em>From The Food of Spain by Claudia Roden (Michael Joseph, RRP &pound;30). </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/food-of-spain.html\"><em>Click here to buy a copy from Guardian Bookshop for &pound;25 </em></a></p> \n<h2>David Eyre’s bacalao a la malague&ntilde;a</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55a02849f540040b393664f23f914411f37a1430\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435158710765/95b77f91-2617-4dc7-a993-8c696587fec7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bacalao a la Malaguena\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Serves 4 as a starter<br /><strong>salt cod</strong> 400g, dry weight, the thicker the better, soaked in two or three changes of water, in the fridge, for about 48 hours<br /><strong>new potatoes</strong> 300g<br /><strong>your best olive oil</strong> 150ml<br /><strong>oranges</strong> 4, peeled and sliced as thinly as possible, reserving any juice<br /><strong>ground black peppercorns<br /></strong><strong>strong black olives</strong> 20<br /><strong>red pepper</strong> 1, roasted, peeled and torn into strips<br /><strong>red onion</strong> 1 small, very thinly sliced into rounds and then soaked in cold water for 10 minutes<br /><strong>picked parsley and/or mint leaves</strong></p> \n<p>Either poach the cod in water until barely cooked and then flake it, dicarding the skin and bones, or tear the uncooked cod into strips.

You can identify the fish by the stripes on the first dorsal fin and, when fresh, three or four yellow streaks along its sides. Its profile is slightly more elongated and less snub-nosed than its cousin.</p> \n<p>Buy the biggest specimens you can find – no tiddlers please. Each fish should weigh around 400g prior to filleting. Get your fishmonger to fillet them for you – each fish will give you two fillets of around 100g each.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>potatoes</strong> 3 medium, peeled<br /><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> 5 tbsp<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 2, chopped<br /><strong>thyme</strong> 1 sprig, leaves stripped<br /><strong>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br /></strong><strong>Arag&oacute;n or Kalamata black olives</strong> 30, pitted<br /><strong>chive stalks</strong> 10, chopped<br /><strong>red mullet</strong> 4 x 400g, filleted<br /><strong>olive oil</strong> for frying</p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Slice the potatoes as thinly as possible (use a mandolin if you have one), then mix with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the chopped garlic and thyme leaves. Season, then spread the mixture over a greased baking tray. Bake for about 15 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, blitz the olives and half the chive stalks with the remaining olive oil in a food processor to make a thick puree.</p> \n<p>Season the fillets. Heat some oil in a frying pan until it is medium hot – the oil should be shimmering but not smoking – and fry the mullet for 2 minutes skin-side down, then turn over and fry for another minute. You want a crispy skin.</p> \n<p>Divide the potatoes between four plates, pop two fillets on top of each mound and, using a teaspoon, drizzle the plate with the olive puree.

At its best, hummus is creamy, unctuous and almost meaty in its fullness of flavour. And that’s no accident: the dish of chickpeas and tahini is packed full of protein. </p> \n<p>All over the Middle East and North Africa people eat <em>hummus bi tahina</em>. They might eat it at breakfast, lunch or dinner. In some regions, it’s a meal in itself. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fa1aa758e0c7ee2655e82146bd98d50b749b0a5\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/1fa1aa758e0c7ee2655e82146bd98d50b749b0a5/0_0_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hummus should be eaten with your hands. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hummus should be eaten with your hands. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What they won’t do is treat it as a dip left on a table beside some cabanossi for guests to pick at absentmindedly while they wait for the real food to arrive. Australians may be surprised to hear that hummus is not a dip. They may even consider that statement controversial. But if Middle Eastern food really is the new Mexican – and given the number of Lebanese pop-up restaurants in Sydney and Melbourne right now that’s a foregone conclusion – it’s time we learned to respect the absolute staple dish of the cuisine.</p> \n<p>In Beirut it may be served as part of a meze with felafel, kibbeh and tabbouleh. A hungry human in Jerusalem may sit down to a bowl of <em>masabacha</em> – hummus served with whole warm chickpeas, olive oil and a sprinkle of paprika – and eat it with wedges of raw onion and fresh, warm pita. Or maybe they’ll have <em>hummus ful, </em>hummus served with a paste of ground fava beans. Sometimes it will be served with a drizzle of sauce, perhaps of parsley, olive oil, lemon and garlic, and maybe some hot peppers if you’re that way inclined. </p> \n<p>Mo Moubayed, one of the owners of <a href=\"http://thethievery.com.au/\">Thievery</a>, a new modern Middle Eastern restaurant in Sydney’s Glebe, said hummus was a constant throughout his childhood. </p> \n<p>“Growing up as a Lebanese kid, hummus was always there on the table,” he said. </p> \n<p>“Although these days we have hummus as a starter, it was actually there as part of a main meal. It goes really well with lamb or beef, and it’s a must to have around a barbecue if you’re cooking those meats.</p> \n<p>“It is something you’d always expect in the fridge of a Lebanese person. As a kid, if I was hungry I’d just pull it out and enjoy with a carrot stick and it’d be absolutely beautiful.”</p> \n<p>Hummus is the Arabic word for chickpea, so the correct Arab term for what we know as hummus is <em>hummus bi tahina</em>. The <em>tahina</em> refers to the second ingredient in hummus – tahini, which is a paste of ground sesame seeds. The ingredients of hummus are simple and invariable: chickpeas, tahini, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, salt. Nothing more, nothing less. And always, the best quality ingredients must be used.</p> \n<p>And it must be eaten properly.</p> \n<p>“You should eat hummus with your hands,” says Moubayed. “I don’t mean with your fingers, but eat it with your hands and Lebanese bread and lots of really good olive oil.”</p> \n<p>There’s an etiquette to this: hold the bread at the tips of your five fingers, dip in the bowl and move in a clockwise direction with a quick flick of the wrist. </p> \n<p>The secret to good hummus is not so secret, which makes it all the more surprising such inferior products are flogged so widely in Australia. Both Moubayed and Ibrahim Naji, chef and owner of a restaurant bearing his name in the Arab-Israeli village of Abu Ghosh, answered with identical tips when asked the secret to good hummus: the chickpeas must be boiled overnight and allowed to cool before mixing with the other ingredients. Use substandard quality olive oil at your peril and avoid anything resembling a food processor. </p> \n<p>Chickpeas should not be bought in a can. The texture and taste is inferior to those bought dried in bags. </p> \n<p>After boiling, the chickpeas should be mushed and mixed by hand with a pestle and mortar or other such device. There’s a reason for that: you have to watch it as you make it, feel the texture, taste for lemon, seasoning and garlic. Have you added the right quantity of tahini to bring out the nutty flavour that gives hummus its fullness of flavour? These things can’t be measured in spoons and cups, but only with human eyes, hands and taste buds.</p> \n<p>“Don’t measure the ingredients,” Naji told Guardian Australia through an interpreter. “You have to be able to feel it.” </p> \n<p>He should know. His hummus has been <a href=\"http://www.jewishjournal.com/foodaism/item/israels_best_hummus_naji_in_abu_ghosh_20110407\">voted by the Jewish Journal’s food blog as the best in Israel </a>and his village once held the Guinness world record for the biggest bowl of hummus. As a Palestinian citizen of Israel, he takes his food history seriously, as do most residents of Abu Ghosh. That’s why they <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-takes-hummus-world-record-1.261081\">were so affronted</a> when in 2009 Lebanon unilaterally declared hummus Lebanese and made a bowl of it weighing 2,056kg to prove it. The village of Abu Ghosh wasn’t having it. Its response? A bowl of hummus weighing 4,090kg. The Lebanese fought back, making 10,452kg worth of hummus. </p> \n<p>Hummus is serious business. And any effort made in taking it seriously will be richly rewarded. <br /></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/cf46b449d25a09ca3eb3384a8ba38efa99824e63/0_374_3964_2378/3964.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2378,"width":3964,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sophia Evans for the Observer","altText":"Hummus is not a dip – it’s a meal.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/1fa1aa758e0c7ee2655e82146bd98d50b749b0a5/0_0_5616_3370/5616.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3370,"width":5616,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Hummus should be eaten with your hands.

On 13 April, 2003, Paula Radcliffe gave us such a moment, when she won the London Marathon in two hours, 15 minutes and 25 seconds. Her time was not only a massive world record, beating her own previous world record of 2:17:18, which she set the previous October in Chicago, but it moved her three minutes and 22 seconds ahead of the next fastest female marathoner in the world, Catherine Ndereba. In the professional marathon, in the modern era, that distance is not a gap: it’s a canyon.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/27/sub-two-hour-marathon-ed-caesar\">Fast times: what will it take to run the marathon in under two hours?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> Radcliffe’s 2003 London Marathon still baffles and thrills aficionados of athletics. At the time, Dave Bedford, the London race director and former 10,000m world champion, called it “the greatest distance-running performance I have seen in my lifetime, it ranks in my mind with the impact of Bob Beamon’s long jump in 1968.” But if anything, Radcliffe’s achievement has swollen since then. In the ensuing 12 years, no other woman has finished a marathon within three minutes of her world record. Radcliffe also continues to hold the three fastest women’s marathon times ever recorded.</p> \n<p> For the past four years, I’ve been considering where the limits of the men’s marathon might lie. <a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/books/two-hours/9780670921898/\">My book, <em>Two Hours</em>,</a> is about the quest to reach one of the last great barriers in athletics: the sub-two-hour marathon. (The world record, held by Dennis Kimetto of Kenya, is 2.02.57.) But, throughout the writing of the book, it occurred to me that we might have already witnessed the equivalent of a sub-two marathon: Radcliffe’s 2003 world record.</p> \n<p>This is not an original thought. Last year, Mike Joyner, a polymath from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, argued this point with vigour. (Joyner wrote the original 1991 paper on the feasibility of the first sub-two-hour marathon, in which, somewhat famously in academic circles, he posited an “ultimate” time for the men’s marathon of 1:57:58.) Last year’s paper for the Journal of Applied Physiology, co-authored by Joyner, Sandra Hunter and Andrew Jones, contended that the “sex difference” between men and women – the relatability of performance between the genders because of differences in body shape, heart size, lung capacity and so on – could be calculated at around 12% or 13%. Not co-incidentally, that percentage difference was what you got if you looked at the 100 best marathon times for men and women, but excluded Radcliffe’s three fastest times. In other words, the fourth best women’s marathon time would be roughly equivalent to the men’s world record now (2.02.57). The authors argued that the best women’s time – Radcliffe’s – is equivalent to a men’s 1:59.</p> \n<p>How did a woman from Cheshire with a seemingly awkward gait destroy the world record in a sport dominated by East Africans?</p> \n<p>One contentious and frequently cited aspect of her world record performance in London is that she ran the marathon alongside two men. Pacemakers can be important to fast times. For manifold reasons, it’s tiring to front-run alone. Pacers not only shoulder some of the psychological burden of pacing the race, they can physically shield an elite runner from the wind. Men pacing women is an ethical tangle, because male pacers with good personal bests can generally be more flexible than male pacers in men’s races, who must run flat-out. In an effort to untangle the rules, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) later brought in a clause for the women’s world record that it must be run in an “all-women” race, and Radcliffe’s record was rescinded for a period, before being reinstated. </p> \n<p>In my mind, the pacers are a side issue. Almost all of the recent men’s world records have been paced. Haile Gebrselassie was occasionally shielded by a team of pacers, who surrounded him like a gaggle of migrating geese. Why shouldn’t Paula have received the same assistance? In fact, she says has always insisted that she raced the men who accompanied her, rather than using them in a traditional role as pacemakers.</p> \n<p>It’s more interesting to look at how Radcliffe prepared. Her pain threshold was legendary. Gerard Hartmann, Radcliffe’s long-time physiotherapist, who lived with her for weeks at a time during training, told <em>The Guardian</em> in 2013: “I’ve worked with 63 Olympic medallists and there was nobody, from Haile Gebrselassie to Kelly Holmes, who on the treatment table could ever take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. She would actually break me down because I’d have to go so deep into the sinews, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards I was in such pain.”</p> \n<p>Radcliffe, however, was no mere pain junkie. She was always working not just to be fitter, but to be better. One of the most instructive statistics about Radcliffe is that she improved her running economy by about 15% over the course of her career. Running economy is the measure of how much energy it takes to power an athlete down the road, and it’s one of the vital facets of one’s success or otherwise in elite distance running. Radcliffe may have looked ungainly, but she conditioned herself to be miserly with her fuel. In automotive terms, her miles-per-gallon ratio was exceptional.</p> \n<p>The most important part of her body, however, was her head. I had a fascinating conversation with Radcliffe two years ago in which I asked her what time she had aimed to run the first half of the London Marathon of 2003. She told me she didn’t know. Her broad aim in marathons was to run a “negative” split – that is, to get faster in the second half. But, beyond that, she never chained herself to a schedule of splits throughout the race.</p> \n<p>“I ran how I felt,” she said. “I had a mantra of ‘no limits’ throughout my career … So I never really ran to try and hit certain times at halfway, or whatever. The big thing was: Why would we set a limit? What if you felt better than that? What are you going to do? Slow down?”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/apr/19/paula-radcliffe-london-marathon-rousing-send-off-final-race\">Paula Radcliffe deserves rousing send-off in 2015 London Marathon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This idea of ‘no limits’ sounds like common sense. But it is the very opposite of what happens in most marathons. I have sat in the meeting rooms of mid-range business hotels in Europe and America on the day before major races, as the organiser has set out his schedule of how fast the pacemakers will run the first half of a race, the first 30km, the first 35km. Two dozen elite East African runners with astonishing personal bests have nodded along. And, almost invariably, the plan has gone awry on race day – in large part, I always think, because most Kenyans and Ethiopians want to run as Radcliffe ran: on feel, not splits. Indeed, in Boston in 2011, when Geoffrey Mutai and Moses Mosop recorded what were then the two fastest marathons ever (2:03:02 and 2:03:06), Mutai says he had no idea how fast he was running, or what his split times were. He was just trucking. </p> \n<p> Radcliffe’s legacy in the marathon is profound. 2:15:25 may not sound as sexy as 1:59:59, but it is just as earth-shattering a performance. In my view, it will be a decade before her record is broken. The performance has its own wisdom to impart, particularly in the men’s marathon, where the landmark two-hour marathon approaches. If the male elite have taken anything from Radcliffe, they will throw their stopwatches away and tattoo ‘no limits’ above their hearts. </p> \n<p><em>Two Hours: The Quest To Run The Impossible Marathon, by Ed Caesar, is published next month by Viking at &pound;16.99.

This year, for the first time, the USDA’s advisory panel recommended that those guidelines should also include sustainability. The government agency is being asked to factor in whether or not a food is good for the planet when deciding whether its healthy. </p> \n<p>The move caused a major uproar throughout the food industry, with thousands of commenters arguing that environmental concerns were beyond the scope of the guidelines and that addressing them was an <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/vital-signs/2015/feb/04/usda-meat-plant-diet-environment-policy-report\">overreach of the USDA’s authority</a>.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The public comment period closed last month and the USDA will be releasing final dietary guidelines by the end of the year. The finished product may or may not include references to sustainability. Regardless, it’s clear that nutritionists are increasingly drawing connections between health and the environment.</p> \n<p>“It’s all connected – you can’t tackle hunger and obesity and the paradox of the obesity crisis among hungry children without tying it to food waste, the farm bill and how the food system has been set up in this country,” says Kate Geagan, a registered dietician and author of the book <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://kategeagan.com/kates-book/\">Go Green, Get Lean</a>.</p> \n<h2>Consumers push for better options<br /></h2> \n<p>According to Geagan, consumers are driving the push for dietary sustainability – and encouraging dietitians to get onboard. “Consumers aren’t just looking for what’s on the nutrition fact panel anymore – they have a whole list of other things they want to know about and how they define eating right,” she says.</p> \n<p>Supermarkets are also looking at the intersections of health and environmental concerns, Geagan adds. “Supermarket dietitians are very interested in this as a way to engage consumers and create value,” she says, pointing to <a href=\"http://www.simpletruth.com/about-simple-truth/101-free/\">Kroger’s Free From 101+</a> as a prime example. The supermarket chain conducted consumer testing and surveyed shoppers to pinpoint 101 ingredients they don’t want in their food, and are now in the process of weeding them out of stores nationally.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/christopher-gardner\">Christopher Gardner</a>, a professor at Stanford University’s School of Medicine, says he sees the various aspects of sustainability – creating local economies, fair labor practices, animal rights, and environmental impacts – as useful drivers of behavior modification. “I spent decades doing all this research to show people what they should be eating and I had very little success getting anyone to change their diet,” he said during a presentation at the Sustainable Foods Institute in Monterey, CA, last month. “But when I started adding in discussions about animal rights or labor practices or climate change, I saw really meaningful shifts in people’s willingness to change.”</p> \n<p>The reason, he says, is that most people relate to at least one of those drivers, and that adding multiple reasons to shift a behavior tends to be more effective than focusing on any one.</p> \n<h2><strong>Healthier for you, healthier for all</strong></h2> \n<p>Appealing to the various drivers of people’s diet choices could help address not only the nation’s obesity problem, but also the environmental impacts of food production, even the stability of the food supply chain. For example, decreased consumption of meat could have a major impact on water usage. According to Arlin Wasserman, founder of food consultancy <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://changingtastes.net/\">Changing Tastes</a>, Americans currently get about 15% of their protein from plant-based sources. Shifting that to 25% could result in enough water savings to provide two-thirds of California’s water supply. </p> \n<p>There may even be a business benefit to shifting the composition of our dinner plates. Wasserman points out that, while McDonald’s is somewhat locked into the quarter pound beef patty, some newer entrants to the industry – like Five Guys – are offering smaller meat servings. In the process, they’re delivering health benefits to customers, environmental benefits to the planet, and financial benefits to the company, all without sacrificing quality or customer satisfaction.</p> \n<p>“It’s hard for people to get jazzed up about changing eating habits for a result they’ll see 10 years from now,” Geagan says. “But framing it as a more immediate payoff or benefit – in terms of weight loss, health, energy, really focusing on the health benefit overlap of these issues, that’s where I think health professionals can really add value to the conversation.”</p> \n<p>Interested in a diet that’s as good for the planet as it is for you? Geagan suggests following these simple guidelines.</p> \n<h2><strong>Eat more of this</strong></h2> \n<p> <strong>Beans, beans the magical fruit:</strong> Packed with protein, fiber and folic acid, beans are available everywhere, are low-fat and filling, and have a relatively <a href=\"http://static.ewg.org/reports/2011/meateaters/pdf/methodology_ewg_meat_eaters_guide_to_health_and_climate_2011.pdf\">small carbon footprint</a>. </p> \n<p> <strong>Sardines:</strong> These little fish are both sustainable and full of Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D. Not everyone is a sardine fan, but you can sneak them in via tomato sauces and salad dressings. </p> \n<p> <strong>Organic fruits and vegetables</strong>: Many conventionally-grown fruits and vegetables are covered in pesticide residue. Conventional strawberries, for example, are still grown with <a href=\"http://cen.acs.org/articles/93/i23/Strawberries-Peril-Fumigant-Phaseout.html\">1,3-Dichloropropene</a>, which the state of California believes <a href=\"http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/risk/rcd/dichloro.pdf\">causes cancer</a>. US shoppers looking to avoid chemicals can start with the Environmental Working Group’s “<a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary.php\">dirty dozen</a>” list to get the most bang for their buck.</p> \n<p> <strong>Protein-packed vegetables, legumes, nuts and seeds:</strong> Most Americans only get about 15% of their <a href=\"http://changingtastes.net/\">protein from plants</a>.<strong> </strong>Bumping that up to 25% could boost both individual health and the health of the planet. Plant protein options that are easy to incorporate into your diet include: lentils, chia seeds (throw them into smoothies, muffins, salad dressings), quinoa, peanuts, and tofu (opt for organic tofu, like Hodo, to ensure that it’s made from sustainably sourced soy).</p> \n<p> <strong>Pasture-raised eggs</strong><strong>: </strong><a href=\"http://news.psu.edu/story/166143/2010/07/20/research-shows-eggs-pastured-chickens-may-be-more-nutritious\">Recent research</a><strong> </strong>has found that pasture-raised eggs contain more vitamin A and more Omega-3 fatty acids than eggs produced any other way. They also tend to pack more flavor, and enough protein to keep you satiated through the morning. Eggs are also one of the most climate-friendly sources of animal protein.</p> \n<p> <strong>Small amounts of high-quality grass-fed beef and dairy: </strong><a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/expert-answers/grass-fed-beef/faq-20058059\">Research has shown</a> that grass-fed beef has measurably more antioxidants and fewer inflammatory fatty acids than grain-fed beef. As for milk from grass-fed cows, it’s higher in alpha-linolenic acid, an Omega-3 fat that reduces inflammation and has been tied to a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and Type 2 diabetes. In both cases, grass feeding dramatically reduces a cow’s environmental impact.</p> \n<h2><strong>Eat less of this</strong></h2> \n<p> <strong>Packaged, highly processed foods: </strong>In addition to added sugars and salts, foods packaged in plastic may be adding a serving of <a href=\"http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1003170/\">harmful chemicals</a> to your midday snack. Disposable plastic packaging also never degrades and has a fairly poor recycling rate, making it bad for the planet.</p> \n<p> <strong>Bottled water: </strong>More water is great for you, but Geagan calls bottled water the “hummer of healthy food”. Citing its sourcing from drought-stricken California and its use of single-use disposable plastic packaging, she argues that bottled water delivers far more negative environmental impacts than health benefits.</p> \n<p><strong>Fresh-flown fish: </strong>While fresh, locally caught fish can be a great choice, fresh-flown fish is often the <a href=\"http://seafood.edf.org/\">least sustainable choice</a>, particularly when it comes to tuna and salmon.</p> \n<p> <strong>Conventionally raised poultry, pork, beef, or dairy products: </strong>Concentrated animal feeding operations have <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/region7/water/cafo/cafo_impact_environment.htm\">significantly higher</a> carbon and water footprints than their pasture-based counterparts.
