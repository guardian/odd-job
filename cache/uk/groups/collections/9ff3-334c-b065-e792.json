From the present you buy because it is the last thing on the list to the outfit you’ll never wear again, we reveal the hidden costs when friends tie the knot","byline":"Homa Khaleeli","body":"<p>It’s the chance to watch two people celebrate their love, make a lifelong commitment and be cheered on by their closest family and friends - if you can stomach the &pound;377 bill. According to a survey of 2000 people by the Nationwide building society, the average wedding guest will shell out hundreds of pounds for each invitation they accept this year. The survey has factored in pre- and post-celebration additions including hen nights, stag dos, new outfits, travel and hotels, with men spending &pound;51 more per happy couple. But how has the price of hearing a couple say “I do” crept up so high? I blame the hidden costs.</p> \n<h2><strong>All the towels are gone</strong></h2> \n<p>You’ve clicked on the gift list too late, all the sensibly priced presents have been bought and you are stuck with two options: pay an extra &pound;20 for the only thing left that looks like an actual gift, or swallow your pride and stick to your budget. This will probably be two silver forks that you could have nicked from the posher wedding you went to last weekend.</p> \n<h2><strong>Unwanted, one-wear-only clothes</strong></h2> \n<p>When it comes to weddings, your normal clothes suddenly look insufficiently dressy and you start panic buying silky dresses, metallic high heeled sandals or – shudder – nude tights. If you come to your senses and refuse to buy a tiny cardigan you will never wear again, you will freeze through the church service. Whatever you buy, you will have to pay extra for a taxi home because you can’t walk in those stupid heels. Men might think a suit will save them, but post-wedding breakfasts have their own strange dress code: brightly-coloured chinos and blazers don’t come cheap.</p> \n<h2><strong>Extra food</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes I know you aren’t paying for the wedding breakfast – but it’s not until 3pm. How can you not sneak off to buy something to plug the gap? And that’s without forking out for any pre-wedding dinners.</p> \n<h2><strong>Blowing away the competition</strong></h2> \n<p>Maybe the bride is an ex. Maybe you had a crush on the groom, maybe you are single, haven’t been given a plus one, and will be looked at with pity by family members all night. Consider it a tax on your ego because sometimes you just need to look amazing; this will definitely tip you over budget.</p> \n<h2><strong>Keeping up with the other guests</strong></h2> \n<p>If your friends’ friends are richer than you, you’re in trouble. One colleague says the first thing he was asked at the stag do was to pay his share for the stripper – his weekend’s budget gone in two seconds. “I remember having to walk for hours back to the campsite I was staying at. I stopped going to stag dos after that.”</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435075484775/What-price-being-there-fo-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"What price being there for their special moment?

All this means is that I am extremely hairy and hate all men, both as individuals and collectively, with no exceptions. Nope. Not even Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen/Paul Hollywood/Ronnie Corbett/Trevor McDonald/David Attenborough or John Nettles circa Bergerac are good enough for me. </p> \n<p>I even hate Ban Ki-moon. It’s one thing to try to eradicate female genital mutilation and forced marriage, but Mrs Ban Ki-moon told me she can’t remember the last time her husband put the Hoover round. Or sprayed his own soiled pants with pre-wash Vanish. Feminism begins at home, Mr Ban, not at the UN. Huh! Ban Ki-hypocrite, more like.</p> \n<p>Feminists don’t like humour, except slapstick. Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Laurel and Hardy and Bottom are all very popular at feminist comedy nights. Anything that involves men being physically harmed always goes down very well with feminists. They also enjoy watching Tom and Jerry, Road Runner cartoons and war documentaries.</p> \n<p>Feminists never have sex and hate men opening doors for them, even into other dimensions.</p> \n<p>Christmas is banned in the “feminist community”, along with birthdays, wallpaper, nuance, giving people the benefit of the doubt and all music. Feminists only ever listen to one song, on a loop: kd lang’s Constant Craving.</p> \n<p>All feminists are lesbians. There is not a single heterosexual woman in the world who believes that women should have equal rights. Not one. If a feminist says she is heterosexual or bisexual or asexual, she is lying. They are all lesbians.</p> \n<p>Feminism is the sole cause of the recession, global warming, terrorism, pandemics, cancelled flights, volcanos, delayed trains and overly pedantic health and safety regulations. You can’t have hot drinks at work now because of feminism, or climb up small stepladders in libraries. You can’t eat a lobster without safety goggles now because of feminists. You can’t even open a door now because of all the feminists. You have to hurl yourself through plate-glass windows to get in and out of buildings now because of the feminists. All doors have been bricked up now because of feminists. It’s like the window tax of 1696 all over again, but with doors.<br /></p> \n<p>All feminists do all day is burn bras. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, without eating, sleeping or taking toilet breaks. A feminist would rather wet herself than leave a bra unburned. If you read the CV of a feminist, under “Occupation” it would say: “Bra-burner.” And under “Skills” it would say: “Very good at burning bras.” And under “Hobbies and interests” it would say: “Finding bras and burning them.”</p> \n<p>And under “My five-year plan” it would say: “To have burned loads of bras.” And under “My 10-year plan” it would say: “To have eliminated all the bras, by burning.”</p> \n<p>Feminists steal bras from wherever they can. From lingerie departments, barns and hay bales, the wardrobe department for The Benny Hill Show, the stage floor at a Tom Jones concert, milkmen’s pockets, James Bond’s glove compartment and Carry on Camping star Kenneth Williams’s face.</p> \n<p>Then they burn the brassieres in braziers, singing their politically correct nursery rhyme, which goes:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p><em>Bra, bra, black sheep,</em></p> \n <p><em>Have you any bras?</em></p> \n <p><em>Yes, sir, yes, sir,</em></p> \n <p><em>Three bras full.</em></p> \n <p><em>One for the master,</em></p> \n <p><em>And one for the dame,</em></p> \n <p><em>And a tiny double-A one for the little girl who lives down the lane, who doesn’t need one yet, and won’t do for years to come, but who wants one because she saw an American Apparel advert, before it was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, for using gratuitous sexual imagery, involving underage-looking models on its website.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>That’s the end of the bra-burning bit now. Oh, did I mention? Feminists never actually burned bras “as a means of protest”. In 1968 and 1969, protesters demonstrated at the annual Miss America Beauty pageant in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The New York Radical Women were one of the earliest women’s lib groups in the country. They threw items they viewed as oppressive to women (high heels, girdles, women’s magazines, tweezers, bras, etc) into a “freedom trash can”. They applied for but didn’t get a permit from the police allowing them to burn the items (the protest was held on a wooden boardwalk), so they just binned everything instead.</p> \n<p>Nothing was ever burned. But the media said they burned everything and have been saying it ever since, and now twats and anti-feminists use the term “bra burners” as a way of trivialising the movement. Just thought I’d clear that one up.</p> \n<p>I am a feminist. This means I think that all men are rapists, without exception. Even paralysed men, who can only move one eyeball. All rapists. Even my seven-year-old son is a rapist, and that is how I introduce him to people. “Have you met my son? He’s seven. Rapist.” That’s what I think, because I am a feminist.</p> \n<p>Even dead men are rapists. A bit of soil and science doesn’t stop them. Mud and physics is just more bureaucratic nonsense for them to negotiate their way around, like CCTV cameras and sentencing.</p> \n<p>Even half the French language are rapists, all those masculine words, raping all the feminine ones. That’s what I think, because I am a feminist.</p> \n<p>Feminists never laugh at anything. They didn’t even laugh at that YouTube clip of babies in car seats going through tunnels that went viral. Or at that clip where someone called St Sanders has made Mick Jagger make funny noises. Even when Germaine Greer told her now legendary joke on feminist practice and post-structuralist theory, to a lecture hall filled with feminists, not a single feminist laughed. She even distorted her voice with helium and wore a funny Marx Brothers mask to encourage the feminists, but she got nothing at all.</p> \n<p>Mind you, she did mess up the punchline by forgetting it. And she got her Marxes mixed up. They were all probably trying to work out why Germaine Greer was doing a Joe Pasquale impression and was wearing a mask of a German revolutionary socialist.</p> \n<p>If a feminist is made to pull a cracker at Christmas, she quickly eats the joke so that she doesn’t have to tell it.</p> \n<p>Feminists only ever eat paper. Paper. And carpets.</p> \n<p>If a feminist is found to love her husband, enjoy cooking, having a facial or interacting with her own children, she is publicly flogged and thrown out of feminism by Julie Bindel and Julie Burchill, who go out undercover, posing as eyebrow-threaders, sugar daddies and John Nettles to try to trick us.</p> \n<p>So that’s feminism. I hope I’ve cleared that up for you.</p> \n<h2>What is a Tory feminist? </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70ad00a9b98843318ef9115f09c804c42cc5a974\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434985545766/46986582-163e-4aec-aba3-6febbc2d5321-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Theresa May.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tory feminist Theresa May.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aenne Chene/Fawcett Society</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’m not entirely sure about women wearing a “This is what a feminist looks like” T-shirt. Or men, for that matter. It’s overstating the case a bit, isn’t it? It’s like wearing a T-shirt with “I am not a racist” on it. It makes me suspicious. I assume that most people’s default setting is feminist, until they do or say something that makes me think otherwise. If I went bowling with a friend, for example, and they took their coat off to reveal an “I am not a racist” T-shirt underneath, I don’t think I’d feel relieved at all. On the contrary, it would make me very on edge. I’d spend the whole night worried I was bowling with an ironic racist.</p> \n<p>A few years ago, because Tory feminists were in the papers all the time, talking about Tory feminism, it made me think about what Tory feminism was, which fed into the standup in my show War Donkey in Edinburgh in the summer of 2012. This is how it went:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“I’ve been trying to work out what a Tory feminist is, because I keep seeing photographs of female Tory MPs in the newspapers, wearing T-shirts with ‘This is what a feminist looks like’ on them. What, like a T-shirt? How can a T-shirt look like a feminist? A T-shirt looks like a T-shirt, doesn’t it? It should say, ‘This is what a T-shirt with “This is what a feminist looks like” written on it looks like.’</p> \n <p>That’s what it says on the front, anyway, of the Tory feminists’ T-shirts that they’re all wearing now. And on the back it says, ‘Not really, I’m a Tory, you gullible dick.’</p> \n <p>Then underneath that it says, ‘I axed the health in pregnancy grant. I closed Sure Start centres.’ That one’s got a smiley face next to it. ‘I cut child benefit and slashed tax credits. I shut down shelters for battered wives and children. I cut rape counselling and legal aid.’ Winking face.</p> \n <p>‘I cut funding for CCTV cameras and street lighting, making women much more vulnerable. I closed down all 23 specialist domestic violence courts. I cut benefits for disabled children.’ Sad face with sunglasses on. ‘I tried to amend the abortion act so that women receive one-to-one abortion counselling from the pope before they go ahead with it.’ Winking face with tongue out. The back is much longer than the front, by the way. It’s a tailcoat, basically. They’re wearing tailcoats.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Extracted from A Book For Her by Bridget Christie (Century, &pound;14.99, out on 2 July).

A time for simple pleasures: outdoor parties, cold drinks, escapes to the beach. A time to choke one’s fellow citizens with a poorly chosen perfume. </p> \n<p>At every turn of the season, designers flood the world with new scents. But does such a thing as a “summer perfume” exist? </p> \n<p>According to Victoria Frolova of the fragrance blog <a href=\"http://boisdejasmin.com/\">Bois de Jasmin</a>, this is hooey: “The seasonal division that we often take for granted is as much about marketing as the meaningless divisions of perfume into the eau de toilette, eau de parfum, etc. It may mean something depending on the brand, but not as a universal concept. It’s just a way to get people to buy more perfume.”</p> \n<p>Still, there are solid reasons to change what you wear in the heat. For one thing, perfume is dependent on heat to work. Essentially, perfume is just aromatic molecules in a neutral medium. Once it’s on your skin, it begins to evaporate – and as the molecules leave your skin and hit the air, voila! You smell. </p> \n<p>Frolova, who has trained professionally at <a href=\"http://www.iff.com/\">IFF</a>, says that perfumers measure the volatility of the molecules to control the nature and evolution of the scent. </p> \n<p>“You first notice molecules with light weight, such as those present in citrus, pepper, herbs and light fruity notes,” she says. “The least volatile (and generally heavier) components will linger on skin much longer, some up to 24 hours: musks, ambers, woods. Temperature – of skin and of air – affects the way molecules evaporate, and consequently, the way perfume smells.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6b6b8fdd9c254f61a343433be920d556bf596bc5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434998709057/419ead04-2f99-4cda-8534-19e28fb35f34-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\" Chanel Eau de Cologne\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chanel Eau de Cologne.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Thus a street in midtown Manhattan can be perfectly lovely in February and yet somehow manage to smell like 5,000 pounds of rotting meat on a muggy day in July – and thus, the bottle of Fracas that you safely wear through three-quarters of the year becomes a chemical weapon in a heat wave. </p> \n<p>The usual response is to slim things down: “Citrus and crisp green scents are perfect in the heat,” says Angela Sanders of <a href=\"http://www.nstperfume.com/\">Now Smell This</a>. “They read as ‘cold,’ and they burn off quickly. They’re the perfume equivalent of a gin and tonic.” </p> \n<p>Often, these are found on the men’s side of the aisle. Sanders recommends Chanel Eau de Cologne (“the gold standard”) and Guerlain Eau Imperiale. Dior’s Eau Sauvage is another classic in this vein, an intentionally simple mix of lemon, rosemary and jasmine. A friend of mine used to dump gin into limonata and serve it at his summer parties, and it tasted essentially like Eau Sauvage smells: crisp, bitter, and the tiniest bit metallic. </p> \n<p>Granted, these colognes are often classically manly scents (lots of people will tell you that Eau Sauvage smells like their dad). If you doubt your manliness can encompass them, there are plenty of other more contemporary takes on green. Hermes’ <a href=\"http://www.fragrancenet.com/fragrances/hermes/un-jardin-sur-le-nil?gclid=CMLW587_o8YCFWjmwgod66cKmA\">Un Jardin Sur Le Nil</a> is a watery “mango” scent that contains weirdly pleasing facets of tomato and carrot; Slumberhouse’s <a href=\"http://www.basenotes.net/ID26136142.html\">Pear + Olive </a>smells like a produce aisle in heaven. Both are crisp and lightweight enough to cut through the heat without making mortal enemies of your co-workers.</p> \n<p>Then again, why be conservative? The fact that scent gets bigger in heat can be used to your advantage. White flowers in particular – jasmine, tuberose, frangipani – are known to “bloom” in hot weather. </p> \n<p>Alyssa Harad, author of Coming to My Senses, recalled an experiment with Parfums DelRae’s Amoureuse, “a huge honey, ginger lily and cardamom perfume”. She says: “On a cool day Amoureuse is very beautiful but very big – a few drops and they’ll smell you coming a block away. In the heat and humidity it blooms into something phantasmagorical, you can practically crawl inside of it. I once wore it on a dare when it was 103 degrees and 85% humidity and I felt I was hallucinating. It was absolutely gorgeous and completely narcotic – I couldn’t get any work done until it simmered down.”</p> \n<p>For those looking to replicate the same experiment on the cheap, Lush has some inexpensive and fantastically loud white florals. Lust is just about the most bombastic rendition of jasmine that you can find, and Sikkim Girls is essentially nag champa – frangipani over a woody base – with extra sweetness thrown in. </p> \n<p>Both are fearsome creatures under any circumstances, but they come alive in heat; it’s not polite, exactly, but it is an experience. </p> \n<p>Everyone I spoke to pointed out that the “rules” for summer perfume depend on everything from location to culture to personal taste. Americans might stock up on coconut scents that remind them of Coppertone (witness the fanatical following for Lauder’s Bronze Goddess); in Europe, sunscreen is more floral-smelling, and summer might smell like lavender or orange blossom. </p> \n<p>Sanders, meanwhile, is of the mind that the best summer perfume should be casual. “It makes sense,” she says. “Do you really wear your most serious clothing in summer? Summer is the time to take Fridays off, stay up late and wear cheap sandals. Summer perfumes reflect that feeling.” </p> \n<p>So, yes: relax, and have fun with your summer perfume. Careful, considerate, well-ventilated fun. </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/750d61164c48cf7536ca65b533a76fce92eb427d/0_0_4117_2470/4117.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2470,"width":4117,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Bernard Annebicque/Sygma/Corbis","altText":"01 Feb 1994, Paris, France --- In 1980, Shiseido hired Serge Lutens to manage its international image.

So why do some still think of instant noodles as the food of the desperate?</p> \n<p>In 1958 Taiwanese-Japanese businessman Momofuku Ando invented the instant noodle. He had seen the devastation and poverty created by war and wanted to make a cheap, tasty product that could feed the world. Now instant noodles are a massive business with around 100 billion bowls eaten annually.</p> \n<p>In Asia, instant noodle brands are endorsed by celebrities, plastered on billboards and served in sit-down restaurants – but in Australia they’re struggling to escape their stereotype as a sustenance-only snack for students with a philistine approach to food.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3cb69c864bc20268a140a6c9ade0cc1d01e641fe\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3cb69c864bc20268a140a6c9ade0cc1d01e641fe/0_130_5425_3256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Instant noodles\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Instant noodles – popular in Asia but maligned in Australia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tsering Topgyal/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But several of Sydney top chefs aren’t shy about expressing their fondness for precooked noodle blocks. Mitch Orr, head chef at Sydney’s innovative Acme, loves instant noodles. “I grew up on Maggi 2-minute noodles. That’s cheap and easy, just a snack Mum would give you to shut you up,” he says. “But as I got older and I moved in with Asian friends it was all about mee goreng. It was next level, really amazing.” </p> \n<p>Ben Sears, chef at Korean fusion restaurant Moon Park, eats instant noodles at least once a week. He says he used to think they were lowbrow and trashy until he started cooking with them. “You work with young Koreans and each night they say ‘hey, try this one’. Gradually you learn some of them are really good. In context they can be quite subtle and intelligent.”</p> \n<p>Sears says if you’re not often exposed to Asian culture you’d never experience the sheer variety – and quality – of instant noodles. </p> \n<p>In Chinatown’s Thai Kee there’s almost an entire aisle dedicated to instant noodles, from dry mee goreng to cheese ramen, to rich, sinewy curries. For the uninitiated, choosing a packet can be quite intimidating. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a01e80293d2b4d20209845250fc3017648e75fd0\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a01e80293d2b4d20209845250fc3017648e75fd0/0_210_5142_3086/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Instant noodles used in curry ramen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Instant noodles form the base for curry ramen noodles.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We sought guidance from international instant noodle celebrity Hans Lienesch on how to choose a packet of instant ramen. He runs the <a href=\"http://www.theramenrater.com/\">Ramen Rater</a>, an instant noodle review blog that has so far discussed the nuances and value of 1,688 packets. </p> \n<h2><strong>How to identify a good packet</strong></h2> \n<p>“It’s funny, if you look at the packet you can’t really tell. I’ve had ones that are in really nondescript boring packages and they’re really yum,” Lienesch says. A sign of a good instant noodle, Lienesch explains, is a lot of packets within the packet. “The ones which just have the powder are a bit boring.” He says a good one should have a powder or two (one for chilli), a paste or a seasoned oil, as well as dehydrated vegetables and herbs and, if you’re lucky, real meat.</p> \n<h2><strong>What brands to look for</strong></h2> \n<p>“Usually anything from south-east Asia will fit the bill pretty much – that area right now is blowing my mind.” Thailand’s Mama and Malaysia’s MyKuali are favourite brands of Lienesch’s. “From South Korea, try Nongshim, Ottogi or Paldo, and look out for Indomie from Indonesia and Momofuku Ando’s Nissin from Japan,” he says.</p> \n<h2><strong>How to judge quality</strong></h2> \n<p>“Noodles tend to be noodles; there aren’t huge differences. The bad ones [are] mushy or spongy, the good ones have a decent chew to them or are more elastic,” Lienesch says. It’s all about the broth, he adds, which should be flavoursome and reminiscent of whatever dish it represents, whether that be Penang white curry, teriyaki yakisoba and mayo or simply bacon flavour.</p> \n<h2><strong>How to prepare it</strong></h2> \n<p>The most common misunderstanding about instant noodles is that they should be eaten on their own. Lienesch says you should think about them as a base ingredient. “It’s like when you go to the store and buy spaghetti – pretty boring on its own, but when you add sauce and meat and vegetables … it’s a totally different animal,” he says. Lienesch’s rough guide is to include whatever features on the packet, but he says it’s really a blank canvas – add whatever you like.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433727066366/a468ea92-5eef-4919-a9fe-1ecd65b2bf67-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Linda Nylind/The Guardian.","altText":"Instant noodles","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian."}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3cb69c864bc20268a140a6c9ade0cc1d01e641fe/0_130_5425_3256/5425.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3256,"width":5425,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Instant noodles – popular in Asia but maligned in Australia.

Plus the obvious: how far the condom came down the penis. “It was a bit strange writing down the amount of time we had sex for. ‘Are we good at having sex or bad at having sex?’” Christina says.

The bottom line is, there are problems with the condom: while it is 98% effective when used correctly, it is hugely unpopular – worn by an estimated 5% of men worldwide. This is a fatal flaw in developing countries, where an HIV diagnosis remains a death sentence, due to the high cost of antiretroviral drugs. Condom design, almost unchanged in 120 years, is ripe for a makeover.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/12/condoms-stop-me-reaching-orgasm-sex\">Condoms stop me reaching orgasm</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In 2013, Bill and Melinda Gates announced that <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/bill-and-melinda-gates-foundation\">their Foundation</a> was making condom innovation a priority (alongside toilets, vaccines and neonatal care): they offered a $100,000 grant to any team with a strong proposal for a “<a href=\"http://gcgh.grandchallenges.org/Explorations/Topics/Pages/NextGenerationCondomRound11.aspx\">next generation condom</a> that significantly preserves or enhances pleasure, in order to improve uptake and regular use”.</p> \n<p>The Foundation received more than 800 submissions, which in 2013 they narrowed down to <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/11-innovative-condoms-awarded-grants-2013-11?IR=T\">11 winners</a>, announcing a further 11 winners of the grant in 2014. The successful proposals ranged from those using Nobel prizewinning materials (<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2013/nov/26/graphene-molecule-potential-wonder-material\">graphene</a>) to those with built-in applicators or lubricant. The Gates Foundation also gave money to simple behavioural studies, and to a shrink-to-fit condom dreamed up by the CFHC. Those proposals are now able to apply for phase two funding of up to $1m each – the winners will be announced later this year, with only a handful likely to be successful.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile many of them are in the testing phase. To be enrolled in an official “breakage and slippage” study for the CFHC, you need to have been in a monogamous relationship for at least six months. The woman also needs to be on the pill or have an IUD, to ensure she won’t become pregnant. (Unless it’s an “efficacy” study, in which case you have to be monogamous but happy to accept the chance of getting a baby out of the study instead of a $100 cheque.)</p> \n<p>Couples have sex for the CFHC between three and eight times with the experimental condom, then the same number of times with a placebo (a regular condom, still in its branded wrapping, which somewhat spoils the “double blind” study pretence). Immediately after the earth has moved (or even if the session ended disappointingly, with a lost erection or broken prototype), each of them studiously fills in a detailed questionnaire.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3c1efb15511e8a6d1269d15a60c817fec68b67e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434021936152/a3a93cd6-3a1b-4fe8-ab2b-ecdb3d165e98-460x349.jpeg\" alt=\"condom testers Christina Pederson and Brendan Weinhold\" width=\"460\" height=\"349\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’s not the worst mood-killer we’ve encountered’: condom testers Christina Pederson and Brendan Weinhold.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Schofield for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Brendan and Christina had been married for 10 years when they started testing, and had seldom used condoms. Christina had only ever been with Brendan. And, to my surprise, the other California condom testers I spoke to had also only had sex with each other. Could they really be the best judges?</p> \n<p>Amy and Max Hurwitz met in college and signed up to a CFHC study in their first year of dating. “Getting paid to have sex? Um, yes!” says Amy, over coffee in their West Hollywood apartment. Married with no children, they are an attractive couple: Max resembles a wholesome Clark Kent; Amy, young with curly brown hair, does most of the talking – which is fitting, as she did most of the testing work: inserting the rings, wearing diaphragms, sporting the cumbersome female condom. “We always thought of it as a good deed,” she says. “We called it ‘sex for science’. And because it was science, we always followed the rules – we weren’t going to fuck up science!”</p> \n<p>What has been their least favourite test? The female condom, by far. The best? The IUD. They disagree on an ultra-thin, polyurethane condom, which Max describes as “bag-like”. “It wasn’t terrible, it would have been an acceptable option,” he says. “But it had this weird texture.”</p> \n<p>“See, I liked it,” interjects Amy, “because it was clear and I could actually see his penis.”</p> \n<p>The couple have pooled the money they earn doing studies – $100 each per trial – into a savings account, earmarked for vacations. And there has been another unexpected bonus: normal sex has become even more thrilling. “You have to wait three days after unprotected sex to have condom trial sex – so we found ourselves thinking, a lot of the time, ‘Are we going to have Study Sex, or Sex Sex?’ It felt a little bit naughty.”</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>A 90-minute drive from Los Angeles, under bright studio lights, inventor and Gates Foundation grant winner Danny Resnic is working on a prototype that he hopes will revolutionise the condom. A solid grey, bullet-like phallus, ribbed vertically like a pleated skirt and nicknamed the Master, hangs above a mould, a white rectangular block of silicone with a circular hole at one end; the interior is a mirror image of the grey master.</p> \n<p>“When I first said two decades ago that I was inventing new kinds of condoms, people asked: what could be different?” Resnic says. “Nobody was capable of imagining anything else. We are all so accustomed to one concept, we haven’t challenged it. But consumers are looking for something that is safe, and that actually addresses their need for pleasure.”</p> \n<p>The reason we haven’t seen anything like this from the main condom manufacturers (Trojan, Durex, Skyn, Okamoto and Ansell, who account for 96% of the market), Resnic believes, is that the “oligopoly” has no incentive to change. They already control the market. “True change is going to have to come from outside the industry,” he says. “From the mavericks.”</p> \n<p>There have been several over the years: Dutch inventor Jan Vinzenz Krause caused a stir when he announced a “spray-on” latex version in 2006, inspired by the mechanics of a car wash. (The main problem: it took five minutes to dry, which was a mood killer.) Last year the designers of the <a href=\"http://galacticcap.com/\">Galactic Cap</a> – an elfin latex hat that fits over the tip of the penis – raised more than $100,000 on Indiegogo, and plan to release it in 2017.</p> \n<p>Resnic talks me through what he believes will be the condom of the future, an eccentric shape that has taken him more than 25 years to develop. Made of thick yellow latex, it resembles a squeaky dishwashing glove more than a condom. Yet, at this very moment, 28 South African couples – half heterosexual, half male homosexual – are road-testing his design. He’s testing it there, Resnic says, because the approval process was quicker and easier than in the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d75a86d6f17de3579ea3b40327015bd44e8e1cd2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434017649394/7a4b3de7-eab4-4c9f-9997-7c9543eb064b-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"condom designer Danny Resnic\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danny Resnic with his vision of the future: the Origami Internal Condom, an eccentric shape it has taken him more than 25 years to develop.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Schofield for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Flaring out like a trumpet, <a href=\"http://www.origamicondoms.com/#!female-condom/cxt7\">Resnic’s Origami Internal Condom</a> comes in both “male” and “female” versions, and if it passes the grade, it will become the world’s first device explicitly approved for anal sex. Resnic is talking to me in the lounge of his LA condo on a bright morning. Tall, bald, with flawless straight white American teeth, wearing casual slacks and a collared red cotton shirt (this counts as business attire in LA), he pulls out a heavy black suitcase containing his prototype.</p> \n<p>Using a veiny purple dildo, a translucent white Fleshlight (a masturbation toy about the size and shape of a torch, with a squishy interior) and a healthy amount of lubricant, Resnic illustrates how the condom would remain in place even with vigorous thrusting. When the superintendent of the building knocks on the door mid-demonstration, the familiar exchange suggests the super has seen this before.</p> \n<p>A former art book publisher and interior designer, Resnic first conceived of a very ribbed super-strong condom 20 years ago. He had watched the love of his life and his best friends die of Aids in the 1980s, and had adopted diligent safe sex practices. But in 1993, a condom broke during sex and he, too, contracted HIV.</p> \n<p>Condom breakage is rare: around four in 1,000 uses. Resnic was not just terrified, he was angry. How could he have used the best device available and still be handed what felt like a death sentence? “I had the idea for the Origami condom before I contracted HIV – but the diagnosis really gave me the motivation to pursue it,” he says. “I thought: there must be a better way to create safe sex.”</p> \n<p>Twenty-five years and $2.5m later, he’s nearly there. “If I had known then what I do now, I’m not sure I would have seen the idea through to the end,” he admits. “I honestly thought it would take a couple of years when I started.”</p> \n<p>But he couldn’t let go of the idea of a safe condom that enhances pleasure: a contraceptive that doubles as a sex toy – something that would make sex with a condom <em>better </em>than sex without one. “Having sex with a traditional condom is like trying to taste a lollipop with <a href=\"http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blsaranwrap.htm\">saran wrap</a> on your tongue,” he says, handling a latex condom. “It’s just never going to feel amazing.”</p> \n<p>Resnic went through many iterations. His idea was that the condom should have some movement, independent from the penis. His first models were folded like accordions, conjuring visions of sophisticated Japanese paper models.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Having sex with a traditional condom is like trying&nbsp;to taste a lollipop with clingfilm on your tongue</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>An earlier Origami condom, with its male and female versions, was pleated horizontally rather than folded and made from silicone, designed to move up and down the penis (conventional latex condoms stay put). Tests found that 67% of couples liked using the Origami female condom, compared with just 16% for the female condoms on the market. The latest version of the Origami condom has thick lengthwise ribs, which Resnic says will be more pleasurable than traditional ribbed condoms (which are ribbed horizontally), as they push against the flesh. “The pleats create reciprocating motion by buckling and unbuckling,” he explains. “The fluting allows for tissue to move within these grooves. With the penis pushing against it, you get this yin and yang thing going on.”</p> \n<p>Recently, he has made his most dramatic change: a switch from silicone to thick, opaque latex. Silicone turned out to be “too bulky”, and the latex condoms can be made by dip-moulding, which is much cheaper than injection moulding when it comes to mass production.</p> \n<p>Will Resnic’s otherworldly, ribbed, buckling and gripping design prove the breakthrough that the Gates are looking for? Will men who dislike clothing their erections in thin sleeves of latex prefer thick ribbed chambers? Handling Resnic’s sturdy, opaque, beige sleeve – so thick it can stand upright – feels distinctly unerotic, but my hands are not the body part that the Origami condom will need to please. Sadly, Resnic won’t let me take a prototype home – I’m not taking part in a clinical trial, and this isn’t yet approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But Resnic himself has used them, and assures me they do feel better than sex with a regular condom – and even better than sex without one.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Resnic has his detractors. He has been accused, in a series of articles on the rightwing Washington Free Beacon, of misspending his funding; <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/issues/origami-condom-inventor-has-to-pay-back-taxpayer-funds/\">the site has claimed</a> he is being investigated by the National Institutes of Health. According to the Beacon, a former employee of Resnic’s has provided them with proof that he spent his funding on plastic surgery, trips to <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/travel/costarica\">Costa Rica</a> and the Playboy mansion, plus a condo in Provincetown. Resnic denies the allegations, and tells me the spending is due to a case of credit card fraud involving an ex-employee which, after a counter suit, he decided to drop. “The district attorney determined that the stolen money had all been spent by [the employee] and we decided to drop the expensive civil case when there was no chance to recover any funds,” Resnic says.</p> \n<p>His design has its critics, too. “The Origami condom really is more of a sex toy that is inserted into somebody – as though you could stare your partner in the eyes while masturbating inside them,” says Mark McGlothlin, president of Apex Medical Technologies, whose lab is two and a half hours’ drive from Resnic’s, in San Diego. McGlothlin has worked in condom science for 35 years. “That doesn’t mean it’s bad sex,” he says of Resnic’s condom, “but it’s not the same thing. The point of a condom is to mimic natural intercourse.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2014/oct/23/sex-education-statutory-requirement-bill\">‘Today we’re talking masturbation’: sitting in on a sex education class</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Apex is another Gates Foundation winner. His, like almost every other team, is trying not to reinvent the wheel, but to make it lighter and sleeker, with materials that are thinner but stronger than latex. While some are going hi-tech (University of Oregon chemists are working with polyurethane, University of Manchester scientists with graphene), Apex is going back to basics with collagen, giving animal intestines a makeover.</p> \n<p>Lambskin condoms, fashioned from the intestines of slaughtered animals, have been used for centuries: the oldest sheep gut condom, recovered from a latrine in Dudley Castle in the West Midlands, was dated to around 1646. Today’s versions (such as <a href=\"http://www.trojancondoms.com/naturalamb.aspx\">Naturalamb</a>, available from chemists and online) are still fashioned from intestine, but sanitised with modern chemistry. They don’t account for a huge slice of the market and are used by those with latex allergies or who prefer the feel of genuine flesh over synthetic latex. McGlothlin thinks they are “disgusting”. “They stink like they came from an animal and they look like they came from an animal. Yet they still have wonderful properties.” The collagen in the skin, for instance, has far better heat transfer and water content properties than latex. People who use lambskin report that they do indeed feel more natural, but they are expensive, averaging &pound;4 each, and – more damagingly – are considered too porous to protect against HIV.</p> \n<p>Instead of using lambskin, McGlothlin’s proposal is to “upcycle” beef waste into reconstituted collagen. By grinding animal hide through a series of high-powered blenders and chemically treating the fluffy white fibres with a variety of plasticisers, surfactants and wetting agents, he is perfecting a condom that meets all the criteria: tactile, cheap and ready for the assembly line.</p> \n<p>On paper, it sounds perfect: thoughtfully traditional yet hi-tech, and made of recycled materials. Unless you’re a vegetarian, is there anything else you could want from a condom? In Apex’s sunny San Diego lab, handling the prototypes, I could feel the creases in my fingers and tiny bumps on my skin through the condom. And it did not smell or look as if it came from an animal. Apex’s offices, housed in a sunny industrial park 25 miles from the Mexican border, look like those of any other business, stacked with full ring binders, photocopy machines, strip lighting and desks overflowing with paperwork. But the labs next door, where the tinkering takes place, house all kinds of condom gadgetry crafted to put new designs through their paces, from pumps used to inflate condoms with air to test their strength, to a phallic mould made of pure Teflon; there is a “Coital Model” that tests condoms with the highest degree of accuracy before they come into contact with real human genitals.</p> \n<p>“We keep this under a cardboard box, because it might seem a bit obscene to our visitors,” says senior development engineer Scott Herrick, as he reveals a large and veiny plastic dildo on an air-powered pump, positioned across from a bright pink Fleshlight mounted on white plastic. Any experimental condom needs to undergo thousands of mechanical copulations before it’s considered safe enough for the real deal. Revved up, the simulator tests for strength. “How many thrusts do you think you get in one typical act?” Herrick says. A back-of-the envelope calculation: 300. “We want to be sure any prototypes we make are able to hold up and also to be able to compare them to other commercially available condoms. So we work with 500 thrusts, simulating a minimum of 13 minutes – somewhat of a guess, but probably not too far off.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7f0ab462514d6f0da1df93af5875acdf5131d024\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434040459917/babb39bf-2220-44e8-b83d-e7058317fa0d-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"condom tester\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Any experimental condom needs to undergo thousands of mechanical copulations before it’s considered safe enough for the real deal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Schofield for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It turns out that most condoms rip because the tip has worked its way down one side of the penis, until the pressure tears it. During the test I see, this condom remains resolutely in place as the coital replicator thrusts the dildo in and out of the Fleshlight, the air-powered pumps making an audible accompaniment, a bit like a steam engine. Herrick and I settle into a comfortable silence, enthralled by the spectacle.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>After years of being drip-dried on to dildos, scrutinised with tweezers and plunged thousands of times into a mushy imitation vagina, nascent condoms enter the main event: the bedroom. More than 25,000 couples are registered with the CFHC to test condoms, penis caps, a huge variety of polymers, hormone implants, contraceptive rings, pills, gels and every other form of contraceptive weaponry in their arsenal.</p> \n<p>“This is probably the weirdest thing we’ve worked with,” says Ron Frezieres, vice-president of research and evaluation at the CFHC. Standing on the fourth floor of an ordinary office block in downtown LA, he is holding up a pair of striped black knickers with an internally-fixed condom. The full-pelvis prophylactics – more chastity belt than sex aid – were designed by a Hawaiian woman who suffered from extreme herpes, ensuring any lover would not come into contact with her skin.</p> \n<p>The CFHC is also developing its own new condom with Gates funding. Its design is a polyethylene condom, not stretchy and thick, but firm and thin. Technical description: “ultra sheer wrapping condom”. Or somewhat like clingfilm. “Our manufacturer has begged us, ‘Oh God, don’t compare it to saran wrap – people will think we’re making sandwich wrappers’,” Frezieres says.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The big idea is to embed the super-material graphene into condoms, making them much thinner and stronger</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Unlike most new designs – modelled on the old roll-on concept – polyethylene condoms are not taut and phallic, but baggy. A bit roomy, they truly are one-size-fits-all, clinging and wrapping instead of squeezing and constricting. They are very thin, about a quarter of the thickness of latex, and the polymer is less likely to degrade in hot climates, such as warehouses in India, Africa and South America, where latex condoms have been known to break down.</p> \n<p>The donning method is easier: you roll it on like a sock using two pull tabs. “Zip and it’s on,” Frezieres says. No fumbling and fussing, no arousal-killing dithering – and a godsend if you live in an area without electric lights. Putting condoms on inside out (making them more likely to come off) is a serious issue in developing countries hit hardest by the HIV epidemic. Innovative, cheap and practical, is the CFHC design the Gates’s silver bullet?</p> \n<p>“In all our years of research with condoms, we have learned that there is no silver bullet,” Frezieres says. “Some like them clear, others go for coloured, some prefer bumps, others like them ribbed. There’s so much variation in taste. Some even like flavoured condoms. I don’t know what the magic mix is, but I don’t think there is one single solution. The great challenge is to develop a bunch of new and creative ideas that push the entire field forwards.”</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Pushing the field forwards sounds all well and good, but designs face several hurdles, from the sketchbook to the chemist, and not least the strict EU and US FDA safety regulations, some of which seem somewhat outdated. For example, a condom needs to be able to hold 16 litres of air before bursting. Apex’s collagen condoms fail this test. Is Herrick concerned that they won’t be what the FDA wants? “The FDA will only readily approve designs that meet the standards for latex condoms, which simply might not apply. Why should a non-stretchable condom have to hold 16 litres of air?”</p> \n<p>The product also needs to be equivalent to another device already on the market. “Don’t invent something that will contradict the current standards – and it will be a decade before the standards change.” Resnic sighs. “In my opinion, making something that is similar to existing products isn’t the definition of innovation.”</p> \n<p>One of Gates’s finalists isn’t redrawing the condom at all. “We decided not to use our money to develop our original condom design, but to do behavioural research in sub-Saharan Africa, to see what would really be practical for people in the places most hard-hit by HIV,” says Ben Strutt, head of design at the <a href=\"http://www.cambridge-design.co.uk/news-and-articles/articles/balancing-design-and-engineering-expertise\">Cambridge Design Partnership</a>. “There are so many practical reasons why it’s not easy to just drop thousands of condoms into the region and expect the epidemic to go away,” he says, talking to me on the phone from his laboratory. “Women don’t carry handbags, for example, so how can you expect them to have condoms with them at all times? We were faced with the decision of carrying on with our narrow, technology-focused approach – or to create a solution that is more realistic. Sometimes people become too attached to their idea because it’s their baby, their sacred cow. Sometimes you need to look at the bigger picture, and put the sacred cow down.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2663d1550870dab0e1a3dee161a5a17443494130\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434018589130/76a601b3-bd7b-4b76-872f-cbde95f27e1d-460x368.jpeg\" alt=\"making non-latex condoms\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glass moulds are dipped into a liquid beef compound, then dried, to make non-latex condoms.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Schofield for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Cambridge team is looking at 18 different prophylactic concepts in order to create a “holistic condom solution”. They have brought on board a specialist in the Japanese affective design philosophy of kansei, or considering the emotional aspects of a product as well as the functional. “Whatever we create can’t just be functional – it has to be deeply sensory as well,” Strutt says. “It can’t be greasy, oily, thick, or something that destroys the moment.”</p> \n<p>There have been some spectacular failures when it comes to this approach. A decade ago, there was an enthusiastic rush to create <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2005/nov/25/outlook.development3\">microbicides</a>: HIV-killing gels. The supposed holy grail of prophylactics, these would put women in control, and could be discreetly inserted like a thick lubricant. But <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2009/dec/14/anti-hiv-gel-trial-failure\">they proved ineffective</a>, and in some trials actually worsened HIV infection rates. At the University of Manchester, the big idea is to use graphene, the super material composed of only the element carbon that won Manchester-based scientists Andre Geim and Kostantin Novoselov the <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/\">Nobel prize in physics in 2010</a>. (Graphene is composed of the same element as diamonds and graphite, only arranged in a flat honeycomb lattice configuration.)</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jan/10/why-do-men-fake-orgasms\">Why do men fake orgasms? | Nichi Hodgson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/aravind/\">Dr Aravind Vijayaraghavan</a>, a lecturer in nanomaterials, initiated a research group to apply for Gates funding to investigate embedding graphene into regular latex condoms. The idea is that it would allow them to be made much thinner (graphene is just one atom thick) as well as stronger. Adding graphene to condoms won’t jack up the price by more than 10 or 20%: “It’s not like we’re adding gold,” Vijayaraghavan says. But what the condom actually feels like or looks like, he will not divulge. A patent is pending.</p> \n<p>Which of these new designs is most likely to disrupt the industry? William Potter is a British condom consultant who has overseen development in the R&amp;D departments of major condom manufacturers since 1985. “There’s a huge amount going on at the moment,” he says, talking on the phone from his office in Cambridge. “But most of it is kept strictly confidential – the industry isn’t keen to publicise what it’s been doing because there is so much competition.”</p> \n<p>The Gates initiative has galvanised awareness, he says, but there are many other schemes that get less attention. Personally, he is excited about one development on the horizon: a condom embedded with an anti erection-loss chemical, Zanifil. (This has been designed by a commercial manufacturer, for whom Potter is consulting.)</p> \n<p>What does he make of the Gates Foundation’s mavericks? “The initiative has succeeded in bringing in new ideas and more speculative projects than the industry would have been capable of or willing to support. Whether or not that is a good idea, we will have to wait and see.”</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Back in Glendale, southern California, I ask another condom-testing couple what they have learned from their years of homework. Tina and Don (not their real names) met in high school, have been together for 20 years and married for 10. The testing has been pretty good, they say, except for the female condom. “They are terrible and deserve their reputation,” Don says. “It’s like having sex with an artificial entity instead of a human being.”</p> \n<p>Tina? “It makes loud rustling noises. It slips in and out. It leaves an unsightly baggy ring outside you. There is nothing erotic about it.”</p> \n<p>But overall the trials have spiced things up. With jobs and two children, now aged five and seven, the couple found that sex was always falling to the bottom of their to-do list. After a day of work, picking the kids up from karate, cooking dinner and doing the laundry, intimacy was not a priority. Being guinea pigs – with “free birth control, the opportunity to contribute to science and get paid for it” – brought it back into the forefront of their minds.</p> \n<p>“Sure, it took away from the spontaneity – but we had more sex overall,” Tina says. “And especially when the trials had deadlines.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Zoe Cormier is the author of Sex, Drugs And Rock’n’Roll, published by Profile Books at &pound;12.99.

He had a&nbsp;very formal upbringing and refused to take off his jacket, so when he came to visit one hot and humid summer, I thought he was going to melt. I&nbsp;came up with a plan: I made him a short-sleeved shirt as a gift, knowing he'd wear it so as not to hurt my feelings. It&nbsp;worked, and after we married I&nbsp;carried on making his shirts.</p>\n<p>The man at the fabric shop was always very generous when he cut my fabric, so, after checking Donald didn't mind, I would make myself a&nbsp;matching blouse with the leftovers. It was fun going out in coordinating shirts – in high school in the US, it means you're &quot;going steady&quot;, which was a giggle to us, since we were married. We got lots of compliments and people who would normally just walk on by stopped to talk to us. We&nbsp;enjoyed the attention and we also enjoyed how we looked.</p>\n<p>Then Donald suggested I&nbsp;make our bottom halves match, too, so we started amassing a whole wardrobe of clothes. Initially we matched only at weekends, but as I&nbsp;grew adept at making more complex garments, such as jackets, sweaters and coats, we decided to go full-time with our identical look. We never needed to go clothes shopping again.</p>\n<p>Now, 35 years on, we have four wardrobes of twin outfits, hanging two by two, organised by season and occasion. I always make myself a&nbsp;feminine version of Donald's outfit, though; it's not unisex, because I like ruffles and girly things. I'd describe our style as traditional – we're not concerned about following fashion.</p>\n<p>We find it funny when watching those crime shows and they say, &quot;What was he wearing when you last saw him?&quot; We could just point to ourselves and say, &quot;This!&quot;</p>\n<p>If we need a new outfit, we go to the fabric shop together and pick out something we both like. Donald is an artist – he designed the now iconic pink plastic flamingos you see in gardens – so has an excellent eye for colour and is comfortable wearing distinctive designs. Whenever I&nbsp;see flamingo fabric, I buy some and make us an outfit; we now have more than 40 in their own special closet.</p>\n<p>Whoever gets there first gets to choose what we're wearing. It's not a stampede, though; we're both amenable to the other's choice. If we're going to a party, we'll discuss what to wear like any other couple, except the difference is we want to look the same. Someone once told me that if she and her husband came down wearing the same colour top, they'd change. What a shame to be so insecure. We both have very strong identities as individuals and wearing the same clothes doesn't affect this; clothes don't make your personality. Instead, dressing the same gives me a lovely feeling of closeness to Donald. I've never not felt like doing it; we've done it for so long now that it would feel unnatural not to.</p>\n<p>Donald used to have to travel for business and when I packed his case, I'd tell him which outfit to wear on which day, so we coordinated even though we were apart. It helped us feel connected to each other. But his boss realised Donald was much more productive if I came along, too, so I'd help out at the conventions. It was good for business, because people would seek out our stall year after year to see what we were wearing.</p>\n<p>We don't like to be apart. Donald proposed on our first date and we've been together almost all the time since. If you want to do things by yourself, why get married? Why have separate hobbies? We never argue – Donald says he learned long ago to say, &quot;Yes, dear&quot;, but in fact it's because we have a strong foundation. Being with him is never an effort.</p>\n<p>As we spend all our time together, we always eat the same food, too, which is good because we have matching stains on our outfits.</p>\n<p>If people in the street snigger or nudge each other, I don't mind. In&nbsp;fact, it makes me laugh. We once saw <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/10/dr-ruth-westheimer-my-family-values\" title=\"\">Dr Ruth</a>, the TV psychiatrist, in a&nbsp;department store. She was making her way over to us – probably to comment on our matching coats and hats – but we eluded her. It's one thing to get negative comments from strangers but quite another to have unwanted psychological suggestions, implying dependency issues or something similar. All it is is a positive reflection of the nature of our relationship. We're a matched set.</p>\n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> As told to Emily Cunningham</p>\n<p>Do you have an experience to share?
