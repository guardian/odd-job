Myers said there was an unacceptable risk of harm to the baby because the mother could have contracted HIV.</p> \n<p>Jackson, 20, was tattooed on her hand and her foot in a reputable tattoo parlour in May, the court heard, and has returned negative tests for HIV and hepatitis. Her appeal was heard in the family court on Friday in Sydney in a specially scheduled urgent hearing.</p> \n<p>Myers initially told Jackson: “Don’t breastfeed any more. Seriously don’t. It’s not in the best interest of the child.</p> \n<p>“I seriously want the mother to consider [stopping breastfeeding] before I make an order to prevent it, and I will do it. I don’t care if it hits the front page.” </p> \n<p>He wanted her to stop because of her mental health problems because she had been diagnosed with postnatal depression and he did not believe she was on the medication she should be. </p> \n<p>The father, also 20, had not initially applied for an injunction to stop the woman breastfeeding and the court heard the “genesis” of the idea came from Myers during a custody hearing.</p> \n<p>Myers could not make an injunction on her breastfeeding based on the woman’s mental health and the court heard he then went looking for an evidence-based reason.</p> \n<p>“He firmly made up his mind before hearing all of the evidence,” Jackson’s barrister, Claire Cantrall, told the court.</p> \n<p>The appeal is being heard by justices Robert Aldridge, Judith Ryan and Hilary Hannan. Cantrall called the injunction “extraordinary”. Ryan agreed it was unprecedented. </p> \n<p>Cantrall argued there was a lack of “evidentiary foundation” for the breastfeeding injunction.</p> \n<p>“[Myer] ought to have taken into account the inherent unlikelihood of the mother contracting HIV,” she said. “The issue of risk does not go over a mere possibility. It is an extraordinary injunction.”</p> \n<p>Myer dismissed evidence from the World Health Organisation that recommends children be breastfed until they are two years old, with Cantrall telling the court the balance of risk and benefit to the child “simply did not occur” in Myer’s judgment.</p> \n<p>Ryan remarked that it was the bench’s view the benefits of breastfeeding were “uncontroversial”.</p> \n<p>Cantrall said Myer failed to properly consider the consequences of depriving the child of the mother’s capacity to breastfeed. </p> \n<p>The mother attended court, sitting still and looking ahead throughout the proceedings while the father did not attend which Ryan said was “disappointing”.</p> \n<p>The hearing continues.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/9b82af87d7abc9d3274229f50e433b23e98905d6/0_268_3690_2213/3690.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2213,"width":3690,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Katie Collins/PA","altText":"Embargoed to 2330 Tuesday March 24\nFile photo dated 26/12/08 of a woman breastfeeding her baby, as buying human breast milk on the internet poses serious health risks to babies, experts have warned.

Her appeal was heard in the family court on Friday in Sydney in a specially scheduled urgent hearing.<br /></p> \n<p>Myers initially told Jackson: “Don’t breastfeed any more. Seriously don’t. It’s not in the best interest of the child.</p> \n<p>“I seriously want the mother to consider [stopping breastfeeding] before I make an order to prevent it, and I will do it. I don’t care if it hits the front page.”</p> \n<p>He wanted her to stop because of her mental health problems because she had been diagnosed with postnatal depression and he did not believe she was on the medication she should be.</p> \n<p>The father, also 20, had not initially applied for an injunction to stop the woman breastfeeding and the court heard the “genesis” of the idea came from Myers during a custody hearing.</p> \n<p>Myers could not make an injunction on the woman’s breastfeeding based on her mental health and the court heard he then went looking for an evidence-based reason.</p> \n<p>When the mother applied to be able to take the child home with her at an earlier hearing the judge denied the request, saying she would “just go home and breastfeed the child”.</p> \n<p>“He firmly made up his mind before hearing all of the evidence,” Jackson’s barrister, Claire Cantrall, told the court.</p> \n<p>The appeal was heard by justices Aldridge, Judith Ryan and Hilary Hannan. Cantrall called the injunction “extraordinary”. Ryan agreed it was unprecedented.</p> \n<p>Cantrall argued there was a lack of “evidentiary foundation” for the breastfeeding injunction.</p> \n<p>“[Myer] ought to have taken into account the inherent unlikelihood of the mother contracting HIV,” she said. “The issue of risk does not go over a mere possibility. It is an extraordinary injunction.”</p> \n<p>Myer dismissed evidence from the World Health Organisation that recommends children be breastfed until they are two years old. Cantrall told the court the balance of risk and benefit to the child “simply did not occur” in Myer’s judgment.</p> \n<p>Ryan remarked that it was the bench’s view the benefits of breastfeeding were “uncontroversial”.</p> \n<p>Cantrall said Myer failed to properly consider the consequences of depriving the child of the mother’s capacity to breastfeed.</p> \n<p>The mother attended court, sitting still and looking ahead throughout the proceedings. The father did not attend which Ryan said was “disappointing”. </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bae4bba02d9bfca3f90818f3716b568b7e1db5d7/1423_1745_2082_1249/2082.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1249,"width":2082,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"KidStock/Getty Images","altText":"Mother breastfeeding baby in living room","cleanCredit":"Photograph: KidStock/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T06:17:48Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T06:55:08Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Bridie Jabour","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/12/17/1418830306723/Bridie-Jabour-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/bridie-jabour"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Breastfeeding","Law","Parents and parenting","Australian law"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/breastfeeding","webTitle":"Breastfeeding"},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"australia-news/australian-law","webTitle":"Australian law"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Bridie Jabour","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/bridie-jabour"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/australia-news-blog/2015/jun/19/tattooed-mother-has-court-breastfeeding-ban-overturned-on-appeal","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avy7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/australia-news-blog/2015/jun/19/tattooed-mother-has-court-breastfeeding-ban-overturned-on-appeal","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-news-blog/2015/jun/19/tattooed-mother-has-court-breastfeeding-ban-overturned-on-appeal"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bae4bba02d9bfca3f90818f3716b568b7e1db5d7/1423_1745_2082_1249/2082.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1249,"width":2082,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The family court in Sydney has found a judge who ordered a woman not to breastfeed her child was relying on his own opinion rather than facts.

It turns out that Richard Desmond invented the Beckhams. Please adjust your records accordingly.</p> \n<p>It is the only conclusion to draw from the publisher’s complex new memoir, <a href=\"http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/editions/untitled/9781473518544\">The Real Deal: the autobiography of Britain’s most controversial media mogul</a>. Slightly less socially acceptable to read in a public place than earlier Desmond publications such as Asian Babes and Over 40s, the work showcases a man sublimely at ease in his marriage to a woman more than a couple of decades his junior – a man who has, above all, made his peace with his own mortality.</p> \n<p>Those looking for the essence of the work could do worse than a couple of sentences which feature in Richard’s description of his modest art collection: “I also have a Picasso pot which Matthew Freud gave me for my 50th birthday and which I thought was worth tuppence halfpenny. (Actually, according to Mr Picasso’s grandson – whom I know because he is our neighbour at our holiday home in Majorca – it’s worth 50,000 euros.)”</p> \n<p>OK! readers will already know Richard as a fastidious chronicler of his good works, but those coming fresh to him will enjoy the many passages with conclusions such as: “And that was the origin of the Richard Desmond Children’s Eye Centre at Moorfields.”</p> \n<p>Anyway, back to Richard’s creations, David and Victoria. <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/victoria-beckham-shares-unseen-wedding-3808395\">The Beckhams were married in 1999</a>, you may recall, and Richard paid &pound;1m to feature their wedding in his OK! magazine. This was clearly an act of commercial lunacy. But I’m getting ahead of myself – let Richard paint you a picture with words: “At the time, the Spice Girls were no longer at the height of their fame, and David Beckham was a respected footballer but not a household name.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd228dee1578a6dae6aa74454b45db4750042bb3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434631264691/29d75ef1-0e4c-4168-877d-bc3fa4a79294-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"David and Victoria Beckham\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young unknowns David and Victoria Beckham, back when they were nothing.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kent Gavin/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Well, quite. He played for a little club by the name of Manchester United – but in the words of Rob Reiner in Spinal Tap: “Don’t look for it; it’s not there any more.” Whether this Manchester United did anything even remotely noteworthy in 1999 I shall leave to the absolute football anoraks to point out. Unless you have an obsessive interest in detail, I think you can only side with Richard on the Beckhams’ sublebrity at the time.</p> \n<p>“But despite all this, I thought the couple had the potential to be media stars.” He informs David and Victoria of this. “‘You know,’ I said. ‘Diana’s gone: we need a new King and Queen of Britain …’ They looked at me blankly. ‘What I am going to do,’ I said, ‘is make you the new King and Queen.”</p> \n<p>On their wedding night, the couple stayed up till 3am with Richard deciding which pictures would be featured in OK! – a reminder of how very, very much the Beckhams wanted it all in those days. There really can be no other possible explanation for Richard and his ghastly <a href=\"http://www.northernandshell.co.uk/board\">Northern &amp; Shell henchman Martin Ellice</a> spending “almost every Friday, it seemed” at Victoria’s parents’ house, where they would all “plot and plan the next features we’d do”.</p> \n<p>Other weddings were less successful – Richard’s product placement of a Cadbury’s Snowflake bar in Anthea Turner’s wedding snaps <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2001/mar/16/marketingandpr.broadcasting\">saw her pilloried</a>, something he claims to regret.

You know the sort of thing from the movies – even when they’re fighting, they’re complimenting each other’s swordplay. To read him on his peer group is to see this echelon of the British business landscape as the locker room in Top Gun, with no one ever more than a hair trigger away from succumbing to their fight-or-fuck reflex. In fact, I can never get through any mogul’s account of his dicing and deal-making without imagining it as sex by other means. To hear Richard bang on about shafting Alan Sugar is to be only one remove from Sugar/Desmond slash fiction. I don’t know why he doesn’t open a new channel, Red Hot Boardroom, and stage porno reconstructions of this sort of thing.</p> \n<p>Of course, sometimes it does feel rather exploitative. Consider the bit where Richard explains that he was the first choice for The Apprentice when the format came to these shores. Naturally, he declined and tried to palm it off on his mate Philip Green, who also declined, and suggested Alan Sugar for sloppy thirds – “although I don’t think to this day he gives us the credit for setting the wheels in motion”. Oof! Your money is on the nightstand, Lord Sugar.</p> \n<p>In the case of Richard’s relationship with Rupert Murdoch, alas, it all feels rather more like unwanted frottage. “What you see is what you get,” says Richard of the News Corp overlord. “He is also a worthy opponent.”</p> \n<p>How very <a href=\"http://www.sherlockholmesquotes.com/images/sherlock%20holmes%20and%20professor%20moriarty.jpg\">Reichenbach Falls</a>. Although it’s arguably more accurate to think of Murdoch as the Moriarty to Richard’s Bergerac.</p> \n<p>Incidentally, have you noticed how, when people feature Murdoch in their memoirs, they literally write down every single thing he ever said to them – every wordless quasi-interaction with him – no matter how dull or irrelevant? It is as if they believe his every word is invested with the mysteries of power, which they have yet to decode, but which they offer up as evidence that He Noticed Them.</p> \n<p>Here’s Richard on the parking arrangements for a Sky do at London’s Oxo Tower: “My driver David suggested we park my Rolls-Royce so that it blocked the main entrance, obliging Murdoch to pull up further down the street and walk. Rupert sought me out at the reception later.” Course he did. “He said: ‘Ah, Mr Desmond, I keyed your car …’” Richard claims this sort of crackling billionaire repartee is entirely beyond Rupert’s younger son. “James is quite literal-minded: he doesn’t always get when it’s rock and roll.”</p> \n<p>Others get away more lightly. “I admire Branson’s work, but he and I tick differently. I’m not a techie like him,” explains Richard. “I am at heart just a drummer.”</p> \n<p>I hope whoever copy-edited this eventually saved time and just commissioned a “WAY TOO PARTRIDGE” stamp to dot down the side of every page in the first draft. Yet even that task would surely have landed them in the Richard Desmond RSI Wing at St Onan’s Hospital. “I’ve been told I’m a good listener,” concludes Richard – and if there is anyone with a better ear as to how they come across, Lost in Showbiz should like to meet them.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434647995180/20446809-352b-42e0-9599-2ce00d4e8a54-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Glenn Copus/Evening Standard/Rex","altText":"David Beckham and his fiancee Victoria Adams.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Glenn Copus/Evening Standard/Rex"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434631265429/29d75ef1-0e4c-4168-877d-bc3fa4a79294-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Young unknowns David and Victoria Beckham, back when they were nothing.

However, I don’t want internet dating to become a trolling experience. What do you think?</em></p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p><strong>Hey, you,</strong><br /></p> \n<p>Putting ‘feminist’ in your profile may well attract some trolls, but it will also likely help you save time by not chatting with men who aren’t believers in equality. So if you’re prepared to delete the occasional missive from a numbskull, go for it. People say that online dating is a numbers game, and it is to the extent that it helps you to increase the numbers of people who you may meet. But ultimately you probably just want to meet one person, so if your profile prevents you from meeting folks who you categorically don’t want to meet, that’s no bad thing. Just try and eliminate them by positive means – flagging that you’re a feminist or a Yankees fan, for example – rather than writing, say, ‘I don’t want to meet any misogynist assholes’, which may make non-misogynists think you sound a bit judgmental.</p> \n<p><strong><em>Dear Eva,</em></strong></p> \n<p><em>What’s with the photos of men posing with drugged tigers in their Tinder pictures? Do they think it’s attractive or is it an internet meme? Am I writing them off when they’re actually being really funny?</em></p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p><strong>Hey, you,</strong></p> \n<p>I think these men think it’s attractive. Usually they will have paid quite a lot of money while on an exotic vacation to pose next to the drugged tiger. </p> \n<p>It seems the men (and women) who post these photos believe that it signifies that they are well-travelled and adventurous. I think it signifies that they are unkind to tigers. </p> \n<p>That said, the most egregious example of this that I have ever witnessed is a couple who posted an engagement photo of themselves kissing while also patting a passed-out lion, so I guess sometimes it really is just a matter of finding someone who shares your interests.</p> \n<p><strong><em>Dear Eva,<br /></em></strong></p> \n<p><em>I’ve had one Tinder date and thought it went really well. I forgot to ask for her number, but she agreed to meet again. I thanked her over Tinder, and she replied that evening, but since then things have gotten tricky.</em></p> \n<p><em>She went away a few days after our date, and I didn’t want to push things until she got back. So, I sent three messages: one with my number in case she wants it, one asking how she’s doing, and another after she got back to ask if she wanted to meet up again. She hasn’t replied. Tinder shows she hasn’t been active for a few days, so maybe that’s not so odd? I’m concerned about being overbearing. Do you think I’m communicating too much?</em></p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p><strong>Hey, you,</strong></p> \n<p>I don’t think you’re being overbearing, per se, but I do think you’re being over-enthusiastic. I promise: if a person wants to be in touch with you, they will get in touch. If you don’t hear from them, it’s unlikely to be because they broke their phone or all of their fingers. Rule of thumb for online dating and for regular dating and life in general: get in touch once, and if you don’t hear back, presume that the person is not interested (an exception: if you’ve slept with them, and they’ve gone silent, you’re also allowed to understand that they are ill-mannered, in which case you don’t want to see them again anyway!)</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/12/1423750172137/8482d09f-2079-4ce7-a9ba-f5e4e8723902-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Celine Loup","altText":"swipe right","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Celine Loup"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T14:50:41Z","lastModified":"2015-06-18T14:59:06Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":215,"contributors":[{"name":"Eva","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/12/1423746169115/Eva-Anonymous.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/eva"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Feminism","Tinder","Online dating","Life and style","Dating","Relationships","Women","Apps"],"tags":[{"id":"world/feminism","webTitle":"Feminism"},{"id":"technology/tinder","webTitle":"Tinder"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/online-dating","webTitle":"Online dating"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/dating","webTitle":"Dating"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/relationships","webTitle":"Relationships"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"technology/apps","webTitle":"Apps"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Eva","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/eva"}}],"series":{"title":"Swipe right - online dating for the real world","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/swipe-right"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/18/ask-eva-online-dating-feminist","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49qf9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/18/ask-eva-online-dating-feminist","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/18/ask-eva-online-dating-feminist"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/12/1423750172137/8482d09f-2079-4ce7-a9ba-f5e4e8723902-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Swipe right: helping you navigate the traps of online dating.

It is most closely associated with Liguria, in the north-west of the country, where it bears little resemblance to the soft, finely textured stuff sold in many British supermarkets. Fortunately for fans of the authentic product’s rich, chewy texture and crisp, salty crust, it’s very easy to make at home.</p> \n<h2>The flour</h2> \n<p>Your choice of flour depends very much on what kind of focaccia you’re after. Using plain flour, as in <a href=\"http://www.cookstr.com/recipes/focaccia-with-onions-genoese-style\">Marcella Hazan’s Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking</a>, or even finer “tipo 00” flour as in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/River-Cafe-Classic-Italian-Cookbook/dp/0718153499\">The River Cafe Classic Italian Cookbook</a>, will give you a softer, more tender crumb; while <a href=\"http://lovinghomemade.com/2013/04/25/homemade-focaccia-great-for-sharing/\">Richard Bertinet’s mixture</a> of strong bread flour and coarse semolina in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dough-Richard-Bertinet/dp/1856267628\">his book Dough</a> creates a more robust, chewy texture.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d8ac8676de9148b327d62dcf87d26d2aace0523\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543585407/cd870eee-fd35-4c74-b613-4aceaec86670-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Marcella Hazan's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcella Hazan’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"http://kitcheninthesand.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/basic-focaccia-locatellis-foolproof.html\">Giorgio Locatelli</a>’s book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Made-Italy-Stories-Giorgio-Locatelli/dp/1841157023\">Made in Italy explains</a> that, in his restaurant, they use “Italian extra-strong flour, which has a good elasticity and the power to absorb water well”. As it isn’t widely available in this country, he recommends using equal parts strong bread flour and 00 for a similar result, and I agree – his loaf does have a pleasingly springy texture without being quite as stiff as those that use strong flour alone.</p> \n<p>Angela Hartnett* is among that number, but her recipe begins with a <em>biga</em>, or starter, which requires a 24-hour fermentation before use. Her bread has a wonderful chewiness and excellent flavour – almost more like a ciabatta than the focaccia I’m used to – but I’m looking for a loaf that can be made fairly quickly and easily, which rules this step out.

If you’d like to use fresh yeast instead of the fast-acting variety that I use, substitute 25g, or 12g of ordinary dried yeast, made up as per packet instructions.</p> \n<h2>The liquid</h2> \n<p>All focaccia contains olive oil, from a mere 2 tbsp in Hazan’s recipe to 150ml in the River Cafe version. As well as keeping the dough moist, the oil gives the bread its rich flavour, but I suspect the large quantity is also responsible for the slightly soft crust of the River Cafe loaf, so I’m going to reduce the amount slightly.</p> \n<p>The principal liquid, however – as in any bread – is water, and lots of it; Hartnett warns the novice baker not to be afraid of adding too much: “It can never be too wet – just trust me on this – it will come together. Too much flour and you end up with something resembling a doorstop.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84c867fbcf82fa4cc4a4ec431613e47da2bd57a2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543485352/3205d26b-b56a-43ce-baa6-0f94c0bb365f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The River Cafe's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The River Cafe’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She’s right. The drier doughs are indeed denser and heavier, and it’s almost safest – given the difficulties of precision when it comes to hydration, which depends on any number of things from the flour you use to the humidity of the day you bake – to be as vague as the River Cafe, which simply instructs one to add enough water to make a “very soft and pliable dough”. Thus the figure below should simply be taken as a guide. As in Hazan’s recipe, add the liquid in stages until you have a soft but workable dough.</p> \n<h2>The method</h2> \n<p>Perhaps it’s the temperature of my kitchen in comparison to that of a professional one, but I don’t find the short rising time in Locatelli’s recipe sufficient to allow the dough to double in size (which is another argument for using the instructions below as a guideline only – exactly how long everything takes will depend on the circumstances in which you make it), and making sure the dough has time to rise properly will ensure a structurally satisfactory result with plenty of air pockets.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d86e3f2e5d7e4ee81b71e676c3d9df5fd3f9f3dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543696856/ab2dd7f2-bafc-43e2-ac1d-3ebd199579d8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Giorgio Locatelli's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giorgio Locatelli’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s easiest to knead wet doughs like this in a food mixer, but if you don’t have one, oil your work surface rather than flouring it, so that you don’t add any more dry ingredients to the mix.</p> \n<p>That said, Locatelli’s bread boasts the best examples of those “dimples” that are such a characteristic feature of the focaccia – I think because his are made directly before baking, as opposed to before the second proof.</p> \n<h2>The baking</h2> \n<p>As with all breads, a very hot oven gives the best results – and baking it on a hot pizza stone or sheet, as Hartnett and Hazan suggest, will give your bread a pleasingly crisp bottom. Spraying a little water into the hot oven to create steam, as the former also recommends, will also help to create a decent crust.</p> \n<h2>The brine</h2> \n<p>Locatelli and others pour a mixture of oil, water and salt on top of their loaves before baking, which, as the River Cafe observes, may seem strange “but the water helps to keep the dough soft and moist in some of the grooves”. Be careful not to overdo it, though, or the loaf won’t brown on top. And don’t feel the need to overload it with salt, either: a mere teaspoon should be quite sufficient given how much there is in the dough.</p> \n<p>Do feel free to add herbs (rosemary sprigs are nice), olives, tomatoes, and so on. And, if you’re feeling really adventurous, the River Cafe even does a dessert version with black grapes and fennel seeds. Personally, I’d draw the line at <a href=\"http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/30955/salted-caramel-and-apple-focaccia\">this salted-caramel version</a>, but each to their own.</p> \n<h2>The perfect focaccia</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d20f84446ee76b10f6d30fda6acca7d93c3ea95b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543810111/93d60cdd-269b-442c-a461-64fb77ae19dc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake's perfect focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake’s perfect focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong><em>(Makes one large loaf)</em></strong></p> \n<p><strong>375g strong white bread flour</strong><br /><strong>375g “tipo 00” flour (sometimes sold as pasta flour)</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp fine sea salt</strong><br /><strong>8g active dry yeast</strong><br /><strong>130ml extra-virgin olive oil (100ml for the dough; 30ml for the topping, mixed with 30ml water and 1 tsp salt flakes)</strong><br /><strong>Water</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp coarse semolina or cornmeal (optional)</strong></p> \n<p>Put the flours in a large mixing bowl with the salt and yeast. Whisk well to combine, then make a hole in the middle and add 100ml olive oil, plus 300ml water. Stir together and add more water (I used about 100ml more) until you have a very soft, but not too sticky, dough.</p> \n<p>Knead until soft and elastic; in a food mixer (preferable) on a medium-slow speed for about 7 minutes, or by hand on a lightly oiled work surface for 10-12 minutes. Put the dough on a lightly oiled rimless baking sheet and leave to rise in a draught-free place for 60-90 minutes until roughly doubled in size.</p> \n<p>Knock back the dough, and lightly dust the baking tray with the semolina, if using. Gently press the dough out with your fingers to fit the baking tray. Brush with olive oil and leave to rise again for about another hour, or until doubled in size again. When this time has nearly elapsed, heat the oven to 220C and put a pizza stone or baking tray in there to heat up. If you have a water spray, ready it.</p> \n<p>Whisk together the remaining 30ml olive oil with 30ml water until emulsified. Transfer the dough to you pizza stone or baking tray and poke dimples into the surface of the focaccia with your fingertips. Pour the oil-and-water mixture on top and scatter with the salt flakes, then place in the oven and squirt a little water into the base of the oven. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until golden on top – keep an eye on it. The focaccia is best eaten warm.</p> \n<p><strong>Focaccia – is it the king of Italian breads, or do you prefer ciabatta, </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farinata\"><strong><em>farinata</em></strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href=\"http://www.msn.com/en-us/foodanddrink/recipes/carta-da-musica-%E2%80%9Cmusic-paper%E2%80%9D-bread/fd-be766c3f-4f53-51e0-8476-20f68b493fb0\"><strong><em>carta da musica</em></strong></a><strong>?
