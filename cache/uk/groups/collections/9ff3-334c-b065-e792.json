When my mum suggested I move to Indonesia with her, I thought, “Why not?” and started making preparations. But as the departure date got closer, I realised how much I was going to miss the UK. I decided I’d spend some time touring the country on my bike with Nero, my five-year-old collie. I sold my car, gave away my furniture, quit my flat, bought panniers for my bike and dragged my tent and sleeping bag out from under the stairs. By the end of the week, I was on my way, Nero trotting beside me.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7622d31197790b984752085a265a4fc99693334f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435228610385/b2c7829a-1917-463d-a0ae-c62e944f1e4b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The pair have travelled the length and breadth of the UK on a specially adapted bike.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pair have travelled the length and breadth of the UK on a specially adapted bike.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SWNS.com</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>My plan was to cycle round the UK in about seven weeks. But a fortnight in, I realised there was no need for me to go fast – I just needed to appreciate what was around me. It was tough going sometimes, but I learned how keen people are to help. Most nights we camped on farmland or in parks (even in a castle once) but we also met people who were happy to put us up for the night. Travelling with a dog, you make friends wherever you go. Very early on, Nero burned his paws on hot tarmac and took to riding on top of my bags; an ironmonger in Whitby welded a special shelf on to my bike for him to sit on.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/bike-blog/2015/feb/18/the-rise-of-cycle-touring-from-crazy-to-cool\">The rise of cycle touring – from crazy to cool</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I’ve seen and done much more than I expected. The west coast of Scotland was particularly thrilling – I learned to sail and fish, I caught wild mackerel for breakfast and saw sea eagles with two-metre wingspans.

This is what I was born to do.”</p> \n<p>My only outgoings are food for me and Nero, about &pound;300 a month.

She should know, having confined herself to dignified parts in pantomimes and I’m a Celebrity …</p>","byline":"Marina Hyde","body":"<p>“I think it’s disgusting. MPs’ wives should behave with dignity.” Well, someone had to say it – and thank heavens it was Christine Hamilton.</p> \n<p>Christine has broken her silence on Karen Danczuk, estranged missus of Rochdale MP Simon, and the result may be judged cogent even by Christine’s exacting standards. Karen’s habit of posting pneumatic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karendanczuk\">selfies</a> every 28 seconds has distressed Mrs Neil Hamilton, who hails from an era of decorum we may now have lost for ever.</p> \n<p>For verily, what was not to love about the Hamiltons: him with his little bow tie, looking cheekily up at her while she admonished him. It was as if some evil vaudevillian – a vaudevillain? – had taken a ventriloquist act called Nanny and Master Mostyn and given it flesh. Then got it elected to parliament.</p> \n<p>Anyway, I need hardly remind you that those days are now gone, particularly after Neil removed himself from the Ukip MPs’ selection process last December, following <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/dec/10/neil-hamilton-withdraws-basildon-south-ukip-expenses-claim-controversy\">some unpleasantness about his expenses</a>. That coming so close to Christmas, the Hammies were prevented from treading the boards last year, but anyone who saw <a href=\"http://www.northamptonchron.co.uk/what-s-on/theatre/panto-fun-from-neil-and-christine-hamilton-in-cinderella-at-kettering-1-3350035\">their turn in Cinderella in Kettering</a> will know that they would make an excellent booking for any pantomime short of a horse. And with rider demands amounting to merely a bottle of Cab Sav and being billed above any puppets, they represent decent value compared with some of the more diva-ish graduates of the cash-for-questions inquiry. A bid to bring Mohamed Al Fayed to Snow White in Bournemouth fell apart over the latter’s negotiating behaviour.</p> \n<p>At present, however, it is Karen’s performing engagements that are troubling Christine, though only the churlish would detect a hint of jealousy. “I’ve actually met her and thought she was awful, parading her breasts round everywhere,” Christine tells the Daily Mail. “The next thing you know she will be on Celebrity Big Brother.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a54cc2d29b454af89723104f227d498d2bb23d7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436465685304/966b3cee-c268-4dfc-af40-27a6b3318ebe-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Christine Hamilton, on I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here, shows how a dignified wife should behave.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Hamilton, on I’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here, shows how a dignified wife should behave.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If that set an alarm bell ringing in your head, there follows a crash course in the moral and intellectual chasms between certain reality formats.</p> \n<p>“OK,” concedes Christine, “I did I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, but that was different. It had a purpose.”</p> \n<p>God, yes. Those kangaroo bumholes don’t eat themselves. “I’ve been offered a fortune to do Big Brother and turned it down five times,” continues Christine, with the dignity only someone who has recreated the potter’s wheel scene from Ghost can muster.</p> \n<p>As it goes, it seems Karen is indeed piquing the interests of the Celeb BB bookers – and her enthusiastic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheSunTVBiz/status/619037391307866112\">retweeting</a> of stories to this effect suggest she would certainly be open to offers. “Karen would be an expensive guest,” a “telly source” claims to the Sun, “but she will be worth it because she is box office”.</p> \n<p>Has third-generation reality TV found its Meryl? Only time will show. For now, there will be those who suspect that Christine is beginning to feel a touch of the Norma Desmonds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbf26e901ee9570ce143466a09212f7067a11782\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436465970043/537b4e78-6345-4aa6-ae2b-18d47259688e-460x309.jpeg\" alt=\"Most wifely … Christine Hamilton and husband Neil recreate the potter’s wheel scene from Ghost.\" width=\"460\" height=\"309\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Most wifely … Christine Hamilton and husband Neil recreate the potter’s wheel scene from Ghost.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris O'Donovan/Muscular Dystrophy/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“People say the Danczuks are fun and the new Hamiltons,” she laments to the Mail, with the air of someone one island format short of a glorious comeback, “but I don’t think so. I met her at a radio studio where we were discussing MPs’ wives and it was all ‘me, me, me’.”</p> \n<p>Mmm. Like a heck of a lot of life, this whole business reminds me of a scene from Showgirls, when the Gina Gershon stripper queen has been dethroned by a stairway fall caused by a young upstart played by Elizabeth Berkley. But far from being bitter about it all, Gina is philosophical, telling Elizabeth: “There’s always someone younger and hungrier coming down the stairs after you.”</p> \n<p>Lost in Showbiz implores Christine to consider that valuable lesson from this world-cinema classic. Though not, for the love of God, to recreate any scenes from it.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436465472100/85bfb192-1667-440a-ad0b-e381671cd70d-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Karen Danczuk has a willing adviser in Christine Hamilton.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436465685851/966b3cee-c268-4dfc-af40-27a6b3318ebe-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Christine Hamilton, on I’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here, shows how a dignified wife should behave.

You really reap the benefits though, with a gorgeously comfy bounce that all but hides the tarmac and concrete below. However, they feel noticeably heavier than the (already sturdy) Brooks Glycerins I’d been wearing this spring, and there is also the added leg lift you need in order not to catch the low sole on kerbs.

It worked perfectly and it was hugely freeing to not be wearing a chest strap, nor continually looking at my watch or phone to check stats. It synched with music already on my system, as well as having the option to stream shared playlists. I could simply look ahead and run, only occasionally nudged if an earbud needed slightly adjusting.

These are fantastic compression tights, but claim to do significantly more. The packaging speaks effusively of “the first system that can put the positive effect of fascia (connective tissue) activation to good use in a textile”. This system is a strip of rubber nodules lining the front of the thigh and along the iliotibial band to the side, as well as the top of the hip, kneading the skin and fascia as you run. They don’t quite hurt, but certainly make you very mindful of your stride as you’re very aware of them poking you. But I’m not sure they did anything more than treat the same areas to what 20 minutes on a decent foam roller during EastEnders would have. The fabric is fantastic quality and they looked great on, but I can’t imagine recommending them to anyone. </p> \n<h2>TECHNOGYM MYRUN</h2> \n<p>&pound;2,650; <a href=\"http://www.technogym.com/gb/treadmill-myrun-not-foldable.html\">technogym.com</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b79f77f974dc0bf34f773e82c1454f35bd45666\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436449499487/1fe8e580-6fde-46d5-87eb-efb1ddf2008f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Technogym Myrun\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> A treadmill that soon becomes part of the furniture.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If you’re not in a position to run outdoors, this is a luxury setup.

It synchs with your heart rate monitor and your music and amends speed and elevation much faster than any gym equipment I’ve used. But I struggled with boredom over more than a couple of miles, ending up streaming TV shows rather than monitoring the beautifully designed app. And I question the point in perfecting a treadmill stride when so much of running technique relies on negotiating uneven ground or other runners. </p> \n<h2><br />ADIDAS CLIMACHILL TEE</h2> \n<p>&pound;30; <a href=\"http://www.adidas.co.uk/uncontrol-climachill-tee/AB6463.html\">adidas.co.uk</a><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"818a99ec3795ca7544f3753cae93769498c6da1a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436449549711/83bf6167-8918-4b8e-8db6-745a5bf86885-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\" Aluminium dots cool you down\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> The shirt’s aluminium dots cool you down.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This looks like a nice if unexceptional running top, but works significantly better than I anticipated. Worn for a few regular runs I was convinced it was merely sweat and sea breeze making me feel cool, but I took it for a sticky session of hill repeats with my local running club and was raving about it after 45 minutes. The Climachill technology is a combination of mesh-like fabric and - crucially - about 100 small aluminium dots scattered across the top of your back and 16 more under each arm. It feels unnerving at first, but by conducting heat away from the body they create the sensation of having splashed the last few sips of your water bottle down your back, while actually keeping you dry. A remarkable effect for a great price. I’m entirely converted for summer running, especially in still weather. </p> \n<h2><br />MOOV PERSONAL FITNESS COACH</h2> \n<p>&pound;50; <a href=\"https://www.moov.cc/order\">moov.cc</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbceabeff5336b3919f000ba4646bd75d86c613d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436449595184/4a06ff01-64f8-4e52-a532-83675ebc3a5e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alex, testing running gadgets for TECHalexandra heminsley\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> The Moov and Hoka trainers.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Moov is a relatively new device, originally a startup, and struck me as best for the new or nervous runner. A circular, sensor clicks into either an ankle or wrist strap. Worn on the ankle for running, it measures not just speed, elevation and distance, but also cadence (steps per minute), and the impact of your step on the ground - useful for avoiding injury. For beginners, it can be set to “brisk walking” but allows for sprint intervals for runners in more serious training. Instructions and feedback are provided via audio (you’ll need your own earphones), and after exercise it displayslovely clear data on your phone screen. The device can be worn on the wrist for swimming, and data is stored centrally so you can measure all your exercise across the week: perfect for the injured or resting runner.It also synched with Apple’s Health app. Impressive. </p> \n<p><em>Alexandra Heminsley is the author of </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/running-like-a-girl.html\"><em>Running Like a Girl</em></a><em> (Windmill Books)</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436449243766/c069f732-e63b-4a2b-9a9c-44db14ff33db-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Karen Robinson for the Observer","altText":"Alexandra Heminsley.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436449322644/697417fd-d867-4334-9d85-4748a9c075c9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" Headphones which help you run to the beat.

I was so blas&eacute;, I went out that night and forgot all about it'","byline":"Annie McCarthy","body":"<p>I was working in the wardrobe department on a&nbsp;television series in Sydney. The pressure was intense, but it was exciting.</p>\n<p>Around halfway through the shoot, I was making an intricate Victorian costume for one of the lead actresses. I remember the pale green taffeta of the gown as I sat at the sewing machine, struggling with&nbsp;all the pleats and ribbons that had to look perfect for the screen. As&nbsp;always, the most convenient place to put the pin I was using was in my mouth. Somehow, one minute it was clenched between my teeth and the next it was gone.</p>\n<p>I didn't feel a thing. I turned around to a co-worker and said, &quot;I&nbsp;just swallowed a pin.&quot; She stopped what she was doing and asked if I was OK. &quot;I think so,&quot; I said. One of the girls called emergency services. Their advice was to eat a&nbsp;cotton wool sandwich which would, they said, coat the pin on its way down the digestive tract. I&nbsp;did this and we all had a good laugh about how revolting it was, and then I thought nothing more about it.</p>\n<p>I spent the rest of the day assuming the pin would eventually find its way out. I was so blas&eacute;, I&nbsp;went out that night and forgot all about it. The next day when I got to work, the&nbsp;costume designer told me that&nbsp;the production department had heard what had happened and were insisting I went for an x-ray. I&nbsp;remember thinking this was a bit nannyish, but I drove to a nearby radiology clinic and went straight into x-ray. While I was waiting for the results, the radiologist came back ashen-faced: &quot;You didn't swallow it – you inhaled it. It's&nbsp;in your right lung. You need to&nbsp;go to the hospital. Now!&quot;</p>\n<p>The drive to hospital was a blur. I&nbsp;called my boyfriend and he was at the hospital to help me, rather shakily, fill in the forms. He signed the one that released them from responsibility should I die. I was taken straight into surgery and given a bronchoscopy. When I came round from the general anaesthetic, the surgeon said that the procedure had been unsuccessful and had only pushed the pin farther in. I had to spend the next two days on an antibiotic drip before a specialist surgeon was free to operate.</p>\n<p>The night before the operation, I&nbsp;was laughing with visitors, surrounded by flowers and get-well cards. I had also received a&nbsp;thoughtful present from the costume department, a block of wood with pins hammered into it and &quot;Annie can swallow a pin&quot; engraved on to the wood. The whole thing was a joke to everyone.</p>\n<p>That is, it was until the surgeon operating on me the next day arrived at my bedside. He explained that the operation involved going in&nbsp;through my back between the ribs, possibly even breaking the ribs, and then removing up to a quarter of the lung tissue around the pin. All&nbsp;the laughter stopped right there, but I still felt calm; it was a&nbsp;surreal moment, as if I was starring in a&nbsp;hospital soap opera.</p>\n<p>I managed to sleep that night, but&nbsp;in the hours leading up to the operation reality kicked in and I&nbsp;began to feel really nervous. I&nbsp;hadn't let myself think of any negative possibilities until then. The&nbsp;pre-op pethidine was a welcome relief from my creeping fear.</p>\n<p>The operation was a success, and the surgeon managed to remove the pin without taking too much of my lung with it. I stayed in hospital for a&nbsp;week while they drained off the gunk my body had provided to fight the invader. There was a lot of pain and discomfort from needing to sleep and rest on my left side.</p>\n<p>At a follow-up appointment a few weeks later, the surgeon told me how lucky I was to have had the x-ray when I did. He explained that if I had left it any longer, it could have meant either puncturing the lung, poisoning or worse.</p>\n<p>I was off work for a month, had trouble using my right arm and lost sensation in my right breast, which has never recovered to this day – I&nbsp;swallowed the pin in 1985. Yet I did feel lucky. When I eventually got back to work, I had a very dubious celebrity status.</p>\n<p>I still have the pearl-headed culprit in a container provided by the hospital. And I now shriek if I&nbsp;ever see anyone with a pin in their mouth – I have a six-inch scar on my back to remind me that, no matter how silly the action, the ramifications can be huge.</p>\n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Do you have an experience to share?

I’d be very happy with 20 messages a week but my problem is with the quality of the men who message me: they are not close enough to my age (around 10 years younger or over 10 years older), they have very little conversation – usually limited to ‘Hi what’s up’ – and then they they disappear. People have suggested that I look at dating men in their mid 40s but I feel this is too old for me.</em></p> \n<p><em>(Also, </em><em>I should say that I have a skin allergy which means that I can’t wear makeup and I can’t tart myself up for my profile. </em><em>I hate the camera. I am really awkward and generally don’t take good photos.)</em></p> \n<p><em>If I do eventually meet a man, one of the following usually happens: we don’t click; he asks me back to his on the first date, I refuse and he disappears; and then there is the occasional man who I go on three dates with (I know chemistry takes a while to develop and I can’t afford to be fussy) but I don’t feel the chemistry.</em></p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Hey, you.</p> \n<p>Some years ago an elderly relative of mine discovered the existence of online dating – I guess she read about it in the newspaper or something. Worried, as ever, about my failure to find a husband, she suggested it: ‘Eva,’ she said, ‘I know that you don’t have a boyfriend, but have you tried this online dating?’ At the time, of course, I’d been dating online on and off for at least a couple years. ‘Yes,’ I said, smiling to conceal my gritted teeth, ‘I have tried it.’ ‘Oh,’ said my elderly relative, with unconcealed disappointment, ‘I mean, I have heard that it is an effective way to meet single men, but perhaps not always.’ </p> \n<p>Rarely have I felt like such a failure: here was this system that, in the eyes of my relative, had been designed explicitly for difficult single women like me, and yet I persisted in turning up at family weddings without a plus one. There must be something <em>really </em>wrong with me if even that was not successful.</p> \n<p>You enumerate the reasons that online dating hasn’t worked for you so far – perhaps genuine reasons, perhaps reasons that are related more to your own perception rather than reality (you point out that you are a mature student, but a half-full glass kind person will see that as brave and inspiring, rather than a lack of career direction). Regardless, you are stating a strong argument about why you think online dating is not for you, and to this I say: that is more than fine. As I wrote in my first column, meeting people through dating websites and apps is going to feel pretty grim for you and anyone you go on a date with if your heart’s not in it. Society may tell you that going online is the primary route that people use to meet partners in these modern times, but you’re under no obligation.</p> \n<p>You’re also not obligated to make an argument as to why you’re giving online dating a miss: most of the points that you make here point to <em>you</em> being the reason that you feel haven’t been successful. This is incorrect. You are not the problem. The problem is that it’s often hard to fall in love.</p> \n<p>Sometimes I also wonder if I have an intrinsic flaw that has caused me to be single. What measures could I take to improve myself? Elocution lessons? Better eyeliner application? Should I tell fewer jokes or color my hair or stop writing a column about online dating in the Guardian? But here’s what I know in my heart of hearts: there’s nothing to fix. No magic solution. I just haven’t met the right person. The only thing I can do is stay open to meeting new people. Doing it online may feel efficient compared to trying to force a supermarket aisle meet-cute. But it’s by no means necessary. So don’t feel you need to keep explaining your choice to date online or not – to yourself or to anyone else. Not even well-meaning elderly relatives.</p> \n<p>Love,</p> \n<p>Eva </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/18/1424288200250/8482d09f-2079-4ce7-a9ba-f5e4e8723902-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Celine Loup","altText":"Swipe right","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Celine Loup"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T16:00:32Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T16:13:27Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":26,"contributors":[{"name":"Eva","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/12/1423746169115/Eva-Anonymous.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/eva"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Online dating","Life and style","Dating","Sex"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/online-dating","webTitle":"Online dating"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/dating","webTitle":"Dating"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/sex","webTitle":"Sex"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Eva","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/eva"}}],"series":{"title":"Swipe right - online dating for the real world","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/swipe-right"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/09/online-dating-quit-advice","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agef","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/09/online-dating-quit-advice","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/09/online-dating-quit-advice"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/18/1424288200250/8482d09f-2079-4ce7-a9ba-f5e4e8723902-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Swipe right: online dating for the real world.
