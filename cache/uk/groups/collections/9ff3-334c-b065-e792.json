However, in your situation, it is probably best for you to take responsibility solely for your own pleasure, and encourage him to do the same. Wanting increased pleasure for him is understandable, but might be experienced as pressure to have sex your way, rather than his. You could, however, try to get him to give you precise feedback as you pleasure him manually or orally – as long as it doesn’t become uncomfortable for him. Keep checking – “Do you want me to continue, or shall we switch to something else?”</p> \n<p>I recommend you first try eliciting feedback from him with erotic caresses to non-genital parts of each other. You could model the kind of detailed feedback you want from him first, as he tries different kinds of strokes and touches on you. This is a good way to learn about each others’ responses. Eventually – when there is a high level of relaxation, communication and non-goal-oriented desire between you – you could progress to genital stimulation.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</em></p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to </em><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\"><em>private.lives@theguardian.com</em></a><em> (please don’t send attachments).</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435941668241/Young-man-sleeping-in-bed-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'I’m losing interest because I can’t enjoy his pleasure' (posed by models).

Deborah Orr toasts the joys of the lunchtime tipple <br /></p>","byline":"Deborah Orr","body":"<p>Like smoking on planes and transporting toddlers in cars without tying them up first, a little inebriation to break up a working day is one of those things that in a generation has moved from normal to, “Oh my God, can you believe we ever did that?”</p> \n<p>Obviously, boozy lunches aren’t actually illegal. But you, the lunchtime drinker, know that when a daytime dining companion suggests ordering a bottle of wine, agreement is conspiracy. Or a test you’re about to fail. You also know, when a dining companion says, “Just water for me!” that you really could and should have done whatever you’re about to do over the phone. Or you think you do, anyway.</p> \n<p>The truth is that drinking at lunchtime is stupid and irresponsible. That’s what makes it such fun. As for having just one or two glasses, the essential paradox of alcohol is that the less you imbibe, the more you feel its effects. After one glass (feel free to adjust for personal tolerances, you dipso), one is aware that one is more relaxed than optimum cut-throat marketplace sharpness demands. After two, one is in longing-for-an-afternoon-nap territory. After three, one is top of the world, thrumming with confidence, one’s excellent judgment assuring one that another glass won’t do any harm <em>at all</em>.</p> \n<p>After which anything can happen, as long as it’s bad. Alcohol is a gateway drug, paving the way for more alcohol. This has been known to the west since the ancient Greeks so sensibly <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/topic/Dionysus\">formalised the ritual of binge-drinking into a form of worship.</a></p> \n<p>The high point of my own lunchtime drinking life came about 10 years ago, when lunch with a friend was brought to an end by kindly waiters gently explaining that, much as it pained them, they really needed our table because dinner service was in full swing. Obviously, this was confusing for us. Holding one of our own fingers in front of our own noses was confusing for us. Somehow, we had managed to have lunch for seven and a half brief hours.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Drinking at lunchtime is stupid and irresponsible. That's what makes it such fun</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>We had been celebrating. Not at first, but after ordering our first bottle of wine (at that point, as we’d imagined, our only bottle of wine), we decided it was corked. Summoning the waiter, we told him of our verdict. A single sip and he confirmed that we were very much correct, confiding also that we were discerning women of the world and a pleasure to serve, because most of the world’s idiots glugged away at corked wine without the smallest suspicion that what they were drinking was not delicious, but rank.</p> \n<p>Well, he didn’t actually say that. We said that. We were so pleased with ourselves for detecting corked wine that we had a few more goes, to check that our new superpower was not a fluke. A sensible waiter would have given us the corked wine again, as bottle three. But our waiter didn’t, because he adored us. OK, I made that up, too.</p> \n<p>The next day – realistically, it was probably two or three days later – I told a hard-drinking colleague of our Great Feat. “Wow!” he said. “So who else was there?”</p> \n<p>“Just us.”</p> \n<p>“Eh? What on Earth did you two find to talk about for seven and a half bloody hours?”</p> \n<p>In fact, both freelance journalists and the mothers of small children, we’d talked first about how we could rearrange our working day to accommodate an extra hour or so of lunch, and next about how we could rearrange our picking- up-the-kids-from-school day to accommodate another extra hour or so of lunch. We then had to have these conversations again the next day, over the phone, because of our terrible hangovers. Clearly, some corked wine had indeed crept into the proceedings. There is no other explanation.</p> \n<p>It’s pretty dreadful, screwing up your work for the sake of a drink. It’s really awful, screwing up your responsibilities to your children for the sake of a drink. I’m not proud. Except I made that up, too. I am proud. I regret nothing. It was a golden afternoon. We may not have been officially worshipping gods, but for one day, we were both Ferris Bueller and we both had a day off. The memory still gladdens my heart. That’s how much I needed a day off.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We were so pleased with ourselves for detecting corked wine that we had a few more goes</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I understand that this is a tale of privileged women who have the luxury of being able to behave badly without suffering too many consequences, but there was a time when this sort of behaviour was a little more universal. Outside the gates of Ravenscraig, the huge steelworks that dominated my home town, Motherwell, was a pub called the Cleekim Inn. It was a bare-faced acknowledgment that a drink before your shift began could turn into a few drinks, and that the solution was to get a workmate to punch your card for you.</p> \n<p>Some of the men were alcoholics, and abused this unofficial system routinely. You could argue that this was a particularly egregious example of how liberty-taking was rife in nationalised industries. Except that I look at our denationalised age and think about how much better it was for all concerned, especially their wives and children, that these men had a wage, security and a place to go and hide, a place to lose themselves that wasn’t home or the dole office.</p> \n<p>Drinking when you should be working was a bit of a gesture of defiance back then, and it’s a gesture of defiance so huge now that it’s a dying tradition. Young people now drink less, it’s said, than for many generations. They’re more sensible, it’s said, more focused. I think, though, that they’re just more fearful. Work, money, success, security: most of us live in fear of not achieving them or not retaining them. Moderation in all things, except dedication to good sense and duty, is the order of the day. One drink at lunch is rebellion. Two is sedition. Three is revolution. The boozy lunch may be rare now, but when a boozy lunch does come along, it’s just <em>wonderful</em>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/15ec9e5865f0910523aab921192b55bb6554c531/0_0_4783_2869/4783.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2869,"width":4783,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty Images","altText":"Drinking wine","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T10:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T10:46:50Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":403,"contributors":[{"name":"Deborah Orr","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/8/20/1408550842728/Deborah-Orr-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/deborah-orr"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Deborah Orr","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/deborah-orr"}}],"series":{"title":"Summer food and drink special 2015: Let's do lunch","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/summer-food-and-drink-special-2015-let-s-do-lunch"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/in-praise-of-lunchtime-drinking","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a98c","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/in-praise-of-lunchtime-drinking","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/in-praise-of-lunchtime-drinking"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/15ec9e5865f0910523aab921192b55bb6554c531/0_0_4783_2869/4783.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2869,"width":4783,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"In praise of lunchtime drinking: ‘The essential paradox of alcohol is that the less you imbibe, the more you feel its effects.’ Photograph: Getty Images","credit":"Getty Images","altText":"Drinking wine","cleanCaption":"In praise of lunchtime drinking: ‘The essential paradox of alcohol is that the less you imbibe, the more you feel its effects.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty Images"}},"importance":5,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/15ec9e5865f0910523aab921192b55bb6554c531/0_0_4783_2869/4783.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2869,"width":4783,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty Images","altText":"Drinking wine","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty Images"}}]},{"title":"Is Reddit’s Ellen Pao just too radical for Silicon Valley’s unequal terrain?","rawTitle":"Is Reddit’s Ellen Pao just too radical for Silicon Valley’s unequal terrain?","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jul/06/reddit-ellen-pao-feminist-mysogyny-discrimination-inequality","title":"Is Reddit’s Ellen Pao just too radical for Silicon Valley’s unequal terrain?","trailText":"An online petition to oust the CEO gained over 100,000 signatures this weekend.

Ellen Pao, chief executive of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/technology/reddit\" title=\"\">Reddit</a>, the social news forum that bills itself as the front page of the internet (but is increasingly known for misogyny and porn), is under fire again. This time it follows the sudden departure of a popular employee at the site, which prompted volunteer moderators<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jul/03/reddit-ama-victoria-taylor-subforums-shut-down-protest-sacking\" title=\"\"> to shut down hundreds of communities – sorry, subreddits – in protest</a>. Reddit has been thrown into chaos and, although <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jul/04/reddit-subforums-ellen-pao-explains\" title=\"\">Pao has apologised for “letting down” users</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/ellen-k-pao-step-down-as-ceo-of-reddit-inc\" title=\"\">petition calling for her removal</a> – set up earlier this year by members unhappy at the company’s attempts to ban communities for harassing behaviour – has gained more than 100,000 signatures over the weekend.</p> \n<p>Why is the world so angry with Pao? Could it be because she is a woman in a position of power or is it infinitely more complicated? It goes back to the sex discrimination lawsuit that Pao brought against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, Caufield and Byers in March. The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/13/ellen-pao-gender-lawsuit-silicon-valley\" title=\"\">landmark trial that captivated Silicon Valley for a month</a> included details about all-male ski trips and Valentine’s gifts, and prompted former employees at Twitter and Facebook to file similar suits. In the process, Pao’s personal life, work habits, and emails were raked through the court. She was accused of being aggressive, timid, greedy, manipulative, and so on. You could say that the courtroom isn’t so different to the boardroom. Even though she lost – the jury sided with Kleiner Perkins’s case that Pao was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/27/ellen-pao-loses-landmark-sexual-discrimination-lawsuit\" title=\"\">“divisive and not a team player”</a> – the case shone a light on the lack of diversity in Silicon Valley.</p> \n<p>Since the trial, Pao has become either the <a href=\"http://www.returnofkings.com/67110/reddit-melts-down-due-to-incompetent-feminist-ceo-ellen-pao\" title=\"\">reckless CEO intent on destroying the freedom of the internet</a>, or the tech generation’s figurehead for speaking out against gender discrimination in the workplace, depending on who you talk to. “If I’ve helped level the playing field for women and minorities in venture capital, then the battle was worth it,” she told reporters outside the courtroom back in March. Her move to Reddit, at first glance, seemed incongruous. Maybe that was the point. After taking on Silicon Valley, where only 4% of senior investing partners at venture capital firms are women, could it be that Pao wanted to clean up what some regard as the biggest online mess of them all? Reddit, as well as being a breeding ground for memes and gifs, has a reputation, sometimes hard to square with site users used to its different face, for being <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/12/reddit-can-ceo-ellen-pao-clean-up-the-mess\" title=\"\">a toxic, misogynistic community</a>. A Chinese-American feminist in charge? That’s really interesting.</p> \n<p>It’s worth noting one complication: the employee fired by Reddit is a woman. But Pao was already in the limelight, and has a reputation for taking on sexual discrimination. In the six months since she has been in post, Pao has <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/04/06/ellen-pao-on-reaction-to-kleiner-case-workplace-sexism-and-running-reddit-qa/?mod=ST1\" title=\"\">removed negotiating – over cash salaries and equity – from Reddit’s recruitment process</a> because she felt men benefited more than women. “It’s an opportunity for me to try to put in things that I think are going to create this equal opportunity environment for everyone,” she said. She has banned “involuntary pornography” by ensuring people whose photos have been posted on Reddit without their consent can have them removed. And the company has introduced an anti-harassment policy: “We’re banning behaviour, not ideas.”</p> \n<p>It’s not exactly shocking yet Pao is accused of waging a war on freedom. The response to introducing some <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/14/reddit-anti-harassment-policy-cyberbullying\" title=\"\">basic principles of respect and tolerance</a> to a site used by more than 150 million people every month has been tellingly disproportionate. In fact, the language of the petition to oust Pao says it all. “A&nbsp;vast majority of the Reddit community believes that Pao, ‘a&nbsp;manipulative individual who will sue her way to the top’, has overstepped the boundaries and fears that she will run Reddit into the ground.” Some might say the boundaries should have been overstepped long ago.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436200777918/Ellen-Pao-Venture-Capital-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ellen Pao.

However, other studies showed far lower rates of drinking in Ireland – from 20-46%, with only 3% of women saying they binge drink.<br /></p> \n<p>In all countries, drinking dropped dramatically in the second trimester (between three and six months pregnant).</p> \n<p>A higher level of education, having other children, and being overweight/obese were also associated with a lower risk of drinking while pregnant, but being a smoker made it more likely that a woman would drink while pregnant.</p> \n<p>The authors write that alcohol exposure may occur in over 75% of pregnancies in the UK and Ireland. Since women drink in the first three months, when the development of the foetus is less well understood, they say, “the widespread consumption of even low levels of alcohol during pregnancy is a significant public health concern”.</p> \n<p>But the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) said this was overstated. “The prevalence of unplanned pregnancy in this country means many women may have an episode of binge drinking before they realise they are pregnant, but the monumental drop in reported binges by the second trimester suggests women alter their behaviour very quickly,” said Clare Murphy, director of external affairs.</p> \n<p>“Bpas regularly sees women so concerned about the damage caused by an episode of binge drinking before they recognised they were pregnant they consider ending what would otherwise be a wanted pregnancy. We would like to see greater reassurance to these women that they are extremely unlikely to have caused their baby harm.”</p> \n<p>They said they were concerned by a suggestion from the authors that tests to measure women’s alcohol intake in pregnancy needed to be developed. “We would be extremely wary of any measures which sought to further police pregnant women’s behaviour, and undermine the important relationship between a pregnant woman and her healthcare provider,” said Murphy.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/6e2244ec33381c84cd9456d5c650ad8eb55fb3dc/0_932_2367_1420/2367.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1420,"width":2367,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Anthony Devlin/PA","altText":"Alcohol use during pregnancy concern","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T22:30:00Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T23:35:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":97,"contributors":[{"name":"Sarah Boseley","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sarahboseley"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Pregnancy","Parents and parenting","Life and style","Health & wellbeing","Family","Society","Women","Health"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/pregnancy","webTitle":"Pregnancy"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sarah Boseley","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sarahboseley"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/concern-over-levels-of-drinking-during-pregnancy-raised-by-studies","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4adkf","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/concern-over-levels-of-drinking-during-pregnancy-raised-by-studies","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/06/concern-over-levels-of-drinking-during-pregnancy-raised-by-studies"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/6e2244ec33381c84cd9456d5c650ad8eb55fb3dc/0_932_2367_1420/2367.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1420,"width":2367,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alcohol use during pregnancy is ‘prevalent and socially pervasive’ in the UK and Ireland, health experts have warned, after carrying out a large-scale study.

It’s the no-nonsense, quick and relatively cheap approach to mental suffering – with none of that Freudian bollocks, and plenty of scientific backing. So it was unsettling to learn, from <a href=\"https://uit.no/Content/418448/The%20effect%20of%20CBT%20is%20falling.pdf\" title=\"\">a paper in the journal Psychological Bulletin</a>, that it seems to be getting less effective over time. After analysing 70 studies conducted between 1977 and 2014, researchers Tom Johnsen and Oddgeir Friborg concluded that CBT is roughly half as effective in treating depression as it used to be.</p> \n<p>What’s going on? One theory is that, as any therapy grows more popular, the proportion of inexperienced or incompetent therapists grows bigger. But the paper raises a more intriguing idea: the placebo effect. The early publicity around CBT made it seem a miracle cure, so maybe it functioned like one for a while. These days, by contrast, the chances are you know someone who’s tried CBT and didn’t miraculously become perfectly happy for ever. Our expectations have become more realistic, so effectiveness has fallen, too. Johnsen and Friborg worry that their own paper will make matters worse by further lowering people’s expectations.</p> \n<p>All this highlights something even stranger, though: when it comes to talk therapy, what does it even mean to speak of the placebo effect? With pills, it’s straightforward: if I swallow a sugar tablet, believing it to be an antidepressant, and my depression lifts, then there’s a good chance the placebo effect is at work. But if I believe that CBT, or any therapy, is likely to work, and it does, who’s to say if my beliefs were really the cause, rather than the therapy? Beliefs are an integral part of the process, not a rival explanation. The line between what I think is going on and what <em>is</em> going on starts to blur. Truly convince yourself that a psychological intervention is working and by definition it’s working.</p> \n<p>Perhaps every era needs a practice it can believe in as a miracle cure – Freudian psychoanalysis in the 1930s, CBT in the 1990s, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/11/julie-myerson-mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy\" title=\"\">mindfulness meditation</a> today – until research gradually reveals it to be as flawed as everything else.</p> \n<p>Or it could be that we’re changing as people. In 1958, a US psychoanalyst, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Wheelis\" title=\"\">Allen Wheelis</a>, published a book arguing that Freudian analysis had stopped working because the American character had altered. In Freud’s day, Wheelis argued, people didn’t understand why they felt sad; psychoanalysis gave them explanations, whereupon they found it easy to transform their lives. Modern people were better at self-understanding, but they lacked the gumption to do anything about it. “Lacking the sturdy character of the Victorians,” as Roy F Baumeister and John Tierney put it in their book <a href=\"http://www.splendidtable.org/story/willpower-rediscovering-greatest-human-strength\" title=\"\">Willpower</a>‚ “people didn’t have the strength to follow up on the insight and change their lives.”</p> \n<p>The old techniques weren’t completely wrong; they’d just outlived their usefulness. If the secret of happiness is hard to find, maybe that’s because the answer keeps changing.</p> \n<p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/6/30/1435660711660/Oliver-CBT-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","credit":"Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","altText":"Oliver: CBT","cleanCaption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T14:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T23:06:27Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":153,"contributors":[{"name":"Oliver Burkeman","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/11/4/1415112352678/Oliver-Burkeman-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/oliverburkeman"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Health & wellbeing","Life and style","Psychology","Sigmund Freud","Mental health"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"science/psychology","webTitle":"Psychology"},{"id":"books/sigmundfreud","webTitle":"Sigmund Freud"},{"id":"society/mental-health","webTitle":"Mental health"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Oliver Burkeman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/oliverburkeman"}}],"series":{"title":"This column will change your life","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/thiscolumnwillchangeyourlife"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/why-cbt-is-falling-out-of-favour-oliver-burkeman","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49pq8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/why-cbt-is-falling-out-of-favour-oliver-burkeman","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/why-cbt-is-falling-out-of-favour-oliver-burkeman"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435660805592/8d70cff8-9412-4881-8dd7-3099d7c11668-1020x425.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":425,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","credit":"Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","altText":"Oliver: CBT","cleanCaption":"Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian"}},"importance":4,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/6/30/1435660711660/Oliver-CBT-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","credit":"Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","altText":"Oliver: CBT","cleanCaption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"How to eat: tuna salad","rawTitle":"How to eat: tuna salad","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2015/jul/06/how-to-eat-tuna-salad","title":"How to eat: tuna salad","trailText":"Sounds simple enough, but every detail is controversial.

Tinned tuna or fresh? Rocket or cos? French beans or no? Which olives, what dressing and what to drink with it? </p>","byline":"Tony Naylor","body":"<p>Hair splitters! Finicky folk! The unbearably anally retentive! Please assemble in the e-meeting room that is theguardian.com. For <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-eat\">How To Eat </a>– the blog series charged with identifying the ideal version of Britain’s favourite dishes – is back and, this month, we’re tackling that controversial classic, tuna salad. It is the star of a million at-desk lunches (so long as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2012/nov/15/liz-kendall-tuna-salad-row\">no one nicks yours from the fridge</a>, that is), and the perfect quick fall-back meal on a hot summer’s evening, but it comes in 1,001 varieties and all but one of them is completely and utterly wrong. So, without further ado, lettuce commence. As ever, keep it cool BTL: no flakiness, no raw language, no overly salty exchanges. </p> \n<h2><strong>The tuna </strong></h2> \n<p>Way back in the mists of time (1998), when we were all obsessed with the perceived sexiness and health-giving properties of the Mediterranean diet, there might have been an excuse for using seared, thinly sliced tuna steak in a salad. We were young, we were foolish and this novelty wasn’t (from memory) &pound;30-a-kilo. But, in 2015, to do so would be a flagrant waste of that precious rosy flesh. Its delicate flavour is best savoured as a rare treat, rather than leaving it to jostle for attention in a salad of competing flavours. </p> \n<p>Instead, tinned tuna will do the job - which is not to say that all tinned tuna is created equal. There is a self-evident hierarchy of quality, both for the tuna itself (flaked useless, chunks marginally better, steaks best), and the liquid it is preserved in. Tuna in spring water or brine is dry, mealy, abominable stuff. Sunflower oil is better, but for maximum flavour it has to be in olive oil. </p> \n<p>I trust it goes without saying that you should <em>never</em> a) use smoked tuna, b) mix tuna with mayo if it is going in a salad, or c) resort to any of the infused or pre-mixed tunas that (in a damning indictment of late capitalism) proliferate in our supermarkets. A salad is no place – if, indeed, one exists – to be experimenting with tuna dressed with tomato and herbs or infused with soy and ginger. </p> \n<h2><strong>Leaves</strong></h2> \n<p>Let he who has never bought a supermarket bagged salad cast the first stone, but you cannot dispute that these sad sacks are a rip-off, and that they are a particular waste of money when it comes to tuna salad. All you want and need, here, is some clean, sweet base crunch. Cos or baby gem lettuce are the way to go; shredded or chopped in chunky hunks that are neither too small nor so big that you need to unhinge your jaw to eat them. Save your swankier salad leaves – peppery watercress, bitter radicchio, that homegrown crop of woody, horrible rocket that never seems to end – for salads where they will make a genuinely effective contribution. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a/0_425_1148_689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anchovies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anchovies can be a useful addition, as long as they are chopped for thorough distribution.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Twort/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The salad ingredients</strong></h2> \n<p>Were this a band, you now have your star lead singer (the tuna) and your tight rhythm section (the leaves) in place. It is time to add some mid-range colour: a lead guitarist, a keyboard player, backing singers, perhaps a flautist for that unexpected prog-rock interlude. Now, some of you will read the ingredients listed below and think: “Hang on, this is just a bastardised salad ni&ccedil;oise”, but what of it? The not-quite-salad-ni&ccedil;oise is – to extend this rock group metaphor way past its breaking point – like a band’s classic first album. Later, they will dabble in jazz-funk and start naming their tracks with runic symbols. Which will be interesting. In a way. But that first album, <em>Not Quite Salad Ni&ccedil;oise</em>, is the one you will always come back to.</p> \n<p>Why? Because, primarily, a great tuna salad is a fine balancing act between sharp, salty, fishy flavours and those fresher, spritzier vegetable components – which function almost as an ongoing palate cleanser, as you eat. And, while there is no need to stick faithfully to the original, the salad ni&ccedil;oise remains our most reliable outline guide as regards how to achieve that balance. Moreover, it determines the additional ingredients you might use in an eminently sensible way.</p> \n<p>The full list of acceptable/unacceptable ingredients is as follows:</p> \n<p><strong>YES</strong>: slices of waxy/new potatoes (boiled); anchovies (chopped for thorough distribution, never whole); halved, not overly ripe baby plum tomatoes; cucumber, deseeded and sliced; a small amount of finely chopped sweet red or spring onion; capers; jarred, brined green olives (save those fresh, buttery nocellera to enjoy on their own); chopped or sliced boiled egg; it’s creaminess is a fantastic contrast. A handful of finely chopped leafy, green herbs (parsley, chives, chervil, basil even) is also welcome, but not essential.</p> \n<p><strong>NO</strong>: French/green beans (vile cold, and invariably boiled to a mushy consistency); raw white onion; carrot and beetroot (whose flavours are jarring in this context); croutons (this is not a caesar salad); any chilli or feta stuffed olives (it pains me that this needs pointing out); dull black and/or shrunken purple kalamata-like olives; sliced bell pepper (whose presence in <em>any salad</em> should rightly prompt a lengthy outburst of vociferous “industrial” language). </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b4da5a26b7c4daf358669726d8688eaf69349b0\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3b4da5a26b7c4daf358669726d8688eaf69349b0/0_65_5760_3460/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not quite right\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not quite right: carrots, feta and dull black olives should be avoided.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Also, on the egg-front, please note that no one wants a tepid-to-warm, still runny poached egg on their tuna salad. There is something deeply unappetising about rogue “hot” ingredients in cold salads and/or salad leaves covered in stringy trails of translucent albumen. Moreover, that running yolk turns any tuna present into gluey, indigestible lumps. You may think a soft poached egg on a tuna salad is sophisticated, clever even. It isn’t.</p> \n<h2><strong>Dressing</strong></h2> \n<p>Step away from the pesto (it makes everything taste of, well, pesto), and dispense with that sharp-elbowed white wine vinegar. All you need here is olive oil, salt, pepper, lemon juice and dijon mustard, all smoothly emulsified in such a way that the character of each ingredient is clear, but elegantly reconciled. Whisk, taste, go.</p> \n<h2><strong>Assembly and plating </strong></h2> \n<p>Serving a salad in a deep cereal bowl makes it difficult to eat. Serving it on a plate always looks wrong. Serving it on slate, meanwhile, is a clear sign that chef needs to stop browsing inspirational tableware catalogues and actually think, practically, about how people eat.</p> \n<p>Instead, line a shallow, wide-rimmed bowl with leaves, and separately (you want those leaves to retain their distinct flavour and crunch) dress and mix the other ingredients, minus the tuna. That, similarly, should be broken into substantive chunks on top and left as a separate complementary dimension of flavour, not doused in vinaigrette.</p> \n<h2><strong>When</strong></h2> \n<p>Lunch or tea – also known, in some part of the UK, as dinner. NB. If anyone in your circle every refers to tuna salad as a “light mid-week supper” you can – after your toes have uncurled from that sudden, excruciating cramp – happily kill them in any gruesome manner you think fitting. There is not a court in the land that would convict you.</p> \n<h2><strong>Drink</strong></h2> \n<p>Crisply bitter pale ales; dry, flinty white wines; water. </p> \n<p>So, tuna salad – how do you eat yours?</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f6b5fd3d82e4a524640762ffe657f01f71e4e100/0_594_7210_4326/7210.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":4326,"width":7210,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Tuna Salad","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a/0_425_1148_689/1148.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":689,"width":1148,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Anchovies can be a useful addition, as long as they are chopped for thorough distribution.

No meat, eggs or diary – nothing that comes from animals. Is there anything interesting left to eat? Yes, there’s lots – according to vegans – including chickpeas, kidney beans, fortified soy products, fruit and nuts. So this week’s research linking vegan diet and weight loss is a triumph for the tofu burger. Vegetarian diets have previously been linked with a reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and dying from pretty much everything. But, more importantly – at least as far as summer magazine issues go – vegan diets haven’t been strongly linked with weight loss.

The diets included the Atkins diet and those recommended by the <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/\" title=\"\">American Diabetes Association</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-pro/guidelines/current/cholesterol-guidelines/final-report\" title=\"\">US&nbsp;National Cholesterol Education Program</a>. Those who followed a vegetarian diet lost an average of 1.48kg more than those on other diets, while vegans lost 2.52kg more than the non-vegetarian dieters. The lead author, Ru-Yi Huang, says that wholegrain products that are rich in fibre may cause the stomach to delay in emptying and therefore delay feelings of hunger. Some of the individual pieces of research within the meta analysis had more dramatic evidence of weight loss – one study found a weight loss of 10kg at a year and 8kg at five years in vegetarians. A <a href=\"http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/2/e003505.full\" title=\"\">study in BMJ Open</a> of 39 overweight people found that an “Eco-Atkins diet” – a low-carbohydrate vegan diet (with protein from soy and nut products) – led to 6.9kg weight loss over six months as well as lower cholesterol levels.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts.pdf\" title=\"\">The British Dietetic Association</a> says that vegetarian and vegan diets are suitable for every stage of life as long as they are well planned. There are many ways to lose weight, all of which involve eating less or at least expending more energy than you take in. Becoming a vegan is usually a lifestyle choice rather a diet – one that people make for many reasons, and feeling better in a two-piece is perhaps not the most common one.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435933964817/Should-I-go-vegan-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A fibrous vegan diet could help delay feelings of hunger.
