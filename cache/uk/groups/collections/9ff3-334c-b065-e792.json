And the sight of the first gingerbread latte of the year still gets me all hot and bothered.</p> \n<p>To me, coffee shops are quite fun places for all – teens like them because it makes them feel grownup; adults like them for meetings; you can have a harmless date there, and some are even licensed (yay!). What you don’t want is some chin-stroking, smirking joy thief looking at you like you’ve done it wrong at the till. But that’s what’s happening. </p> \n<p>As a nation, we drink about 165m cups of coffee a day. Men (1.7 cups) drink more than women (1.5 cups). More than eight out of 10 of us drink it at home, in the office, or in one of the tens of thousands of coffee shops that litter every town and city, <a href=\"http://reports.mintel.com/sinatra/oxygen/list/id=679744&amp;type=RCItem#0_1___page_RCItem=0\">which equates to an annual national spend of more than &pound;1bn</a>.</p> \n<p>But as the industry grows, so does the aching presence of the <a href=\"http://www.timhayward.com/\">coffee bore.</a> And they’re everywhere.

I don’t know, but the reason I don’t know is because I don’t know what Fika is. I’ve never seen a more niche magazine – and I’ve worked for the company that publishes Coin-operated Laundry Monthly and Rubber &amp; Plastics Weekly. </p> \n<p>Do I want my beans ground fine or coarse? I don’t know. I don’t care enough about the production method. Yes, sneer if you like. But it’s only coffee, isn’t it? Well, not to the bloke who stood next to me in the latest coffee house to spring up in Manchester’s Northern Quarter recently, who spent a good 15 minutes cross-examining one of the poor baristas about which variety of Guatemalan bean he’d best be suited to. He wanted to see them. And sniff them.

I just don’t know everything there is to know about coffee. Sorry. Has anybody else started to develop a jangling case of nerves as they approach a barista? Just me? How has this happened?</p> \n<p>When the craft ale thing started to happen, it was made slightly less enjoyable by the intensely solemn “punk” taste-makers, who acted as a sort of unofficial booze police. In a nutshell, they were rude, patronising and painfully boring.

It’s the no-nonsense, quick and relatively cheap approach to mental suffering – with none of that Freudian bollocks, and plenty of scientific backing. So it was unsettling to learn, from <a href=\"https://uit.no/Content/418448/The%20effect%20of%20CBT%20is%20falling.pdf\" title=\"\">a paper in the journal Psychological Bulletin</a>, that it seems to be getting less effective over time. After analysing 70 studies conducted between 1977 and 2014, researchers Tom Johnsen and Oddgeir Friborg concluded that CBT is roughly half as effective in treating depression as it used to be.</p> \n<p>What’s going on? One theory is that, as any therapy grows more popular, the proportion of inexperienced or incompetent therapists grows bigger. But the paper raises a more intriguing idea: the placebo effect. The early publicity around CBT made it seem a miracle cure, so maybe it functioned like one for a while. These days, by contrast, the chances are you know someone who’s tried CBT and didn’t miraculously become perfectly happy for ever. Our expectations have become more realistic, so effectiveness has fallen, too. Johnsen and Friborg worry that their own paper will make matters worse by further lowering people’s expectations.</p> \n<p>All this highlights something even stranger, though: when it comes to talk therapy, what does it even mean to speak of the placebo effect? With pills, it’s straightforward: if I swallow a sugar tablet, believing it to be an antidepressant, and my depression lifts, then there’s a good chance the placebo effect is at work. But if I believe that CBT, or any therapy, is likely to work, and it does, who’s to say if my beliefs were really the cause, rather than the therapy? Beliefs are an integral part of the process, not a rival explanation. The line between what I think is going on and what <em>is</em> going on starts to blur. Truly convince yourself that a psychological intervention is working and by definition it’s working.</p> \n<p>Perhaps every era needs a practice it can believe in as a miracle cure – Freudian psychoanalysis in the 1930s, CBT in the 1990s, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/11/julie-myerson-mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy\" title=\"\">mindfulness meditation</a> today – until research gradually reveals it to be as flawed as everything else.</p> \n<p>Or it could be that we’re changing as people. In 1958, a US psychoanalyst, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Wheelis\" title=\"\">Allen Wheelis</a>, published a book arguing that Freudian analysis had stopped working because the American character had altered. In Freud’s day, Wheelis argued, people didn’t understand why they felt sad; psychoanalysis gave them explanations, whereupon they found it easy to transform their lives. Modern people were better at self-understanding, but they lacked the gumption to do anything about it. “Lacking the sturdy character of the Victorians,” as Roy F Baumeister and John Tierney put it in their book <a href=\"http://www.splendidtable.org/story/willpower-rediscovering-greatest-human-strength\" title=\"\">Willpower</a>‚ “people didn’t have the strength to follow up on the insight and change their lives.”</p> \n<p>The old techniques weren’t completely wrong; they’d just outlived their usefulness. If the secret of happiness is hard to find, maybe that’s because the answer keeps changing.</p> \n<p><a href=\"mailto:oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/6/30/1435660711660/Oliver-CBT-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","credit":"Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","altText":"Oliver: CBT","cleanCaption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T14:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T23:06:27Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":153,"contributors":[{"name":"Oliver Burkeman","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/11/4/1415112352678/Oliver-Burkeman-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/oliverburkeman"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Health & wellbeing","Life and style","Psychology","Sigmund Freud","Mental health"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"science/psychology","webTitle":"Psychology"},{"id":"books/sigmundfreud","webTitle":"Sigmund Freud"},{"id":"society/mental-health","webTitle":"Mental health"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Oliver Burkeman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/oliverburkeman"}}],"series":{"title":"This column will change your life","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/thiscolumnwillchangeyourlife"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/why-cbt-is-falling-out-of-favour-oliver-burkeman","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49pq8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/why-cbt-is-falling-out-of-favour-oliver-burkeman","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/why-cbt-is-falling-out-of-favour-oliver-burkeman"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435660805592/8d70cff8-9412-4881-8dd7-3099d7c11668-1020x425.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":425,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","credit":"Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","altText":"Oliver: CBT","cleanCaption":"Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian"}},"importance":5,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/6/30/1435660711660/Oliver-CBT-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","credit":"Thomas Pullin for the Guardian","altText":"Oliver: CBT","cleanCaption":"  Illustration: Thomas Pullin for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"How to cook meat and veg the Indigenous way","rawTitle":"How to cook meat and veg the Indigenous way","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/jul/08/how-to-cook-meat-and-veg-the-indigenous-way","title":"How to cook meat and veg the Indigenous way","trailText":"A traditional Aboriginal earth oven steams, roasts and barbecues food all at the same time – and the results are worthy of the finest open-air restaurant<br>","standFirst":"<p>A traditional Aboriginal earth oven steams, roasts and barbecues food all at the same time – and the results are worthy of the finest open-air restaurant<br /></p>","byline":"Monica Tan","body":"<p>To the untrained eye, an Aboriginal earth oven appears to be a simple mound of sand. But get close, and it’s warm to the touch and emanates a wonderfully smoky fragrance of meat that has been marinated in native Australian spices.</p> \n<p>David Beaumont is a community engagement co-ordinator from the City of Sydney and a Wiradjuri man, “born on The Block in Redfern”. Before dawn on Monday he, along with members of catering company Goanna Hut, which specialises in bush tucker, built two traditional underground ovens in the heart of Sydney’s Hyde Park.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"839b7b087ca996bebcffd6f3d5863ec5396b48a9\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/839b7b087ca996bebcffd6f3d5863ec5396b48a9/0_0_3800_2533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Beaumont, City of Sydney community engagement coordinator, digs an earth oven in Hyde Park as part of Naidoc week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Beaumont, City of Sydney community engagement coordinator, digs an earth oven in Hyde Park as part of Naidoc week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sharon Hickey/City of Sydney</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Beaumont talks me through the oven’s construction: a shallow pit, with a base grid of Gymea lily stalks, heated by burning hot rocks. That heat is sealed with a mixture of wet hessian bags and sand. “It steams, roasts and barbecues the meat all at once. Now I don’t know one man-made machine that can do that and have the food come out exquisite,” he says.<br /></p> \n<p>Without the temperature gauge of a typical oven, it requires some finesse on the part of the operator in timing the cooking and rotating the rocks to get an even spread of heat. It’s a perfect embodiment of the “slow cooking” movement, he says.<br /></p> \n<p>Where possible Beaumont uses natural material – as he did when he was taught the method 10 years ago by a Torres Strait islander elder. But Beaumont is no purist. “Culture is ever-evolving and you tweak things,” he says, comparing his practice to the contemporary Indigenous dance company Bangarra.</p> \n<p>“They’ll perform new dances with new music, but still draw on that inner spirituality in a contemporary world. Earth ovens are no different.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1b106aa7b9362c8b7b53a1c1f45275e7776bd4e2\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/1b106aa7b9362c8b7b53a1c1f45275e7776bd4e2/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Beaumont and volunteers uncover the Hyde Park earth oven. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Beaumont along with Jo-Ann and Darrell Wolles of Goanna Hut uncover the Hyde Park earth oven. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sharon Hickey/City of Sydney</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The ovens were built as part of Naidoc week, an annual celebration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander culture. By midday several hundred attendees, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, have lined up, eager to pile their paper plates with food.<br /></p> \n<p>The ovens are dismantled and the meat and vegetables pried out of their foil cocoons. Roast lamb emerges dripping in the sweet juices of bush tomato; the chicken is infused with lemon myrtle; a particularly tender slice of pork bursts in my mouth with the taste of native pepperberry.</p> \n<p>Beaumont appears proud to see so many satisfied diners.</p> \n<p>“Sometimes we struggle to understand what it means to be, as Tony Abbott says, ‘Team Australia’,” he says. “As First Nations people we have made so many contributions and achievements over tens of thousands of years to this continent that is now called Australia and we want to celebrate that with people. </p> \n<p>“For the past 200 years we haven’t been able to do that, but we’re doing that now.”</p> \n<h2>How to build a traditional Aboriginal earth oven</h2> \n<p>Dig a shallow pit between 1.5 and two metres in diameter and about 40cm deep (the grass can be removed carefully with soil and roots intact, then protected with wet hessian bags and returned when finished). The size of the pit may vary depending on the amount of food. </p> \n<p>Add a 4cm layer of fresh sand to the base of the pit before building the fire. Assemble the fire by scattering a layer of rocks, then adding wood and more rocks until it reaches about half a metre high.<br /></p> \n<p>Light the fire and allow it to burn down for between one and two hours. Monitor the fire and make sure the rocks stay within the fire pit. This process heats the rocks, which are then used to cook the food.</p> \n<p>After another two hours the rocks should be very hot. Any excess wood can be scraped aside. Spread the hot rocks over the base of the pit to distribute the heat evenly.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7aacfbc9a8f60c23b5c50b1deaf5b1669349f002\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7aacfbc9a8f60c23b5c50b1deaf5b1669349f002/0_0_3717_2232/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Food slow-cooked in an Indigenous earth oven is served by a volunteer in Sydney’s Hyde Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Food slow-cooked in an Indigenous earth oven is served by a volunteer in Sydney’s Hyde Park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sharon Hickey/City of Sydney</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Place green wood, which has a very high water content and will not burn, over the hot rocks to act as a barrier between the food. This will prevent them from burning and allow the heat to circulate through the food once the pit is sealed. Place some hot rocks on the food to keep the heat even throughout the pit. These ovens feature four layers, with the larger cuts of meat on the bottom and smaller cuts on top, and a small amount of hot rocks spread in between for heat control and aeration.</p> \n<p>Lay large, fresh, green leaves over the food to provide a protective layer and moisture to the pit. Preferably banana leaves for the first layer. The Hyde Park one used clippings from trees.</p> \n<p>Add a layer of hessian that has been soaking in water for several hours over the green leaves. This helps keep the heat in and sand out. The hessian needs to be placed from the base of the pit to the top in a circular fashion so the sand falls away from the pit and not into it when it’s time to remove the food. Make sure the hessian covers the whole pit, including flowing out from the base.</p> \n<p>Create a seal around the base of the pit, before covering the whole pit with clean sand. Finally, make sure the whole pit is covered with sand and there is no smoke leaking from the pit.</p> \n<p>In our oven, the food takes between three and four hours to cook. When it’s ready, scrape the sand back very gently with a shovel so it doesn’t pierce the wet hessian below. Peel away the hessian and leaves very carefully so no sand falls directly on to the food. Rake hot rocks away with a shovel and extract the food.</p> \n<p>Note, the food is extremely hot with a high moisture content that will burn and scald, so don’t forget to wear gloves. Food can be left on the hot pit until ready to carve. </p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Oven construction instructions provided by David Beaumont and Goanna Hut</em><br /></li> \n</ul>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7aacfbc9a8f60c23b5c50b1deaf5b1669349f002/0_137_3717_2231/3717.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2231,"width":3717,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sharon Hickey/City of Sydney","altText":"National Aboriginal NAIDOC & TORRES Straight Islander Week 5-12 July 2015<br>A man serves food from an earth oven.The earth oven was dug to cook food in the ground using traditional Indigenous methods as part of the NAIDOC Event in Hyde Park, Sydney, Australia on 6 July 2015.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sharon Hickey/City of Sydney"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/839b7b087ca996bebcffd6f3d5863ec5396b48a9/0_0_3800_2533/3800.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2533,"width":3800,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"David Beaumont, City of Sydney community engagement coordinator, digs an earth oven in Hyde Park as part of Naidoc week.

Gradually add the polenta, stirring constantly with a long wooden spoon until all the flour has been incorporated into the water and is lump-free. At this stage you must be careful that you do not splash hot polenta on to your hands.

Mix into the rice halfway through the cooking.</p> \n<p>Squeeze the half lemon into a small bowl and combine it with the egg yolk, parmesan, cream, a little salt and a very generous grinding of black pepper. Mix well with a fork.</p> \n<p>When the rice is al dente, draw the pan off the heat and stir in the egg and cream mixture and the remaining butter. Cover the pan and leave to rest for 2 minutes or so. Then give the risotto an energetic stir, transfer to a heated dish or bowl and serve at once, with more grated parmesan in a little bowl if you wish.</p> \n<p><em>From Italian Kitchen by Anna del Conte (Square Peg, &pound;20). </em><em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/italian-kitchen.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Click here to buy from Guardian Bookshop for &pound;16</a></em></p> \n<h2>Claudia Roden’s pumpkin gnocchetti</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df704d31831717d58e4bc1fdf58d3332075eec59\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435677695957/8e01ec2e-8234-4328-a1a9-933b9dffd2ee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Gnocchi\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Serves 4-6<br /><strong>pumpkin or squash flesh</strong> 800g, cut into pieces<br /><strong>egg</strong> 1 large<br /><strong>sugar</strong> 1-2 tsp<br /><strong>salt and freshly ground pepper<br /></strong><strong>plain flour </strong>about 150-175g<br /><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 75g, melted<br /><strong>grana padano or parmesan</strong> grated</p> \n<p>Put the pumpkin in a large pan with 500ml water.

Take the tomatoes from the vine, dice and add to the bread, together with the chopped onion. Tear the basil and add that too. Add the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Stir together and set aside.</p> \n<p>Under running water, scale the sardines and then open them out, leaving the heads attached. To do this, insert a sharp filleting knife at the tail end, next to the backbone, and cut upwards, until you reach the belly of the fish. Turn the sardine over, then cut in the same way to the same point on the other side of the bone. Starting at the tail end, take the backbone between your forefinger and thumb and run them along the length of the bone up to the head. Cut across the bone at the tail end and head end and the bone should lift out, leaving the fillets still attached at the opposite side, so you can open them out like a book. At the outside of each fillet, you will see a black area with some fine bones. Just take your knife under these parts, and remove them. Then, with a pair of tweezers, take out any pin bones that may have remained in the fillets.</p> \n<p>When all the sardines are prepared, season, brush with a little of the olive oil and put on the hot grill, 6 at a time. Let them get crusty on one side (about 3 minutes), then turn over and do the same on the other side (about 2 minutes).</p> \n<p>While the sardines are cooking, spoon some of the panzanella on each serving plate, then put the sardines on top, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and serve.</p> \n<p><em>From Made in Italy by Giorgio Locatelli (Fourth Estate, &pound;26).</em><em><a

However, in your situation, it is probably best for you to take responsibility solely for your own pleasure, and encourage him to do the same. Wanting increased pleasure for him is understandable, but might be experienced as pressure to have sex your way, rather than his. You could, however, try to get him to give you precise feedback as you pleasure him manually or orally – as long as it doesn’t become uncomfortable for him. Keep checking – “Do you want me to continue, or shall we switch to something else?”</p> \n<p>I recommend you first try eliciting feedback from him with erotic caresses to non-genital parts of each other. You could model the kind of detailed feedback you want from him first, as he tries different kinds of strokes and touches on you. This is a good way to learn about each others’ responses. Eventually – when there is a high level of relaxation, communication and non-goal-oriented desire between you – you could progress to genital stimulation.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</em></p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to </em><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\"><em>private.lives@theguardian.com</em></a><em> (please don’t send attachments).</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435941668241/Young-man-sleeping-in-bed-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'I’m losing interest because I can’t enjoy his pleasure' (posed by models).

Deborah Orr toasts the joys of the lunchtime tipple <br /></p>","byline":"Deborah Orr","body":"<p>Like smoking on planes and transporting toddlers in cars without tying them up first, a little inebriation to break up a working day is one of those things that in a generation has moved from normal to, “Oh my God, can you believe we ever did that?”</p> \n<p>Obviously, boozy lunches aren’t actually illegal. But you, the lunchtime drinker, know that when a daytime dining companion suggests ordering a bottle of wine, agreement is conspiracy. Or a test you’re about to fail. You also know, when a dining companion says, “Just water for me!” that you really could and should have done whatever you’re about to do over the phone. Or you think you do, anyway.</p> \n<p>The truth is that drinking at lunchtime is stupid and irresponsible. That’s what makes it such fun. As for having just one or two glasses, the essential paradox of alcohol is that the less you imbibe, the more you feel its effects. After one glass (feel free to adjust for personal tolerances, you dipso), one is aware that one is more relaxed than optimum cut-throat marketplace sharpness demands. After two, one is in longing-for-an-afternoon-nap territory. After three, one is top of the world, thrumming with confidence, one’s excellent judgment assuring one that another glass won’t do any harm <em>at all</em>.</p> \n<p>After which anything can happen, as long as it’s bad. Alcohol is a gateway drug, paving the way for more alcohol. This has been known to the west since the ancient Greeks so sensibly <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/topic/Dionysus\">formalised the ritual of binge-drinking into a form of worship.</a></p> \n<p>The high point of my own lunchtime drinking life came about 10 years ago, when lunch with a friend was brought to an end by kindly waiters gently explaining that, much as it pained them, they really needed our table because dinner service was in full swing. Obviously, this was confusing for us. Holding one of our own fingers in front of our own noses was confusing for us. Somehow, we had managed to have lunch for seven and a half brief hours.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Drinking at lunchtime is stupid and irresponsible. That's what makes it such fun</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>We had been celebrating. Not at first, but after ordering our first bottle of wine (at that point, as we’d imagined, our only bottle of wine), we decided it was corked. Summoning the waiter, we told him of our verdict. A single sip and he confirmed that we were very much correct, confiding also that we were discerning women of the world and a pleasure to serve, because most of the world’s idiots glugged away at corked wine without the smallest suspicion that what they were drinking was not delicious, but rank.</p> \n<p>Well, he didn’t actually say that. We said that. We were so pleased with ourselves for detecting corked wine that we had a few more goes, to check that our new superpower was not a fluke. A sensible waiter would have given us the corked wine again, as bottle three. But our waiter didn’t, because he adored us. OK, I made that up, too.</p> \n<p>The next day – realistically, it was probably two or three days later – I told a hard-drinking colleague of our Great Feat. “Wow!” he said. “So who else was there?”</p> \n<p>“Just us.”</p> \n<p>“Eh? What on Earth did you two find to talk about for seven and a half bloody hours?”</p> \n<p>In fact, both freelance journalists and the mothers of small children, we’d talked first about how we could rearrange our working day to accommodate an extra hour or so of lunch, and next about how we could rearrange our picking- up-the-kids-from-school day to accommodate another extra hour or so of lunch. We then had to have these conversations again the next day, over the phone, because of our terrible hangovers. Clearly, some corked wine had indeed crept into the proceedings. There is no other explanation.</p> \n<p>It’s pretty dreadful, screwing up your work for the sake of a drink. It’s really awful, screwing up your responsibilities to your children for the sake of a drink. I’m not proud. Except I made that up, too. I am proud. I regret nothing. It was a golden afternoon. We may not have been officially worshipping gods, but for one day, we were both Ferris Bueller and we both had a day off. The memory still gladdens my heart. That’s how much I needed a day off.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We were so pleased with ourselves for detecting corked wine that we had a few more goes</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I understand that this is a tale of privileged women who have the luxury of being able to behave badly without suffering too many consequences, but there was a time when this sort of behaviour was a little more universal. Outside the gates of Ravenscraig, the huge steelworks that dominated my home town, Motherwell, was a pub called the Cleekim Inn. It was a bare-faced acknowledgment that a drink before your shift began could turn into a few drinks, and that the solution was to get a workmate to punch your card for you.</p> \n<p>Some of the men were alcoholics, and abused this unofficial system routinely. You could argue that this was a particularly egregious example of how liberty-taking was rife in nationalised industries. Except that I look at our denationalised age and think about how much better it was for all concerned, especially their wives and children, that these men had a wage, security and a place to go and hide, a place to lose themselves that wasn’t home or the dole office.</p> \n<p>Drinking when you should be working was a bit of a gesture of defiance back then, and it’s a gesture of defiance so huge now that it’s a dying tradition. Young people now drink less, it’s said, than for many generations. They’re more sensible, it’s said, more focused. I think, though, that they’re just more fearful. Work, money, success, security: most of us live in fear of not achieving them or not retaining them. Moderation in all things, except dedication to good sense and duty, is the order of the day. One drink at lunch is rebellion. Two is sedition. Three is revolution.
