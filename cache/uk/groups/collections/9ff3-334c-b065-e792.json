It is a disputed theory that states that black dogs are the last to get adopted at shelters, perhaps because of superstition or a perception that they are aggressive. The idea inspired Levy to begin his <a href=\"http://caninenoir.tumblr.com/\">Black Dog Project</a> on their behalf. The dogs Levy photographed came from owners he recruited through his Facebook page. He had also started working with abandoned dogs referred to him by shelters – sharing their photos online in search of permanent homes. They are difficult to photograph well.

But which ones live up to the hype?</p>","byline":"Tony Naylor","body":"<p>In food, if there is one thing you can say without fear of contradiction, it is this: Britain loves burgers. The UK market is now worth &pound;3bn annually and, increasingly, it is no longer McDonald’s and Burger King that define our idea of the perfect patty. Borne aloft by the rise of “dude food”, a new wave of gourmet bun slingers has turned this once humble sandwich into an object of reverence. The food geeks who used to obsess over the detail of fine dining are now queueing to get into hip burger joints such as MeatLiquor, Almost Famous, Dirty Burger or Patty &amp; Bun. Online, the debate rages about fat-to-lean mince ratios and what precise blend of chuck or rump steak, brisket or short-rib meat you should use, to produce the ultimate burger. That scrutiny has led the supermarkets to up their game, but the expansion of their chilled, premium burger ranges is also being fuelled by a booming demand for barbecue food. In the late 1990s, Britain held about 10m barbecues each year. Today, remarkably, that figure has risen to an estimated 120m.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/may/14/supermarket-lagers-best-worst-taste-test-bottles\">Supermarket lagers: the best and worst – taste test</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But do any of these supermarket burgers match the beefy clout of the best restaurant patties?

Fashionably, the mince has been given a chunky grind and is relatively loosely packed, giving it a solid but easily yielding feel in the mouth. However, its steaky flavour is far from barnstorming. The seasoning is meek and what look like (yay!) tiny white nuggets of fat are, on closer inspection, sticky bits of dried potato.</p> \n<p><strong>6/10</strong></p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/en/product-range/exclusive-to-aldi/summer-food-and-drinks/meat/meat-product-detail-page/ps/p/specially-selected-scotch-beef-quarter-pounders/\">Aldi, specially selected Scotch beef quarter pounders<br /><em>Four-pack, &pound;2.99, 454g</em></a><br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb49020dfb4fed8e60ef2706d5fcf0a1b272fb07\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434462442190/444f3103-0f0b-42db-82e8-02f83d6019bb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Aldi burger\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>“Win tickets to a VIP BBQ party hosted by Alex James,” threatens a Red Tractor sticker on the box, a prospect that is even more unappetising than these sorry burgers.

The flavour, however (closest to brisket, one of three cuts used to make these burgers), is far too subtle.</p> \n<p><strong>6/10</strong></p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://www.lidl.co.uk/en/8783.htm?action=showDetail&amp;id=24248\">Lidl, deluxe Scotch beef steak quarter pounders<br /><em>Four-pack, &pound;2.99, 454g</em></a><br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa5b6f7fde2cc13e312434fc806581bc31a89c2c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434462577204/1fd69656-9e09-4cd8-a655-262e6f854787-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lidl burger\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>The steak flavour is present and correct, and the black pepper seasoning comes through, eventually.

As it isn’t widely available in this country, he recommends using equal parts strong bread flour and 00 for a similar result, and I agree – his loaf does have a pleasingly springy texture without being quite as stiff as those that use strong flour alone.</p> \n<p>Angela Hartnett* is among that number, but her recipe begins with a <em>biga</em>, or starter, which requires a 24-hour fermentation before use. Her bread has a wonderful chewiness and excellent flavour – almost more like a ciabatta than the focaccia I’m used to – but I’m looking for a loaf that can be made fairly quickly and easily, which rules this step out.

If you’d like to use fresh yeast instead of the fast-acting variety that I use, substitute 25g, or 12g of ordinary dried yeast, made up as per packet instructions.</p> \n<h2>The liquid</h2> \n<p>All focaccia contains olive oil, from a mere 2 tbsp in Hazan’s recipe to 150ml in the River Cafe version. As well as keeping the dough moist, the oil gives the bread its rich flavour, but I suspect the large quantity is also responsible for the slightly soft crust of the River Cafe loaf, so I’m going to reduce the amount slightly.</p> \n<p>The principal liquid, however – as in any bread – is water, and lots of it; Hartnett warns the novice baker not to be afraid of adding too much: “It can never be too wet – just trust me on this – it will come together. Too much flour and you end up with something resembling a doorstop.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84c867fbcf82fa4cc4a4ec431613e47da2bd57a2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543485352/3205d26b-b56a-43ce-baa6-0f94c0bb365f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The River Cafe's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The River Cafe’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She’s right. The drier doughs are indeed denser and heavier, and it’s almost safest – given the difficulties of precision when it comes to hydration, which depends on any number of things from the flour you use to the humidity of the day you bake – to be as vague as the River Cafe, which simply instructs one to add enough water to make a “very soft and pliable dough”. Thus the figure below should simply be taken as a guide. As in Hazan’s recipe, add the liquid in stages until you have a soft but workable dough.</p> \n<h2>The method</h2> \n<p>Perhaps it’s the temperature of my kitchen in comparison to that of a professional one, but I don’t find the short rising time in Locatelli’s recipe sufficient to allow the dough to double in size (which is another argument for using the instructions below as a guideline only – exactly how long everything takes will depend on the circumstances in which you make it), and making sure the dough has time to rise properly will ensure a structurally satisfactory result with plenty of air pockets.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d86e3f2e5d7e4ee81b71e676c3d9df5fd3f9f3dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543696856/ab2dd7f2-bafc-43e2-ac1d-3ebd199579d8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Giorgio Locatelli's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giorgio Locatelli’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s easiest to knead wet doughs like this in a food mixer, but if you don’t have one, oil your work surface rather than flouring it, so that you don’t add any more dry ingredients to the mix.</p> \n<p>That said, Locatelli’s bread boasts the best examples of those “dimples” that are such a characteristic feature of the focaccia – I think because his are made directly before baking, as opposed to before the second proof.</p> \n<h2>The baking</h2> \n<p>As with all breads, a very hot oven gives the best results – and baking it on a hot pizza stone or sheet, as Hartnett and Hazan suggest, will give your bread a pleasingly crisp bottom. Spraying a little water into the hot oven to create steam, as the former also recommends, will also help to create a decent crust.</p> \n<h2>The brine</h2> \n<p>Locatelli and others pour a mixture of oil, water and salt on top of their loaves before baking, which, as the River Cafe observes, may seem strange “but the water helps to keep the dough soft and moist in some of the grooves”. Be careful not to overdo it, though, or the loaf won’t brown on top. And don’t feel the need to overload it with salt, either: a mere teaspoon should be quite sufficient given how much there is in the dough.</p> \n<p>Do feel free to add herbs (rosemary sprigs are nice), olives, tomatoes, and so on. And, if you’re feeling really adventurous, the River Cafe even does a dessert version with black grapes and fennel seeds.

Stir together and add more water (I used about 100ml more) until you have a very soft, but not too sticky, dough.</p> \n<p>Knead until soft and elastic; in a food mixer (preferable) on a medium-slow speed for about 7 minutes, or by hand on a lightly oiled work surface for 10-12 minutes. Put the dough on a lightly oiled rimless baking sheet and leave to rise in a draught-free place for 60-90 minutes until roughly doubled in size.</p> \n<p>Knock back the dough, and lightly dust the baking tray with the semolina, if using. Gently press the dough out with your fingers to fit the baking tray. Brush with olive oil and leave to rise again for about another hour, or until doubled in size again. When this time has nearly elapsed, heat the oven to 220C and put a pizza stone or baking tray in there to heat up. If you have a water spray, ready it.</p> \n<p>Whisk together the remaining 30ml olive oil with 30ml water until emulsified. Transfer the dough to you pizza stone or baking tray and poke dimples into the surface of the focaccia with your fingertips. Pour the oil-and-water mixture on top and scatter with the salt flakes, then place in the oven and squirt a little water into the base of the oven. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until golden on top – keep an eye on it. The focaccia is best eaten warm.</p> \n<p><strong>Focaccia – is it the king of Italian breads, or do you prefer ciabatta, </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farinata\"><strong><em>farinata</em></strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href=\"http://www.msn.com/en-us/foodanddrink/recipes/carta-da-musica-%E2%80%9Cmusic-paper%E2%80%9D-bread/fd-be766c3f-4f53-51e0-8476-20f68b493fb0\"><strong><em>carta da musica</em></strong></a><strong>?

Just another day at the office, then. My crime that day was to have said during an episode of <em>MasterChef</em> that a dessert “looked like the sort of thing served at a cheap wedding full of regret held at a hotel on a ring road”. My correspondent’s stepdaughter had apparently just got married at a ring road hotel and it had been lovely. “I’m sure it was,” I replied, “but was it also full of regret? Because if it wasn’t, it isn’t covered by my critique.” I may be a snob, but I’m a precise snob.</p> \n<p>The touchiness shouldn’t have surprised me. When it comes to food at weddings people are like that. A wedding is one of life’s great set piece events, upon which the compass flickers. Accordingly everything about them must be perfect, even when everything plainly isn’t. And now it’s June, and wedding season is upon us. For the next few months many of us will be putting on suits and frocks smelling of dry cleaning fluid, and tramping into baggy marquees where we will eat some of the worst, most overpriced food ever inflicted upon us by people who claim to be our dearest friends. And then, regardless of how dismal it all was, we will loudly proclaim the opposite. In the coming months more lies will be told about the quality of lunch and dinner than in the rest of the year put together.</p> \n<p>We are meant to be experiencing a British food revolution, and in many ways we are. There are better restaurants than ever before. But in the business of mass catering we are generally awful. I say generally. Obviously, if you run a catering firm and you’re limbering up to complain, I don’t mean you. You’re brilliant. Likewise, the food at your wedding was obviously fabulous. It’s everyone else.</p> \n<p>Everyone else is responsible for dry canap&eacute;s that taste only of margarine and complacency. Everyone else is responsible for desiccated lumps of yesterday’s pre-cooked chicken the colour of an old stained sink; for sauces that could creosote fences and vegetables so overboiled you could suck them through a straw; for cream desserts that have split, and overbaked tarts with pastry like walnut shells. And the cost! I only use exclamation marks for shouting, which is what I’m doing. THE COST! Despite economies of scale, caterers charge more for this dismal crud than the price of a quality restaurant meal and rising. Why are they allowed to get away with it?</p> \n<p>Precisely because it’s a special event, and nobody likes to admit one of those isn’t actually that special. Plus, avoiding the pitfalls of mass catering dreariness requires a certain radicalism: the willingness to do away with the awful formally plated main course, to sack the poor exploited teenage waitresses and instead concentrate spend on the cooking. The problem is that weddings generally involve young people and for all their youthful irreverence, young people can be rather “small c” conservative. A wedding is a grown-up event, and they have a mythologised notion of what grown-up looks like, which includes a marquee and chicken the colour of a stained sink.</p> \n<p>Recently the savings expert Martin Lewis’s <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/cheaper-weddings\">website </a>said that, when booking a wedding reception at a hotel, tell them it’s for a party rather than for nuptials. Apparently hotels charge more the moment they hear it’s a wedding. This is good advice. It won’t stop the food being crap, but at least it won’t cost you as much.</p> \n<p><em>Tell us about your wedding-day catering disasters and triumphs below</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037088538/8ce08c37-1c1b-4a4a-8303-4d2a79721723-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.'","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T13:30:07Z","lastModified":"2015-06-16T13:30:07Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":350,"contributors":[{"name":"Jay Rayner","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733739943/JayRayner.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jayrayner"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Weddings","Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/weddings","webTitle":"Weddings"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jay Rayner","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jayrayner"}}],"series":{"title":"Happy eater","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/happy-eater"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/wedding-season-crimes-against-food-jay-rayner","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49kzy","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/wedding-season-crimes-against-food-jay-rayner","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/wedding-season-crimes-against-food-jay-rayner"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037088538/8ce08c37-1c1b-4a4a-8303-4d2a79721723-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.’ Photograph: Alamy","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.'","cleanCaption":"‘The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}},"importance":3,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037088538/8ce08c37-1c1b-4a4a-8303-4d2a79721723-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.'","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}}]}],"lastModified":"2015-06-18T07:09:30Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/9ff3-334c-b065-e792","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/9ff3-334c-b065-e792"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle/series/an-apple-a-day/front"}
