That’s why we drink coffee out. But classes are springing up in Melbourne and Sydney, teaching mere mortals how to be baristas at home.<br /></p> \n<p>Nolan Hirte, owner of inner-city Melbourne cafes <a href=\"http://www.proudmarycoffee.com.au/\">Proud Mary</a>, <a href=\"http://staggerlees.com.au/\">Stagger Lees</a> and <a href=\"http://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/food-and-drink/directory/cafe/aunty-pegs-coffee-proud-mary\">Aunty Peg’</a>s, admits not everyone wants to do all that, but if people knew how easy it was to make it properly at home, “your coffee would be so much better.”</p> \n<p>In his most recently opened cafe, Aunty Peg’s in Collingwood, Hirte has set up what he calls the <a href=\"mailto:auntypegs@proudmarycoffee.com.au\"> Genius Bar</a>. </p> \n<p>Four different machines – French Press, AeroPress, Clever Dripper and V60 – are set up along a long wooden bench, allowing customers to come in and be trained by Hirte or one of his staff. “It’s free advice,” says Hirte. “There are many factors to making a good coffee but, once you know them, it’s easy to do it.” </p> \n<p>So here I am, a coffee drinker and a lazy one at that. I don’t weigh the water and I don’t always grind my beans at home, so I’m here to learn how. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ea68c4794ee2ab5c28c3542a8d75c3d0992c294\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/8ea68c4794ee2ab5c28c3542a8d75c3d0992c294/0_160_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There’s more than one way to skin a cat: the pour-over, chemex, aeropress, and vacuum pot. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There’s more than one way to skin a cat: the pour-over, Chemex, AeroPress and vacuum pot. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edmund D. Fountain/ZUMA Press/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>French press</h2> \n<p>We start with the French press, aka the coffee plunger. The grind size is vital, according to Hirte. We are making two cups, and as it’s 15-18g of beans for one cup of coffee (one cup being 250 ml), I weigh out 30g of beans into a silver cup on a highly sensitive digital scale. The bean we use is Ethiopian Yirgacheffe and we use the same bean for each extraction method.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/apr/02/expensive-specialty-coffee-how-much-would-you-be-prepared-to-pay\">Expensive specialty coffee: how much would you be prepared to pay?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Before we go any further we preheat the plunger, just as you would warm a teapot in anticipation of a good brew, with a pour of hot water. The glass takes on the heat and we put the vessel aside.<br /></p> \n<p>Hirte puts the beans that will become our coffee on a grind that is coarser than table salt. <br /></p> \n<p>I place the plunger on the digital scales, then put in the ground coffee and bring the scales back to zero. I weigh the just-boiled water – 500g equals 500ml – pouring it into the plunger and ensuring all the grounds are saturated. We give the mix a stir. </p> \n<p>Hirte puts the timer on for three and a half minutes. “Leave it for longer if you want a stronger brew,” he says. Time’s up and we have a delicious cup of black coffee. It’s fruity, a little nutty and delicate. Not adding milk only emphasises this flavour profile. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"410da25c0d6dbff08dfdb8e25924dab76f8b483e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/410da25c0d6dbff08dfdb8e25924dab76f8b483e/0_0_2848_4276/666.jpg\" alt=\"An old favourite – French press coffee.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An old favourite – French press coffee.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Drip coffee</h2> \n<p>“This got my mum to stop drinking Moccona,” says Hirte. “It’s really clever.” </p> \n<p>The Clever Coffee Dripper is a device that makes a single cup of filtered coffee. With the filter paper, coffee and water poured into the dripper, the extraction happens when the dripper is placed on top of the cup and the coffee is released via a weight-controlled valve. It’s like a filter coffee maker for a single cup rather than a large jug. “This allows us to brew quicker – with the press we had to wait four minutes with this – you just press it when you’re ready and get on with it,” says Hirte.</p> \n<p>This time, I weigh out 14g of coffee, we grind it a little finer than we did for the French press and put the ground coffee into wet filter paper in the dripper. Hirte wets the filter paper, “as we don’t want to taste paper in the coffee”. We put the device on the scale and weigh the water again directly over the ground coffee in the filter paper. <br /></p> \n<p>We only need 250g of water for the one cup and cover the top of the dripper to let the flavours mingle. After two and a half minutes, or however long you want it, place it on the cup and the valve will release the brew. The flavour is denser than you get with the plunger.</p> \n<p>This device is available in any specialty coffee shop that sells equipment, and retails at $20-$35 or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Shrub-Clever-Dripper-C70777/dp/B00EOM5RN0\">on Amazon</a>. </p> \n<h2>AeroPress</h2> \n<p>The AeroPress has garnered its own loyal following in the last few years and I can’t help but wonder what the fuss is about. Hirte says it’s a quick and efficient method of extraction that gets good results.</p> \n<p>This time I measure out 12g of beans for one cup of coffee. I hit 12.1g and Hirte says it’s fine to be slightly over. He preheats the AeroPress and the vessel that will hold the finished coffee and we weigh out the coffee. It is a fine grind. We put the AeroPress and ground coffee on the scales. As we measure out 200ml of water, he says, “Spot on, and then we give it a good stir.” </p> \n<p>After one and a half minutes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ8wvUKa35E \">we flip the device</a>, “like flipping a cake” Hirte says, and we push down gently on the AeroPress. The extraction is through pressure and it brings out a slightly different aroma again. There’s more depth to the smell and it’s a little richer on the palate. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"341044f34e75c4f58449f70739594280abc63444\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/341044f34e75c4f58449f70739594280abc63444/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"The AeroPress method of brewing coffee.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The AeroPress method of brewing coffee.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>V60 (pour-over method)<br /></h2> \n<p>The name is reminiscent of a rev-head’s souped-up engine but it simply refers to the angle of the cone that filters the coffee. This is 21st-century filter coffee, also known as the pour-over method. </p> \n<p>This is Hirte’s favourite method. He makes himself coffee using this method every morning because “the quality and clarity in the cup are really good”.</p> \n<p>I’ve found my rhythm now. I know I will be heating vessels first, weighing beans and weighing water. Hirte says this method is a “bit more involved and you can get this wrong”, although I feel confident we can do it. </p> \n<p>We weigh out the coffee again and we need 28g for two cups. We go 29g – why? “I want more strength in the flavour,” he says. Half a gram can change the strength markedly. “You can weigh out 32g if you want to but it will make it very strong, a tiny change can make a big difference.”<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eff43284270725e00652ebf01995c5494750229\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0eff43284270725e00652ebf01995c5494750229/0_2940_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A barista preparing coffee using the V60 in Kuala Lumpur. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A barista preparing coffee using the V60 in Kuala Lumpur. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Ruslan/Demotix/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hirte pours 80ml of water over the ground coffee. He’s using a kettle with a long thin spout. “The way you pour is very important, you can’t do this with a normal kettle,” he says. He explains that pouring a large amount of water quickly over the grounds can cause “dry patches in the coffee, and it won’t filter properly. Begin in the centre and work the water out to the edges in a circular motion.” <br /></p> \n<p>I pour the next amount, about 100ml, and Hirte finishes off. We stir the coffee and water and it takes about two minutes to filter through. It has the best flavour of all the brews, rich and rounded. I can see why this is his preferred method. </p> \n<p>I have come to the conclusion that Hirte’s right. I am lazy. I don’t know if I will change my ways or just keep coming to places like this to have my coffee weighed and made for me. I’m considering a Clever Drip for home but may find that hard to move away from my stovetop. The new methods I’ve learned are fascinating but old habits are hard to beat. </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e1191ab2e509cd850d47c7feb3b9337aaf073d25/0_78_5472_3284/5472.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3284,"width":5472,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Nan Palmero/Flickr","altText":"Pour Over Coffee with a Hario V60 at Fourteen Eighteen Cafe in USA.

Online dating suggests that “on the internet, nobody knows you’re a perpetual underachiever with a host of complex personal defects” may be more apt. It’s kind of obvious, really; pseudonyms, avatars, carefully crafted dating profiles – the internet lends itself to lying. We’ve all done it – shaving an inch or two off our waistlines, exaggerating the realms of responsibility in a drab office job. Even selecting our most flattering photos requires a slight suspension of disbelief. When a profile translates to a real-life date, some of these lies become apparent immediately. But some don’t.</p> \n<p>It’s happened to me before. I was horrified to find out that the charming, handsome older man I’d been seeing was not in fact a divorced, childless lecturer at an art school, but a married primary school teacher with two children closer to my age than his. And it’s not just me who’s been stung; <a href=\"http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-biggest-lies-in-online-dating/\">stats on the dating website OkCupid show</a> that, on average, people are two inches shorter and 20% less well-off than they claim online.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You could learn to trust in an unforgiving and harsh world. Or you could take a lie detector to all of your dates.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Sometimes people don’t even know they’re lying, as Nicole Ellison, associate professor of information at the University of Michigan, tells me. “People present this kind of embellished self, but it’s not really a lie because it resonates with their ideal self. The extent to which the ideal self can be realised by the time you meet is what governs the acceptability of the lie. If my ideal self is 5kg lighter than I really am, and I won’t meet you for a month, that’s acceptable. But if my ideal self is 50kg lighter, which is probably not going to be attainable in a month, it’s a lie.”</p> \n<p>So, besides hiring a private investigator to vet every right swipe on Tinder, how best to navigate the treacherous waters of online dating? You could learn to trust and love and open up in an unforgiving and harsh world. Or you could, like me, take a <a href=\"http://www.body4real.co.uk/polygraph-machine-home-testing-kit-usb/\">portable lie detector</a> to all of your dates.</p> \n<p>Lie detectors have a bad rap. Often considered the domain of exploitative daytime TV shows, such as Jeremy Kyle or Jerry Springer, they’re sometimes written off as irrelevant gimmicks. The American Psychological Association reveals <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/research/action/polygraph.aspx\">mixed evidence</a>; while some experts rubbish the reliability of polygraphs, others are dedicated proponents. But they’re not admissible as evidence in courts of law as they’re not considered reliable enough.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2012/apr/22/lie-detector-fallibility-criminal-psychology\">Vaughan Bell: the truth about lie detectors</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Aldert Vrij is a professor of applied social psychology, at the University of Portsmouth, who studies verbal and nonverbal cues to deception and lie detection. Polygraphs are unreliable for a number of reasons, he says.</p> \n<p>“There’s no theoretical reason as to why it would work. The assumption is that liars are more anxious than truth-tellers because they have something to hide – the problem is, truth-tellers can be equally nervous too.”</p> \n<p>In the simplest possible terms, polygraphs work by measuring the physiological reactions of a test subject; heart rate, skin galvanisation (change in the electrical properties of the skin), breathing rate and, sometimes, blood pressure. Certain changes in these often indicate a lie, although, as Aldert says, there’s no evidence that any particular physiological pattern underlies deception.</p> \n<p>There’s also a lie-bias (“more people fail the test than pass it – and those who fail include innocents”) and an undue reliance on polygraphs by organisations that employ them.</p> \n<p>“Failing a test means that the person is in trouble – the polygrapher is typically convinced the person is lying, which quickly creates a situation in which the person has to convince others that they’re innocent,” Vrij says. This puts the onus on the potentially innocent accused, which considering that polygraphs can be unreliable is certainly problematic.</p> \n<p>The portable model I used was a little less sophisticated than a static counterpart. It works in much the same way, though; sensors are wrapped around the test subject’s fingers, a clip is attached to their index finger, and a heart rate monitor is strapped to their chest. All this information is then fed into the program, which returns a pleasingly scientific-looking display of heart rate, galvanic skin response and rate of breathing. After a few control questions, you grill your willing test subject and are given the potentially damning verdict.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/feb/09/match-eharmony-algorithm-internet-dating\">The algorithm method: how internet dating became everyone's route to a perfect love match</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I sourced all of my test subjects from two different dating sites: Tinder and OkCupid. Tinder is primarily visual – although you can write a bio, many members bypass this step and select their matches purely on initial attraction. OkCupid allows users to get a little bit more in depth; not only are there standard categories to fill in (a self-summary, lists of interests and hobbies), there’s also a huge selection of user generated questions, the answers to which give you and other users a unique “match percentage”, a rudimentary yardstick by which to judge your potential compatibility. This means that OkCupid users have more scope to lie, although my experiences with Tinder have indicated that lying by omission is also a potential problem.</p> \n<p>None of my dates seemed particularly prone to lying; no hastily cropped profile pictures with half a girlfriend’s arm still in view, no wild claims about jobs or experiences. Two of my four dates did seem a little eager to please, though – they professed to have the same favourite books as me, and were slightly too keen to agree with my feminist politics than their profiles might have suggested. None of this indicated any deep, dark secrets – but they could have been better liars than I was willing to give credit for.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9dd199289387cbc0ae06e476b9cdeca8f3b39292\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436289101073/e504b086-00a7-4afd-a763-f467e41ee78b-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Truth-tellers are potentially just as nervous as liars.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Truth-tellers are potentially just as nervous as liars.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose/Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Requesting, pre-date, that they be hooked to a lie detector and grilled for an article was the first real hurdle, although everybody was far more willing than I expected. I’m not sure whether it was innocent naivety about the type of questions I would ask or misplaced confidence in their ability to manipulate the polygraph, but everybody was weirdly keen.</p> \n<p>Actually hooking them up was the next problem. Publicly strapping a heart rate monitor around the chest of a man you had only met an hour earlier was considerably more awkward than I anticipated. From the bemused looks of bar staff and passersby, I think I may have appeared like an overbearing girlfriend quizzing a boyfriend she thought had strayed. It also affected the tone of the date completely; probably wanting to appear innocent and trustworthy, my dates were all on exceptionally polite and good behaviour from the moment we met, and a thick air of apprehension coloured the atmosphere as we wasted time making small talk before the main event.</p> \n<p>Having the lie detector present also led to what could be considered shifty behaviour – fidgeting, an inability to make eye contact, clear nervousness. It’s totally understandable, and relates back to Vrij’s point about truth-tellers potentially being just as nervous as liars. For some of my dates, this increased dramatically when I started asking the questions.</p> \n<p>As I was dating, I thought I’d cut to the chase and ask the important stuff first: “Are you really single?” Only one person failed, but considering that was 25% of my test subjects, and he was the first one, it was slightly disheartening. But hey, 75% of the people I had selected to spend some ephemeral moments of my mortal existence with <em>weren’t</em> in a relationship already, so that was nice.</p> \n<p>Next: “Did you come on the date just to have sex with me?” and perhaps the more subtle version of this: “Do you really want a relationship?” 50/50 lies on both of these, although one subject (the one with the secret girlfriend) answered “yes” and “no” respectively to them, and was telling the truth, which made me suspect maybe he might not be my soulmate or future father of my children.</p> \n<p>The mere fact that I was testing my dates seemed to compel them all to startling and uncomfortable honesty. “Do you have a weird relationship with your mother?” isn’t a question somebody would normally ask on a first date, and certainly not one anyone would answer with any modicum of emotional honesty, but the presence of the polygraph meant we talked about it in a way that would previously have been impossible. One guy, seemingly buoyed by a combination of being polygraphed and red wine, admitted apropos of nothing that he loves having women spit in his mouth. Likewise: “Would you change anything about my appearance?” doesn’t often appear on lists of recommended pickup lines, but I asked it and boy did they answer. (The answer was “yes”, in case you didn’t realise. A resounding, 75% yes, and a solitary 25% lie.)</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/apr/12/bumble-dating-app-women-call-shots-whitney-wolfe\">WLTM Bumble – A dating app where women call the shots</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I wasn’t particularly willing to overlook these lies – wanting to change someone’s appearance in some small way might not be deal-breakingly bad, but it did hurt my pride quite considerably. The act of lying itself was often more annoying to me than the subject of the lie; I would probably date somebody who had previously cheated on a partner, but not somebody who would cheat and then lie about it so well.</p> \n<p>Rather disappointingly, none of my dates had lied too dramatically on their profiles, and they all passed when I asked them about this. There was some exaggeration, of course, but nothing more dramatic than a polished list of favourite books or some carefully filtered profile pictures. It seemed like the online element of the dating process hadn’t actually compelled my dates to lie any more than they would in the offline world – and it comes back to the idea of the “embellished self”.</p> \n<p>“It’s not like when we go online it’s this whole other virtual world where we become different people and completely different norms apply,” Ellison explained. “The characteristics of online communication don’t necessarily encourage people to lie, but they do enable it. What it allows people to do is present a kind of improved self that isn’t really a lie because it resonates with their self-identity.”</p> \n<p>All my dates had done online was provide me with an aspirational version of themselves; a cultivated image of who they wanted to be in reality. Sometimes they fell short of that – but then sometimes so do I.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It can be difficult to assess who really is a successful, well-endowed entrepreneur and who isn’t.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>So how best to avoid running into a catfish online? Unfortunately, without the non-verbal cues that consciously and unconsciously colour offline interaction, it can be difficult to assess who really is a successful, well-endowed entrepreneur and who isn’t. Shifty body language, eye signals and unnecessary fidgeting have all been cited as good indicators that someone is lying, but there’s just no way of gauging this level of information online.</p> \n<p>There are a few tricks that Ellison’s test cases used to sniff out a liar, though: asking the same question on a few different occasions and comparing the responses is one, as well as keeping a copy of the original profile and comparing it to later answers. There’s also the classic Google <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1325808?hl=en\">reverse image search</a>, through which I have discovered several fake profiles. One girl actually used a picture of model Miranda Kerr, but had forgotten to crop the photo attribution from the bottom of the picture. Unfortunately not every attempt to hoodwink is as cack-handed as that, and reverse searching suspiciously attractive profile images often reveals reappropriated images from modelling portfolios and social profiles.</p> \n<p>As for the polygraph? It may be a self-evident truth, but it turns out that testing all your partners in a public place is actually pretty awkward, potentially kind of weird, and definitely not a recommended first date activity. And there are some questions it really is best not to know the answer to.</p> \n<h2>Romantic desires<br /></h2> \n<p>In his book <em>Quirkology: How We Discover the Big Truths in Small Things</em>, psychologist Richard Wiseman finds that a 70/30 divide between personal information and desired traits from a partner <a href=\"http://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2015/02/09/ebmed-2014-110101\">generates the most responses</a> from an internet dating profile.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>A 2013 University of Chicago <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/25/10135.full.pdf\">study</a> found that 5.96% of married partners who met online separate, compared with 7.67% of those who found the spark offline.</li> \n <li>Online, 56% of emails are sent by users seeking a long-term relationship, rather than something casual, according to a <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=895442&amp;download=yes\">2006 University of Chicago</a> paper. The same <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=895442&amp;download=yes\">study</a> also showed that, while male interest is unaffected by jobs, women are 8.6% more likely to approach those in legal work compared with university students, 7.7% more drawn to firefighters and law enforcers, 6.7% to members of the military and 5% to health workers, compared to the baseline appeal of a student.</li> \n <li>The 2006 study also showed that women with a body mass index of 24-26 are 10% less likely to be approached by men than those with a BMI under 20, but women prefer men with a BMI over 20. So it’s no surprise that a <a href=\"http://psp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/34/8/1023\">2008 Cornell University study</a> found women underreport their weight by an average of 3.8kg compared with 0.9kg for men. Men are guilty of deception too, overstating their height by an average of 1.4cm compared with 0.08cm for women. Among study participants 81% lied in their profile.</li> \n <li><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2009.01420.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false\">Another Cornell study</a>, from 2009, found that female photos were more misleading. Profile pictures of women online daters had an average of three discrepancies – from photo enhancement, for example – whereas men had an average of 1.33.</li> \n <li>The same research team <a href=\"http://\">later reported</a> that being female, unattractive or wanting a short-term relationship increases your tendency to use misleading pictures, and these characteristics can collectively account for 35.3% of all photo trickery.</li> \n <li>Education and looks are searchable on dating websites, but it is harder to glean information people really care about such as humour and conversation, say academics at the Harvard Business School. Their <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094996808700069\">2008 study</a> participants gave online dating an average of only 5.5 on a 10-point scale of enjoyment, compared with seven for offline dating.</li> \n <li><a href=\"http://smg.media.mit.edu/papers/atf/fiore_donath_chi2005_short.pdf\">Research from the MIT Media Lab</a> found that marital status was identical in 64% of online dater couples in contact, wanting children in 54% and the number of children in 39%, suggesting that sameness is attractive.</li> \n <li>According to a <a href=\"http://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2015/02/09/ebmed-2014-110101.full\">2014 Nottingham Trent University study</a> men are drawn to user names indicating physical attractiveness (Cutie), while women prefer those suggesting intelligence (Cultured).

Being a mother was acceptable if it wasn’t one’s raison d’&ecirc;tre – as a side mention it was passable, as a passion it indicated only a lack of capacity and imagination.</p> \n<p>In the west, this perception is now almost universal. Nurturing a child is considered to be squandering the time and talent of the educated. Female high-achievers now hunger for “challenges” in place of connections; the chancellor of the exchequer said recently that mothers who stay at home to look after their children are making a lifestyle choice, as if it were on a par with nudism or polyamory.</p> \n<p>This is reinforced by the behaviour of women in public life. A week after giving birth to her third son, the actor Cate Blanchett was addressing a summit. Rachida Dati, a former minister in the French cabinet, returned to parliament, in heels, five days after a Caesarean section.</p> \n<p>Such behaviour is not surprising given the menial status of motherhood. Our cultural take on success and heroism – the ideals of any&nbsp;civilisation&nbsp;– reflect a prejudice that is staggering. Throughout human history, heroism has almost exclusively been attributed to men. Although heroism pivots on courage, self-sacrifice and the preservation of other lives, the billions of mothers who have&nbsp;died in childbirth are forgotten.</p> \n<p>In 2013, four times as many women died giving birth around the world than there were casualties in the Syrian conflict, yet there were no headlines, crisis bulletins, aid packages or expressions of public outrage. The 293,000 women who die in pregnancy and childbirth every year (and the seven to 10 million who suffer severe or chronic illnesses caused by pregnancy-related complications) do so without public recognition of any kind. Heads of state do not stand in silence for the mothers who have fallen.</p> \n<p>The seriousness of childbirth on every level – emotional, spiritual, physical – for mothers is not only ignored, but derided. “Congrats! You’ve had the baby … now what?” fitness magazines ask, before suggesting “the general rule of thumb is to head back to the gym six weeks after birth”. Implicit in such advice is the understanding that having a baby is an event like any other, that a mother’s instinct to place her infant’s needs before her own is old hat, and that it is not only acceptable but correct for a mother to separate from her baby.</p> \n<p>A mother’s attachment to her child begins in hospital, where mothers are made to feel inferior to professionals in relation to their infants, then separated from them for examinations, bathing etc. One mother who gave birth in an elegant private hospital told me her son “was whisked off to neo-natal intensive care without me even having had a chance to greet him.” Despite having had a C-section, she staggered three floors down to see him, only to be forbidden to touch him. “They told me that he was too fragile and it was too much trouble to move all the equipment. Bonding, love and warmth had no value to them.”</p> \n<p>John Krystal, professor of psychiatry and neurobiology at the Yale School of Medicine, cites the recent discovery that the autonomic activity (heart rate and other involuntary nervous system activity) of two-day-old sleeping babies is 176% higher during maternal separation. “This is a major physiological stressor for the infant,” he concluded. Human beings are the only mammals to separate mothers from their infants. Scientists have, for decades, separated newborn animals from their mothers to study the damage to the evolving brain. But little has changed. Children are still placed in childcare and then go to school while adults work themselves into cardiac arrests. What’s lost in the wash is love.</p> \n<p>We are scripting simple happiness out of our lives. Throughout history, the most brutal cultures have been distinguished by maternal-infant separation. That earliest relationship is the very foundation of our ability to love and bond in later life but it requires quiet, calm, sustained proximity to one’s baby. Despite this, we continue to in effect bully mothers into returning to the workforce before the uterus has had time to shrink.</p> \n<p>The magnitude of childbirth is minimised for economic purposes, blighting an experience that could otherwise be infused with the purest bliss. At the most vulnerable time of their lives, mothers are repeatedly failed by the community. The post-partum confinement period – a 30 to 40-day tradition throughout China, Greece, India, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam – allows mothers not just to recuperate after birth, but to adjust to motherhood at a pace conducive to maternal-infant bonding. Hurried through the process, women in their millions are failing to give birth without intervention and to breastfeed.</p> \n<p>The joy and pleasure in new motherhood has been de-emphasised – and there is a cost. Our culture has come to be defined by adrenaline. From the way we wake up (strong coffee, blaring alarms, television, radio) to the way we mate (Tinder, Grindr, Blendr, Tingle and so on), the bar is set by technology: jarring, bright, instant. But babies cannot be jump-started and the acceleration of life as it’s lived now is toxic in terms of parenting. Life comes at us, and we react. Intimacy, on the other hand, is quiet, slow. There is no expediting love. And it is precisely at this point that our culture has started to fall apart.</p> \n<p>The fact that there is a need to specify attachment in relation to parenting tells us everything we need to know about the rupture between 21st century man and his heart.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a8d3f91456cc50e62d2e1634a846d5d683d3938d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436197335004/1150271c-fdf7-41d0-a440-4f6fab8d9ab3-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"John Bowlby, who wrote that it is crucial for the mental health of the child, to 'experience a warm, intimate and continuous relationship with his mother.'\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Bowlby, who wrote that it is crucial for the mental health of the child, to ‘experience a warm, intimate and continuous relationship with his mother.’</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Attachment theory began taking shape during the second world war, when Anna Freud, the founder of psychoanalytic child psychology (and Sigmund’s daughter), observed children separated from their families for safe-keeping during the blitz were suffering developmental problems. Despite sometimes receiving superior physical and intellectual care, these children were subject to fits of aggression, emotional withdrawal, headbanging, bed-wetting and soiling, tantrums, regression and other behavioural disturbances. Freud wrote movingly of “the depth and seriousness of this grief of a small child” when their attachments were disrupted.</p> \n<p>This laid the groundwork for the psychiatrist John Bowlby’s exploration of the issue. In 1951, he published a monograph describing how essential it is for the mental health of the infant and young child to “experience a warm, intimate and continuous relationship with his mother (or permanent mother-substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment. Given this relationship, the emotions of anxiety and guilt, which in excess characterise mental illness, will develop in a moderate and organised way.”</p> \n<p>Parental devotion has an irreversible impact on children. Only 20-25% of the brain is complete at birth and, even then, only in terms of autonomic function (heart rate, breathing, etc); the rest of the brain is formed by the infant’s experience of love or by its absence. The first three years of life in particular are critical in shaping both the capacity to form loving relationships in adulthood and the stability that makes happiness possible.</p> \n<p>“Empathy, caring, sharing, inhibition of aggression, capacity to love and a host of other characteristics of a healthy, happy and productive person are related to the core attachment capabilities which are formed in infancy and early childhood,” noted Professor Bruce Perry, the renowned child mental health researcher. Given that this is the case, the current epidemic of disconnection makes it clear that our current child-rearing methods do not equip us with the capacity to sustain intimacy.</p> \n<p>If a child’s early experiences of care-giving are inconsistent, insensitive or indifferent, certain biochemical systems – the stress response and emotional systems among them – can be affected. To be abandoned by mother in infancy – and the neonatal brain is wired by evolution to interpret being left alone even briefly as abandonment – not only damages our ability to connect with others, but creates the self-loathing that can destroy a life.</p> \n<p>Effective mothering requires not only a sustained investment of energy by the mother, but an equal investment of energy into the mother by her partner, family and community. The change we need demands a revision of priorities. We need to rally round mothers, enabling them to bond with their babies so that the next generation does not suffer the same wounds.</p> \n<p>Critically, we need to understand that far from being drudges, mothers are, in fact, creating the very course of our species’ future.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Mama Love, Motherhood and Revolution by Antonella Gambotto-Burke is published by Pinter &amp; Martin, &pound;11.99.
