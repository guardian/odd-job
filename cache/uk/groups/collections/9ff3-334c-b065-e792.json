A nation that should long ago have moved past these&nbsp;ugly incidents is exposed for what it is: bitterly divided on the manner in which this pastime should be summarised for&nbsp;the public.</p> \n<p>Every year, Wimbledon coverage fails to prove acceptable in one way or&nbsp;another, and the pressure cooker threatens to blow. You can feel it simmering now: gathering its ire around&nbsp;<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/01/bbcs-new-wimbledon-highlights-show-mauled-by-critics-and-viewers\" title=\"\">the BBC’s Wimbledon highlights show</a>, with presenter Clare Balding just one ill-received aside about court times away from lighting the touchpaper on a&nbsp;conflagration neither she nor those beginning to coalesce into a resistance will be able&nbsp;to control.</p> \n<p>On Thursday morning, the Today programme ran a primetime discussion about the merits or otherwise of Wimbledon 2Day. In the Daily Mail, the&nbsp;show was described as <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3146621/It-s-like-Gear-meets-Play-School-JAN-MOIR-savages-Wimbledon-s-new-highlights-s-driving-fans-mad.html\" title=\"\">“a travesty and a tragedy”</a> – and is there anyone out there other than the most unreconstructed sane person who imagines that to be something other than an understatement?</p> \n<p>As always with these things, lack of&nbsp;education plays a huge part, and the&nbsp;sheer ignorance of most participants in rows about tennis coverage is perhaps the logical result of generations of tactical neglect. Look at the Centre Court crowd – I know you’re not supposed to fall back on profiling but you’re basically dealing with people whose life choices have been so limited they applaud when a&nbsp;pigeon lands on the net. The&nbsp;umpire’s reminder to switch&nbsp;off mobile phones nearly brings the house&nbsp;down. You can&nbsp;try all&nbsp;you like to fob these people off with&nbsp;some more platitudes about the fact it’s only a highlights show, but&nbsp;in the end you have to face up to the&nbsp;fact that they feel like they have nothing to lose.</p> \n<p>Where now? Well, I hope we can rely on tennis leaders to appeal for calm. But with 10 days more of play in SW19, it’s&nbsp;difficult to see these increasingly unavoidable tensions not spilling over into some sort of generational moment. Still, maybe it’s time.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/afa985853e646a58492bd6f5bd0a1f48f5982a37/16_756_3266_1959/3266.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1959,"width":3266,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer","altText":"GD*46947404<br>Observer magazine OM this much i know TMIK Clare Balding photographed at the BT Sport studios in queen elizabeth olympic park 18/09/2014","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T17:15:22Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T23:01:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":482,"contributors":[{"name":"Marina Hyde","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733743785/MarinaHyde.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/marinahyde"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Wimbledon 2015","BBC","Celebrity","Life and style","Tennis","Wimbledon","Sport","Media","Clare Balding","Television & radio"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/celebrity","webTitle":"Celebrity"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/clare-balding","webTitle":"Clare Balding"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Marina Hyde","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/marinahyde"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2015/jul/02/wimbledon2day-row-explode-all-over-centre-court-clare-balding-bbc","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ab98","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2015/jul/02/wimbledon2day-row-explode-all-over-centre-court-clare-balding-bbc","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2015/jul/02/wimbledon2day-row-explode-all-over-centre-court-clare-balding-bbc"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/afa985853e646a58492bd6f5bd0a1f48f5982a37/16_756_3266_1959/3266.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1959,"width":3266,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Clare Balding: causing consternation on Henman Hill.

For instance, did you know that the Bee Gees have sold more than 200m records? That nearly 10 million people watched <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jan/02/tv-ratings-mrs-browns-boys-dethrones-queen\">the Mrs Brown’s Boys Christmas special</a>? Or that <a href=\"https://www.npdgroup.co.uk/wps/portal/npd/uk/news/press-releases/pubs-continue-to-build-on-food-success/\">less than one-in-10 visits to the pub</a> are now solely for the purpose of having a drink?</p> \n<p>“Sorry, come again?” you may ask of that last factoid, and you would be right to question it. Despite <a href=\"http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Trends-Reports/Dining-trends-Fewer-than-one-in-10-pub-visits-now-solely-drink-occasions\">the headlines that greeted this latest research</a> from market analysts NPD, its central thrust – that British pubs are now primarily places to eat rather than drink – is not quite<em> </em>as dramatic as it first appears. NPD reported that 92 out of every 100 pub visits now involve the consumption of food. But when I asked NPD to clarify this, it transpires that it counts crisps and nuts. “If the panellist considers a pint and crisps as their dinner, they can declare them as such,” said a spokesperson.</p> \n<p>That is a less resounding death knell for the quick pint than was <a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/articles/358129/pub-food-on-the-up-as-operators-diversify\">reported at the time</a>, but it does not soften NPD’s wider message. For those who bemoan the march of the gastropub and the way that many pubs now marginalise drinkers, this report makes grim reading. There are now 100m breakfasts sold in pubs annually, up 128% since 2008. The number of servings of alcohol in pubs has dropped by more than a quarter over the same period, while consumption of tea and coffee has risen by more than 11%. It appears to confirm what analysts and the huge pub companies have been saying for years: that the pint and the traditional boozer is in decline and, to survive, your local must become a family-friendly, food-led pub.</p> \n<p>You can see that happening all around you. Twenty-nine pubs shut each week, and those that survive are, increasingly, places to dine not drink. They are effectively restaurants in former pub spaces. I have nothing against that per se. However, no one could argue that the character of a pub is not hugely altered (that something special is lost, even), in that shift of focus from booze to food. Moreover, while this broad generational change is irrefutable, the propaganda around food-led pubs as the only viable business model has shut out discussion of potential alternatives. There are, although you might not know it, purist drinking dens bucking this rush to food.</p> \n<p>The last few years has seen a surge in pubs where you might get a bowl of wasabi peas (the most illogical pub snack ever) or, at most, a cheese barm, but whose offer is very much based around fantastic drinks, not food. The craft beer movement has been a game-changer in that respect, with – to name but a few – Manchester’s Port Street Beer House, Cask Tavern and Smithfield Tavern; Conwy’s Albion; the Black Dove in Brighton; the Wellington and Craven Arms in Birmingham; or the York, Euston and Harrogate Taps all thriving while doing at most the bare minimum of food. </p> \n<p>In some ways, the fast-growing <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/09/community-fixers-mighty-rise-micropub\">micropub movement</a> (small, no-frills pubs) is an implicit kick-back against the rise of shiny, barnlike family food pubs. In Manchester, there has been a remarkable recent growth in suburban bars that exclusively specialise in great beer. Many of these – Heaton Hops in Stockport, <a href=\"http://prairie-schooner-taphouse.co.uk/\">the Prairie Schooner in Urmston</a>, BarBeerian in Whitefield – double-up as bottle shops, too, a formula replicated at, for instance, Cardiff’s Gravity Station or Tall Boys in Leeds. The message? Stock high-quality, unusual drinks and that, in itself, can turn a pub into a destination. </p> \n<p>That specialism and sense of occasion is something cocktail bars have exploited for years, without feeling the need to serve food. At the same time, a new wave of informal London wine bars, such as Vindinista and <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/london/bars-pubs/sager-wilde\">Sager + Wilde</a>, while serving food, don’t trouble themselves much beyond short menus comprising small plates, sandwiches, cheeses and charcuterie. Fundamentally, these are places to drink exciting wine. The food is almost incidental.</p> \n<p>I love restaurants, but they have a completely different dynamic to pubs and bars. Pubs are democratic, communal, potentially raucous adult spaces in a way that restaurants (almost) never are. And that is something precious. Let us raise a glass, therefore, to those landlords fighting the good fight for the pure appreciation of fine alcohol, the ennobling effects of a boozy atmosphere and a world where you can walk into a pub and not find all the tables reserved for dinner.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435080905098/756df9f1-89f9-4e6c-b445-a34051ffeb78-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Oli Scarff/Getty Images","altText":"Food for thought ... can pubs get by without going gastro?","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T10:41:15Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T10:44:46Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":648,"contributors":[{"name":"Tony Naylor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/tonynaylor"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Pubs","Food & drink","Restaurants","Life and style","Alcohol","Society","Beer","Wine"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/pubs","webTitle":"Pubs"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/restaurants","webTitle":"Restaurants"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/alcohol","webTitle":"Alcohol"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/beer","webTitle":"Beer"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/wine","webTitle":"Wine"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tony Naylor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/tonynaylor"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/must-pubs-serve-food-to-survive","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3mq","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/must-pubs-serve-food-to-survive","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/must-pubs-serve-food-to-survive"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435080905098/756df9f1-89f9-4e6c-b445-a34051ffeb78-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Food for thought ... can pubs get by without going gastro?

Recent incidents involving tacks scattered on roads and neck-high wire strung across cycle paths have taken the vilification of ‘Lycra louts’ to a whole new level</p>","byline":"Peter Walker","body":"<p>On 14 June 2015, Alec James was taking part in the <a href=\"http://www.velothon-wales.co.uk/en/\">Velothon Wales</a>, a 90-mile mass bike ride on closed roads through countryside near Cardiff. The 28-year-old press officer, a keen cyclist, had invited along some London friends and was particularly proud to show them the region where he grew up.</p> \n<p>But his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AEWJ/status/610122967528415232\">day ended early.</a> “I was about 30 miles in, on a fast downhill stretch, and I saw one rider on my left go down,” James says. “I moved to avoid him and started to slow. Then my front tyre blew out and I went over. I rolled with the bike for a good few yards, bashed my head, breaking the helmet. I was doing about 30mph. I got deep lacerations on my leg. I couldn’t walk properly for a week.”</p> \n<p>After he struggled to his feet, James found a drawing pin in his front tyre, then saw a number of other tacks scattered on the road, at a point seemingly chosen to cause the most danger.</p> \n<p>A fortnight before this, police in Brighton <a href=\"http://www.sussex.police.uk/pressline/2015/05/29/danger-wires-warning-for-people-using-coldean-woods,-brighton\">had issued a warning</a> about wires strung between trees on a popular bike track through woodland, saying two such hazards had been spotted in as many days. A week earlier, in Dorset, <a href=\"http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/12955696.Cyclist_hurt_after_fishing_line_strung_across_path_at_Moors_Valley/\">a rider suffered cuts</a> after hitting 15 strands of fishing line stretched across a cycle path in a country park.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f6b97f84a823fa1dbc35730a2070066120485805\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f6b97f84a823fa1dbc35730a2070066120485805/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"Alec James after his crash at the Velothon Wales..\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alec James after his crash at the Velothon Wales.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alec James</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the same week, several riders taking part in Redhill Cycling Club’s 70th anniversary road race, on back roads in the Surrey countryside, suffered punctures after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redhillcc/status/612288507516710912\">drawing pins were scattered on the route</a>. No one was hurt, but that was mainly down to luck, says Adrian Webb, the club’s chairman: “You can guess how dangerous it can be if you have an 80-man peloton and someone punctures unexpectedly. These guys have got slick tyres pumped up very strongly for a race – there’s every chance a tyre can explode. If a rider comes off, there could a mass pile-up.”</p> \n<p>Such incidents remain rare, and any such physical threat to cyclists is tiny when compared with the danger from other motor vehicles, especially lorries. One of the many paradoxical elements about cycling in Britain is that it is both far safer than many people think – numerous studies have shown it is many times more likely to lengthen a lifespan through increased exercise than shorten it – but notably more perilous than it could be.</p> \n<p>Annual government road casualty figures for 2014, released last week, show the number of seriously injured riders rose 8.2% against the year before, a bigger increase than that in the number of cyclists. In London, in particular, the focus is on the danger posed by lorries, especially construction trucks. On 24 June, thousands of protesting cyclists brought the busy road junction at Bank to a halt after 26-year-old consultant Ying Tao was crushed by a tipper truck two days earlier. She was the eighth cyclist killed in the city in 2015, seven of whom died in incidents involving lorries, six of the victims women.</p> \n<p>Another paradox is that even as cities such as London and Bristol are, finally, building segregated bike lanes, proven to be the best way to prevent such deaths, the tone of the debate around cycling has arguably become more polarised and poisonous than ever. Some campaigners worry that the sabotage incidents are linked to a public and media narrative in which cyclists are demonised equally as both anarchic lawbreakers and smug, humourless killjoys, sausage thighs squeezed into unsightly DayGlo Lycra.</p> \n<p>The debate around cycling occasionally bears comparison with the treatment of so-called societal outgroups, according to <a href=\"http://www.bath.ac.uk/psychology/staff/ian-walker/\">Dr Ian Walker</a>, a psychologist at Bath University. <a href=\"http://opus.bath.ac.uk/9332/\">One of his experiments</a> to research attitudes towards cyclists involved riding around his home town wearing a long brunette wig with an electronic distance gauge attached to his bike, to see whether drivers gave female cyclists more overtaking space than men. They did, even when the “woman” was 6ft tall and, for the drivers who happened to look in their rearview mirror, surprisingly hairy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a73debb964f202d5480a72db202d15349c1064c\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/9a73debb964f202d5480a72db202d15349c1064c/0_110_5020_3011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cycling in traffic in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cycling in traffic in London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Images Group/Getty Images/Universal Images Group</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“What you see in discourses about cycling is the absolute classic 1960s and 1970s social psychology of prejudice,” he explains. “It’s exactly those things that used to be done about minority ethnic groups and so on – the overgeneralisation of negative traits, under-representation of negative behaviours by one’s own group, that kind of thing. It’s just textbook prejudiced behaviour.”</p> \n<p>This is played out in the media, on television and radio and, most virulently, via social media and website comments. Under a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3136411/Eighth-cyclist-killed-London-2015-Oxford-graduate-26.html\">Daily Mail story last week</a> about Ying’s death, the most-recommended reader comment until it was deleted read: “Why not ban cyclists? They don’t pay road tax.”</p> \n<p>This is a particularly pervasive point, and one that ignores the fact that “road tax” – a car-based fund set aside for highway construction – was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23694438\">scrapped in 1937</a>. Vehicle excise duty, its replacement, is based on emissions, meaning cyclists, if liable, would be zero-rated anyway.</p> \n<p>Other comments under the piece surmised that such deaths happen because of rampant cyclist lawbreaking, notably jumping red lights. Again, this doesn’t bear scrutiny. An <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/15/cycling-bike-accidents-study\">analysis of police statistics</a> found a failure to stop at a red light or stop sign was a factor in just 2% of serious adult cycling incidents; in contrast, drivers were deemed solely to blame about two-thirds of the time.</p> \n<p>Lawbreaking is one of the difficulties of the debate for cyclists. The average person on a bike is arguably no more likely to break a law then their peer in a car. However, when they do so it’s more obvious, less normalised. People notice a cyclist pedalling through a red light, whereas speeding – which 80% of drivers <a href=\"http://www.ctc.org.uk/blog/roger-geffen/rac-says-%E2%80%9Cdrivers-need-help%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-and-they%E2%80%99re-right\">admit to doing regularly</a> – is often ignored, despite the immeasurably greater human cost this causes.</p> \n<p>Chris Boardman, the Olympic track cycling champion who is now <a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/campaigning/article/cam20130530-campaigning-Chris-Boardman-MBE-0\">policy adviser to British Cycling</a>, recalls appearing on a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05vy4kk\">recent episode of BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours</a> to discuss whether cyclists should be obliged to take out insurance, a discussion prompted in part by an incident where a pavement-riding cyclist struck a young child. This premise lacked context, Boardman argues: “When you put it into perspective, there’s 36 people killed on pavements by cars, buses and lorries every year – that’s just on pavements – versus about one every three years from a cyclist. It’s ludicrous the programme was even on. Nobody seems to feel obliged to look at any facts.”</p> \n<p>Elsewhere over recent years, there has often not been any attempt at balance, even in generally sober parts of the media. Several years before anyone thought of stringing wire across Brighton woodland, Times columnist Matthew Parris <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/matthewparris/article2044185.ece\">half-jokingly advocated</a> a similar idea in a piece titled: “What’s smug and deserves to be decapitated?”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f37c7a712158bc37f0b7763d22085e408181059\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/2f37c7a712158bc37f0b7763d22085e408181059/0_0_1999_3000/666.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Boardman.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Boardman.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Marsland/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In November 2013, the Spectator ran as its <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9073071/off-your-bike/\">cover story</a> a long rant by Rod Liddle at cyclists, describing them as oversensitive lawbreakers who deliberately hold up traffic while wearing “pompous little pointy plastic hats”. Even the Observer had <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2013/apr/28/stop-pampering-scottish-cyclists\">an article</a> in April of the same year by a regular columnist, Kevin McKenna, calling cyclists a scourge, complete with jokes about middle-class bike-riding fops and their “cous cous packed lunches”.</p> \n<p>BBC Radio Kent, meanwhile, ran a phone-in show about road safety last week under the banner: “Should cyclists be banned in cities?”</p> \n<p>A recent twist on this narrative is the idea of a two-wheeled versus four-wheeled “war” on the roads, typically illustrated by dramatic cyclist helmet camera footage. “Many road rage incidents have been prompted by the ongoing war between motorists and cyclists,” boomed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvthismorning/status/611899986352177152\">a promotional tweet</a> last week from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvthismorning/status/611899986352177152\">ITV’s This Morning</a> programme. “Whose side are you on?”</p> \n<p>Boardman is scathing about such hyperbole, not least because cyclists and drivers are very often the same people – British Cycling data shows 90% of its members also own cars.</p> \n<p>“You’ve got 2% of vulnerable road users versus 98% in two tonnes of steel,” Boardman says. “How can you possibly have a war? I think that’s called a massacre. What could a cyclist possibly do to somebody in a car?”</p> \n<p>He is, however, wary of connecting this media narrative with the idea of an increase in attacks and sabotage against cyclists: “There’s about 250,000 assaults on the streets a year. If we’re going to accuse other people of taking things out of context, we need to not do that. There are always going to be idiots and people who are evil or just plain stupid.”</p> \n<p>Others profess to see the hint of a connection, at least locally. Mark Strong, a transport consultant and cycling advocate in Brighton, says the debate about bikes in his home city has been increasingly toxic ahead of the wire-trap incidents, partly inflamed by the recently ousted Green-led council’s introduction of new bike lanes and parking restrictions.</p> \n<p>“There is an element of legitimisation towards dislike of cyclists from the attitudes of the press and politicians,” he says. “It’s almost an official endorsement to be anti-cyclist. And for everyone who thinks it’s now OK to shout at a cyclist, at the tip of the bell curve there will be somebody who think it’s OK to stretch wires across bike paths.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/aldred-rachel\">Rachel Aldred</a>, a Westminster University sociologist who studies transport issues, argues that British cyclists suffer because, unlike in countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark, bikes are seen as frivolous, compared with the serious, adult business of driving. She says: “It’s as if you’re doing something you shouldn’t be doing on the roads, almost like you’re playing in the street and getting in the way of the traffic, like you’re a child. There’s also this dual way you can be stigmatised as a cyclist – it was historically seen as something for people with no choice, but now it’s seen as something for people who have a choice. It’s a leisure or play thing that they shouldn’t be doing in this inappropriate place.”</p> \n<p>Aldred has also studied the environment cyclists face on the road, and her findings are alarming. In <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/11/female-cyclists-bad-driving-harassment-study-uk-women-men-near-miss\">a pioneering paper </a>published this month she finds cyclists experience on average one “very scary” incident involving another road user every week. Female riders suffer disproportionately more, thought to be because drivers are less patient with their slower average speeds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be44892e32680443df8bf6e54bfaec6d5c4e8b8a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/be44892e32680443df8bf6e54bfaec6d5c4e8b8a/0_696_4862_2919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman cycling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woman cycling.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Image Bank/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Do toxic anti-cyclist comments in newspapers or on social media contribute to this road environment? It’s impossible to prove. But some believe this is the case. “I’d be very surprised if that’s not happening,” says Walker. “It is acceptable to sit in a pub and say things like: ‘Bloody cyclists, we should run them off the road.’ Or to write things that are, literally, calling for murder. You can’t do that with other groups.”</p> \n<p>In 2013, <a href=\"http://opus.bath.ac.uk/37890/\">Walker led a study</a> that saw a co-researcher sent on to the roads on a bike in seven different outfits, with a gauge measuring the space drivers gave him overtaking. Four outfits made him look like a cyclist of varying experience, while three had bright yellow waistcoats with written messages. One read: “Novice cyclist: please pass slowly.” Another: “Polite: please slow down.” And finally: “Police: camera cyclist.”</p> \n<p>The data for 5,700 overtakes showed just one garb made an appreciable difference to driver behaviour: the one saying “police”. Here, the average passing distance was notably bigger, while the proportion of vehicles who passed very near the bike was significantly lower. In contrast, the tabard saying “polite” saw almost twice as many potentially dangerous passes.</p> \n<p>The lesson seems clear: drivers are perfectly able to distinguish between different types of rider, and to read the message. But rather than adjusting their driving to the cyclist’s apparent vulnerability, the only real trigger for them to take proper care is a possible legal sanction.</p> \n<p>Will things change? Bike campaigners hope London’s new network of segregated cycle “superhighways”, now being built, will increase the number of riders, and act as an example to other cities. Cycling as everyday transport, and cyclists whose progress is separated from that of motor vehicles, will, they hope, drain the poison from the debate.</p> \n<p>Such tangled considerations remain far from the mind of James, now back at work and again on the bike, though with a pedal-shaped chunk out of his thigh from his high-speed fall in South Wales: “It was the worst bike crash I’ve had by far, and all the more upsetting as it was nothing that I did. Perversely, I was quite lucky with the injuries I had. If this kind of sabotage continues, someone will get killed.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> This article was amended on 2 July 2015.

Is there a way to turn around someone making a sexual innuendo about something on my profile?</em></p> \n<p><em>I do get a lot of people making positive comments about my apple analogy. And then I get a message from a great-looking guy and it’s about something inappropriate. Very disappointing.</em></p> \n<p><em>I’m 44 and on the verge of giving up!</em></p> \n<p><em>Help, please.</em></p> \n<p>Hey you,</p> \n<p>I’m including a screengrab of your ‘apple analogy’ for our readers’ sake.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5b03489811ce079d6d43fdfe06d3f831d2504036\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435847701734/d7d701c8-f88c-41e0-9dff-a48146e52b2c-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"rotten apples\" width=\"358\" height=\"418\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Now, here’s a theory: by including this poetic statement about sexual restraint in your profile, I think it may be having the reverse-psychology effect of inspiring men to email you “inappropriate” things. </p> \n<p>Is it possible to turn one of them from sleazebag to Prince Charming? Not really. To be honest, they’re probably not men who you want to date, even if they’re great-looking. They’re messaging you because they like to get a rise out of a woman they suspect may be prudish. They’re not trying to connect with you. They’re … bad apples.<br /></p> \n<p>But here’s a thought. You note that you’re very “open and flirtatious” but that you don’t want people to know that before you go on a date with them. I think that could be a little self-defeating. You also mentioned that you get a lot of “positive remarks” about your apple analogy, and yet you remain disappointed by the men who you’re meeting. Could it be possible that it’s of interest to men at extreme ends of the spectrum – prudish or sleazy – and not the guys who you really want to meet?</p> \n<p>I’m not recommending that you edit your profile to be something that you’re uncomfortable with or that doesn’t reflect you. But sometimes it’s OK to leave something out. </p> \n<p>I often advise other folks not to list things that they don’t like on their profiles, and I think basically the same principle applies here: you’re telling men that you’re not easy, but not what you can be. If you take a more neutral stance towards flirtation, rather than blatantly positioning yourself as at the top of the “tree”, you’ll hear from more guys who take a similarly neutral position: interested in the possibility of flirtation and maybe more, but not determined to raise it in your first conversation or on your first encounter.</p> \n<p>Love,<br /></p> \n<p>Eva</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/12/1423750172137/8482d09f-2079-4ce7-a9ba-f5e4e8723902-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Celine Loup","altText":"swipe right","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Celine Loup"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435847701734/d7d701c8-f88c-41e0-9dff-a48146e52b2c-bestSizeAvailable.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":418,"width":358,"orientation":"portrait","credit":"Screengrab","altText":"rotten apples"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T15:00:23Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T15:09:59Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":273,"contributors":[{"name":"Eva","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/12/1423746169115/Eva-Anonymous.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/eva"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Life and style","Sex","Online dating"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/sex","webTitle":"Sex"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/online-dating","webTitle":"Online dating"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Eva","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/eva"}}],"series":{"title":"Swipe right - online dating for the real world","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/swipe-right"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/swipe-right-online-dating-sexual-encounters","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ab6p","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/swipe-right-online-dating-sexual-encounters","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/swipe-right-online-dating-sexual-encounters"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/12/1423750172137/8482d09f-2079-4ce7-a9ba-f5e4e8723902-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Swipe right: helping you navigate the traps of online dating.

A short, sharp reminder that she can still be torn down at any moment. So it was at Glastonbury last weekend, when an audience member at Kanye West’s set chose to wave an enormous flag printed with a still image from a sex tape showing Kardashian performing oral sex on her former partner Ray J. The tape was leaked in 2007 <a href=\"http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20012494,00.html.\">without Kardashian’s consent</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/25/kanye-west-glastonbury-festival-2015-worlds-biggest-pop-star\">The enigma of Kanye West – and how the world's biggest pop star ended up being its most reviled, too</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kardashian, who is four months pregnant, was present, so she got to witness the moment the photo was displayed to her husband and a huge crowd of his fans. Printed on the flag were the words “Get Down, Girl, Get Head Get Down”, a play on the lyrics from West’s song Gold Digger. Luckily, a compassionate Twitter user immortalised the moment by posting a picture with a suitably disapproving caption:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JacobWTurner01/statuses/615070025079255041\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Someone printed kim k giving ray j head on a flag and waved it about as Kanye performed at Glastonbury ahahahaha <a href=\"http://t.co/QXrp1gedwL\">pic.twitter.com/QXrp1gedwL</a></p>— Jacob (@JacobWTurner01) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JacobWTurner01/status/615070025079255041\">June 28, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p> Many online were quick to share their glee, describing the flag as “the BEST Glastonbury flag ever”, “flag of the day”, “#BESTEVER”, “genius” and “hilarious”. The Lad Bible declared that it <a href=\" https://twitter.com/TheLadBible/status/615143949368471552\">“wins the internet”</a>. Just in case she hadn’t noticed the flag itself during her husband’s set, thoughtful users<a href=\"https://twitter.com/82BAnArsenalFan/status/615176002659074049\"> tweeted it into Kardashian’s mentions</a> to be sure the picture be waiting for her when she got home. </p> \n<p>The precise intent behind the stunt isn’t clear, though the idea that a man should be threatened or shamed by his partner’s past sexual history is as old as it is misogynistic. The use of West’s lyrics suggests it might have been intended to suggest that Kardashian is herself a gold digger, despite her own enormously successful media and business ventures. Is it possible that the flag waver was trying to make a point about sexism in West’s lyrics? At a stretch, yes. Is it likely? No. And even if that were the case, the ends wouldn’t justify the means, any more than they did when the person who threatened to leak naked photos of Emma Watson later claimed it was all in the name of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-emma-watson-nude-photo-leak-was-a-very-elaborate-hoax-9752810.html\">a campaign against the internet site 4Chan</a>. Thank goodness for these towering heroes of morality. </p> \n<p>Regardless of intent, the outcome was yet another very successful woman being reminded that no matter how high she climbs, she can always be torn down by a slut-shaming, misogynistic double standard. There are powerful echoes here of the blame and outrage directed at the victims of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/10/fbi-seizes-computers-in-hunt-for-celebrity-photo-hackers\">last year’s nude celebrity photo hacks</a>. These are women who we pressure to be hyper-sexualised when they are objects for public consumption, in magazines or films or on television. We love to squeal over their “barely there” dress or “plunging cleavage” when they’re walking the red carpet, packaged for an approving audience. But when they dare to take ownership of their own bodies, to have sexual agency, or even, heaven forbid, to enjoy sex for themselves, we are ready to scream shame and demand grovelling public apologies. What Kardashian was doing in that sex tape was private and consensual. The only piece of wrongdoing was the publication of the tape without her consent; one amplified by the flag bearer in revictimising her before a live audience. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/18/kim-kardashian-selfish-book-selfies\">Kim Kardashian's Selfish book snapped up by thousands</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> Though Kardashian is not the only A-lister to have suffered this publicising of her sexual past as a weapon against her, there are noticeable differences in the way she is treated. While there was an outpouring of sympathy and support for many of the photo hacking victims, it was noted at the time that there was a nasty streak of venom reserved particularly for Kardashian. </p> \n<p>There was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/11113789/Kim-Kardashian-naked-photo-leak-Why-the-hacking-of-Kim-Kardashian-deserves-our-sympathy.html \">a classist undertone of sneering</a>, as some suggested that she was “asking for it” because she often chooses to share revealing photographs with her fans, or that as a reality star she doesn’t really deserve to be treated as a celebrity. It is regularly suggested that she leaked the tape intentionally to find fame, though she <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/06/hulk_hogan_sues_gawker_celebrity_sex_tapes_used_to_thrill_us_now_they_trouble.single.html\">has made it very clear this was not the case</a>. </p> \n<p>It was the same classist sexism that saw the Duchess of Cambridge, pregnant with Prince George, praised for her pregnancy style and svelte silhouette, while Kardashian, pregnant at the same time with baby North, faced nasty memes comparing her to a whale, and <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2013/03/28/pregnant-kim-kardashian-succumbs-to-cravings-and-gorges-on-burger-and-chips-3564195/\">front-page stories about her “gorging” on fast food</a>. While the Duchess topped Vanity Fair’s<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2013/04/top-ten-best-dressed-pregnant-celebrities#1\">“best-dressed pregnant celebrities” list</a>, Kardashian<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2305066/Kate-Middleton-v-Kim-Kadashian-baby-bump-Duchess-Cambridges-maternity-style-oceans-apart.html\"> was described as “brash” and “trashy”</a>. </p> \n<p>We will praise women for being sexy, as long as it’s the right kind of sexiness. As long as they’re the right “kind” of woman. As long as they’re not in control. As long as we can remind them of their place at any moment.</p> \n<p>This wasn’t “banter”. This wasn’t a hilarious stunt. This was the very public shaming of a pregnant woman in front of her husband and a crowd of strangers. And if that sounds positively medieval, then it should tell you something about our “modern” attitudes towards women.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673442393/1b22908c-b8ac-4fa7-b26c-1bf046efeaff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lionel Cironneau/AP","altText":"Kim Kardashian … social media reacted with glee at the stunt.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Lionel Cironneau/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T15:06:46Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T15:36:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2232,"contributors":[{"name":"Laura Bates","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/3/1428058264790/Laura-Bates-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/laura-bates"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Kim Kardashian","Women","Celebrity","The Duchess of Cambridge","Life and style","Feminism","Glastonbury 2015","Kanye West","Glastonbury festival"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian","webTitle":"Kim Kardashian"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/celebrity","webTitle":"Celebrity"},{"id":"uk/duchess-of-cambridge","webTitle":"The Duchess of Cambridge"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"world/feminism","webTitle":"Feminism"},{"id":"music/glastonbury-2015","webTitle":"Glastonbury 2015"},{"id":"music/kanyewest","webTitle":"Kanye West"},{"id":"music/glastonbury","webTitle":"Glastonbury festival"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Laura Bates","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/laura-bates"}}],"series":{"title":"Laura Bates on everyday sexism","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/laura-bates-on-everyday-sexism"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a96k","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673442393/1b22908c-b8ac-4fa7-b26c-1bf046efeaff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kim Kardashian … social media reacted with glee at the stunt.
