Just another day at the office, then. My crime that day was to have said during an episode of <em>MasterChef</em> that a dessert “looked like the sort of thing served at a cheap wedding full of regret held at a hotel on a ring road”. My correspondent’s stepdaughter had apparently just got married at a ring road hotel and it had been lovely. “I’m sure it was,” I replied, “but was it also full of regret? Because if it wasn’t, it isn’t covered by my critique.” I may be a snob, but I’m a precise snob.</p> \n<p>The touchiness shouldn’t have surprised me. When it comes to food at weddings people are like that. A wedding is one of life’s great set piece events, upon which the compass flickers. Accordingly everything about them must be perfect, even when everything plainly isn’t. And now it’s June, and wedding season is upon us. For the next few months many of us will be putting on suits and frocks smelling of dry cleaning fluid, and tramping into baggy marquees where we will eat some of the worst, most overpriced food ever inflicted upon us by people who claim to be our dearest friends. And then, regardless of how dismal it all was, we will loudly proclaim the opposite. In the coming months more lies will be told about the quality of lunch and dinner than in the rest of the year put together.</p> \n<p>We are meant to be experiencing a British food revolution, and in many ways we are. There are better restaurants than ever before. But in the business of mass catering we are generally awful. I say generally. Obviously, if you run a catering firm and you’re limbering up to complain, I don’t mean you. You’re brilliant. Likewise, the food at your wedding was obviously fabulous. It’s everyone else.</p> \n<p>Everyone else is responsible for dry canap&eacute;s that taste only of margarine and complacency. Everyone else is responsible for desiccated lumps of yesterday’s pre-cooked chicken the colour of an old stained sink; for sauces that could creosote fences and vegetables so overboiled you could suck them through a straw; for cream desserts that have split, and overbaked tarts with pastry like walnut shells. And the cost! I only use exclamation marks for shouting, which is what I’m doing. THE COST! Despite economies of scale, caterers charge more for this dismal crud than the price of a quality restaurant meal and rising. Why are they allowed to get away with it?</p> \n<p>Precisely because it’s a special event, and nobody likes to admit one of those isn’t actually that special. Plus, avoiding the pitfalls of mass catering dreariness requires a certain radicalism: the willingness to do away with the awful formally plated main course, to sack the poor exploited teenage waitresses and instead concentrate spend on the cooking. The problem is that weddings generally involve young people and for all their youthful irreverence, young people can be rather “small c” conservative. A wedding is a grown-up event, and they have a mythologised notion of what grown-up looks like, which includes a marquee and chicken the colour of a stained sink.</p> \n<p>Recently the savings expert Martin Lewis’s <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/cheaper-weddings\">website </a>said that, when booking a wedding reception at a hotel, tell them it’s for a party rather than for nuptials. Apparently hotels charge more the moment they hear it’s a wedding. This is good advice. It won’t stop the food being crap, but at least it won’t cost you as much.</p> \n<p><em>Tell us about your wedding-day catering disasters and triumphs below</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037088538/8ce08c37-1c1b-4a4a-8303-4d2a79721723-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.'","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T13:30:07Z","lastModified":"2015-06-16T13:30:07Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":274,"contributors":[{"name":"Jay Rayner","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733739943/JayRayner.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jayrayner"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Weddings","Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/weddings","webTitle":"Weddings"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jay Rayner","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jayrayner"}}],"series":{"title":"Happy eater","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/happy-eater"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/wedding-season-crimes-against-food-jay-rayner","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49kzy","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/wedding-season-crimes-against-food-jay-rayner","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/wedding-season-crimes-against-food-jay-rayner"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037088538/8ce08c37-1c1b-4a4a-8303-4d2a79721723-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.’ Photograph: Alamy","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.'","cleanCaption":"‘The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}},"importance":7,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037088538/8ce08c37-1c1b-4a4a-8303-4d2a79721723-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.'","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}}]},{"title":"Julia Gillard's views on sexism in politics are about every woman in every job","rawTitle":"Julia Gillard's views on sexism in politics are about every woman in every job","item":{"type":"comment","id":"lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/16/julia-gillards-views-on-sexism-in-politics-are-about-every-woman-in-every-job","title":"Julia Gillard's views on sexism in politics are about every woman in every job","trailText":"Her famous speech electrified the debate about misogyny in the workplace – and the former Australian PM has explained further what drove her to make it, and what it achieved","standFirst":"<p>Her famous speech electrified the debate about misogyny in the workplace – and the former Australian PM has explained further what drove her to make it, and what it achieved</p>","byline":"Laura Bates","body":"<p>“I’m too much of a patriot to think [sexism in politics] is an issue about Australia,” said Julia Gillard, former Australian prime minister, at Fortune magazine’s summit for women on Monday night. “This issue about women and leadership is a global issue. Still, somewhere in our brains, is whispering a stereotype that says if a woman is leading, commanding, she has probably given up on ‘female’ traits of empathy, likeability; she’s probably a bit hard boiled.” </p> \n<p>It’s a problem women in work face every day, and as Gillard passionately pointed out, “until we can shed that stereotype that women, leadership and likeability don’t go together, we will be putting the baggage of that on to the women who do emerge. We’ll see some of it in Hillary [Clinton]’s campaign.”</p> \n<p>She isn’t wrong – Clinton has already faced a barrage of ageist and sexist criticism, particularly in recent months as speculation increased about her presidential bid. An inordinately crass tweet (hastily deleted) sent from <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-via-twitter-hillary-clinton-cant-satisfy-her-husband-2015-4?IR=T\">Donald Trump’s Twitter account asked</a>: “If Hillary Clinton can’t satisfy her husband, what makes her think she can satisfy America?” When talking straight politics, Clinton has been accused of being cold and out of touch, but when she mentions her family, she faces accusations of<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2015/04/20/basking_in_estrogen_maureen_dowd_offers_predictably_sexist_take_on_hillary_clintons_campaign/\"> being too “oestrogen” fuelled</a>.

It’s a depressing state of affairs – that even at this level of power and international prominence, women will be reduced to . It’s no surprise that Gillard describes politics as “too crowded, quarrelsome and contested” to give much time for internal meditation, and the need to have mentors in women’s lives.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/jul/26/julia-gillard-misogyny-kevin-rudd\">Julia Gillard reveals what she thought when she gave the 'misogyny speech'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Asked if she had any regrets about her famous 2012 <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2012/oct/12/julia-gillard-sexism-australian-women\">speech on misogyny</a>, Gillard had an unequivocal one-word answer: “No.” She didn’t realise how far-reaching the impact would be, but that “in a state of cool anger, that after all I’d put up with on gender, I was going to be lectured by Tony Abbott about sexism”.</p> \n<p>It wasn’t until later that day, when she walked back from the chamber to her office and found it “alight with phone calls and emails”, that she began to realise the speech had gone viral. The moment “the penny really dropped”, Gillard said, was on a subsequent trip to India, where she was greeted by an Indian police officer who was part of her assigned security detail. “The first thing she said, when she greeted me and ushered me into the car was, ‘Great speech.’”</p> \n<p>Asked whether she had any advice for Clinton, Gillard replied that Clinton was experienced enough not to need her advice, but did suggest calling out sexism early; Gillard had assumed that the most extreme “reaction about gender”, both supportive and negative, would peak at the beginning of her term in office. Instead, she said, it heightened when she spoke out about controversial political issues, when gender became a “convenient cudgel of criticism”and abuse – such as “ditch the witch” and “ditch the bitch” – was hurled at her. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jan/13/julia-gillard-backlash-puts-women-with-traditional-gender-beliefs-off-politics-study\">Julia Gillard backlash puts women with traditional gender beliefs off politics – study</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But the advice might not be easy to follow – as Gillard herself discovered, the very act of standing up to sexism can see women in politics re-victimised. After her speech on misogyny was beamed around the globe, some commentators accused Gillard of “gratuitously” betraying her emotional sensitivity’ and suggested that <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/brendanoneill2/100184669/julia-gillard-needs-to-man-up/\">she simply needed to “man up”</a>. Opposition politicians described her pithy, intelligent responses to sexist behaviour as “playing the gender card”, attempting to portray her as the real threat to women in politics, with claims that she had <a href=\"http://www.australiantimes.co.uk/liberal-mp-says-gillard-speech-pathetic/\">“demeaned every woman in this parliament”</a>. </p> \n<p>Ultimately it is our stereotypes that need to shift, not the response of women in politics. Gillard admitted that when she was a girl, “if someone had suggested you could be prime minister it would have been as unreal as suggesting you could go with Neil Armstrong to the moon”. On encouraging our daughters to “pursue [their] passion”, she summed up the problem for everyone in the room: “I don’t think people are born with a blinkered gender construct about what they can achieve in the world. We stamp that onto them. And we’ve got to pull the stamp away.”</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434469079770/47c3b4d4-9d08-47a7-950f-a6d78c42d1de-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Daniel Deme/WENN.com/Daniel Deme/WENN.com","altText":"Julia Gillard in London this month.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Daniel Deme/WENN.com/Daniel Deme/WENN.com"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T16:54:21Z","lastModified":"2015-06-16T17:06:09Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":222,"contributors":[{"name":"Laura Bates","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/3/1428058264790/Laura-Bates-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/laura-bates"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Women","Life and style","Politics","Gender","Feminism","UK news","Julia Gillard","Work & careers","Women in politics"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"world/gender","webTitle":"Gender"},{"id":"world/feminism","webTitle":"Feminism"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/julia-gillard","webTitle":"Julia Gillard"},{"id":"money/work-and-careers","webTitle":"Work & careers"},{"id":"politics/women","webTitle":"Women in politics"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Laura Bates","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/laura-bates"}}],"series":{"title":"Laura Bates on everyday sexism","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/laura-bates-on-everyday-sexism"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/16/julia-gillards-views-on-sexism-in-politics-are-about-every-woman-in-every-job","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49pxx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/16/julia-gillards-views-on-sexism-in-politics-are-about-every-woman-in-every-job","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/16/julia-gillards-views-on-sexism-in-politics-are-about-every-woman-in-every-job"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434469079770/47c3b4d4-9d08-47a7-950f-a6d78c42d1de-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Julia Gillard speaking to schoolkids in London this month.

Dr Tim Chico, a consultant cardiologist in Sheffield, said: “The message I take from this study is that if you are a healthy weight, then eating chocolate (in moderation) does not detectably increase risk of heart disease and may even have some benefit.

And, actually, it’s really hard to ignore your body when you’re pregnant; it mutinies and starts ordering you about. In many ways this is good – forcing you to go to bed early, or eat enough protein. But, in the unnatural food landscape of today, in which irresistible unhealthy snacks are the easiest foods to come by, it can also be bad.</p> \n<p>The first time I was pregnant, I signed up for a daily email with tips and information on the baby’s development. Occasionally, I’d receive a gentle reminder to snack on carrot sticks instead of cakes, and I would think: “Up yours, patronising email service – don’t you realise you’re talking to someone who makes her own sodding muesli?” Then I’d inhale an entire carton of ice-cream, which obviously needed replacing every 48 hours, as was surely the right of all weary pregnant women everywhere.</p> \n<p>But, as obesity researcher Nicole Avena sets out in her new book, <a href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/237260/what-to-eat-when-youre-pregnant-by-dr-nicole-m-avena/\">What to Eat When You’re Pregnant</a>, avoiding overindulgence and eating healthily is even more important when pregnant. Firstly, she says, the average woman (in the US) who becomes pregnant is already overweight or obese, which heightens the risk of conditions like pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and postpartum haemorrhage. And between 46% and 59% (depending on BMI) of these women will gain more weight than necessary when pregnant, which will likely be retained post-pregnancy.</p> \n<p>Secondly, it’s widely accepted now that what happens in the womb does not stay in the womb. <a href=\"http://www.drnicoleavena.com/publications/tag/research-articles\">Research that Avena and colleagues have done</a> (albeit mostly in rats) has found that not only can an in-utero diet high in fat or sugar lead to the child growing up obese, but maternal diet, she writes, “can have a long-lasting impact on the offspring’s risk of developing mental-health disorders, impaired social behaviours, lower cognitive abilities and increased response to stress”.</p> \n<p>That’s a bitter pill to swallow, especially in a society that sometimes seems designed to make people fat. And, as more and more individual studies on the impact of maternal behaviour are reported, it can feel as though the media is building a case against mothers. “That’s a valid debate,” says a very pregnant Avena, via video link. “Part of the reason I wanted to do the book was because women are given guidelines about what not to eat during pregnancy. There’s a lot of weight-shaming that goes on when it comes to pregnancy, although we have to address it because it’s important. But it doesn’t have to be negative. I try to focus on the healthy aspects of eating while pregnant.”</p> \n<p>So, after walking readers through the cold, hard science of pregnancy weight-gain and the risks associated with eating badly, the fun part begins: a week-by-week guide to what to eat, and what your baby is growing right now (brainstem, skin, fingernails), along with easy recipe suggestions. Week 34, for instance, is all about squash, which is high in fibre – an essential in beating third-trimester constipation. A nice prompt, but then fibre is always necessary. Isn’t a common-sense, healthy, balanced diet all that’s ever required? “The book is not necessarily meant to make women eat brussels sprouts during a certain week,” says Avena, “but, if they can focus on them in one week and try to incorporate them into their diet, I’m giving them a way to eat healthily in a prescriptive manner – not just telling them: ‘OK, eat healthily.’” Which, judging by obesity levels, isn’t enough.</p> \n<p>In the throes of early pregnancy, however, all this is the last thing many women want to deal with. Traditionally, it’s a time to put your feet up and enjoy your extra calorie allowance. The hospital in New York where Avena works runs weight-loss clinics and, when female attendees become pregnant, many of them want to drop out. “We encourage them to stay in,” says Avena. Not because they think they should lose weight while pregnant, but because “you still can benefit from some of the advice on how to maintain healthy eating and dietary patterns”.</p> \n<p>Could, I wonder, any ill-effects that my chocolate H&auml;agen-Dazs habit had on my daughter, in the womb, be erased by her upbringing? It’s hard to accurately study nature versus nurture in humans, but Avena has placed baby rats, born to mothers fed on high-sugar and high-fat diets, with rats on healthy diets – to breastfeed and raise them. “They still grew up to have these changes in the brain, and have propensities to want to consume high-sugar and high-fat foods,” she says. However, in humans, if self-restraint is taught and the child is brought up to recognise their satiety signals, “then that’s going to mitigate the effects that might have occurred from in-utero exposure”.</p> \n<p>Avena demystifies cravings by talking about the hormones involved and suggesting how to beat such mutinous urges. Taking a mindful approach has been shown to help addicted people move past their cravings; rather than trying to fight it or giving in, simply acknowledge and accept it. Planning ahead pays – make healthy foods more readily available than the contents of the nearest vending machine. Tipping off friends and family to resist feeding you treats helps, too, as does sufficient sleep. And, finally, know your cravings. Typically, Avena writes, genuine hunger-driven cravings are for food groups (like meat), rather than specific food items (like ice-cream). In other words, listen to your body, but only when you know its intentions are sound.</p> \n<p><em>What to Eat When You’re Pregnant by Nicole Avena (Ten Speed Press, &pound;13.99).

The idea that you can wash away your calorific sins is the perfect antidote to our fast-food lifestyles and alcohol-lubricated social lives. But before you dust off that juicer or take the first tentative steps towards a colonic irrigation clinic, there’s something you should know: detoxing – the idea that you can flush your system of impurities and leave your organs squeaky clean and raring to go – is a scam. It’s a pseudo-medical concept designed to sell you things.</p> \n<p>“Let’s be clear,” says <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2014/oct/19/edzard-ernst-outspoken-professor-of-complementary-medicine\">Edzard Ernst</a>, emeritus professor of complementary medicine at Exeter University, “there are two types of detox: one is respectable and the other isn’t.” The respectable one, he says, is the medical treatment of people with life-threatening drug addictions. “The other is the word being hijacked by entrepreneurs, quacks and charlatans to sell a bogus treatment that allegedly detoxifies your body of toxins you’re supposed to have accumulated.”</p> \n<p>If toxins did build up in a way your body couldn’t excrete, he says, you’d likely be dead or in need of serious medical intervention. “The healthy body has kidneys, a liver, skin, even lungs that are detoxifying as we speak,” he says. “There is no known way – certainly not through detox treatments – to make something that works perfectly well in a healthy body work better.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-455174680__\n</div> \n<p>Much of the sales patter revolves around “toxins”: poisonous substances that you ingest or inhale. But it’s not clear exactly what these toxins are. If they were named they could be measured before and after treatment to test effectiveness. Yet, much like floaters in your eye, try to focus on these toxins and they scamper from view. In 2009, a network of scientists assembled by the UK charity <a href=\"http://www.senseaboutscience.org/pages/debunking-detox.html\">Sense about Science</a> contacted the manufacturers of 15 products sold in pharmacies and supermarkets that claimed to detoxify. The products ranged from dietary supplements to smoothies and shampoos. When the scientists asked for evidence behind the claims, not one of the manufacturers could define what they meant by detoxification, let alone name the toxins.</p> \n<p>Yet, inexplicably, the shelves of health food stores are still packed with products bearing the word “detox” – it’s the marketing equivalent of drawing go-faster stripes on your car. You can buy detoxifying tablets, tinctures, tea bags, face masks, bath salts, hair brushes, shampoos, body gels and even hair straighteners. Yoga, luxury retreats, and massages will also all erroneously promise to detoxify. You can go on a seven-day detox diet and you’ll probably lose weight, but that’s nothing to do with toxins, it’s because you would have starved yourself for a week.</p> \n<p>Then there’s colonic irrigation. Its proponents will tell you that mischievous plaques of impacted poo can lurk in your colon for months or years and pump disease-causing toxins back into your system. Pay them a small fee, though, and they’ll insert a hose up your bottom and wash them all away. Unfortunately for them – and possibly fortunately for you – no doctor has ever seen one of these mythical plaques, and many warn against having the procedure done, saying that it can perforate your bowel.</p> \n<p>Other tactics are more insidious. Some colon-cleansing tablets contain a polymerising agent that turns your faeces into something like a plastic, so that when a massive rubbery poo snake slithers into your toilet you can stare back at it and feel vindicated in your purchase. Detoxing foot pads turn brown overnight with what manufacturers claim is toxic sludge drawn from your body. This sludge is nothing of the sort – a substance in the pads turns brown when it mixes with water from your sweat.</p> \n<p>“It’s a scandal,” fumes Ernst. “It’s criminal exploitation of the gullible man on the street and it sort of keys into something that we all would love to have – a simple remedy that frees us of our sins, so to speak. It’s nice to think that it could exist but unfortunately it doesn’t.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3aaeb913db858a72273bcf8a7cc96c60e1de595a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/4/1417706153305/2bfff0dd-e1c5-403c-915d-c1f99bb4f6f3-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Spinach and broccoli smoothie.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spinach and broccoli smoothie.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That the concept of detoxification is so nebulous might be why it has evaded public suspicion. When most of us utter the word detox, it’s usually when we’re bleary eyed and stumbling out of the wrong end of a heavy weekend. In this case, surely, a detox from alcohol is a good thing? “It’s definitely good to have non-alcohol days as part of your lifestyle,” says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rd_catherine\">Catherine Collins</a>, an NHS dietitian at St George’s Hospital. “It’ll probably give you a chance to reassess your drinking habits if you’re drinking too much. But the idea that your liver somehow needs to be ‘cleansed’ is ridiculous.”</p> \n<p>The liver breaks down alcohol in a two-step process. Enzymes in the liver first convert alcohol to acetaldehyde, a very toxic substance that damages liver cells. It is then almost immediately converted into carbon dioxide and water which the body gets rid of. Drinking too much can overwhelm these enzymes and the acetaldehyde buildup will lead to liver damage. Moderate and occasional drinking, though, might have a protective effect. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7767150\">Population studies</a>, says Collins, have shown that teetotallers and those who drink alcohol excessively have a shorter life expectancy <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24415611\">than people who drink moderately</a> and in small amounts.</p> \n<p>“We know that a little bit of alcohol seems to be helpful,” she says. “Maybe because its sedative effect relaxes you slightly or because it keeps the liver primed with these detoxifying enzymes to help deal with other toxins you’ve consumed. That’s why the government guidelines don’t say, ‘Don’t drink’; they say, ‘OK drink, but only modestly.’ It’s like a little of what doesn’t kill you cures you.”</p> \n<p>This adage also applies in an unexpected place – to broccoli, the luvvie of the high-street “superfood” detox salad. Broccoli does help the liver out but, unlike the broad-shouldered, cape-wearing image that its superfood moniker suggests, it is no hero. Broccoli, as with all brassicas – sprouts, mustard plants, cabbages – contains cyanide. Eating it provides a tiny bit of poison that, like alcohol, primes the enzymes in your liver to deal better with any other poisons.</p> \n<p>Collins guffaws at the notion of superfoods. “Most people think that you should restrict or pay particular attention to certain food groups, but this is totally not the case,” she says. “The ultimate lifestyle ‘detox’ is not smoking, exercising and enjoying a healthy balanced diet like the Mediterranean diet.”</p> \n<p>Close your eyes, if you will, and imagine a Mediterranean diet. A red chequered table cloth adorned with meats, fish, olive oil, cheeses, salads, wholegrain cereals, nuts and fruits. All these foods give the protein, amino acids, unsaturated fats, fibre, starches, vitamins and minerals to keep the body – and your immune system, the biggest protector from ill-health – functioning perfectly.</p> \n<p>So why, then, with such a feast available on doctor’s orders, do we feel the need to punish ourselves to be healthy? Are we hard-wired to want to detox, given that many of the oldest religions practise fasting and purification? Has the scientific awakening shunted bad spirits to the periphery and replaced them with environmental toxins that we think we have to purge ourselves of?</p> \n<p>Susan Marchant-Haycox, a London psychologist, doesn’t think so. “Trying to tie detoxing in with ancient religious practices is clutching at straws,” she says. “You need to look at our social makeup over the very recent past. In the 70s, you had all these gyms popping up, and from there we’ve had the proliferation of the beauty and diet industry with people becoming more aware of certain food groups and so on.</p> \n<p>“The detox industry is just a follow-on from that. There’s a lot of money in it and there are lots of people out there in marketing making a lot of money.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.city.ac.uk/people/academics/peter-ayton\">Peter Ayton</a>, a professor of psychology at City University London, agrees. He says that we’re susceptible to such gimmicks because we live in a world with so much information we’re happy to defer responsibility to others who might understand things better. “To understand even shampoo you need to have PhD in biochemistry,” he says, “but a lot of people don’t have that. If it seems reasonable and plausible and invokes a familiar concept, like detoxing, then we’re happy to go with it.”</p> \n<p>Many of our consumer decisions, he adds, are made in ignorance and supposition, which is rarely challenged or informed. “People assume that the world is carefully regulated and that there are benign institutions guarding them from making any kind of errors. A lot of marketing drip-feeds that idea, surreptitiously. So if people see somebody with apparently the right credentials, they think they’re listening to a respectable medic and trust their advice.”</p> \n<p>Ernst is less forgiving: “Ask trading standards what they’re doing about it. Anyone who says, ‘I have a detox treatment’ is profiting from a false claim and is by definition a crook. And it shouldn’t be left to scientists and charities to go after crooks.”</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/4/1417712418061/2ed7bc93-9848-4230-a799-84590f282bcc-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Frederic J.

There are so many great cellar doors to visit, but here are eight of my favourites.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Mount Pleasant – 401 Marrowbone Road, Pokolbin NSW </strong></p> \n<p>Steeped in history, Mount Pleasant is the place where Australian fine wine was born. Some of the vines here are well over 100 years old and were once tended by Australia’s own legendary winemaker, Maurice O’Shea. The cellar door staff are passionate, knowledgeable and respectful of this place’s history, and a taste of their wines will put you in good stead for the rest of your journey throughout the valley.<br />Ask to taste the Elizabeth Semillon and Old Hill Shiraz. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2985c4261f839df33f76c3af0b78f0997ea4515\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a2985c4261f839df33f76c3af0b78f0997ea4515/0_0_2958_1777/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There are more than 120 vineyards in the Hunter Valley region. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are more than 120 vineyards in the Hunter Valley region. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Tinklers - Pokolbin Mountains Road, Pokolbin NSW </strong></p> \n<p>The Tinklers are farmers first and winemakers second, and it’s not just grapes they grow on the rolling hills of their Pokolbin property. Seasonal produce like avocados, lemons and limes, pumpkins, watermelons, peaches and figs are also sold in the cellar door. But the wine is why you’re here. You can lean against the heavy timber bar or sit down amongst the barrels and drink Hunter wines, made and grown in the same place by the same family for more than the last 100 years. Ask to taste the Viognier and U &amp; I Shiraz.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"723983d67a0ad502a32aa8c5035cb2c80eefd6df\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434501617082/55ed903d-1274-48c3-ba6f-abcbaeec7365-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rural New South Wales\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You’re spoilt for choice in the picturesque wine regions of NSW.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bon Appetit/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Gundog Estate - 101 McDonald’s Road, Pokolbin NSW</strong></p> \n<p>Gundog Estate’s cellar door used to be the old Pokolbin schoolhouse, where local students would learn how to read and write and practice their times tables. Today, the schoolhouse has been transformed into a cellar door, where staff won’t give you detention if you’ve failed to learn the difference between a primary and secondary fermentation. <br /></p> \n<p>The cellar door is always busy on weekends with people tasting classic Hunter Valley wines with a contemporary twist. You will probably learn something about wine too, especially if winemaker Matt Burton and his offsider Nick are around. Ask to taste the Wild Semillon and new Indomitus range.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Bimbadgen Estate – 790 McDonalds Road, Pokolbin, NSW</strong></p> \n<p>Bimbadgen is an Indigenous word that means ‘many great views’, and that’s exactly what you’ll get when you visit this cellar door. Grab a glass of their viognier or shiraz and look out over panoramic views of the Brokenback range to the south and Barrington Tops to the north. Ask to taste the Estate Chardonnay and Estate Viognier.</p> \n<p><strong>Hart &amp; Hunter – 463 Deaseys Road, Pokolbin NSW</strong></p> \n<p>Tucked away on Deaseys road, you’ll find one of the Hunter’s newest wine labels. Hart &amp; Hunter don’t only have a great taste for wine, but music as well. Their sole focus is on Hunter Valley fruit, so you won’t find a sauvignon blanc here – just tremendous semillon, chardonnay and shiraz, native to the region. Ask to taste all of them!</p> \n<p><strong>Macquariedale –170 Sweetwater Road, Belford NSW</strong></p> \n<p>Biodynamic duo Ross and Derice McDonald were one of the first Hunter Valley winegrowers to be certified organic. They also grow and produce delicious garlic and olive oil on their Rothbury property, but it’s the wines that will give you a reason to stay. You can taste whites and reds in their gorgeous cellar door at the top of the hill while you watch the sun set over the Brokenback on a crisp, wintry afternoon. Ask to taste the verdelho and Thomas Shiraz.</p> \n<p><strong>Oakvale – 1596 Broke Road, Pokolbin NSW</strong></p> \n<p>The Oakvale label has been growing grapes and making wine in the Hunter Valley since the 1890s. second-generation winemaker Bob Elliot used to sell wine to Maurice O’Shea from up the road at Mount Pleasant. Today, the Becker family name is above the cellar door and their respect for Oakvale’s rich past is more evident than ever. Son James Becker recently took over the winemaking reins full time. He has a not-so-secret love for Hunter chardonnay, which is deliciously revealed in every glass. Ask to taste the Ablington Chardonnay and shiraz.</p> \n<p><br /><strong>Krinklewood – 712 Wollombi Road, Broke NSW</strong></p> \n<p>Krinklewood is one of the most peaceful destinations for wine in the whole Hunter Valley. Their cellar door is nestled beneath the foothills of the Brokenback range, in the sub-region of Broke, one of the region’s most charming places to visit. Echoing somewhere in France, Krinklewood’s vineyard has more than just grapevines. The sheep eat the weeds, the worms turn the soil, and Minty the dog stands watchful over all of it. Ask to taste the Francesca Ros&eacute; and Spiders Run White.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/14/1376464639582/A-vineyard-in-the-Hunter--011.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"TOURISM AUSTRALIA/PR IMAGE","altText":"A vineyard in the Hunter Valley ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: TOURISM AUSTRALIA/PR IMAGE"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a2985c4261f839df33f76c3af0b78f0997ea4515/0_0_2958_1777/2958.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1777,"width":2958,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"There are more than 120 vineyards in the Hunter Valley region.
