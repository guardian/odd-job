She’s wearing a red top hat, a heart-patterned dress and a huge smile. Flirting workshops have long been a popular choice for hen parties and singles nights but when couples seek flirting tips it’s often couched in the context of counselling or a desperate attempt to “spice things up”.</p> \n<p>What’s changed is that couples these days attend flirting workshops for fun. “Couples at the workshops are almost always in a good place in their relationship,” says Mackenzie. “They can work on it and have a fun night out.”</p> \n<p>Flirting with a partner is different from flirting to bag one. Without the fear of rejection, flirting becomes a simple renewal of the “I love yous” you’ve already exchanged, rather than a jump-start you only reach for when the relationship starts to sputter. “The first few months of a relationship are intense,” says Mackenzie, “then we think, ‘they’re bagged’. But a relationship can’t run on those six months. Would you expect your car to run on six months of petrol?”</p> \n<h2>Silliness</h2> \n<p>Mackenzie tells us to laugh. The fake-ophony of “hahaha” is so difficult to maintain I’m almost relieved when we’re instructed to tickle the people either side of us.</p> \n<p>When we’ve finished assaulting strangers, Mackenzie explains the reason for the silliness: it facilitates flirting.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdf1b44dbe91db55378136eda8c6603d0c67921b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217630776/60e84db3-bded-4570-b464-25f0b5716533-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kiss me, you fool.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Seriousness tends to creep into early-stage relationships when you’re establishing how “serious” you are about one another and being honest about fear of heartbreak and abandonment. And no one ever flirted successfully with the opening line: “If you leave me, I swear to god …”</p> \n<p>Eschewing seriousness is easy for my partner and me. Five years in, we’re past the “where is this going?” stage, but far from worrying about primary school places or lice. We planned a wedding day prank before we booked a venue. We have silliness down pat. Next.</p> \n<h2>Simmering</h2> \n<p>“Sometimes you’re not feeling that sexy,” says Mackenzie in the workshop, “so collect sexy feelings and build them into a sensation you can have later when you see your partner.”</p> \n<p>I’m unsure as to where I can store a “sexy feeling” until my fiance staggers through the door, battered and war-weary from the commute. So the next weeknight, I try something else Mackenzie advises and envision myself running up and giving him a great big hug and kiss.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55200ba7869f5e26f31c721fd72b5eb988ad258e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217291983/fb2b6f35-e795-4438-a49f-35a0ab970900-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We have silliness down pat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I hear the key in the door and almost trip over the cat as I rush to comply with my “vision”. We’ll call that a dress rehearsal.</p> \n<p>It goes down much better than the usual grunt from behind a computer screen. Later, as he chops vegetables and I finish an article, we find ourselves catching each other’s eye and smiling.</p> \n<p>“It’s working,” he says. “We’re adorable. I kind of hate us.”</p> \n<h2>Thoughtfulness</h2> \n<p>What could be more flirtatious than showing you’re thinking about your partner’s desires?</p> \n<p>“It can be as simple as buying tickets to a football match you know they want to see.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c3f531a326f40587de7c7acb8d4d61cfaf29e32\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217390108/48f35032-db87-479a-820c-f0263ada99e0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tickets!</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If thoughtfulness were a competition, I’d be losing. We lived with his father for a while, and I had a kettle in my room and would pop downstairs for milk. One morning I went down earlier than usual and happened upon my father-in-law-to-be strolling around naked in the kitchen.</p> \n<p>From that day on, my partner left a jug of milk on my bedside table while I was sleeping. Every morning. How am I supposed to top that?</p> \n<p>Since he’s been complaining that he can’t resist the omnipresent office treats, I slip a bag of almonds into his jacket pocket with a note that says: “Don’t eat cake”. I’ll work on it.</p> \n<h2>Self-love</h2> \n<p>Self-deprecation jars with the act of flirting, says Mackenzie. You wouldn’t offer homemade cookies saying: “Would you like one? I understand if not: they’re doughy and nowhere near as sexy as they used to be.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43f3225f25c73aa7e830e89d84187b865e9cc784\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217459307/24a1ecfb-65b1-4943-ba1f-1b4402a8de80-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mr Potato Head, holding a pair of eyeballs with hearts on them, clearly feeling self-love.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’m a rampant self-deprecator, so I start small. I don’t croon “I’m irresistible”. But when he tells me I look nice I say “thanks” instead of turning my belly button into a mouth-puppet and making it say: “No, she looks like a Teletubby with tits.”</p> \n<p>This unnerving alter-ego of low self-esteem – or, as we call it, “Belly Furtado” – has no place in a flirtatious situation. I know that now.</p> \n<h2>Role play</h2> \n<p>Mackenzie suggests: “Tell your partner to wear certain clothes and meet you to role play fantasy figures.”</p> \n<p>We decide to be ourselves in a parallel universe where we never met in a philosophy tutorial and awkwardly made arrangements to see Shrek 2, to which one of us turned up doused in CK1 cologne. I won’t say which one.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25d9854b1d91f1e79e55b9eeb86aabda1944540f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217571292/ec1f5a51-9308-41a2-8f37-26436630863d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I am irresistible.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Saturday evening, a few days after the workshop, I sit on a train and try not to giggle as he gets on and pretends not to know me. He saunters over.</p> \n<p>“Hello. I fancy you. Would you like to watch Netflix with me this evening? In pyjamas?”</p> \n<p>“That’s the creepiest chat-up line I’ve ever heard.”</p> \n<p>“You would though, wouldn’t you?”</p> \n<p>“Yes.”</p> \n<p>This is where couples have the edge over singles when it comes to flirting: your partner already knows what you like and how you like it. And that, put to good use, is irresistible.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432138362101/Potato-men-for-Do-Somethi-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Collect sexy feelings and build them into a sensation you can have later when you see your partner.'

Previous studies have shown that relationship breakdowns can have a negative impact on health. </p> \n<p>He said: “I think the results we found are very interesting. We expected that when you have a lot of transitions in life, you have worse health but actually transitions such as separation and divorce do not have a long-term effect.” </p> \n<p>Most of the divorcees they analysed had also “bounced back” and started new relationships. “For those people who experience separation and divorce, it appears that as long as they begin another relationship, their health does not suffer in the long term,” Ploubidis explained.</p> \n<p>Relate, which is calling for relationship support to be made available by the NHS, believes more research is needed into the link between research and health. <br /></p> \n<p>Ruth Sutherland, the chief executive of Relate said: “This is an interesting study which helps to show that there is most certainly life after divorce. </p> \n<p>“Rather than focusing solely on relationship status, we also know that relationship quality is a hugely important factor here.

So far, so good.</em></p> \n <p><em>But since then things have gotten a bit odd. After a good bit of chatting online, we met up. The original plan was to have a drink, but instead we had dinner at mine and he spent the night. I don’t think either of us really intended for it to go so fast, so far, but it wasn’t at all unpleasant, just somewhat out of sequence.</em></p> \n <p><em>Since then, we’ve barely spoken and haven’t seen each other again. Just when I was ready to write the whole thing off, he visited my profile again, and “liked” me. So I wrote and asked if he was willing to try again, since we seemed to have bollixed things up a bit. He responded that he had enjoyed the evening, but since he was feeling a bit “unsettled” right now, he wanted to leave things for a little while.</em></p> \n <p><em>I have no idea what to do. I see him on the site fairly often, but he isn’t in touch with me. If he were really uninterested, wouldn’t he just knock it on the head? And if he were truly interested, wouldn’t he be in touch more often than every four days or so?</em></p> \n <p><em>---</em></p> \n <p><em>Dear Eva,</em></p> \n <p><em>I met a guy on Tinder a few weeks ago and we’ve been talking ever since, we got on really well and he seemed keen to meet me. We met up last week for a first date and it all seemed to go really well, since the date I’ve sent him a few texts and he hasn’t replied. Can’t help but think I sound crazy, is it mad that I’m upset he’s not replying? Why am I feeling so attached to someone I barely know?</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Hey, both of you.</p> \n<p>I hope you don’t mind me answering your letters in the same column: I think it’s useful not just because you’re presenting similar quandaries, but because it demonstrates that you are not alone. My gosh! YOU ARE NOT ALONE.</p> \n<p>There is nothing that leaves you questioning your judgment, behavior and dignity quite like someone who goes cold from hot, like a shower when an inconsiderate roommate has flushed the toilet. It can also make you feel like you’ve been flushed down a toilet. </p> \n<p>The reason I think it happens when people meet online so much more often than when they meet in the wild is this: many people who start dating online want a relationship in principle – that’s why they’re on the sites and apps, of course – but they don’t really know what they want in practice. They’re using online dating to test the waters. There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with that, but it can hurt if you’re the water being tested.</p> \n<p>Sometimes, having the experience of a wonderful date with someone will help us to realize exactly what we do want, and that it’s with that person, but it can also make us feel filled with self-doubt. Going back to the problem-solving model of internet dating that I’ve mentioned before – need partner, get partner, happily ever after, like Seamless for people – it no longer surprises me when people kick things off with intensity and then back away with equal speed. If you take a fast food approach to online dating, expecting to have your desire for love and companionship satisfied immediately, then you’re likely to end up like someone who’s noshed at McDonald’s: still hungry, maybe with a touch of heartburn.</p> \n<p>Now, how to move forward after these dispiriting engagements (or, you know, non-engagements). </p> \n<p><strong>First</strong>: in neither case are these men worth pursuing. I’m sorry! But the truth is that if they are leaving you feeling insecure, crazy or upset after the first date, they are not going to make you feel good in the long run, even if they resurface.</p> \n<p><strong>Second:</strong> it is not your fault! If someone vanishes on you after a good first date you can be sure it has everything to do with that person’s previous years of existing and feeling and interacting with other people, and little to do with the handful of hours that you spent together. So do not take one disappointing encounter with a relative stranger as a reason to beat yourself up.</p> \n<p><strong>Third:</strong> do not lose hope, but commit to giving yourself a bit more control. Both of you have in common a real desire to connect with someone, and that is not crazy: it is human and wonderful and valuable to be able to recognize in yourself. Allowing yourself the vulnerability of hope is brave, and in the long run it is what’s going to allow you to really love someone. </p> \n<p>That said, maybe in both of these cases it would be good to maintain a bit more self-protection early on. It’s not mad to feel wild about someone who you’ve just met – it’s happened to all of us – but it’s wise to work on creating a situation that will help you to maintain some distance if a person fails to live up to their potential. </p> \n<p>If you can, instead of asking yourself why a relative stranger isn’t that into you, try to focus on what the encounter taught you about yourself - you really fancy men with mustaches, you couldn’t love anyone who doesn’t love cats - and apply that self-knowledge to your encounters with the next people you meet.</p> \n<p>I’ve mentioned this before, but it’s worth reiterating: but if you are looking for a serious relationship, make a commitment to yourself to not hooking up with someone on the first date. Not because hooking up with someone on the first date is “bad” (you’re an adult, sex is great, do what you want) but because it feels a lot crueller to be rejected by someone with whom you’ve been physically intimate than with someone you’ve chatted with over a Frappuccino. </p> \n<p>For me, this means postponing sex until I don’t feel any anxiety of morning-after “but will they respect me?”. If this means avoiding sultry first-date situations and going for a froyo by the glaring light of day, then insist on it. If you suggest this and the person you’re meeting requires sultry first-date situation, then maybe you’ll know that your intentions are not aligned.</p> \n<p>Love, </p> \n<p>Eva</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/12/1423750172137/8482d09f-2079-4ce7-a9ba-f5e4e8723902-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Celine Loup","altText":"swipe right","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Celine Loup"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-11T13:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-06-11T13:00:10Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":331,"contributors":[{"name":"Eva","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/12/1423746169115/Eva-Anonymous.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/eva"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Dating","Life and style","Sex"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/dating","webTitle":"Dating"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/sex","webTitle":"Sex"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Eva","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/eva"}}],"series":{"title":"Swipe right - online dating for the real world","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/swipe-right"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/11/how-do-i-survive-the-morning-after-having-sex-on-my-first-online-date","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49yv4","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/11/how-do-i-survive-the-morning-after-having-sex-on-my-first-online-date","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/11/how-do-i-survive-the-morning-after-having-sex-on-my-first-online-date"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/12/1423750172137/8482d09f-2079-4ce7-a9ba-f5e4e8723902-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Swipe right: helping you navigate the traps of online dating.

If you’re unsure how you like to take your celebrities, complete this simple test. Do you want them to bang on about stuff such as how dreadful the NSA spy programme is, like CBE-in-waiting Benedict Cumberbatch? Or do you want them to have legendary rider demands such as “a basket of puppies and kittens to pet”; a comically grotesque retinue of personal staff, including someone whose job is best summarised as Chief Positioner of the Royal Bendy Drink Straw; and a repository of anecdotes about having once been literally kept in a gilded cage or something? “I hate the bus!” Mariah <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3671906/Mariah-Carey-Come-in-and-smell-the-perfume.html\" title=\"\">once hooted</a>, in appalled reply to a&nbsp;question about how in touch with reality she was. “I’ve already been on&nbsp;the bus – I don’t need to get back on&nbsp;the bus!”</p> \n<p>If you answered (b), stay with this.</p> \n<p>The background to&nbsp;it all is that Mariah is single once more.

Indeed, it made its debut in&nbsp;a clip on said site – though I beg you&nbsp;not to imagine this to be just a&nbsp;marketing stunt. “My girlfriends set&nbsp;up my profile,” she claims, adding in a&nbsp;statement via – ah! – match.com: “I&nbsp;hope every woman who is single and&nbsp;listens to this song goes out and finds her infinity, whether on Match or the traditional way.”</p> \n<p>Totally. By way of the important information for potential suitors, though, Mariah describes herself on&nbsp;the site as a “self-employed/entrepreneur”, reveals that she is&nbsp;looking for a chap between 20 and&nbsp;120,&nbsp;and lists her interests as cooking, movies, concerts, and religion.

What you may not have worked out, however, is in what sense she is “Joey girl”, particularly in this context. Allow me to clear up the mystery: she once took a selfie of herself with Joey Essex.</p> \n<p>While that defining moment sinks in, here follows a refresher course on Mr Essex. A former hero (though not eponymous) of scripted-reality doltscape The Only Way is Essex, he is, quite simply, the lodestar by which early-21st-century Britain must navigate any cultural event. During the election, this was highlighted by the fact that he was granted audiences and campaign time with all the main party leaders bar David Cameron, by people who imagined him to be the spiritual leader of politically disengaged youth. If fate has conspired to place you more than one degree of separation from Joey, be advised that it will be impossible for anyone to get a handle on anything that might ever befall you, no matter how dramatic.</p> \n<p>Consider the lessons learned in the wake of the conviction of Lostprophets frontman <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2013/dec/18/ian-watkins-jailed-child-sex-crimes\" title=\"\">Ian Watkins</a>. The latter was a&nbsp;celebrity in his own right, yes, but his crimes would simply not have been eye-catching enough had he not gone out briefly with a C-lister many years previously. Or <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2013/nov/28/ian-watkins-case-celebrity-lostprophets\" title=\"\">as the Sun’s splash headline put it</a>: “FEARNE EX: I&nbsp;TRIED TO RAPE BABY BOY”.</p> \n<p>Of course, it isn’t just unspeakably grim things that can only be understood by a celebrity connection so bizarre that you could fancy it was being made by an&nbsp;alien whose empathy-simulation software has suffered a&nbsp;catastrophic malfunction.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09b4157304506250f1e3e37792a604cad01975ac\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434039246176/b35d10df-0eaa-4c09-a983-ca8302a1d5ab-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"What links Kate Moss to suspected illegal immigrants?

The entire drama just happened to be captured in&nbsp;photos credited to the celebrity paparazzi agency Xposure Photos, which by some cosmic coincidence appears to have been on the scene at the precise moment the men began their daring – and photogenic – exit. What are the chances, eh? It’s like Cartier Bresson said: “Reality offers us such wealth that we must cut some of it out on the spot; simplify. The question is, do we always cut out what we should?”</p> \n<p>An intriguing debate, particularly with these pictures, but one in which the Mail declined to get bogged down. Instead, it led with the following summary: “The men cut holes in the side of the lorry, which had a Romanian number plate, before leaping free from the truck while it stopped at the lights on the A429 near Bourton-on-the-Water in the Cotswolds, around 10 miles from where model Kate Moss lives in nearby Little Farringdon.”</p> \n<p>Well. I have two questions. 1. As close as 10 miles? 2. Which sub is going to get a carpeting for failing to include the guesstimate value of said property?</p> \n<p>Let’s look at an archived Sun report to see <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/theguardian/2007/jun/06/features11.g2\" title=\"\">how it should be done</a>: “Career girl Kate Beagley was murdered just yards from model Jerry Hall’s &pound;10m mansion.” How ghastly for Jerry. “Pretty Kate, 32, was killed – and possibly raped – in a meadow near a Millionaire’s Row in Richmond, Surrey.” Was it ghastly for property prices too? Speculation on that front remained tantalisingly unexplored, though a 2007 Mirror report on a case of child battery was at pains to mention that the crimes had taken place in an apartment block shared by “Frank Skinner and Carol Vorderman”, where flats “cost between &pound;500,000 and &pound;3m”, and which boasted “a 24-hour concierge and state-of-the-art gym”. All of which certainly puts the toddler battery into perspective.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"411b32db8006c57d2168cab43915b5d1802c8ea8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434039472056/9bdc183a-6226-469b-bcdc-620eb80402dd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rebels in the Syrian town of Kafranbel hitch their cause to Caitlyn Jenner.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebels in the Syrian town of Kafranbel hitch their cause to Caitlyn Jenner.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: kanfranbelenglish/twitter.com</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Other classic examples of this almost comically psychopathic style of reporting include <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marinahyde/status/406681821964152832\" title=\"\">the main headline on the front page of the Daily Mail website</a>. “Three revellers killed as police helicopter crashes through roof of Glasgow music venue where Billy Connolly once got in a punch-up.”</p> \n<p>In this sort of context, perhaps it isn’t a surprise to see the celebrity angle showing up in increasingly unexpected places. Our final <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/33049904/syrian-activists-come-out-in-support-of-caitlyn-jenner\" title=\"\">snapshot comes from rebels in the Syrian town of Kafranbel</a>, whose resistance to both Assad and Isis saw them this week unfurl a giant banner hitching their cause to the world’s hottest new star. “Caitlyn!” this read. “We would write Kafranbel with a C, if it meant like you, we would be free. Maybe liberated Cafranbel?”</p> \n<p>Clearly, these people are far too nice (and desperate) to add the inquiry: “DID WE GET YOUR ATTENTION YET, SHITHEADS?” But as chastening images go, you’ve got to say it’s up there.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434036839954/e1987cfc-f0fc-4ad4-9807-80c87187702a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ken McKay / Rex Features/Ken McKay / Rex Features","altText":"The former hero of Towie is the lodestar by which early-21st-century Britain must navigate any cultural event.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ken McKay / Rex Features/Ken McKay / Rex Features"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434039247759/b35d10df-0eaa-4c09-a983-ca8302a1d5ab-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"What links Kate Moss to suspected illegal immigrants?

Chucking a load of ingredients into the pan and hoping for the best doesn’t really wash here, however hard you scrub.</p> \n<p>Softer and crumblier than toffee, smoother and richer than its close relative, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/jan/22/how-to-make-perfect-tablet-recipe\">tablet</a>, its dairy content means fudge is associated particularly with the south-west, though shops churning it out in a mind-boggling array of weird and only occasionally wonderful flavours are de rigueur in tourist honeypots throughout the British Isles.

If you want to keep things simple, like candy <a href=\"http://www.hopeandgreenwood.co.uk/recipes/peanut-butter-fudge\">pros Mrs Hope and Mr Greenwood</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.hopeandgreenwood.co.uk/recipes/peanut-butter-fudge\">folk from Rodda’s clotted cream</a> and <a href=\"http://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/caramel-mousse-recipe\">Michelin-star chef Tom Aikens</a>, this can be caster or ordinary white granulated, but given sugar plays such a large part, the demerara suggested by the <a href=\"https://www.carnation.co.uk/recipes/67/Ultimate-Fudge\">Carnation condensed milk tin</a> or the light muscovado used by <a href=\"http://www.jamieoliver.com/news-and-features/features/creamy-sea-salted-fudge-recipe/#ftsTEEwRpKOcplKw.97\">Ren Behan in Jamie magazine</a> will give a more interesting flavour. Personally, I prefer the slightly more subtle caramel notes of the first here.</p> \n<p>Aikens and Roddas both also add some sugar syrup – boring glucose in the former case, ambrosial golden in the latter – which makes their fudge wonderfully smooth as opposed to the slightly gritty, sandy texture of the Carnation and Hope and Greenwood recipes, which, though undoubtedly pleasing, is more reminiscent of Scottish tablet. Clearly feeling two types of sugar aren’t quite enough, Aikens finishes his fudge with an infinitesimal amount of icing sugar, for, no doubt, very sound Michelin-starred reasons which I am unable to fathom.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15f50824423376fe7324855e6d5deb45f925ddde\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945143833/02911193-5340-4c62-9f42-70adb1e18073-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Roddas's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roddas’s fudge goes all out with clotted cream.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The dairy</h2> \n<p>The second, and most important, ingredient in fudge is fat. Dairy fat to be precise. Some recipes cleverly combine the two ingredients in one big hit of nauseatingly delicious condensed milk, which makes their fudge taste distinctly like white chocolate – not that there’s anything wrong with this, but it’s not the classic flavour I’m after.</p> \n<p>Hope and Greenwood plump for the nostalgic boiled flavour of evaporated milk instead, an ingredient that has so far failed to reinvent itself for a more decadent age. Despite a weird complaint that it tastes “meaty”, I happen to like it, but not as much as the clotted cream which plays an unsurprisingly large part in the Roddas recipe, or the double variety in Aikens’s fudge.</p> \n<p>In fact, the Roddas recipe proves pretty popular; soft, smooth and rich, it’s classic Cornish seaside stuff. My only complaint is that the flavour is a little too sweet and rich, which I admit may sound ridiculous, but in a side-by-side comparison, we preferred those recipes using butter as well. Let’s be honest, everything’s better with butter. But, as butter and clotted cream could prove a fatal combination, a downgrade to double seems just what the doctor ordered.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb2e571089756166bf95884fb673baae2a7c905b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945257884/e7b22b5b-562c-436a-b61f-86987205051f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ren Behan's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ren Behan’s recipes uses vanilla extract.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The flavouring</h2> \n<p>Though to make this a fair test I omit Hope and Greenwood’s peanut butter (anything containing peanut butter is always going to win big for me), I do allow Roddas, Behan and Aikens their vanilla. Not strictly necessary for a satisfactory result, but a lovely combination of flavours nevertheless – and this is one place where I think vanilla extract works better than those fiddly little seeds. Salt is another must – as ever, it brings out the best in the sugar, keeping it just the right side of sickly. How much you add depends on how enthusiastically you have embraced salted caramel mania over the last few years; sceptics will be content with a pinch, salt fiends like myself should up the dosage considerably. In for a penny, in for a pound.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28087b3b2da0edb1419a066bbbc37cab6d8e9da5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945369181/d110d9e0-c45d-47e4-9883-ecdc4f5be5c9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tom Aikens fudge.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Aikens uses a high temperature to produce a more brittle fudge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The method</h2> \n<p>All the recipes I try start in much the same way, dissolving the sugar and dairy together over heat, bringing the resulting mixture to the boil, and then letting it simmer until it reaches the desired setting temperature. (Covering the pan, as Roddas suggest, works fine, but feels a bit scary to me; I prefer to keep my molten sugar where I can see it.)</p> \n<p>The difference comes in temperature, which ranges from 113C from Behan, which gives a very soft, almost fondant-like result, to Aikens’s 121C, which is brittle and chewy, more like a hard caramel than a fudge. Even Hope and Greenwood and Carnation’s 118C is a bit harder than I had expect from a fudge – my testers and I agree that Roddas have hit the sweet spot at 116C: firm enough to hold its shape, soft enough to melt in the mouth.</p> \n<p>Lots of recipes give advice about how to achieve this without a sugar thermometer (dropping a little into a glass of cold water until it reaches a pliable consistency), but this is a fiddly and inexact science, so I’d recommend investing in a sugar thermometer. They’re not expensive, and they’ll work forever (though be careful when washing as they can be delicate).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff868836c9b6e7193c7f55d0a3b6ca6c64059f29\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945538506/71cf141a-be66-4573-94d9-0c1097f9e045-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hope &amp; Greenwood's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hope &amp; Greenwood’s fudge has a slightly gritty texture.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Stirring?</h2> \n<p>Fudge, like tablet, is beaten as it cools to help it thicken. Behan suggests allowing it to cool a little before doing this, but I can’t see that it makes much difference, apart from making it dangerously tempting to sample (still not a good idea, however tough you think your tongue is). Once it’s set completely, however, it’s every man for himself. I cannot be held responsible for the consequences. Add chopped nuts, dried fruit, crisp nuggets of streaky bacon … your call.</p> \n<h2>The perfect fudge</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1ffc0ad8082f6feb097654dd62cb6a614aaf625\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434004392334/11b8acb2-0705-4248-a43a-41958b7cd118-460x318.jpeg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake's perfect fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"318\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake’s perfect fudge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>(makes 1 x 23x23cm tin)</em></p> \n<p>100g butter<br />550g demerara sugar<br />200g golden syrup<br />350ml double cream<br />1 tsp vanilla extract<br />&frac14;-&frac12; tsp sea salt flakes</p> \n<p>Melt the butter, sugar and syrup and cream in a medium, high-sided heavy-based pan, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.

He might try to defend it and I would lose it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c3d6772f0710177831deca8782db63cac6db46d8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433938917886/8bd7c8be-7525-493b-88ed-ff9db02090b6-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A knees-up over gnocchi.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A knees-up over gnocchi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/31/giorgio-locatelli-family-values\">Italian chef Giorgio Locatelli</a>, on the other hand, says mistakes are likely to leave him chuckling. “People say ‘gee-nocchi’ instead of ‘nyocchi’ and, in Italian, that means ‘knees’. That’s fantastic.” But he does have a pet hate – when people say ‘bruschetta’ with a soft ‘shh’ (which I think a fairly easy mistake to make).“That is the one that kills me,” he complains, as I make a mental note never to do this again. “‘Sch’ in Italian is pronounced ‘sk’, so it should be ‘broo-sket-ta’,” he continues. “If I was with a friend, I would correct them, because I would always want people to correct my English.”</p> \n<p>The problem is, even if your pronunciation is perfect, that doesn’t mean you will escape being chastised, as <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/marina-oloughlin\">Guardian restaurant critic Marina O’Loughlin</a> points out. “An actual conversation with a waiter I had recently went like this: Me: ‘I’ll have the broosketta.’ Waiter: ‘One brooshetta, then.’ Me: ‘Yes, the broosketta’. Waiter, kindly, pityingly: ‘Brooshetta it is.’”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/felicity-cloake\">Food writer Felicity Cloake</a> has suffered similarly. “It’s not often that I’m lucky enough to be offered Mo&euml;t &amp; Chandon,” she says. “But since learning that the correct way to pronounce it is with a hard ‘t’ (mo-wett), I tend to avoid saying the name at all, because people often gently repeat it back to me as ‘mo-way’, as if I’m some unsophisticated hick who needs saving from myself.” It’s a middle-class dilemma that has her stumped, she says. “Where do you go from there – copy them to spare their blushes, or carry on regardless?”</p> \n<p>Guardian columnist <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/zoewilliams\">Zoe Williams</a>, who writes restaurant reviews, has the opposite problem. “I remember when I realised ‘scallop’ was pronounced ‘scollop’ – it gave me a real anxiety. When you know one thing is wrong and one is right, you will never get them the right way round. Then I hated myself for caring, because it’s obviously just a posh thing.”</p> \n<p>But she says there is something about the way the English approach foreign languages that escalates the awkwardness. “It’s that unique English pretence of not being pretentious: people who pronounce ‘<a href=\"http://www.lafromagerie.co.uk/ami-du-chambertin/\">Ami du Chambertin</a>’ in perfect French accents are considered despicable, and people who pronounce it wrong are even worse, so you just say ‘that cheese’.” The whole thing is so exhausting that she suggests – only half-jokingly – that we should just return to ordering things by numbers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff6fde6e7a381f36699af0ebef50265c6edbb8a0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433939026738/ece25337-fa87-4407-896d-cca2a4b4a6ca-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake suffers the middle-class dilemma of ‘mo-wett’ v ‘mo-way’\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake suffers the middle-class dilemma of ‘mo-wett’ v ‘mo-way’.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Teri Pengilley</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Luckily, when you are the one who runs the restaurant, you can make sure the menu only has easy-to-say words on it – which is an approach championed by <a href=\"https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/contacts_and_people/fergus/\">Fergus Henderson, the founder of St John restaurant</a>. He is happy to confess that there are words he stumbles on. “‘Physalis’ I struggle with – I can barely remember the name, let alone pronounce it,” he tells me. “Mind you, it’s one of those ingredients that turns up on plates where it’s not needed, so it can be safely ignored.” So, what should you do if you are faced with an unpronounceable word? Henderson insists it’s best to “just steam in”, but that, if you think you could really offend someone with your pronunciation, there are ways around it.</p> \n<p>“I find that the best course of action is to mumble. If you go to China, for instance, and there is an egg-fried rice that looks like it is called ‘fuck you’, just mumble.”</p> \n<p>And if this sounds like an unlikely situation, it’s one that <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jayrayner\">food writer Jay Rayner</a> can relate to. “In a restaurant on holiday, in Normandy, I ordered tripe in the local ‘Caen’ style, using my best terrible French,” he says.</p> \n<p>“The waitress sniggered. A French friend leaned across the table and said: ‘You just asked for your tripe to be cooked in the style of a chronic masturbator.’</p> \n<p>“I’m still not quite sure what I mispronounced.”</p> \n<h2>Menu unmentionables<br /></h2> \n<p><strong>Chipotle</strong><br /></p> \n<p>When the Mexican fast-food chain came to the UK, it helped the British out with an advertising campaign teaching the correct pronunciation of its name, derived from the Nahuatl for a smoked and dried jalape&ntilde;o chili pepper. Which you say as “chee-poat-lay”.</p> \n<p><strong>Pho</strong><br />There’s still much debate over the correct pronunciation of this fragrant noodle dish, which originated in Hanoi. Some say the recipe came about under French colonial rule, therefore the name should be pronounced with a long “o”, but the consensus is “fuh”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"213105fcaa588f4710d19b179f06de9ade06ca4d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433940240455/16654580-97e7-4040-8839-c02e6a4310ee-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pho, a fragrant noodle dish, which originated in Hanoi.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pho, a fragrant noodle dish, which originated in Hanoi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Edamame</strong><br />When these immature soya beans crossed over from east-Asian cuisine to stud salads in your local M&amp;S, it led to a spate of mispronunciations. “Ed-a-mah-meh” is correct.</p> \n<p><strong>Sriracha</strong><br />The hottest sauce to hit your table in the past few years, this fruity number now graces supermarket aisles and burger chains alike, but people are still saying it wrong. “See-ratch-a”’ is what you want.
