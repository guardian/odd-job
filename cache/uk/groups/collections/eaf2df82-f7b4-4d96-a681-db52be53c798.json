When David Cameron called on the Muslim community in Britain not to “quietly condone” terrorism, he fuelled a passionate debate about collective responsibility and religion, and caused many to wonder how much the prime minister understands about the true nature of Islam in the UK. </p> \n<p>The debate raises many questions, but very few are ever put to British Muslims themselves, so we are inviting you to tell your own stories. </p> \n<p>What do you think when someone refers to the “Muslim community”? How do you feel about the way Islam is discussed in the media? What do you feel is most misunderstood about you because of your beliefs? How has your religion influenced your life?</p> \n<p><strong>We’d also like you to share a photo of yourself, or if you prefer an image that represents your perspective of being Muslim in Britain today. </strong><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1879c4b1c5f2a9123b7e26b4ea87537fe19df924\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436366720119/8d69e424-61ac-4fbe-ab70-b68348afa068-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A mother and her children walk past a mural of David Bowie in Lambeth, London.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mother and her children walk past a mural of David Bowie in Lambeth, London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Baker//Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>You can share your perspectives with GuardianWitness by clicking on the blue “contribute” buttons on this article.

It will apply to over-25s. It will start next year at &pound;7.20, rising to &pound;9 a year by 2020. 2.5 million people will receive a pay rise as result, Osborne says.<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Student maintenance grants will be replaced by loans</strong> from 2016/17. The maximum value will be increased to &pound;8,200 and will only need to be paid back when people earn more than &pound;20,000.<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Tax-free personal allowance to be raised</strong> to &pound;11,000 next year. After that, the personal allowance will always rise in line with inflation.<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Benefits cap to be reduced</strong> to &pound;23,000 in London, and to &pound;20,000 elsewhere.<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Wealthy social housing tenants to pay market rents</strong>.<br /></li> \n <li>From April 2017 <strong>&pound;1m free of inheritance tax</strong>.<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Tax credits and universal credit will only support the first two children</strong>. After April 2017, people who have an additional child will not get extra help, and people who make a new claim will only get money for two children. There will be exceptions for multiple births. There will be similar changes in housing benefits.<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Mortgage tax relief for buy-to-let landlords to be restricted to the basic rate</strong><br /></li> \n <li><strong>Apprenticeship levy</strong> to be imposed on all firms. Those that offer apprentices will get more out of this, in terms of funding for apprenticeships, than they put in.<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Permanent non-dom status to be abolished</strong> – from April 2017, anyone who has lived in the UK for 15 of the past 20 years will pay same level of tax as other UK citizens.<br /></li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>What do you think about the budget?
