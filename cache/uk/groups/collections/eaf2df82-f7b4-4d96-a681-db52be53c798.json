This roman a clef, written in an allusive, lucid style, is brimming with intelligent insight about the troubles faced by Nigeria – both past and present. I’ve now moved on to Gordon Burn’s novel about the underbelly of fame: Alma Cogan. The ever reliable John Self recommended this on Twitter, and luckily for me I stumbled upon a copy on my parent’s bookshelf. Burn’s novel casts dissimulation and surreality as fame’s bedfellows. I’m only thirty pages in but I’m mightily impressed with what I’ve read so far. Stylistically it’s akin to Martin Amis, it’s all fizzing adjectives and punchy description. Highly recommended.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"00a8b37a60c7f14011940f7bff5c9769ad7554e7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434371435580/770f5854-b7f3-470e-8129-4698255e82de-314x420.jpeg\" alt=\"brick lane\" width=\"314\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creating serious envy on the books desk ...

Yes, you could say there are longeurs but somehow she maintains her grip – and the sense of a constantly unfolding psychological drama silences criticism. Oates offers no glib solutions and above all wishes to present inner conflicts in all their turbulence and irrationality – thereby making her characters live long in your mind, their vulnerability magnificently exposed. </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2011/aug/31/life-fate-vasily-grossman\">Life and Fate</a> by Vasily Grossman has been sparking a number of discussions lately. <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10098507\">Albertine67</a> shared:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I am still thinking about how on Earth one can begin to talk about Life and Fate. When I finished it the other night I turned the light out and went to sleep, feeling emotionally and intellectually drained. I still haven’t picked up another book yet, I am still feeling its power.</p> \n <p>There are perhaps two things that are particularly haunting me: the choices made by the characters (and the depiction of the decision-making processes) and the ending. The main protagonist, Shtrum the physicist, makes a choice that is almost noble, saintly, given the impact it will have on him, his work, his family; and then, in a later chapter, makes a choice which is pragmatic but is completely at odds with his principles. [...] Similarly, there are many loose ends left at the end; I feel that is completely right for the book, and have to admit that I prefer that type of ending generally, but I realise it’s not for everyone.</p> \n <p>It is just unbelievably good, and I want to run out and buy copies to give out to strangers on the street, as well as my friends. Maybe that’s really all there is to say: give it a chance and read it.<br /></p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"94e0acb79f5bc2bf94b20900ddad9c124318732b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434373313645/c7378ad8-0294-4b6f-bca9-e14ed7ac1024-369x420.jpeg\" alt=\"heartburn\" width=\"369\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/nora-ephron\">Nora Ephron</a>’s Heartburn “made me want to make mashed potatoes,” said – and showed – <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/556c7974e4b04a873a5a93e2/1550583\">ihath</a>.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10021252\">conedison</a> introduced us to the concept of “sleep-reading”:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>My wife awakened in the middle of the night to find me sitting up in bed with the light on. I was sleep-reading ... again. You may consider this a strange circumstance, but what’s even stranger is that I held no actual book in my hands. My wife claims it didn’t stop me from turning the pages, though. I wish I knew what book I was reading, but ... but what if – what if it was something ... (forgive me, Lord) something low-brow? I mean something REALLY low-brow? Or even worse, what if I have an entire virtual-library of the mind made up solely of low-brow books and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/shortcuts/2013/aug/14/barbara-cartland-novelist-beyond-grave\">Barbara Cartland</a>’s the Head Librarian?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13134881\">Audrey Schoeman</a> in China shared a brilliant discovery – and raised questions about whether a book’s accessibility can work against it:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I am bursting with excitement to let people know what I did this weekend. Wait for it ... I found a bookshop! A real one, with paper books, in English, for sale in deepest Chengdu. I piled them up and in the end was talked down by my husband and left with only four (including a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2012/jan/22/china-chinese-food-sichuan-province\">Sichuan</a> cookbook).</p> \n <p>I feel I could have justified buying more as I’ve already raced through Sarah Waters’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/aug/14/paying-guests-sarah-waters-review-satire-costume-drama\">The Paying Guests</a>. It’s a great book and a great read, but I have some lingering doubts about whether it really belonged on the shortlist for a major prize. Now this may well be me being a book snob, and I’ll take that feedback if it comes, but it didn’t feel to me like a thought-provoking or reflection-inducing enough book to merit the recognition. A ripping good yarn, yes, although perhaps a bit wordy. But able to compete against a book like <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/sep/13/how-to-be-both-ali-smith-review-novel\">How To Be Both</a>? No. Do I sound like an absolute pretentious twat?

The most un-American of all American cities. Honolulu is both the westernmost and southernmost major American city and the most remote city in the world – its geography the first act of distancing itself from the United States. The city does not think of itself as American, and conversely, when thinking of American cities, no one thinks of Honolulu.</p> \n<p>Roughly translating to “calm port”, Honolulu is the only American city with a royal palace, a reminder of the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom, subsequent annexation and eventual American statehood in 1959, the same year James Michener published his epic historical saga <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_(novel)\">Hawaii</a>, a 937-page chronicle of the island which goes all the way back to the lava flow which gave the island birth.</p> \n<p>In 1846 the Honolulu Police Department was established, perhaps providing inspiration Earl Derr Biggers’s detective novels starring fictional Chinese detective <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/09/chan-the-man\">Charlie Chan</a>. Apparently based on real Honolulu detective Chang Apana, the protagonist was meant to serve as a rebuttal to the stereotyped Chinese villains in films and books.</p> \n<p>While Honolulu is mostly thought of by Americans as a tourist destination, it’s also a connective port between Asia and the United States, making it a central nexus of business, immigration and the military. The 19th century saw obsessive attempts by global powers to control the islands; Hawaii has always had an influence and lure greatly disproportionate to its size. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The cross-section of Pacific and Asian cultures that arrived brought to Hawaii a mix of races, food and languages</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><br />The cross-section of Pacific and Asian cultures that arrived brought a mix of races, food and languages. Alan Brennert’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Honolulu-Alan-Brennert/dp/0312606346\">Honolulu</a> follows the lives of Korean immigrants in the early 20th century, focusing on a female protagonist, Regret. She escapes Korea as a mail-order bride, looking for education and a better life, but finds herself married to violent man who works on the plantations. This account of exchanging subjugation in one country for oppression in another gives a terrific portrait of early Asian immigrants to the islands.</p> \n<p>Authors have come as well. From the visitors who penned tales there passing through, including Mark Twain, Jack London, Robert Louis Stevenson and Somerset Maugham to authors, like Paul Theroux, who end up calling it home – the island city has long held a magnetic attraction to foreigners. </p> \n<p>Those travellers often stay in Waikiki. Once a playground for royalty, the beaches of Waikiki still attract throngs of tourists year round. Paul Theroux penned a satirical novel, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2001/apr/29/fiction.features\">Hotel Honolulu</a>, about a 49-year-old writer down on his luck who lands a job managing a hotel and showing us a cross-section of those who pass through. There’s even a bar in Waikiki named after the 1925 Charlie Chan novel, <a href=\"http://www.halekulani.com/dining/house-without-a-key\">House Without a Key</a>.</p> \n<p>What you read of Hawaii is largely written in English and often by people born elsewhere. Before the missionaries arrived, the islands held an oral tradition. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Kawena_Pukui\">Mary Kawena Puku‘i</a>, Hawaiian historian and author, preserves the Hawaiian culture with books like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Olelo-Noeau-Hawaiian-Proverbs-Poetical/dp/0910240930\">Olelo No‘eau</a>, a collection of over 3,000 proverbs and sayings, relating the beliefs and practices of the Hawaiian peoples.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Trouble in paradise is an evergreen theme. Behind the wafting scent of plumerias is the shadow city tourists never see</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The Hawaiian language as it was condensed into written form by missionaries, consists of just twelve letters – five vowels, seven consonants – plus an ‘okina, which is a reversed apostrophe to indicate a glottal stop between two syllables, helping visitors to pronounce names like Ka‘a‘awa (Kah-ah-ah-vah). However Hawaiian is a nearly extinct language; you’re more likely to catch the local pidgin dialect, used often in the novels and stories written by authors born and raised in the islands.</p> \n<p>Local staple <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pidgin-Max-Douglas-Simonson/dp/093584841X\">Pidgin’ to Da Max</a> is an illustrated comic guide to the language, which opens with the caveat: “Remember Pidgin’ to Da Max is not a tourist guide to pidgin. So don’t try to speak it after reading this book. You’ll just get in trouble.”</p> \n<p>Trouble in paradise is an evergreen theme for writers of Hawaii. Behind the island’s scent of plumerias and sunny face is the shadow city the tourists never see. Alexei Melnick’s novel <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Tweakerville.html?id=rGTAcQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\">Tweakerville</a> follows a young drug runner who confronts the devastation of crystal meth, portrayed with vibrant local colour and a deft use of pidgin. Chris McKinney’s teases out the racial complexities of Hawaii in his novel <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QEOCdULktj4C&amp;hl=en\">Tattoo</a><em>,</em> which follows two men, one white, one Japanese local, both serving time in Halawa Correctional Facility. Mark Haskell Smith’s <a href=\"http://www.markhaskellsmith.com/novels/delicious-a-novel\">Delicious</a>, a novel about a Las Vegas company moving in on a family-run business in Honolulu, is a page-turning tale which sometimes veers into vulgarity, illustrating that while reception of white mainlanders ranges from tolerance and reservation, it often teeters to outright distaste.<br /></p> \n<p>Over 200 years after Captain Cook was killed by native Hawaiians, another white traveller arrived, this time on a 747 and drunk as a skunk. Hunter S Thompson got an assignment – to cover the Honolulu Marathon for Running Magazine – a tale told in his hilarious and little read <a href=\"http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/art/all/42831/facts.the_curse_of_lono.htm\">The Curse of Lono</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"546497cf97616716fd50a917098e91e1e2b697f6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433952513882/2fd39f94-8112-47bd-8152-e342091b3e81-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Eddie Aikau\" width=\"250\" height=\"352\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Legendary Hawaiian surfer Eddie Aikau.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: eddieaikaufoundation.org</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On Thompson’s travels he brings several books with him, including <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/travel/14twain.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">Mark Twain</a>’s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mark-Twains-Letters-Hawaii-Twain/dp/0824802888\">Letters from Hawai‘i</a> and the <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fkfRAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=The+Journals+of+William+Ellis+guardian&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s\">Journal of William Ellis</a>, which relates the 19th-century missionary’s time in the islands, a book whose dry style and decorum are a far cry from the colourful episodes told in Thompson’s rollicking prose, typified by the time he entered his friend <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/may/29/ralph-steadman-hunter-s-thompson-gonzo-film\">Ralph Steadman</a> in the world-class surfing contest, Pipeline Masters.</p> \n<p>Much writing and travel to Honolulu involves the longtime royal sport native to the islands – surfing. Jack London wrote of surfing adventures which forced him to stay in bed in <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Cruise_of_the_Snark.html?id=o14RAAAAYAAJ&amp;hl=en\">The Cruise of the Snark</a>, a 1907 travelogue of sailing to Honolulu. The life of one of Hawaii’s most famous surfers, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Aikau\">Eddie Aikau</a>, is chronicled in the pages of <a href=\"http://eddiewouldgo.com/\">Eddie Would Go</a>, by Stuart Coleman, the title evoking Aikau’s willingness to take on the waves when others wouldn’t dare. Even Mark Twain took up the board in 1866, describing it as waiting “for a particularly prodigious billow to come along” and then “whizzing by like a bombshell.”</p> \n<p>The waters bring other kinds of visitors, of course, perhaps the most infamous being the Japanese military. The attack on the Honolulu naval base Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 is chronicled in Gordon W Prange’s <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/At_Dawn_We_Slept.html?id=swUL2H5vGfUC&amp;redir_esc=y\">At Dawn We Slept</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Day-Infamy-60th-Anniversary-Classic/dp/0805068031\">Day of Infamy</a> by Walter Lord. Both books make use of extensive research and interview to paint a portrait of a day that changed the once-open feeling of Hawaii’s ports, in a continued echo of the gunboat diplomacy and global powerplays laid out in the 19th century.</p> \n<p>The days of long treacherous voyages are gone and those ports, while guarded, are still open. It is easy now to access the once elusive Honolulu. You don’t need to sail your own yacht like London, or voyage for months on end like Captain Cook. But just because the most isolated city on Earth is now easy to reach doesn’t mean it’s easy to find. Even after reading everything ever written about Honolulu, a visitor might find themselves harboring the same sentiments <a href=\"http://www.online-literature.com/maugham/the-trembling/6/\">penned</a> by William Somerset Maugham in 1921: “Nothing had prepared me for Honolulu.”</p> \n<ul> \n <em>Anisse Gross is a writer and editor based in San Francisco.
