There are two other possibilities: one is paperwork, and the other is nostalgia,” added Frank Zappa, with a humorous frown. But what is nostalgia, and is it good or bad? Well, of course, it’s a bittersweet both. And arguably grains of it run through all music where we cannot but hear inescapable echoes of the past. In fact it is all around us in every aspect of culture and surroundings, from photography to furniture, sounds to styles, food to cars, retro in retail, all in a constant recycling of roots and influences and recapturing of eras, but how does it work in song?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d8a3743048381a9079f92689543f7e71cb29ac8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432221236906/4d4aa705-59ec-4732-b93a-6a2ad374525f-460x332.jpeg\" alt=\"Those were the days … or were they?\" width=\"460\" height=\"332\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Those were the days … or were they?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nostalgia is a sentimental look back at the past to the “good old days”, but it’s not all a fluffy glow. Originally the word was coined by a 17th-century Swiss medical student, from Greek derivatives meaning painful, aching homesickness in reference to mercenary soldiers abroad. So nostalgia is a form of melancholy. It implies that the past is better, and it’s an attempt to pull it, at least in the mind’s eye, into the present. Yet while <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/science/what-is-nostalgia-good-for-quite-a-bit-research-shows.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">science once thought of it as an illness, research shows it can in fact me beneficial to the brain</a>. Zappa, pushed the musical envelope against nostalgia into the brilliant, innovative and at times abstract and difficult, but other musicians, such as Noel Gallagher, deliberately and unashamedly referenced musical forebears, notably the Beatles and well, Slade, but you could never describe that ballsy Burnage boy as sentimental. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ba01c5a0cd7680425a101abbf6013dde76ce974\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432213185329/1fad11c6-059b-4d7b-8f83-9608e1da2bcd-332x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Nostalgia without sentimentality … Noel Gallagher in the Oasis days.\" width=\"332\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nostalgia without sentimentality … Noel Gallagher in the Oasis days.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Gallagher used a phrase for a mediocre album title that was first expressed in the 12th century by Bernard of Chartres, who described the metaphor of dwarves carried by the tall, and later in 1676 by Isaac Newton, who said in a letter: “If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” The past can indeed help us develop, but harking back the the achievements of others can also be painful. Harold Bloom’s 1973 book, The Anxiety of Influence, describes the many ways in which poets, particularly those from the Romantic period, struggled with the canon from which they had sprung, and Bloom identifies six forms of revisioning that shape this difficult, creative process. So in song, your may identify where artists have tried to show, or mask their influences too.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgjLJSuGPt8\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZgjLJSuGPt8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  What a load of cobbles … Hovis has just left the building.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nostalgia in songs can come out it all sorts of other ways. References to the past through the five senses - lyrical or sonic descriptions of sights, smells, touch, tastes and hearing, as well as musical echoes, can all trigger a vivid and positive glimmer of the past. Some even use original clips of yesteryear. Public Service Broadcasting, for example, use news footage of the <a href=\"http://www.britishpathe.com/\">British Path&eacute;</a> type and archaic recordings with ingeniously geeky glee.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILiLaRXHUr0\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ILiLaRXHUr0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Mobile phone retro nostalgia? Tap into this 1922 version from British Path&eacute;\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Desirable objects of yesterday may be today’s rubbish, but tomorrow they become … authentic. Chintz becomes choice, kitsch collectible, old toys and tacky pop records may transform into treasure, but not until they have all been thrown out. Time can turn all things a different colour, not merely objects, but memories and associations, slowly brewing, perhaps a generation or more later, into the warm glow of nostalgia, a sentimentality for the past that makes muddy brown turn to a mellow gold. In short, if something is loved once, it can be loved again. And if such a dizzy, transient, perceived vogue can return to the world fashion, art, ornaments or TV, how else does it reflect the stuff of song? <br /></p> \n<p>With emotion, that’s how. Jarvis Cocker is a prime example of a songwriter who captures raw feeling with a bittersweet look at the past, and does so with an self-deprecating honesty. He is part of a northern tradition of nostalgia with a gritty, humorous melancholy. And he is also a big fan of kitsch - Toby jugs, pottery dogs, plastic ephemera - that kind of thing. The artist and potter Grayson Perry is an Essex alternative, humorously him- or, depending what frock he fancies that day - herself, combining everyday objects of the mantelpiece, the fond tokens of the aspirational classes. He combines these with humour and tragedy, shaped into old artefacts in pottery, tapestry or sculpture.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de4e4f689c8ada850ea2b11081a18a8a5612c993\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432213070688/a5031e2f-9807-41f3-81c8-bffd304d7ced-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"A Grayson Perry pot including the image of Mark E Smith from his Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman exhibition at the British Museum.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Grayson Perry pot including the image of Mark E Smith from his Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman exhibition at the British Museum.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While the best artists can turn nostalgia, paradoxically, into something new, the recycling mainly works through the editing process of memory. That is simply how our brains work. But is it a distortion? The popular and beautifully balanced cricket commentator, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/apr/10/richie-benaud-dies-aged-84-rolling-reaction\">Richie Benaud, who sadly passed away this year</a>, wrily remarked: “The problem with relying on nostalgia for commentary is that people only remember the good things.” And as Florence King put it: “True nostalgia is an ephemeral composition of disjointed memories.” While singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey reminds us that fashion “draws inspiration from the best of the past”, the novelist Carson McCullers takes the subject to a more profound level: “We are torn between nostalgia for the familiar and an urge for the foreign and strange. As often as not, we are homesick most for the places we have never known.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a75d0cf89a4f3e3a20fe0f1a09a59240a6bf469\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432238376147/d4197e13-6780-444e-b0c9-7cc0e1c24440-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Richie Benaud - wry nostalgia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richie Benaud - wry nostalgia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Dempsey/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nostalgia brings out mixed feelings in many. I’m sure I’m not alone in thinking fondly about the good old days of Top of the Pops, about how it was the focus and talking point of the week. It is easy to forget, when looking back at some old episodes, that 90% of it could be utter shite, but then occasionally you come across one that is pure gold. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBsLy5ayHU4\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UBsLy5ayHU4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Tops of the Pops. Classic gold, or old guff?\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>With that in mind, I’ve personally been to a few fancy dress birthday parties invited to come as your childhood hero, fictional or real. The results have variously included ironic to genuine recreations of luminaries as diverse as Jacques Cousteau, Mr Ben, George Best, Citizen Smith, No&euml;l Edmonds, Kate Bush and the pope. Then again, for those of us who grew up in the 1970s, in the last few years there has been a form of reverse nostalgia. Much of our childhood gold has dissolved back to a grimy brown in the murky world of child abuse allegations and prosecutions. Mind you, if that gets too depressing, there’s always a way out. I just think about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfsMZKwqw3w\">The Clangers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bKAYH3Sl8s\">Noggin the Nog</a>.

As things stand it’s a three-way fight to avoid the drop, with Sunderland holding the advantage – as well as a game in hand – over local rivals Newcastle and third-from-bottom Hull City.</p> \n<h2>Sunderland, 37 points. Remaining games: Arsenal and Chelsea away</h2> \n<p>Sunderland face an unenviable task at the Emirates on Wednesday night but can take solace from the knowledge that they have held Arsenal to goalless draws in three of their last six trips to North London. If they manage the same feat this time around, Dick Advocaat will have steered the club to safety in the space of just eight matches. It’s also worth noting that Arsenal have drawn a blank in both of their last two home matches.</p> \n<p>Sunderland have managed to pick up just eight points from the last 60 available against Ars&egrave;ne Wenger’s side though. If the league had started at the turn of the year, Arsenal would be top on goal difference, despite having played one game fewer than their rivals. They have only won one of their last four matches but Arsenal have been the strongest team this year, <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/Teams/13\">with a score of 7.27</a>.</p> \n<p>If Sunderland lose to Arsenal, they will have to travel to the champions in the hope that they will recreate the shock victory that helped secure their survival late last season. The result effectively ended Chelsea’s title hopes and Jos&eacute; Mourinho is not the sort of manager who forgives and forgets. He will demand that his side sign off in style before the trophy presentation, especially in light of their defeat to West Brom last time out.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, aside from their humiliation at Southampton early on in the season, Sunderland have been well organised away from home. They have only lost more away matches than the Premier League’s current top four (six), while only five sides have conceded fewer goals on their travels (23).</p> \n<h2>Newcastle, 36 points. Remaining game: West Ham at home</h2> \n<p>On paper, a home match against mid-table West Ham looks to be among the most favourable available, with the Hammers having picked up the fourth fewest points in the league since the turn of the year (16). Unfortunately for Newcastle their points haul in that time, under head coach John Carver, places them bottom of the league with just 10, and their defeat at QPR on Saturday showed their inability to pick up any sort of result right now.</p> \n<p>Newcastle’s recent record against West Ham doesn’t make for great reading either, with the one win they have secured in their last five meetings also the only match in which they have scored against them in in that time. A point would not be enough to secure their safety if Hull beat Manchester United, due to Hull’s significantly superior goal difference (-17 to -25).</p> \n<p>Sam Allardyce does not exactly hold fond memories from his time at Newcastle and will be keen to avoid a third successive defeat in what could be his final game in charge of West Ham. Newcastle should not expect any favours from their opponents.</p> \n<h2>Hull City, 34 points. Remaining game: Manchester United at home</h2> \n<p>Hull City have it all to do. While they will be praying for Arsenal to beat Sunderland on Wednesday for obvious reasons, a victory for the Gunners would mean that United will finish fourth, subsequently entering the Champions League qualification phase. Such an outcome could have a baring on Louis van Gaal’s team selection, though he is unlikely to field a weak side given the quality he has at his disposal; best highlighted by the fact that a player of Angel di Maria’s quality cannot make the starting XI.</p> \n<p>Steve Bruce has no such luxuries but will take confidence from the fact that United have won just six and lost five of their 18 away matches this season. That said, Bruce has never managed any side to victory against his former – from 20 attempts in the league – so now would be a hell of a time to register his first.</p> \n<p>A win is a necessity for Hull but it will not guarantee their survival. In seven Premier League meetings with United, they have lost every one and while <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/Teams/214\">a rating of 6.92</a> is enough to place them 15th, above both <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/Teams/16/Statistics/England-Sunderland\">Sunderland (6.88)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/Teams/23\">Newcastle (6.87)</a>, it appears they have left themselves with too much to do.</p> \n<h2>Premier League team of the week</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7929be931bf8dac99bcac27462bfe3f9fa69375\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432124765634/f5b105d4-eb30-40a4-85ef-cf126ff49b38-300x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Premier League\" width=\"300\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Infographic: WhoScored</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>La Liga team of the week</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70901366f5d60ec2951ace3af15396589d0a267e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432124893104/3d9ee9b6-34ae-4c33-9141-eb9427e6263a-460x368.jpeg\" alt=\"LIga\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Infographic: WhoScored</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Bundesliga team of the week</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"114baa08069f1327311a8d9648665ea7cbaf62ff\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432125044173/0ea71335-09c6-4f4d-a1bf-68453958e55c-460x368.jpeg\" alt=\"Bundesliga\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Infographic: WhoScored</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Serie A team of the week</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa79b34a7d2abcdea442aa1479d05870cbdf3748\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432125077537/75333688-75f9-40cf-ad5d-e08b3121ee1a-460x368.jpeg\" alt=\"Serie A\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Infographic: WhoScored</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Ligue 1 team of the week</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e51c77142152404d91e4f07f7172b47e72311183\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432125410458/376dec6e-e566-48d1-96cd-cd80af5f2b90-460x368.jpeg\" alt=\"Ligue 1\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Infographic: WhoScored</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>All statistics courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/\">WhoScored.com</a>, where you can find more stats, including live in-game data and unique player and team ratings.

Many of these have been around for decades, are family businesses that span generations. They have continued to provide a service to the community over the years and contributed to the vibrant culture of the area. As in many other regeneration plans, the outcome will inevitably result in unemployment, displacement and stripping yet another neighbourhood of its unique character.</p> \n <p><strong>- <a

and jostling and rubbish all about -- but also like Aladdin's Cave. All the wonders of the world, carried in on barrows and set up on trestles. That's a bygone London. A pity, as the chain-shop model has rendered entire areas utterly dull and predictable. But we live in times of endless commercial repetition and newness. No used goods.</p>\n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</figure> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I lived near Broadway Market in the late-70s/early-80s and there was a wonderful piece of graffiti which said: “Broadway Market is not a sinking ship, it’s a submarine”. Went back last year and found they were right! I miss all the old London markets I knew in the 70s and 80s, including the Waste. It is a shame that they have, in the main, become as gentrified as the incomers who now frequent them.</p> \n <p><strong>- <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/1518325\">Helen121</a></strong></p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The disappearance of “traditional” London life is making for a less interesting city.
