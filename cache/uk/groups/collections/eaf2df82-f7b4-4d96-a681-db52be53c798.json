Nearly half of the people in the UK <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sustainable-business/2015/jan/15/employers-social-environmental-business-practices-survey\">say they would like a job</a> that changes the world, and a US survey reveals <a href=\"http://business.time.com/2012/08/31/top-reasons-why-americans-stay-at-their-jobs-and-what-it-means-for-the-presidential-campaign/\">51% of people</a> enjoy their job because it offers “the opportunity to make a difference”. So, if you’re socially conscious and want to make a real change in the world, why not work for a charity?</p> \n<p>From media communications, to management, fundraising and volunteering — there’s a range of careers in the charity sector. Because the sector is so diverse, it’s worth identifying your skillset and which part of an organisation you would like to work for before you apply.</p> \n<p>“Take a moment to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/top-tips-for-switching-to-a-career-in-a-charity-elaine-smethurst\">think about the experience you’ve gained</a> in your career and how this transfers to a charity role,” says Elaine Smethurst, manager of <a href=\"http://www.workingforacharity.org.uk/\">Working for a Charity</a>. “For example, someone with experience in sales may have the interpersonal skills and database knowledge which could be suited to a role in fundraising.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, school leavers and graduates should look out for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/top-tips-for-switching-to-a-career-in-a-charity-elaine-smethurst\">internships</a> and volunteering opportunities to make their applications stand out. “There are various paid and unpaid internship schemes available in charities. Many charity employers also look for volunteering experience – be it organising a school fete, church raffle or volunteering during school or university,” adds Smethurst.</p> \n<p>So, if you’re looking for a job in the third sector but need help on where to start, or advice on how to perfect your application – join us on <strong>Wednesday 13 May from 1–3pm BST </strong>for a live chat with the experts.

Tour&eacute;’s agent, the ever reasonable Dimitri Seluk, pointed out this grave injustice to the media: “When it was Roberto Carlos’s birthday, the president of Anzhi gave him a Bugatti,” said a concerned Seluk. </p> \n<p>“I don’t expect City to present Yaya with a Bugatti. We only asked that they shook his hand and said ‘we congratulate you’. It is the minimum they must do when it is his birthday and the squad is all together. I hear one newspaper has written that City congratulated him from Twitter but this is a joke. It is better they don’t put anything on Twitter if they are not saying anything to him.”</p> \n<p>The message is simple: Premier League footballers are not immune from the human condition and, like the rest of us, they prefer cake to mentions on Twitter.

Whether you’re doing art for A-level or you’re exhibiting in a degree show, we’d love to see what you’ve produced in any of the arty disciplines: sculpture, fashion, painting, illustration, graphics, textiles, animation, model-making, printing and any others we’ve not thought of.
