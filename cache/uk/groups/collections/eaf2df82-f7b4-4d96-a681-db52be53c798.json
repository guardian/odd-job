In the wake of the massacre in Charleston last week, a group of historians in the US have turned to Twitter to crowdsource a list of suggested writings on the history of racial violence and race relations in America. <a href=\"http://aaihs.org/resources/charlestonsyllabus/\">Their website</a> says that educators can use the list “to broach conversations in the classroom about the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/us-news/charleston-shooting\">horrendous events</a> that unfolded in Charleston, South Carolina on the evening of June 17, 2015”.</p> \n<p>The #CharlestonSyllabus, which can be found <a href=\"http://aaihs.org/resources/charlestonsyllabus/\">on this site</a>, includes more than 200 titles – from key African American literature such as <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/tonimorrison\">Toni Morrison</a>’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2006/jul/08/fiction.tonimorrison\">Beloved</a> or Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man, general historical overviews, poetry, newspaper op-eds and readings on slavery, South Carolina, racial identities and more. </p> \n<p>The syllabus was conceived by Chad Williams, associate professor of African and Afro-American studies at Brandeis University. After feeling “deeply shocked, saddened and angered” by the shooting, Williams tells the Guardian that he grew “increasingly frustrated with the lack of information” on the commentary about the subject as days unfolded and he reflected upon what this meant “for the work we do as scholars and how we teach”. Thinking about the impact a similarly minded <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/08/how-to-teach-kids-about-whats-happening-in-ferguson/379049/\">#FergusonSyllabus</a> had had, he reached out to a group of colleagues and on Friday they asked Twitter for suggestions. Within a matter of hours <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CharlestonSyllabus?src=hash\">#CharlestonSyllabus</a> was trending, and the conversation is still kicking. </p> \n<p>The list, completely crowdsourced and put together with the help of librarians, includes recommendations by not just scholars but “ordinary folks clearly hungry for some type of resource to learn more about Charleston and discuss it”.</p> \n<h2>Where to start your reading? Four key works</h2> \n<p>We asked historian Chad Williams which books he would recommend for anyone who wants to learn more. Here are the four he highlighted:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>WEB Du Bois, <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/souls-of-black-folk/oclc/49295022&amp;referer=brief_results\">The Souls of Black Folk </a>(1903) is a “crucial starting point” that he always recommends his students. </li> \n <li>James M McPherson, <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/battle-cry-of-freedom-the-civil-war-era/oclc/15550774&amp;referer=brief_results\">Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era</a> (1988) is one of the key works on the civil war and the reconstruction period. </li> \n <li>John Coski, <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/confederate-battle-flag-americas-most-embattled-emblem/oclc/57010219&amp;referer=brief_results\">The Confederate Battle Flag: America’s Most Embattled Emblem</a> (2005) – given <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/23/mississippi-confederate-flag-consider-dropping-emblem\">the current focus on the confederate flag</a>, here is some necessary context. </li> \n <li>Thomas Holt, <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/title/black-over-white-negro-political-leadership-in-south-carolina-during-reconstruction/oclc/2964308&amp;referer=brief_results\">Black Over White: Negro Political Leadership in South Carolina During Reconstruction<em> </em></a>(1977) is a great resource on the history of South Carolina. </li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><a href=\"http://aaihs.org/resources/charlestonsyllabus/\">See the full Charleston Syllabus here</a>, and also on <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/89150._CharlestonSyllabus?page=1\">this Goodreads list</a>.

For the last six months Greece has been locked in talks with the EU aimed at securing a sustainable future. During the last few weeks the crisis has reached breaking point – will Greece exit Europe or can a last minute deal be negotatiated? </p> \n<p>Η αβεβαιότητα για τους Έλληνες είναι πλέον τρόπος ζωής. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/19/tsipras-greece-europe-eurozone-crisis-banks-debts-euro-imf-ecb-germany-austerity\">Τα πέντε χρόνια της ύφεσης και της λιτότητας έχουν αφήσει το 26% του εργατικού δυναμικού χωρίς εργασία και συγχρόνως το ΑΕΠ έχει συρρικνωθεί κατά ένα τέταρτο</a>. Τους τελευταίους έξι μήνες η Ελλάδα συζητά με την EE ώστε να μπορέσει να εξασφαλίσει ένα βιώσιμο/καλύτερο μέλλον. Τις τελευταίες όμως εβδομάδες η κρίση έχει φτάσει σε ένα κρίσιμο σημείο - θα βγεί η Ελλάδα από την Ευρωζώνη ή θα υπάρξει συμφωνία της τελευταίας στιγμής;</p> \n<p>We’d like to hear from Greeks about what it’s like living with the economic crisis. We’d also like to hear from the diaspora; if you have family in Greece or visit Greece often, how do you view the situation? Θα θέλαμε να ακούσουμε απόψεις των Ελλήνων πάνω σε αυτό το θέμα, πως είναι να ζεις την περίοδο αυτής της οικονομικής κρίσης.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Do you think Greece should stay in the eurozone? Πιστεύετε ότι η Ελλάδα πρέπει να μείνει στην Ευρωζώνη;</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>Should the Greek government keep negotiating with the EU, or reach a deal as soon as possible? Θα πρέπει η Ελληνική κυβέρνηση να συνεχίσει να διαπραγματεύεται με την ΕΕ ή να φτάσει σε συμφωνία όσο το δυνατόν πιο γρήγορα;<br /></li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>What have the past five years been like for you, your family and the people around you? Πώς ήταν τα τελευταία πέντε χρόνια για εσάς, την οικογενειά σας και τους ανθρώπους τριγύρω σας;</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>What do you think needs to change to improve the economic situation in Greece? <br />Tι αλλαγές πιστεύετε ότι πρέπει να γίνουν ώστε να καλυτερεύσει η οικονομική κατάσταση στην Ελλάδα;</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li>How do you view the future?

In the face of a brewing backbench rebellion and public opposition from prominent figures such as former attorney general Dominic Grieve, the commitment was promptly delayed to a period of consultation.</p> \n<p><strong>We want to hear what you think. Should we keep the Human Rights Act or should we replace it with a new Bill of Rights?</strong> What are the arguments for scrapping it? Do landmark cases such as that of Abu Qatada prove the act is open to abuse? Does it enshrine European judicial overreach? And would a British exit from the ECHR trigger the end of its supremacy across Europe? What would happen to privacy and protest rights? And what would a new Bill of Rights mean for law enforcement?</p> \n<p>You can share your views by clicking on the blue “contribute” buttons on this article.
