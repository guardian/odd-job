What followed crippled the city, causing loss of life and destroying people’s homes.

Less than a month later, Hurricane Rita added insult to injury.</p> \n<p>Recovery and rebuilding efforts drew mass attention, not least for their <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2007/dec/04/film.usa\">celebrity spearheading</a>.

Is each neighbourhood as prepared as the next?<br /></p> \n<p>If you live in New Orleans, share your thoughts, stories, images and videos on whether the city feels stronger since Katrina.

Let’s take Iceland for example. They said no to the IMF, and now after five years, they are the fastest growing economy in Europe. </p> \n<p>There have been suicides because of how bad things have become. Our previous governments promised us no austerity measures. But then they passed two memorandums and drove us to the worst, favouring the rich and those who have interests against middle class.</p> \n<p>Last year, I made it into a university in a city nearby. At that time, only my dad had a job. My family couldn’t afford to to send me there, so I got stuck in my city. Our economic situation limited not only mine, but most children’s futures. I could have had greater potential for a prosperous future elsewhere, rather than in my own city.</p> \n<p>Now, both of my parents work in the private sector, without knowing if tomorrow they will still have a job. We can only afford the basics: food and water. Every month we struggle to make ends meet, and we have to take out money from our savings to afford all the bills and loans. <br /></p> \n<p>Even though I didn’t vote for Syriza, I believe that they have been the best government in modern history. They may not have an agreement yet, but voting no will get rid of more austerity measures and more relief will come to Greek homes.</p> \n<p> Personally, I’m planning to leave the country at some point, after I finish school. But that’s only because I have the privilege to have an Australian citizenship. Under no circumstances do I recommend that people leave the country.

In fact, it’s only been the opposite. It has been a struggle without any outcome. </p> \n<p>The yes voters are mostly people who have become rich in the previous years by the former governments. People who own or work at national enterprises and those who are really afraid and affected by the media’s propaganda. </p> \n<p>I am 30 years old, I have a university diploma with a masters degree, and I do not have my own job right now. I still live with my parents and my future is not certain. Last week my employment contract ended. It was only for 8 months, and I waited for over two hours to get my unemployment card. The media doesn’t show such stories.</p> \n<p>You can feel the anxiety and the agonising of people wondering what’s next. If the result is a yes, the best scenario is that everything stays the same.

The crisis is present in my daily life, in the lives of most people. My parents’ monthly income has fallen even though my mum tries hard to tell us that we can live from now on as before.</p> \n<p>My education has suffered. I know that I can’t do anything more than just a degree in this country. And a degree that’s hardly recognised by universities outside of Greece. Ι’m indescribably happy about what I study but disappointed by the opportunities offered to me. </p> \n<p>I choose to vote no not only for my country but for the whole of Europe. This situation was caused by the administration mechanisms in Europe who favour finances and not humans. Νobody can stand the policies.<br /></p> \n<p>I’m not a supporter of Syriza however I believe in similar ideas. I think that this government tries hard and resists.

You might be a huge Wimbledon fan currently living overseas, having to burn the midnight oil to get a chance to see your favourite players in action.

According to a review in Kirkus: “In the middle of his thirty-seventh year and first nervous breakdown, reading obits of college pals in the alumni rag, the husband-author manque of Joan Didion rents an apartment in the town that’s always open. In between sleeping and TV quiz shows he gets to know some of the occasionally wealthy but always degenerate desperate citizens: comic Jackie Kasey, who gets $10,000 a week but drives himself crazy with lack of fame and status games like “taking steam” with Frankie or Sammy or Cosby; Artha the hooker who turned 1203 tricks with 1076 johns in five years, including 54 “multiples,” 24 S and 1 M; and Buster Mano, the private dick, who traces straying conventioneering hubbies and hustles gambling debts.” Sounds more than promising. </p> \n<p>A “wonderful novel” according to <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1709107\">ID5882060</a>, despite its low sales and almost unknown status.

It’s because of The Stand that I’ve read all his work, and that I embarked on this series; it’s because of The Stand that I’m a writer at all.” “For me, the writing of Stephen King starts and ends with<em> </em>The Stand,” <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/richardthomas/essential-stephen-king#.xu8MRoJ8v\">wrote</a> author Richard Thomas on Buzzfeed.</p> \n<p>“Nothing in The Stand is an accident. As much as it’s a novel about the battle between good and evil, it’s also a novel about fate. These people – the American contingent of the 0.6% of the world’s population who survived Captain Trips – manage to meet up in Las Vegas, called from all around by dreams. Did they choose to find each other, or was it chosen for them?” continued Smythe. The novel was recommended by reader <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12201101\">CoronationChicken</a>. <br /></p> \n<p><strong>In quotes from the book:</strong><br /></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Who gets to be bexst-liked in any community?

Fools Die (1978) and Inside Las Vegas (1977) by <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/mario-puzo\">Mario Puzo</a></h2> \n<p>The author of The Godfather wrote two books set in this city: the novel Fools Die, recommended by <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12044296\">banjodsp</a>, and the non-fiction Inside Las Vegas, a “world-weary account of the place” according to <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2910461\">Face56</a>. These are also examples of an author from elswehere (New York in this case, of course) settling in the city for a while and translating the experience into fiction and memoir. Apparently, Puzo himself <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/mario-puzo/inside-las-vegas/\">was a “degenerate gambler”</a> – but he believed Las Vegas was an honest, clean city. </p> \n<p><strong>In quotes from the book:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Let us be separated by wars and pestilence, death, madness but not by the passing of time. – Fools Die</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The fact of the matter is that I wanted to hold a grudge in some funny kind of way.

When D’Agata helped his mother move to Las Vegas in the summer 2002, the US Congress was going ahead with the plans, and the writer and essayist stayed to look into the history of it all (as well as investigate the mysterious suicide of a boy who jumped off a hotel-casino). The format of the book has also been called “a reporter’s notebook that reads like poetry” by <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124361803\">NPR</a>.

This trilogy, formed by the novels American Tabloid, The Cold Six Thousand and Blood’s a Rover, tells a saga of corruption in the late 50s and early 60s and includes real history – John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King’s assassinations and the Vietnam War among other defining events – and spans across the country. Las Vegas has a strong presence as the Mafia’s stronghold.
