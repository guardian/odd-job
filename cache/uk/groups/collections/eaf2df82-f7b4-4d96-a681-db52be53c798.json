I just read Ryan Boudinot’s <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Littlest_Hitler.html?id=GxiWoVAvvZ0C&amp;redir_esc=y\">The Littlest Hitler</a>. I do not know how I do not know who Ryan Boudinot is. I do not understand why this writer and this book has not been reviewed, recommended and hyped to a point that made me cry: “Oh for pity’s sake, not another article about bloody Boudinot! Isn’t Gaiman <em>ever</em> going to get a look in?”</p> \n <p data-dropid=\"3\">(Searching for it just now on The Guardian yielded one result, a story about a three-year-old boy called Adolf Hitler Campbell whose birthday cake a bakery refused to decorate.)</p> \n <p data-dropid=\"4\">Why is this book on my shelf? Where did I come across it? Who told me about it? Was it one of you? Who should I hug? Whoever it was, you should really be hugging me, whispering “there, there”. After reading these 13 stories, I’m simultaneously terrified, befuddled, bemused, amused, excited, dazzled and dazed.</p> \n <p data-dropid=\"5\">The stories are every genre and none. Weird, dystopian, utopian, fantastical, realistic, surrealistic, absurd, satirical, romantic. The writing’s so pitch-perfect it’s invisible, but I can’t substantiate with quotes. Partly because I was too immersed to take notes. Mostly because the power lies in the cumulative effect.

It’s a hugely researched and detailed account of the early Everest expeditions — and not just a revision of the expeditions themselves but a biographical study of the people involved, a political study of British colonialism in Asia, a geographical study of the Himalayas, and – essentially, and perhaps most interesting to me – a putting of the Everest expeditions into their historical context: <em>why</em> these men did it, and <em>what</em> it meant to them (and, in fact, to the world). Many of the men involved seem to have made Everest their mission in life, and viewed the conquest of it as having a meaning far deeper than that of simple personal gratification; a belief that following the abject misery of the First World War, their achievement would mean something for Great Britain itself, that it would be an inspiration to the British people – “a climbing expedition that would become the ultimate gesture of imperial redemption”.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p data-dropid=\"5\">This belief could be viewed, charitably, as admirable, even noble in its way – but it is just the sort of attitude that tends to possess an awfully ugly side, too. As Davis writes, the British mountaineering community in the early twentieth-century was anything but a meritocracy – I believe almost every one of the men involved in the expeditions was public school-educated, if not Oxbridge-educated – and I’ve found Davis’s insights into that rather fascinating; why particular climbers were chosen for the expeditions, and others were not. One incident recounted sums it up: Sydney Spencer, editor of the Alpine Journal, is in conversation with a friend and glances out of a window at a street sweeper, “casually” commenting that, “his Alpine Club would never admit such an individual, even if he were the best climber in the world”.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10021252\">conedison</a> posed a great question:<br /></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p data-dropid=\"2\"><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/dec/13/stoner-john-williams-julian-barnes\">Stoner</a>’s one of the greatest novels I’ve ever read.

For that reason, and that reason alone, I can’t envision myself taking the time to go through all of it again; however, I may feel different when I’m older – perhaps it will want me to read it again when I’m 35, or 49, or 61.

Thinking about a book as a work of art, and putting literature into the same realms as art, music, poetry and so on makes the case for rereading. I could never know all there is to know about any art form from one visit. I also revisit at different times of my life bringing new experiences to bear. Some music I have listened to all my life and still find something new every time, something to make me catch my breath and relearn the work emotionally. It’s the same with reading. Each decade brings its own wisdom, or otherwise, and great works of literature demand a renewed acquaintance.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/556c7974e4b04a873a5a93e2/1555802\">Vladislav Slyusarev shared</a> this picture of his “readings and ridings of June”:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3f673e5244eacfd40f1c1d98ea4a54ab90375d0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435572970606/03c0a26c-2f39-4392-8887-f308c36ad905-460x400.jpeg\" alt=\"tls\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">“Toy reads <a href=\"http://britishlibrary.typepad.co.uk/european/2014/01/vasyl-stus-in-memoriam.html\">Vasyl Stus</a>’s selected poems against a background of Philology Faculty with dismounted memorial table for the poet.

I am currently reading John Gimlette – he seems to delight in following in someone else’s footsteps and then providing a doubled travel narrative. I first came across him a few years ago when I read <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2005/feb/26/featuresreviews.guardianreview3\">Theatre of Fish</a>, which follows his great-grandfather’s trail around (primarily) Newfoundland and Labrador.

I’m finding it a fair bit more lively than Theatre of Fish, mainly (I think) because his source (an army Lieutenant) is with him, and retracing his own steps as a civilian.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-book-buyers-lament\">A Book Buyer’s Lament</a>: “Unread books remind me of promises made to read them when they were bought; some of these promises are now decades old.” A New Yorker piece that we know will resonate with many of you...</li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2015/jun/22/nypd-photo-archive-death-destruction/\">A Roomful of Death and Destruction</a>: <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3828881\">Swelter</a> recommended this read for “those who, like me, have enjoyed Luc Sante’s looks at historical New York City crime and vice in <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Low_Life.html?id=EKy1QgAACAAJ\">Low Life</a> and <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Evidence.html?id=ewSEQgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\">Evidence</a>.” The New York Review of Books article talks about a collection of police evidence photos spanning over fifty years of the 20th century.</li> \n</ul> \n<blockquote> \n <p data-dropid=\"1\">[...] besides preserving the physical facts of important events and highlighting trends and aberrations in social behavior over the decades, the pictures record innumerable details of the appearance and atmosphere of the city in those decades.
