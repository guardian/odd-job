For example, some women report experiencing intense mood swings. Others say they gain weight, lose their sex drive and stop having periods. Some women find the perfect contraceptive method the first time they head to their GP – others find they need to shop around before settling.</p> \n<p>We want to learn more about women’s experiences with hormonal contraception.

With 93% saying they suffer from stress at work, and more than half saying they are more stressed than this time last year, learning to clock off and manage stress has never been more important. </p> \n<p>Alongside the positive and charming “I use adult colouring books”, we received frank responses that detailed the daily struggles some public service workers face. Many respondents described over-eating as a means to combat the pressure of work, while others – some 28% – said they tended to drink when stressed. Some said there’s often no time for relaxation, because with a massive workload it’s easier to just carry on doing as much as possible rather than let it pile up further.</p> \n<p>So how do you relax? Are you no sooner through the door then you’re out with the dog to walk off the day? Do you fill up the tub for a long hot soak? A bottle of wine in front of the TV? Running before breakfast? Gardening or DIY? Do you have advice you think others who experience stress could benefit from? Or do you just want to share the work week pain with a selfie to sum up your Friday feeling?</p> \n<p>We want the images and stories of how those working in public services and the voluntary sector try to find a balance between work and home. You can submit yours via GuardianWitness anonymously or with your name. </p> \n<p>We will be using these to inform our project, called Clock off, which is examining work-life balance in the public and voluntary sectors.
