As our critic Jonathan Jones wrote: “The still life is democratic; anyone can do it. Pick up a pencil and draw your lunch, as the cartoonist Robert Crumb ritualistically does. Or take your camera and survey the ordinary things around you. Click the shutter on a bunch of grapes or a bottle of ketchup. Is that a still life?” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2012/nov/16/still-life-photography-jonathan-jones\">The answer is complicated</a>, especially in the era of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/technology/instagram\">Instagram</a> and ubiquitous mobile photography.
