On the follow-up of the OECD toolkit-II, manufacturing needs to be included in the prior action;<br /></li> \n <li>on energy markets, proceed with the privatisation of the electricity transmission network operator (ADMIE), unless replacement measures can be found that have equivalent effect on competition, as agreed by the Institutions;<br /></li> \n <li>on labour markets, undertake rigorous reviews and modernisation of collective bargaining, industrial action and, in line with the relevant EU directive and best practice, collective dismissals, along the timetable and the approach agreed with the Institutions. On the basis of these reviews, labour market policies should be aligned with international and European best practices, and should not involve a return to past policy settings which are not compatible with the goals of promoting sustainable and inclusive growth;<br /></li> \n <li>adopt the necessary steps to strengthen the financial sector, including decisive action on non-performing loans and measures to strengthen governance of the HFSF and the banks, in particular by eliminating any possibility for political interference especially in appointment processes.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>And on top of that, Greece will also establish a new fund to sell off valuable assets to help repay its new bailout, and refinance its banks.</p> \n<p>Or as the statement put it:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>develop a significantly scaled up privatisation programme with improved governance; valuable Greek assets will be transferred to an independent fund that will monetize the assets through privatisations and other means. The monetization of the assets will be one source to make the scheduled repayment of the new loan of ESM and generate over the life of the new loan a targeted total of €50bn of which €25bn will be used for the repayment of recapitalization of banks and other assets and 50% of every remaining euro (i.e. 50% of €25bn) will be used for decreasing the debt to GDP ratio and the remaining 50% will be used for investments.</li> \n</ul> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://witness.theguardian.com\">GuardianWitness</a> is the home of readers’ content on the Guardian.

It’s the ONLY novel I’ve read that can truly be described as “charming” and “groundbreaking” in the same sentence. Jean Louise’s descriptions of the town of Maycomb, her childhood desire to “make Boo Radley come out,” her innocent courage in front of the court house the night before the trial, and her love of her father are all elements of the novel that continue to engage the reader on every visit to the novel. It is a beautifully written story of courage. I never tire of meeting up with Scout, Jem, Dill, Cal, Boo Radley, and, of course, one of the greatest heroes in literature, Atticus Finch.

I used to read it every summer in the roasting Australian sun, feeling an affinity with Jem, Scout and Dill – sweating through the summer with them. But despite the heat (and unlike my sister and I, who survived each January on a diet of raspberry ice-blocks), Maycomb residents are still baking cakes.</p> \n<p>The classic Southern Lane Cake appears a couple of times in the book, generally as a welcome, and almost certainly to allow the baker to show off their baking finesse. Miss Maudie tells Scout that Miss Stephanie, who has been after her recipe for thirty years, will never learn her secrets.

It was one of the first books that I can remember that sparked my interest in literature and that helped shape my writing style. Now, as an adult and English teacher myself, I seem to better understand its themes of perseverance, empathy, and compassion. The gritty realism of the book demonstrates the prevalent cultural norms of the time, and the steadfast fortitude of Atticus and Mrs. Maudie shows the existence of those who opposed such attitudes. There is also a great balance in Atticus’s character, and it is what makes him one of the greatest American literary heroes.” By <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55926fbfe4b01076d7bf078a/1609007\">Blake Downs</a></p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436786600133/17a15f8f-8fca-44bf-a69c-ac792e55caf1-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"GuardianWitness","altText":"ghosts","cleanCredit":"Photograph: GuardianWitness"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436787530202/d739e539-0350-433b-b213-258907b491cf-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Photograph: <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55926fbfe4b01076d7bf078a/1608075\">PullandKick74/GuardianWitness</a>","credit":"GuardianWitness","altText":"TKAM","cleanCaption":"Photograph: <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55926fbfe4b01076d7bf078a/1608075\">PullandKick74/GuardianWitness</a>"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436787145666/f57c7972-22d3-4cd8-906d-04d9e206b9ba-1020x679.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":679,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"“One copy is not enough – school copy and anniversary edition,” shared by <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55926fbfe4b01076d7bf078a/1609860\">LM Chapman</a>.
