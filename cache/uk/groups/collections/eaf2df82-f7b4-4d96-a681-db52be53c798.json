Will Manchester United save Sunderland and Newcastle?</p>\n<p>By <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martinlaurence7\">Martin Laurence</a> for <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/\">WhoScored?</a>, part of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/guardian-sport-network\">Guardian Sport Network</a></p>","byline":"Martin Laurence","body":"<p>The majority of the focus on the Premier League’s final day, as so often proves to be the case, will be on the sides battling against relegation. As things stand it’s a three-way fight to avoid the drop, with Sunderland holding the advantage – as well as a game in hand – over local rivals Newcastle and third-from-bottom Hull City.</p> \n<h2>Sunderland, 37 points. Remaining games: Arsenal and Chelsea away</h2> \n<p>Sunderland face an unenviable task at the Emirates on Wednesday night but can take solace from the knowledge that they have held Arsenal to goalless draws in three of their last six trips to North London. If they manage the same feat this time around, Dick Advocaat will have steered the club to safety in the space of just eight matches. It’s also worth noting that Arsenal have drawn a blank in both of their last two home matches.</p> \n<p>Sunderland have managed to pick up just eight points from the last 60 available against Ars&egrave;ne Wenger’s side though. If the league had started at the turn of the year, Arsenal would be top on goal difference, despite having played one game fewer than their rivals. They have only won one of their last four matches but Arsenal have been the strongest team this year, <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/Teams/13\">with a score of 7.27</a>.</p> \n<p>If Sunderland lose to Arsenal, they will have to travel to the champions in the hope that they will recreate the shock victory that helped secure their survival late last season. The result effectively ended Chelsea’s title hopes and Jos&eacute; Mourinho is not the sort of manager who forgives and forgets. He will demand that his side sign off in style before the trophy presentation, especially in light of their defeat to West Brom last time out.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, aside from their humiliation at Southampton early on in the season, Sunderland have been well organised away from home. They have only lost more away matches than the Premier League’s current top four (six), while only five sides have conceded fewer goals on their travels (23).</p> \n<h2>Newcastle, 36 points. Remaining game: West Ham at home</h2> \n<p>On paper, a home match against mid-table West Ham looks to be among the most favourable available, with the Hammers having picked up the fourth fewest points in the league since the turn of the year (16). Unfortunately for Newcastle their points haul in that time, under head coach John Carver, places them bottom of the league with just 10, and their defeat at QPR on Saturday showed their inability to pick up any sort of result right now.</p> \n<p>Newcastle’s recent record against West Ham doesn’t make for great reading either, with the one win they have secured in their last five meetings also the only match in which they have scored against them in in that time. A point would not be enough to secure their safety if Hull beat Manchester United, due to Hull’s significantly superior goal difference (-17 to -25).</p> \n<p>Sam Allardyce does not exactly hold fond memories from his time at Newcastle and will be keen to avoid a third successive defeat in what could be his final game in charge of West Ham. Newcastle should not expect any favours from their opponents.</p> \n<h2>Hull City, 34 points. Remaining game: Manchester United at home</h2> \n<p>Hull City have it all to do. While they will be praying for Arsenal to beat Sunderland on Wednesday for obvious reasons, a victory for the Gunners would mean that United will finish fourth, subsequently entering the Champions League qualification phase. Such an outcome could have a baring on Louis van Gaal’s team selection, though he is unlikely to field a weak side given the quality he has at his disposal; best highlighted by the fact that a player of Angel di Maria’s quality cannot make the starting XI.</p> \n<p>Steve Bruce has no such luxuries but will take confidence from the fact that United have won just six and lost five of their 18 away matches this season. That said, Bruce has never managed any side to victory against his former – from 20 attempts in the league – so now would be a hell of a time to register his first.</p> \n<p>A win is a necessity for Hull but it will not guarantee their survival. In seven Premier League meetings with United, they have lost every one and while <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/Teams/214\">a rating of 6.92</a> is enough to place them 15th, above both <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/Teams/16/Statistics/England-Sunderland\">Sunderland (6.88)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/Teams/23\">Newcastle (6.87)</a>, it appears they have left themselves with too much to do.</p> \n<h2>Premier League team of the week</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7929be931bf8dac99bcac27462bfe3f9fa69375\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432124765634/f5b105d4-eb30-40a4-85ef-cf126ff49b38-300x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Premier League\" width=\"300\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Infographic: WhoScored</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>La Liga team of the week</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70901366f5d60ec2951ace3af15396589d0a267e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432124893104/3d9ee9b6-34ae-4c33-9141-eb9427e6263a-460x368.jpeg\" alt=\"LIga\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Infographic: WhoScored</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Bundesliga team of the week</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"114baa08069f1327311a8d9648665ea7cbaf62ff\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432125044173/0ea71335-09c6-4f4d-a1bf-68453958e55c-460x368.jpeg\" alt=\"Bundesliga\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Infographic: WhoScored</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Serie A team of the week</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa79b34a7d2abcdea442aa1479d05870cbdf3748\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432125077537/75333688-75f9-40cf-ad5d-e08b3121ee1a-460x368.jpeg\" alt=\"Serie A\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Infographic: WhoScored</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Ligue 1 team of the week</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e51c77142152404d91e4f07f7172b47e72311183\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432125410458/376dec6e-e566-48d1-96cd-cd80af5f2b90-460x368.jpeg\" alt=\"Ligue 1\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Infographic: WhoScored</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>All statistics courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/\">WhoScored.com</a>, where you can find more stats, including live in-game data and unique player and team ratings.

They have continued to provide a service to the community over the years and contributed to the vibrant culture of the area.

It’s unclear what this might mean for EU migrants living in the UK - and for Brits living in Europe. Currently <a href=\"http://epthinktank.eu/2015/01/26/welfare-in-europe-access-and-safeguards-as-regards-to-social-assistance-and-benefits/\">there are 14 million EU citizens residing in another member state</a> and a British exit could require a whole new set of rules governing economic migration, visas and leave to remain. <br /></p> \n<p>Free movement – that’s the ability to live, work and study anywhere in the Union could be restricted and future <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/14/brexit-what-would-happen-if-britain-left-eu-european-union-referendum-uk\">migration into and out of the UK </a>could theroretically be regulated by British national law. In an extreme scenario, British people could end up having to apply for visas every time they travel across the Channel. And Brits already living in other EU countries such as Spain may face integration rules, such as a requirement to speak the language of the host country, before gaining long-term residency status. Access to education, healthcare and welfare could also be in doubt. <br /></p> \n<p>We’d like to hear from people who’re concerned about what a future UK exit from the EU would mean for them – both Brits living in Europe and EU migrants to the UK. Do you feel it’s important to get dual nationality now? Have your applied for a second passport? Are you making plans to acquire citizenship? We’d also like you to tell us about your situation – are you married or in a relationship with someone from another European member state? Perhaps you’re working in the UK but your family resides elsewhere.
