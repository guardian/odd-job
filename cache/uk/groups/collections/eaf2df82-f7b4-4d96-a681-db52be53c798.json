If you ever have the chance to follow a world-class golfer around one of the planet’s great courses, take it. The way they go after fairways, attack greens, drop shots beside pins and then spin them back to within putting distance is a sight to behold. Watching a golfer make a mockery of a course’s supposed “par” score is one of the great experiences in sport.</p> \n<p>That being said, there’s also something deliciously satisfying about seeing a group of professionals clambering their way around a course and being as baffled by it as the rest of us. If you enjoy your golf with a healthy dose of schadenfreude, you will have enjoyed the US Open this weekend. </p> \n<p>Henrik Stenson likened playing the Chambers Bay course to “putting on broccoli”. Gary Player spoke with horror about the player who missed the green by a yard and end up “50 yards down in the valley”. Welcome to our world Gary; the harder we practise, the unluckier we get. For most of us, golf will always be a mournful ballad entitled “50 yards down in the valley”.</p> \n<p><strong>Gary Player:</strong><br /></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“The worst golf course I might’ve ever seen in the 63 years as a professional golfer. The USGA, who I admire and have chosen great golf courses in this great United States of America — they’re preaching speed of play. Enjoyment. User-friendly. This golf course here, if you’re a 10-handicap, you couldn’t break 100 if you had the best day of your life. They’ve got pros putting from 20 feet and hitting the ball 20 foot to the right, a man misses the green by a yard and he’s 50 yards down in the valley. I mean I don’t understand it. It’s 7,900 yards long. The world is in dire straits with water. Can you imagine the costs to maintain this? And it’s a public course, but they’ll probably charge the public $200 to play it. I’d like to challenge anyone with a 16 handicap to do better than 40 over par. It’s basically unplayable.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Sergio Garc&iacute;a:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“Why do they do this to the course? This is a great championship with great history. The US Open deserves so much better than this. It hurts to see what they have done to the course. These greens, come on, let’s be honest, you can’t say they are good. It’s just not right.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Billy Horschel:<br /></strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“I’ve been waiting for this moment all week. I think a lot of players, and I’m one of them, have lost some respect for the USGA and this championship this year for the greens. When you have a majority of the players commenting publicly, and some of them aren’t because they don’t want to get the pushback from it, then there’s an issue. I heard someone say that the TV is making the greens look worse than they are. That’s a complete lie.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Ernie Els:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“We have to go out there in front of millions of people and putt on these things. The USGA, they have got to take a bit of responsibility.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Justin Rose:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“I had a five-foot putt on the first and didn’t have the first idea what it was going to do. It felt like outdoor bingo at that point.” </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Ian Poulter:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“What wasn’t playable were the green surfaces. If this was a regular PGA tour event lots of players would have withdrawn and gone home on Wednesday, but players won’t do that for a major. They were simply the worst most disgraceful surface I have ever seen on any tour in all the years I have played. The US Open deserves better than that.’’</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Henrik Stenson:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“It is borderline laughable at some of the greens and some of the pin positions. When we’re actually almost better off plugged in a bunker than being on the top of a ridge, like on the fourth. And it’s pretty much like putting on broccoli, as well.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Dustin Johnson, who led for most of the weekend but <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/22/jordan-spieth-us-open-2015-rivalry-rory-mcilroy\">lost out to Jordan Speith at the last hole</a>, was complimentary about the course. “From the first time I played it I liked it,” he said. “It’s a lot of fun and you need to use your imagination.” What do you think?

In the face of a brewing backbench rebellion and public opposition from prominent figures such as former attorney general Dominic Grieve, the commitment was promptly delayed to a period of consultation.</p> \n<p><strong>We want to hear what you think. Should we keep the Human Rights Act or should we replace it with a new Bill of Rights?</strong> What are the arguments for scrapping it? Do landmark cases such as that of Abu Qatada prove the act is open to abuse? Does it enshrine European judicial overreach? And would a British exit from the ECHR trigger the end of its supremacy across Europe? What would happen to privacy and protest rights? And what would a new Bill of Rights mean for law enforcement?</p> \n<p>You can share your views by clicking on the blue “contribute” buttons on this article.

One of the things I'm most proud of having achieved is of making a living as a writer since I was in my mid-20s. Looking back it seems more and more amazing to me that someone from my background is able to make a living as a professional writer. I can now see how difficult and how increasingly difficult that is. I would also like my kids to see what it is to have a vocation, what it is to have work that you love to do. And that would be at least one lesson I would like to pass onto the kids. When I get up in the morning after my coffee the first thing I want to do is write - I still have that passion.

So for me philosophy and psychoanalysis crossed over and their concerns were very similar. So through philosophy and psychoanalysis, I could think about race, sexuality, contemporary politics, families, madness, and so on. I can't say how all this informs my work, but I would have to say that anything you listen to, think about, read, the conversations you have would inevitably inform your work. Mostly at the beginning of my career I was interested in writing about race because I came from a mixed-race background, and saw that although Britain was changing from the post-war period, very few writers and artists felt they were in a position to write about it. I remember reading ER Braithwaite's To Sir With Love, which concerns a black man going to teach in a white school in the East End, and thinking: I want to write about this subject. The end of the empire, and the beginning of a new form of colonialism within Britain. When I finally got around to writing The Buddha of Suburbia and I found a voice and tone and style for it, it was the book I'd been trying to write since I was 14 or 15 years old. The book that would be about race, fashion, drugs, music, sexual experimentation and punk, ie much of what I'd lived through. But you can't just write down what happened to you yesterday; you have to find an approach or point of view that enables you to write freely. And it's that that takes the time. But when you find that - when I found that I should write it in the first person rather than the third - it should then come relatively easily. </p> \n    <p>It would be a mistake to think that writing is therapy for the writer; that really is for bad writers. The therapy involved in writing is for the reader, that you are making or are part of a culture. The point of a culture is to provide a resource where people can think more widely about what matters to them. This is I guess why having a living culture, that's informed by new voices, is so crucial.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-5587eb5ce4b0629b0a62a9ba","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:03:08Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:28:23Z","body":"<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4034427\">MythicalMagpie</a> asked:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Some of your writing is reported to have caused conflict with family because of its seemingly autobiographical content.

The opposite of conflict would be a terrible conformity or quiescence. It would be a form of death to remain silent. So you must say you'll say, and then you'll find out how others think about what it is you've said. Silence is worse. The truth is, you don't really know how others are going to receive your works, but if you remain silent, they'll never find out. It would be ridiculous to think you could live in a world without conflict; there's a lot of truth in conflict. I would recommend engaging in good conflict: where you might feel the need to speak the truth. When you're writing, the one thing you must do is say it how it feels to you.

And for some time, this did as they say, my head in. After a while I realised that this was a political and social issue, rather than something that concerned my psychological health. I saw that Britain had to change. There was an idea that whiteness was the standard, that whiteness was the bar, as it were. Just as at that time heterosexuality was considered to be the sexual standard. Things would only improve for all of us if these categories were questioned, dismissed, and we could begin to see things differently. As I say, this is a political, social and cultural issue. It's terrible when people become locked into identities that are too narrow for them, when they see themselves exclusively as, say, straight, Muslim, white, or whatever it is. You might say we need a more creative view of human possibility. The arts might be one way of advancing this.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-5587ee6ee4b0b5dab300bd52","title":"\"I often wish that I'd started a franchise like JK Rowling\"","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:16:10Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:29:17Z","body":"<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2485239\">listlessbedouin</a> asks:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>If you had to write a sequel to one of your stories, which would it be?

Because when you write a story, a novel, or a movie, you really inhabit the characters and they really inhabit you. For a long time they're a part of your life. They are bits of you, and they seem to have some sort of independent existence. So when you're done with them you do worry about what happens to them. I often wish that I'd started a franchise like JK Rowling, by which I mean a form in which you could keep the same characters going forever. I would be a richer man than I am now. So although I still wonder what might have happened to Karim Amir, or Charlie Hero, or DeeDee Osgood, what excites me are the new characters that I'm making, that still appear to me as I sit at my desk and starting talking in my ear. So when I finish something I feel a terrible vacancy, and I wait for myself to be inhabited by these new ghosts who soon, if I'm lucky, start speaking to me and to one another. I can't say I know how this kind of magic happens; I guess you have to turn up your hearing aid, and if you're lucky, you'll pick up something. Perhaps for a writer it becomes a kind of habit and you don't even have to look for stories any more; they find you.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</figure>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-5587ee84e4b0b5dab300bd54","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:16:31Z","body":"<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12216831\">meekstom21</a> asks:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>How can I avoid being part of the 99.9 per cent of creative writing students who are talentless?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/54236157\"> \n <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> \n  <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> \n   <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15038158\" title=\"View HanifKureishi’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for HanifKureishi\" /> </a> \n   <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> \n  </div> \n  <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> \n   <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> \n    <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15038158\" title=\"View HanifKureishi’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">HanifKureishi</span> </a> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> \n    <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/54236157\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">22 June 2015 12:13pm</a> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"> \n    <p>Most people can sing, or dance, or cook a bit, and have all sorts of accomplishments they they are not necessarily outstanding at.

So whether you are a lesbian, person of colour, or identify with any minority, I would like to see us forming a new politics that is concerned with what I would call public values. Thatcher destroyed public values; indeed, didn't appear to believe in them. So now, a generation later, we are left without public housing, decent pensions, effective trade unions, or a political party that can represent anything except the elite. So after the collapse of Marxist communism, and the instatement of neo-liberalism from Thatcher through her disciple Blair and onto Cameron, we are it seems to me now living more or less in a one-party state. We lack an effective and ideological opposition. The collapse of the left at the last election presents a great opportunity for us to think about possibilities of reframing politics and creating alternatives to the neo-liberal horror that awaits us.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</figure>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-5587f121e4b0629b0a62a9dc","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:27:58Z","body":"<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4285950\">bettyparry</a> asks:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Do you think <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/franzkafka\">Kafka</a> has any meaning for us today?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/54236876\"> \n <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> \n  <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> \n   <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15038158\" title=\"View HanifKureishi’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for HanifKureishi\" /> </a> \n   <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-contributor d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian contributor\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian contributor</span> \n  </div> \n  <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> \n   <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> \n    <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/15038158\" title=\"View HanifKureishi’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">HanifKureishi</span> </a> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> \n    <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/54236876\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">22 June 2015 12:24pm</a> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"> \n    <p>One of the things I've noticed particularly with regard to my own teenage children is that there has occured a break between the culture of the past and the present. My children were mostly brought up in the 90s and 00s which meant their progenitors were really Sony and Apple. They were brought up more or less entirely on what I refer to as &quot;electronics&quot;. What this means is that the transmission of humanism or humanistic tradition as I would think of it, is in danger of being lost. Without sentimentalising the past I'd like to say that the books my grandfather read he handed onto my father, and it was in my father's library that I educated myself. And that it would be a tragedy if this form of cultural transmission, that this history of values, was eroded by children who are receiving their education from the electronic media, rather than from other educated adults. I grew up in the 60s, at a time when authority was under attack, but it would seem to me now to be a tragedy for us to regard all authority as perverse or fascistic. It would be a further tragedy if our children saw themselves only as consumers. It is fascinating that some young people are choosing to go to Syria and join Isis. You'd have to say that this was misplaced idealism. It would be terrible to think, that on the other side, our children were merely consumers and had given up on idealism and politics altogether. Although we are condemned to five more years of Tory rule it doesn't follow that we should be disillusioned or give up on thinking about alternatives to this form of aggressive, elitist, and ultimately empty hyper-capitalism which will devastate the post-war values, particularly of the welfare state, that I, in my sentimental way, still hold dear.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-5587f244e4b0629b0a62a9e4","title":"\"Writing today, particularly writing in English, is in a surprisingly healthy state\"","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:32:55Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:36:22Z","body":"<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11797439\">HuNaught</a> asks:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>What is the state of literature today?

I wouldn't say that I write about sex particularly as an act - I think of myself writing about sex as a form of passion. So if you look at the film The Mother, or My Beautiful Laundrette or even Le Week-end, you would say these are stories about people's involvement with one another, their passion for one another., And what happens when that passion ignites, in the case of The Mother and Venus, or what happens when it dies, in the case of Le Week-end. I would never dissociate sexuality from the person or the character I was writing about. There is no sex without meaning.</p> \n    <p>I would write about not a particular act or position, but I would write about what a particular form of desire would mean to somebody and how it might change their life. After all, Anna Karenina doesn't just have sex - she does something that is deeply transgressive, and the whole of that novel revolves around the meaning of what she does.</p> \n    <p>People can write badly about anything!

We writers are 50% artist and 50% in commerce. We try and make a living from what we do. One of the things I'm most proud of having achieved is of making a living as a writer since I was in my mid-20s. Looking back it seems more and more amazing to me that someone from my background is able to make a living as a professional writer. I can now see how difficult and how increasingly difficult that is. I would also like my kids to see what it is to have a vocation, what it is to have work that you love to do. And that would be at least one lesson I would like to pass onto the kids. When I get up in the morning after my coffee the first thing I want to do is write - I still have that passion.

Because when you write a story, a novel, or a movie, you really inhabit the characters and they really inhabit you. For a long time they're a part of your life. They are bits of you, and they seem to have some sort of independent existence. So when you're done with them you do worry about what happens to them. I often wish that I'd started a franchise like JK Rowling, by which I mean a form in which you could keep the same characters going forever. I would be a richer man than I am now. So although I still wonder what might have happened to Karim Amir, or Charlie Hero, or DeeDee Osgood, what excites me are the new characters that I'm making, that still appear to me as I sit at my desk and starting talking in my ear. So when I finish something I feel a terrible vacancy, and I wait for myself to be inhabited by these new ghosts who soon, if I'm lucky, start speaking to me and to one another. I can't say I know how this kind of magic happens; I guess you have to turn up your hearing aid, and if you're lucky, you'll pick up something. Perhaps for a writer it becomes a kind of habit and you don't even have to look for stories any more; they find you.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</figure>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-5587ef1be4b0629b0a62a9d3","title":"\"We have probably reached the end of so-called identity politics\"","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:19:05Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:31:31Z","body":"<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2735278\">sarahsmith232</a> asked:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>To what extent do you think that the non-white sections of this society are guilty of defining themselves against “the white” other?

What I'm interested in now is a broader, socialistic alliance. So whether you are a lesbian, person of colour, or identify with any minority, I would like to see us forming a new politics that is concerned with what I would call public values. Thatcher destroyed public values; indeed, didn't appear to believe in them. So now, a generation later, we are left without public housing, decent pensions, effective trade unions, or a political party that can represent anything except the elite. So after the collapse of Marxist communism, and the instatement of neo-liberalism from Thatcher through her disciple Blair and onto Cameron, we are it seems to me now living more or less in a one-party state. We lack an effective and ideological opposition. The collapse of the left at the last election presents a great opportunity for us to think about possibilities of reframing politics and creating alternatives to the neo-liberal horror that awaits us.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</figure>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-5587f244e4b0629b0a62a9e4","title":"\"Writing today, particularly writing in English, is in a surprisingly healthy state\"","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:32:55Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-22T11:36:22Z","body":"<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11797439\">HuNaught</a> asks:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>What is the state of literature today?

His obsession lead him to attempt the Spartathlon, the dreaded 152 mile continuous race from Athens to Sparta.

At that time, any moderately well connected person with a working understanding of the book trade – a mid-ranking metropolitan journalist, or a junior editor in a publishing house, for instance – could say, “I’m taking a few months’ leave and going to Central America; I don’t speak Spanish, and to be honest, I’ve never been much of a traveller, but could I have an advance please?” Chances are, the answer would be in the affirmative.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"420502e2c896a2744ecee0a230a5fc7b5190f521\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434982838727/2c0b143d-4586-46d7-830c-049623674e1b-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Kundera\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I’ve been really looking forward to this novel’ – <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/TaymazValley\">TaymazValley</a>, reading <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jun/14/festival-of-insignificance-review-milan-kundera-lacks-vim\">the latest Kundera</a>.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>The books they produced – usually subtitled “Travels in XXX”, “A Journey in Search of YYY”, or “In the Footsteps of ZZZ” – weren’t actually <em>bad</em>, as such. They understood the genre, its required clich&eacute;s and formulas. Generally, thanks to their background, they could write perfectly proficiently, if rarely with much proper sparkle. But they hardly added anything to the sum of literary achievements; their books fuelled the bloating of travel literature, and that bloating almost certainly contributed to the fact that, around the turn of the millennium, its tide began to retreat, leaving only a flotsam and jetsam of comedy quests and TV tie-ins, a few legacy attractions (Paul Theroux and Colin Thubron) permitted to ply the scenic routes on summer days, and a very occasional commissioning editor’s anachronistic indulgence (“A travel book! We’ve not commissioned one of them for ages!”)</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>These days, however, that same writerly demographic – well connected, understanding the industry, wanting to “write a book” but lacking either the inclination or the wherewithal to pen a novel – has a new option. What they now say is “I’m taking a few months leave, and I’m thinking of going walking in the Lake District. I’ve never been much of a one for the outdoors, and I live in North London, but I think I did a school project about ponds when I was eight, so I could probably spin something out of that. Or deer, maybe; I’ve got a few books out of the library about deer. Can I have an advance?” </p> \n <p>I wish commissioning editors wouldn’t say yes to them. They are bloating the “new nature writing” genre in exactly the same way that they bloated the old travel writing, and surely propelling it faster than needs be towards its inevitable demise. <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/53866986\">See the full comment, and the whole discussion, here.</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>Interesting links about books and reading</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://electricliterature.com/bookstores-wont-go-the-way-of-video-stores/\">Bookstores Won’t Go the Way of Video Stores</a>: Let’s hope so – for now, this piece on Electric Literature is convincing. </li> \n <li><a href=\"http://lithub.com/in-praise-of-the-book-tower/\">In Praise of the Book Tower: on clutter, collecting, and the infinite stack</a>.
