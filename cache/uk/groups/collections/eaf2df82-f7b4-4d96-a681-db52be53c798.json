And then, by your fourth or fifth year, the actual game has lost meaning for you. You’re engaged in the numbers that the game spins out and engaged with millions of others in the same way. It has no relationship not just to the fan attachment that you may have had to a particular team but to the physical thing that’s taking place on the field. It’s the representation of it in a number that’s what’s important. I’m thinking of our original group. A couple of them really don’t give a shit about baseball at all anymore. When people say, ‘How do you feel, having invented this?’ I say, ‘I feel the way that J. Robert Oppenheimer felt having invented the atomic bomb.’ I really do. I mean, pretty terrible!”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>No one was interested in Okrent’s idea when he first pitched it but, now that everyone loves it, he doesn’t care for his creation at all.

The Porto fans didn’t seem to mind the humiliation that much. A crowd of them turned up to the Francisco de S&aacute; Carneiro Airport at 3am on Thursday morning to welcome home their fallen heroes. </p> \n<p>Porto have a proud record in Europe. They won the European Cup in 1987 and 2004, and had not conceded six goals in the competition since AEK Athens beat them 6-1 back in 1978, but their crushing defeat to Bayern did not deter their fans. A loyal bunch of 300 or so supporters made their way to the airport in the middle of the night to cheer their team through the arrivals lounge.

They mixed film footage, audio recordings, text, photography and maps to capture the essences of these three neighbourhoods and display them online. The resulting website is remarkably forward-thinking, which is more than can be said for Fifa’s legacy in these cities. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ccbe0927ae94bc67c15d55f19c631130c1eadf5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/27/1430151310075/09ae6d4d-65d0-47fc-8895-5c19d7c37b67-460x276.png\" alt=\"WC\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Who are the champions?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Submarine Channel</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e752c20cc1d156a881500963be0c361c92c5e158\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/27/1430151215427/f7362e8f-7d57-45ab-a8c7-31f3bebca8a0-460x286.png\" alt=\"WC\" width=\"460\" height=\"286\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Who are the champions?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Submarine Channel</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><a href=\"http://grantland.com/the-triangle/run-the-jewels-the-best-nut-punches-of-the-nba-season/\">8) The best nut punches of the NBA season</a></h2> \n<p>Never mind all those boring player of the season awards.

I was delighted when ENMWombat recommended this last week as I’d been thinking of trying something by Ursula Le Guin but didn’t know where to start. I picked it up at the library this afternoon and was pleased to see that reassuring Virago green spine. But oh dear oh dear. I didn’t even get to the end of the first chapter.

Do you think that Highsmith was mining a vein that Simenon pioneered?</p> \n <p>I am not a fan of series detectives and have pretty much ignored Simenon, not realizing until recently that he had written a number of books that were not part of his Maigret series. Reading a description of these <em>romans dur</em>, as they seem to be called, they sounded similar to some of the Highsmith novels I’ve been enjoying recently, examining how a violent act intrudes upon and changes the lives of otherwise ordinary people, and sometimes reveals that, after all, they were not so ordinary to begin with.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13134881\">Audrey Schoeman</a> started a very useful discussion with a plea for an ebook store that would accept Paypal.
