В воздухе витает идея грандиозного размаха: создание новых рабочих мест, строительство новых домов, создание инфраструктуры и другие общегородские изменения.</p> \n<p>Тем временем Москва меняется не виданными раньше темпами. Трансформируется само устройство городского пространства. Достаточно упомянуть планы для парка “Зарядье”, процветающие творческие кластеры, строительство нового жилья и гастрономическую революцию, чтобы понять масштаб изменений в столице. В планах московских градоначальников - открытие пешеходной зоны на набережной Москвы-реки, запуск высокоскоростного речного транспорта и создание новой инфраструктуры для велосипедистов.</p> \n<p>Однако в какой степени изменилась жизнь простых москвичей? Принесла ли трансформация города пользу всем или группе избранных? Какое будущее ожидает эту новую Москву? </p> \n<p>Начиная с 8 июня, журналисты газеты “Гардиан” проведут неделю в Москве, чтобы своими глазами увидеть жизнь в российской столице. Они посетят центральные районы и окраины, поговорят с женщинами, мигрантами и заключенными, коснутся таких тем, как велосипеды, гастрономия и религия. Они сделают все возможное, чтобы как лучше узнать этот замечательный город. Однако им необходима помощь москвичей. Теперь и вы можете подсказать нашим журналистам темы для статей.</p> \n<p><strong>Нам нужны ваши истории</strong></p> \n<p>Нравится ли вам новая Москва или вам кажется, что город поменялся в худшую сторону? Как изменилась жизнь в мегаполисе за последние десять лет? Считаете ли вы, что программа изменения городской инфраструктуры успешна или обречена на провал? Как вы думаете, жить станет лучше, жить станет веселее или получится как всегда?</p> \n<p>Расскажите нам вашу историю и покажите нам вашу Москву через приложение GuardianWitness: мы принимает тексты, фотографии или короткие видеосюжеты. А если вам кажется, что какие-то аспекты жизни в городе не получают заслуженного внимания со стороны прессы, мы будем рады выслушать ваши идеи.</p> \n<p>Если вы говорите по-английски, тогда вы можете воспользоваться приложением GuardianWitness.

His third book, Lean on Pete, tells the story of a teenager who lives in a race track in the city. His latest, The Free (2014), was praised in a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/feb/07/free-willy-vlautin-review\">Guardian review</a>: </p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“It is love, in all-American, over-salted, extra-large portions, that makes The Free original and compelling. [...] Freddie and particularly Pauline waddle triumphantly out of their heaps of shopping and stacks of bills as convincing, heroic people, and provide ample shoulders over which to peek at Vlautin’s blasted vision of the US.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Not all of his works are strictly Portland, but “many of the stories centre around the Pacific Northwest and a broader theme of societal marginality in the new west,” added <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4362712\">tproland</a>. Vlautin wears a second hat as the frontman of alternative country band Richmond Fontaine, which <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/959065\">mikeollier</a> pointed out to us.

But if you’re a fan of the Fight Club author and Portland native, you can’t miss his travel guide of sorts. Dan Glaister <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2004/mar/13/fiction.chuckpalahniuk\">wrote on the Guardian</a>: </p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Fugitives And Refugees is that most quaint of things, a travel book - but it’s not quite the book his publishers hoped for. Instead, it is a series of essays, postcards and ruminations on the underbelly of his home town, Portland. Yet beneath the profanities and the glitz of his new book [...] there is a calm, spiritual Palahniuk fighting to get out. This side also struggles out in conversation, sometimes in the most unexpected of ways.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Underground tunnels, strange customs, a self-cleaning house, sex clubs, local vocabulary, anecdotes and lots of strange facts like where Palahniuk’s tonsils currently rest await you.

Fifty years ago you could stand in the middle of the Avenue (where the Blazers play basketball today) and look up Williams past the chilli parlors, past the barbecue joints, the beauty salons, all the way to Broadway, and see hundreds of people dressed up as if they were going to a fashion show.

This Portland story might be well-known for the filmmaker’s <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089537/\">adaptation</a> (another famous Portlander, incidentally), which pretty much kickstarted the director’s career, but Curtis’s autobiographical novel is as gripping a depiction of the city in the 70s. In it, Curtis, considered the city’s street poet and often associated to the Beat authors, explained his relationships with Latino teenagers in the city’s Little Mexico neighbourhood. <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4182856\">alonk</a> said:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Mala Noche, also one of Van Sant’s first films, captures well 1970s Portland, before Skid Row residents were evicted and the area was turned into “The Pearl” and homeless shelters and cheap hotels became stores selling expensive junk.

Whether you’re doing art for A-level or you’re exhibiting in a degree show, we’d love to see what you’ve produced in any of the arty disciplines: sculpture, fashion, painting, illustration, graphics, textiles, animation, model-making, printing and any others we’ve not thought of. Like photography. And film.</p> \n<p>Submit your work through GuardianWitness - it’s really straightforward. You can share your art by clicking on the blue ‘Contribute’ button on this article. You can also use the <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/apps\">GuardianWitness smartphone app</a> or the <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/global/ng-interactive/2014/may/29/-sp-the-guardian-app-for-ios-and-android\">Guardian app</a> and search for ‘GuardianWitness assignments’ – and if you add it to the homepage – you can keep up with all our assignments. If you’re on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram you can share your art using #guardianstudents.<br /></p> \n<p>Alongside your entry, let us know your name, degree subject and university. <strong>Please submit no more than two pieces of artwork each.</strong><br /></p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/\">GuardianWitness</a> is the home of readers’ content on the Guardian.
