From pop acts to policital debates, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/live/2015/jun/26/glastonbury-2015-friday-daytime-liveblog-and-the-music-begins\">there’s plenty going on, and plenty there to enjoy the fun.</a><br /></p> \n<p>However, this also means that a lot of people are not at Glastonbury. Statistically, this weekend across Britain there will be more people not going to Glastonbury than going. Are you one of them? This is the assignment for you.</p> \n<p>It may be entirely anecdotal, but Glastonbury weekend is a wonderful time to explore the bits of Britain that are not Glastonbury. Galleries, gig venues and cafes are noticeably less busy. Beauty spots, pencil museums and pub beer gardens are even more pleasant places than usual. <br /></p> \n<p>So we want to hear from you, wherever you are (other than Glastonbury) and whatever you’re up to, be it wandering around a garden centre, enjoying a row on a boating lake, or treating the family to a trip to one of Britain’s many owl sanctuaries. You may even be watching Glastonbury on the telly. That’s also fine. </p> \n<p>Share your photos and stories of a lovely weekend with us, and we’ll publish a collection of the best on Monday, to make all those weary festival-goers green with jealousy.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a>GuardianWitness</a> is the home of readers’ content on the Guardian.

At least Erin Walters describes it as a ‘bootcamp,’ but judging by carefree expressions of everyone in the photo, no one looks like they are longing to be elsewhere. A few days later the team returned home to Long Island for the start of school. Erin was looking forward to term time, having learned she had made the Varsity (first team) as a tenth grader. \n <strike> \n  <br /> \n </strike> But then 9/11 happened: “I arrived at school on the morning of September 11 excited to be playing in my first game at that level. Needless to say, I’d have to wait a bit longer to get that game played.”</p> \n<p>Erin grew up in Garden City, a small village in the town of Hempstead on Long Island, New York. Both her parents encouraged Erin and her younger brother to play as much sport as possible , and there was also a recreational soccer programme in their town helping to drum up interest. “Sports were huge in my house growing up. Buoyed by my parents’ enthusiasm, we tried out everything our town had to offer. My Grandpa would come over and we’d always be kicking about, playing catch, shooting pucks, roller blading, or cycling.” Despite starting out with soccer, Erin’s brother Bobby ended up playing ice hockey and lacrosse at a competitive level.</p> \n<p>It was only when the USA hosted 1999 Women’s World Cup Erin really started developing an interest in soccer. “I didn’t feel any particular attachment to the game when I started out, but my dad was excited to take me to practice and my friends were there, so I went with it. But the 1999 World Cup was huge. My friends and I went to the opening games at Giants Stadium.” Mia Hamm inspired USA to a 3-0 win over Denmark in the opening game, but despite the forward being a firm fans’ favourite, Erin set her sights on another player. “I idolised USA’s captain Carla Overbeck. She wore my number 4 shirt and played in my preferred centre back position.”</p> \n<p>Having played for Garden City Middle School for two years, alongside playing for a local club team called The Rockets, Erin was geared up for her high school team debut, when tragedy struck New York. As bad as the events were that day, it could have been so much worse on a personal level. “My Dad had an office in the World Trade Centre, and was supposed to be there that day, but after I made the high school team he decided to work from home so he could easily get to the pitch to watch me play. The father of one of my teammates, who also coached me on the Rockets, worked for Cantor Fitzgerald but unbelievably he somehow missed his train that morning. Other parents were not so lucky.” No girls in Erin’s team lost parents, but many of her other school friends lost relatives. It was difficult getting in touch with family members, but Erin remembers her soccer coach being particularly supportive amid the chaos. “Our coach Mike Heedles was outstanding on the day. I remember getting off the pay phone to my Mom and seeing Heedles first thing. He was trying so hard not to cry and just gave us all hugs.”</p> \n<p>Erin enjoyed her first taste of varsity sport under the guidance of Coach Heedles and enjoyed his rather eclectic training methods. “He knew that bonding would both make us better as a team and help us through the aftermath of the tragedy [of 9/11]. We trained so hard running timed pitch laps, while the marching band was next to us practicing Metallica covers. We also had gruelling play-off trainings in sleet, hail and snow. Heedles had us running sprints up mountains, but I loved every second of it in a way I never thought I could love training.” </p> \n<p>The Garden City team beat Valley Stream to win the Nassau County Championship that year, but Erin eventually recognised her sporting talent lay elsewhere. After college in Providence, Rhode Island, she moved to England where she has lived for the past nine years, now working in Sports Development for the London School of Economics Students’ Union. “I was never the fastest soccer player, but apparently I was strong and could defend well. But it soon became obvious that my primary sport was lacrosse. I played lacrosse in college, and currently play for the Wales national team. We are busy training for the European Championships in August.”</p> \n<p>While soccer does not play a big part in Erin’s life anymore, she still follows the USA women’s national team closely, having discovered plenty of role models in the team through the years. She also still keeps in touch with her teammates from the 2001 Garden City High School team. “We bonded together as a team and the camaraderie both on and off the pitch helped us all pull through during a difficult time. To this day, even after a long and continuing sports career, that team remains one of the most supportive and best teams I’ve ever been part of.” </p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435068201936/a827b5b1-dd8e-4d05-b148-7d099897a42d-620x465.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":465,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘That’s me in the white shirt and purple socks.’ Erin Walters and the Garden City High School soccer team, September 2001 Photograph: Erin Walters/GuardianWitness","credit":"Erin Walters/GuardianWitness","altText":"‘That’s me in the white shirt and purple socks.’ Erin Walters and the Garden City High School soccer team, September 2001","cleanCaption":"‘That’s me in the white shirt and purple socks.’ Erin Walters and the Garden City High School soccer team, September 2001","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Erin Walters/GuardianWitness"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-26T12:00:07Z","lastModified":"2015-06-26T12:30:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Tom Stevens","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/tom-stevens"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Women's World Cup 2015","Women's football","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/women-s-world-cup-2015","webTitle":"Women's World Cup 2015"},{"id":"football/womensfootball","webTitle":"Women's football"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tom Stevens","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/tom-stevens"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/26/other-parents-were-not-so-lucky-a-tale-of-long-island-soccer-friendship","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3j7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/26/other-parents-were-not-so-lucky-a-tale-of-long-island-soccer-friendship","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/26/other-parents-were-not-so-lucky-a-tale-of-long-island-soccer-friendship"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":5,"kicker":{"title":"'Other parents were not so lucky'"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"replace","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a7bbea0b289c6edf8e20f98e7844340db0d555a/0_80_4099_2459/4099.jpg?w=700&amp;q=85&amp;auto=format&amp;sharp=10&amp;s=f869731c90faf32a8ae9a87f29621ce0","height":420,"width":700}}]},{"title":"Australian citizenship / What does it mean to you?","rawTitle":"What does it mean to you?","item":{"type":"article","id":"australia-news/2015/jun/26/australian-citizenship-what-does-it-mean-to-you","title":"Australian citizenship: What does it mean to you?","trailText":"We become citizens by birth or naturalisation.

As Canadian singer-songwriter Paul Anka (who, incidentally wrote for Frank Sinatra, Tom Jones and Michael Jackson) put it, it’s a country “that has a gentler, slower pace - it lends perspective”.

For two days the train, with a curved glass viewing dome, trundled across vast plains, ending up in Vancouver, where, in Stanley Park, I was amazed to spot and throw nuts to squirrels the size of cats, and all of them entirely black.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66f56c72387200c07f9f8d1cc89b9fc3a9200a31\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435248903830/b8057395-4a6e-4075-b590-984fefe7fca6-350x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Not Justin Bieber, just a beaver - a truer symbol of Canada.\" width=\"350\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not Justin Bieber, just a beaver - a truer symbol of Canada.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: blickwinkel/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><br />Think of Canadian music and you’ll probably recall songs by Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, Alanis Morissette, Arcade Fire, KD Lang or Shania Twain, or if you’re not so lucky, Celine Dion. Or if you just read the tabloids, Justin Bieber. But simply naming songs by Canadians won’t cut the mustard, or indeed the Montreal smoked meat, nor will it put out the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2014/sep/07/poutine-the-posh-chips-and-gravy-taking-over-the-world\">poutine</a>, or sweeten the selection process like maple syrup might. Major Canadian artists will only be worth mentioning if their songs are about Canada, its cities, people, or some aspect of Canadian life. But this topic does include other lesser known artists who may not mention Canada, but in some way represent the culture of the country. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuceBWqia3E\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KuceBWqia3E?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  La Bolduc, also known as Madame Bolduc - a Canadian legend\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Canada has a strong history of jazz from Oscar Peterson to Diana Krall. Much of the music draws on the country’s bilingual heritage. You might choose to draw, for example, from the rich influences of the lively Quebec scene, perhaps from satirical singer Madame Bolduc, other French inspirations from Brittany and Picardy, the rock and metal of the Stills or Godspeed You! Black Emperor, the hip-hip of Loco Locasse and more, the Inuit influence, the Celtic folk influx from Scotland and Ireland, not to mention the Aboriginal sounds and stories from the Inuit, M&eacute;tis, Iroquois, Mi’kmaq, Huron, and Haida.

Hearing is believing\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What does Canada mean to you? Like many countries it has a harsh history of invasion and colonialism. But it has always struck me as a down-to-earth and welcoming place, laid back in its rich multiculturalism, and proud to contrast, in some ways, to its brasher, flashier neighbour to the south. But while a majority of Canada’s population live in the southern areas, within reach of the borders of the US for commercial reasons, perhaps your song choices may include something that tells how it differs from America, and how this has shaped its identity. Canada, for example, has a national healthcare service, not unlike Britain’s NHS. As the writer Douglas Coupland put it: “In Canada, we’re happy to provide a safe haven for next-door neighbours in the middle of a marital dispute. And if anyone trips while crossing the border, we’re happy to set their broken bones for free.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b1accabf6d39de0c806d4171b417866c30549e4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435249595557/f810015d-01d3-484e-8198-c0ff1fc94a70-460x313.jpeg\" alt=\"Leslie Nielsen in 'Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell Of Fear' (1991).\" width=\"460\" height=\"313\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Given the slip ...

In May, many of you shared <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/553e1e73e4b006cad0a26aab\">amazing alternative UK election posters with GuardianWitness </a>and some of these are going to be shown on site. So if you’re at the festival do go and see them. To accompany the installation, Shangri-La are asking festival goers to create political slogans, posters and placards which you can either create on the Glastonbury site or share from where you are via GuardianWitness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5351a3d865213935d5ad079eb82081b4ca125128\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435162399871/05bdf36c-5a76-484f-af9e-27c3ec5a860a-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"Power to people poster Shangri-La at Glastonbury \" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This year the Shangri-La area at Glastonbury is asking people to celebrate their democratic rights</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Wojciechowski/Shangri-La</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Tell us about about your political beliefs.
