Ahead of us lie decisions that may change the nature of Britain irrevocably – and it is essential that there are journalists who are asking tough questions and challenging the status quo. </p> \n<p>With the Human Rights Act in jeopardy, <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/behind-the-headlines-human-rights-the-final-act-17426955493\">the Guardian will be there</a> exposing the myth-makers. When the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/oct/04/reality-check-cat-theresa-may\">home secretary herself repeats media distortions</a> about human rights – “The illegal immigrant who cannot be deported because, and I am not making this up, he had a pet cat” – someone needs to set the record straight: no, minister, the judge did not say the cat stopped the man’s deportation.</p> \n<p>When severe benefit cuts fall on those least able to cope, the Guardian will make sure the impact is revealed. When the public is told that Benefits Street-type scroungers take the lion’s share, the Guardian strips the factoids from the facts: only 3% of the social security bill goes to the unemployed, while half goes to pensioners. When the bedroom tax and benefit sanctions leave families without food, the Guardian shines a light on the plight of those using food banks.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If you read the Guardian, become a Member and part of our community of writers and readers</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Britain faces a monumental decision in the EU referendum. However strict the rules for the yes and no campaigns, nothing will stop the blasts from Britain’s Eurosceptic media. A wall of sound will warp the democratic process – and the Guardian’s independent voice will matter more than ever. No press baron owns us, so we are free to think, write and report without constraint.</p> \n<p>I doubt anyone agrees with everything we publish, and indeed we make a point of encouraging a rainbow of views from contributors. But in a tipped-up, one-sided media, the Guardian is here to restore balance, hold power to account, challenge the conventional view and give a voice to the voiceless.</p> \n<p>If you read the Guardian, become a Member and part of our community of writers and readers.
