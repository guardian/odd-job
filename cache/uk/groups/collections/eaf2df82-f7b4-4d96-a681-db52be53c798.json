It certainly isn’t supposed to, but it is – though there’s arguably a distinction between what the government is doing and the Syriza party. It’s also worth bearing in mind that the Yes camp have a lot of money, a lot of support from the main busines and professional associations, and perhaps most importantly the backing of pretty much all the country’s commercial media including the main private TV channels.

The referendum question itself is odd – it is a vote on a proposal that the creditors say is no longer on the table. Most eurozone leaders, meanwhile, say it is actually a poll on whether Greeks want to be in the euro. So, in the event of a 51% victory for “no”, the losing “yes” side could be screaming about democratic illegitimacy if Greece was rapidly shuffled towards euro exit. One could understand their point of view. So, yes, I agree there could be severe consequences for Greek society. In the very short term, it is also easy to see how a close outcome could mean more delay in opening the banks.</p> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/54946123\"> \n <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> \n  <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> \n   <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/1334091\" title=\"View JonHenley’s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2014/07/30/1334091/edd92da3-e439-4f77-b2de-83c7d6b10cc9/60x60.png\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for JonHenley\" /> </a> \n   <span class=\"d2-badge d2-badge-staff d2-hidetext\" title=\"Guardian staff\" itemprop=\"jobTitle\">Guardian staff</span> \n  </div> \n  <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> \n   <div itemscope=\"\" itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> \n    <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/user/id/1334091\" title=\"View JonHenley’s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">JonHenley</span> </a> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> \n    <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/54946123\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">03 July 2015 1:07pm</a> \n   </div> \n   <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"> \n    <p>It may well do.

But: the eurogroup’s stance is that, equally, there is no obligation on the credtors to offer a third bailout programme if Greece is unwilling to accept the final terms of the second bailout. Without a third bailout programme, there is the clear possibility that the European Central Bank could cut off liquidity to the Greek banks declearing them to be insolvent. Them’s the rules, the ECB could argue, and rules must be followed.<br />In practice, things might work differently. I suspect there would be an attempt to restart negotiations after a “no” vote, especially if the IMF is urging that course.

It really believed that a debt haircut has only recently become necessary. That's what yesterday's communique says. &quot;At the time of the last review in May 2014, public debt dynamics were considered to be sustainable but highly vulnerable.&quot;<br />3.
