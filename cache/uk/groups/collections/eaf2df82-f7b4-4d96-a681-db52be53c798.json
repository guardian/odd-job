This week pick out music that goes beyond the big stars to capture the spirit, culture, and landscape of this vast, bilingual country<br /></p>","byline":"Peter Kimpton","body":"<p>O Canada! Land of the beaver, the goose, bear and moose, the maple, caribou, mountie and loon. Such a landscape of vast space – the second biggest of any nation in the world, behind Russia, but larger than China and the US, and with the world’s biggest volume of fresh water in a whopping, lapping 31,700 lakes. As Canadian singer-songwriter Paul Anka (who, incidentally wrote for Frank Sinatra, Tom Jones and Michael Jackson) put it, it’s a country “that has a gentler, slower pace - it lends perspective”. This, and all those lakes, is something to musically reflect on in time for this coming <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Canada_Day\">Canada Day</a> on 1 July.<br /></p> \n<p>I visited the land of the maple leaf when I was 12 to see an auntie, uncle and cousins. I was gobsmacked at the scale of things – we took a very slow train from Edmonton in Alberta, going west, and visited Banff National Park, spotted a moose, crossed part of the Athabaska glacier on a snowcat then drank, trickling from its gentle melt, some of the purest water in the world. For two days the train, with a curved glass viewing dome, trundled across vast plains, ending up in Vancouver, where, in Stanley Park, I was amazed to spot and throw nuts to squirrels the size of cats, and all of them entirely black.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66f56c72387200c07f9f8d1cc89b9fc3a9200a31\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435248903830/b8057395-4a6e-4075-b590-984fefe7fca6-350x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Not Justin Bieber, just a beaver - a truer symbol of Canada.\" width=\"350\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not Justin Bieber, just a beaver - a truer symbol of Canada.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: blickwinkel/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><br />Think of Canadian music and you’ll probably recall songs by Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, Alanis Morissette, Arcade Fire, KD Lang or Shania Twain, or if you’re not so lucky, Celine Dion. Or if you just read the tabloids, Justin Bieber. But simply naming songs by Canadians won’t cut the mustard, or indeed the Montreal smoked meat, nor will it put out the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2014/sep/07/poutine-the-posh-chips-and-gravy-taking-over-the-world\">poutine</a>, or sweeten the selection process like maple syrup might. Major Canadian artists will only be worth mentioning if their songs are about Canada, its cities, people, or some aspect of Canadian life. But this topic does include other lesser known artists who may not mention Canada, but in some way represent the culture of the country. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuceBWqia3E\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KuceBWqia3E?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  La Bolduc, also known as Madame Bolduc - a Canadian legend\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Canada has a strong history of jazz from Oscar Peterson to Diana Krall. Much of the music draws on the country’s bilingual heritage. You might choose to draw, for example, from the rich influences of the lively Quebec scene, perhaps from satirical singer Madame Bolduc, other French inspirations from Brittany and Picardy, the rock and metal of the Stills or Godspeed You! Black Emperor, the hip-hip of Loco Locasse and more, the Inuit influence, the Celtic folk influx from Scotland and Ireland, not to mention the Aboriginal sounds and stories from the Inuit, M&eacute;tis, Iroquois, Mi’kmaq, Huron, and Haida. Now have a taste of some pretty astonishing Inuit throat singing.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXKBx67GzVo\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXKBx67GzVo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Inuit throat singing. Hearing is believing\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What does Canada mean to you? Like many countries it has a harsh history of invasion and colonialism. But it has always struck me as a down-to-earth and welcoming place, laid back in its rich multiculturalism, and proud to contrast, in some ways, to its brasher, flashier neighbour to the south. But while a majority of Canada’s population live in the southern areas, within reach of the borders of the US for commercial reasons, perhaps your song choices may include something that tells how it differs from America, and how this has shaped its identity. Canada, for example, has a national healthcare service, not unlike Britain’s NHS. As the writer Douglas Coupland put it: “In Canada, we’re happy to provide a safe haven for next-door neighbours in the middle of a marital dispute. And if anyone trips while crossing the border, we’re happy to set their broken bones for free.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b1accabf6d39de0c806d4171b417866c30549e4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435249595557/f810015d-01d3-484e-8198-c0ff1fc94a70-460x313.jpeg\" alt=\"Leslie Nielsen in 'Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell Of Fear' (1991).\" width=\"460\" height=\"313\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Given the slip ...
