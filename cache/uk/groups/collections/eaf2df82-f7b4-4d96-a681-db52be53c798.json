From a whisper to a scream, suggest music that grows in unusual or powerful ways</p>","byline":"Peter Kimpton","body":"<p>What a song.* It begins with nothing more than a hint of stillness, a tiny flick of wind through grass, a gnat’s heartbeat, a cricket’s wink, a cat hair’s whisper in the imagination. Then, emerging from beyond the frequency at which human biology can detect sound, an indeterminate buzzing, perhaps of an insect, a rhythmic crunching, and a rustling like the uncurling of forest foliage. Next, the low thrum of a distant double bass, a rumble of timpany, a bass drum thud, then a snare, repeating and rising like the approach of a far-off army. Is that an oboe or a clarinet through the trees? Joining out of nowhere, the sounds are reminiscent of industry, the pushing of pistons, the hiss of steam, the banging of hammers. These instruments quickly and indiscernibly align into the rhythm of a human heartbeat.<br /></p> \n<p>Suddenly, cracking like jagged sunlight across the sky, a guitar riff breaks out, and throws strange shadows. It does it again. Then cutting across, a piano plays a rhythmic counterpoint. The sounds intertwine. A string section joins. The energy rises, the pace quickens, and building, all the instruments quickly take a second’s breath, until a voice, at first soft but distinct in the verse, lets out a low howl, rising to a scream as it drives into the big corner of the chorus, joined by more voices and doubled guitars. The pattern repeats itself, each cycle building in intensity, the lyrics alternating between absolutely heart-wrenching and utterly joyous. Vocal phrases are echoed first with organ, then brass, then bells, until all hell breaks loose in a middle-eight section with the sound of a chainsaw. Somehow it cuts back to the verse, then into a chaotic final chorus where emotions are unleashed into a hurricane of the unspeakable, all instruments straining in anarchic energy at the edge of each register, out of which we hear, to an uproar and climax, a herd of elephants – trumpeting, thudding, tramping, triumphant.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17a8856a372740954cd73c5551fa17fb456f5dd4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432758494975/1cb6c9fb-cda9-4230-8b12-1172759647a2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Beat building … James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem at London’s Brixton Academy in 2005.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beat building … James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem at London’s Brixton Academy in 2005.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Building is a process that happens in most songs, but this week we’re looking for the ones that do it in the most effective, interesting ways. Your approach may be less about the technicalities of song structure, perhaps even more all about how the song makes you feel and how it carries you. And song building doesn’t only have to be about increasing volume. It can come from more subtle multiple layers of sound and instruments. A song’s sense of crescendo, of whatever type, can, for example, build with suspense through the story it tells in lyrics or the delivery of the vocalist. The effect might be explicitly or otherwise sexual, or simply offer a physical release, and create moments of so-called “eargasm”. It can build slowly or fast, it can increase and develop to high level of joy, or anger, or other emotions, and the intensity doesn’t have to come at the very end, but at another point. Yet often the best building up songs move from a whisper to a scream, and finish with a climax that leaves your feelings and ears resonating.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc095e9eab42099dd9f0cedb83db1f0e1baee831\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/28/1432831482329/59eee6dc-a698-413d-a870-5ecf59e9930b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Arcade Fire.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Once they get started … the unstoppable Arcade Fire.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Mosenfelder/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Songs or pieces of music that build can originate from many genres, from classical to dance, but don’t have to be lengthy to build successfully. Three minutes can be enough. They can spark emotions with careful pace of rhythm, structure and delivery. The standard intro-verse-chorus-middle-eight-verse-chorus or similar structure could seen be a hindrance to momentum, but there are songs that still use this sort of shape but build and increase intensity within it. Dance music often simplifies structure and builds from a constant beat and baseline, but there are many interesting crossbreeds that bring momentum in various forms, from New York’s indie-dance hybrid LCD Soundsystem to Sacramento’s guitar-based !!! (also known as Chk Chk Chk), and Montreal’s Arcade Fire.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"412e4f0a3d48eee9e2c2faa55054d7ce6bd25c90\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/28/1432812134255/105d0115-e408-47d9-9ff1-9cd0b2516cdb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Master builder … Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840-1893)\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Master builder … Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840-1893)</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The classical genre, with length at its disposal, may also bring many prominent examples, from the great composers – so Tchaikovsky, Beethoven or Wagner may be on some lists – to lesser known modern figures. Finland’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7NFuw8ORk4\">Einojuhani Rautavaara</a> is an unusual composer who uses sounds from nature and builds with a mystical quality and unusual stringed arrangements. Artists from Iceland, such as Sigur Ros, also build songs with their own otherworldly quality, and are equally inspired by the powerful forces of their landscape. </p> \n<p>Folk, country and different forms of world music may also come frequently into the build-up category, with an emphasis on storytelling. Even if the language is not understood by western listeners, there is now shortage of infectious buildup momentum in African artists such as Tinariwen from the Saharan Desert of northern Mali. Combining folk and the passion of soul and Motown, of which there may well be many contenders, Van Morrison is also an artist who can build, and uses unusual structures, evoking many mood changes, from the peaceful shores of Donegal to the fierce passion of his city of Belfast or Detroit.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7277a6522af63e25ec3e5e00b5b994f7d8a5204d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432758624780/c8747937-7a54-4424-9816-16c956bcb2a3-460x293.jpeg\" alt=\"Stormy buildup … Jonsi Birgisson of Iceland's Sigur Ros.\" width=\"460\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stormy buildup … Jonsi Birgisson of Iceland’s Sigur Ros.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Sheppard/Redferns via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Rock has no shortage of bulding ability either. So Smashing Pumpkins and Godspeed You! Black Emperor may be among your thoughts of many. Funk and soul is also an ideal genre for building up energy, and of course James Brown and in a different way, George Clinton, were also pioneers of the build, while Otis Redding was an outstanding star of emotional climax. But who whether these or others, has done it best, and in what songs?<strong><br /></strong><br />Time then to briefly look at some other forms of building to help inspire your choices. These may express the feeling that your song inspires. Malcolm Gladwell’s book of philosophy, science and society, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2000/apr/22/extract\">The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</a>, reached its own huge sales momentum with a fascinating read on how small things can start trends of accelerating energy. So let’s look at a quirky, musical example in the form of how one eccentric, lone dancer at the Sasquatch festival, Washington, in 2009 helped build up a surprising about of momentum. Better watched, in my opinion, with the sound and commentary turned down ...</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO8MwBZl-Vc\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hO8MwBZl-Vc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  It only takes one … crazy Saquatch festival dancer. Watch what happens next. Far more enjoyable with the sound turned down... \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><br />Nuclear fusion is perhaps the ultimate form of energy building up, a chain reaction speading rapidly into explosion. How then to illustrate, in a basic way, what happens? Ping pong balls and mouse traps, of course. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjqIJW_Qr3c\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vjqIJW_Qr3c?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Chain reaction of fission seen in the form of ping pong balls on mousetraps\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><br />Does your song suggestion do this in your mind? Finally, buildup doesn’t have to be explosive, but delicately determined and unstoppable. In 1987 two Swiss artists, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Fischli_and_David_Weiss\">Peter Fischli and David Weiss</a> with an extraordinary talent for using old bits of scrap, as well as a great grasp of physics and chemistry, created an installation film, Der Lauf Der Dingen (The Way Things Go). There have been other versions since, not to mention controversy over an alleged copycat Honda car ad, but here’s the original, speeded up four times. Does it remind you of that feeling of playing the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_Trap_%28game%29\">Mousetrap game</a> or watching dominoes fall? <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XniQwRFLTqc\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XniQwRFLTqc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Der Lauf Der Dingen, by Fischli and Weiss\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This week’s brillant baron of buildup and master of momentum, not to mention the great keeper of all built-up records in Readers Recommend history, is the magnificant <a href=\"https://id.theguardian.com/profile/marconius/public\">Marconius</a>.

A mere 7% had discussed what sort of care they might want if they are unable to make their own decisions, while only 18% said they had spoken to a family member about the way they might want to end their life.</p> \n<p>Such a general lack of planning was also the case among those with dependants: of people with children under 18 living with them, little more than a quarter had made instructions as to who would look after them should the parent die, or planned for inheritance issues. Only 40% had taken out life insurance.<br /></p> \n<p>Prof Mayur Lakhani, a GP in Leicestershire who chairs the Dying Matters Coalition, said: “There are encouraging signs that talking about dying is becoming less of a taboo than previously, but too many people are continuing to avoid facing up to their own mortality and are not putting plans in place.</p> \n<p>“The public and health professionals alike need to become more comfortable talking about dying and discussing options for end of life care. We know that many people have strong views about their end of life wishes, but unless they talk about them and plan ahead they are unlikely to be met.”<br /></p> \n<p>A parallel strand of the survey, undertaken for Dying Matters Awareness Week, the sixth of its kind, which seeks to encourage debate on the subject, found a general consensus that quality of life is more important than length, with just 8% of people saying they would like to live to over 100.</p> \n<p>When asked about what constituted a good death, a third of people cited a lack of pain, while 17% named being with family and friends. Three-quarters said end-of-life care should be a fundamental part of the NHS.</p> \n<p>The Dying Matters Coalition, which is led by the National Council for Palliative Care, has more than 30,000 members, also including care homes, hospices, GPs, funeral directors and financial organisations.</p> \n<p>Claire Henry, the organisation’s chief executive, said: “Talking about dying and planning ahead may not be easy, but it can help us to make the most of life and spare our loved ones from making difficult decisions on our behalf or dealing with the fallout if we haven’t got our affairs in order.”</p> \n<p><strong>What are your feelings about discussing dying and bereavement?

The baby was three months early’</h2> \n<p><strong>Toyin Ojora-Saraki, Nigeria</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"880952f72b6fbda5d57212b402d09dce000d48d7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431885506141/6b09022f-eec4-42d4-b531-44166725e19e-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Toyin Saraki\" width=\"204\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toyin Saraki, who gave birth on her wedding day in Nigeria.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toyin Saraki</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I gave birth to twins – on my wedding day – in an urban maternity hospital in my home country of Nigeria. The birth was three months premature, and midwives and doctors were present, but there was a fatal delay in finding an anaesthetist to enable an emergency caesarean section by general anaesthetic since an epidural was neither offered nor available. <br /></p> \n<p>I had been preparing for the birth in the UK, receiving prenatal care in London from consultants. As it was a multiple birth, prenatal consultants provided consistent care in the months leading up to my due date. However, I had to prepare for my wedding in Nigeria and had to travel to the country before my due date. I was assured that it should be fine to return home, get married, and make it back to London in time to give birth. </p> \n<p>Yet on my wedding day, and within only 24 hours, I got married, gave birth three months prematurely, and lost one of my twin babies in childbirth. We were fortunate, however, that as soon as the emergency arose, I immediately received two of an indicated three steroid injections to help my babies’ lungs mature faster. </p> \n<p>I came close to death myself, having become severely anaemic. I had to fight to save my life and the life of the surviving twin. In getting through this harrowing process, my child and I are very lucky to be here today. The care following the birth was diligent, but uncomfortable and difficult due to a lack of modern resources. </p> \n<p>Three days after giving birth in the hospital, I suffered from painful engorgement and had to express my breast milk. The nurses treating me handed me a white plastic bucket, without explaining what I should do. They began pressing my breasts to pump milk into the bucket, leading to a lot of crying and pain on my part.</p> \n<p>Knowing that an experience like mine is all-too-common for mothers and infants around the world is heartbreaking, but it could have been worse, because, in fact, 14% of Nigerian women give birth without anyone present. Some of these women – if they survive – suffer permanent birth injuries. Stillbirths often go unrecorded, let alone lead to counselling. This is why I started the <a href=\"http://wellbeingfoundationnig.org/\">Wellbeing Foundation Africa</a>, which works to improve maternal, newborn, and child health across the continent.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/may/27/millennium-development-goals-child-mortality-maternal-health-explainer\">What are the millennium development goals on child mortality and maternal health all about?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>‘Healthcare is underfunded in Poland, but I got the care I needed’</h2> \n<p><strong>Claudia, Poland</strong></p> \n<p>I decided to share my story because I was very satisfied with the care I received in a public hospital in eastern Europe and I thought this might go against the usual complaints we hear about public healthcare in this part of the world. </p> \n<p>At 35 weeks of pregnancy, I was diagnosed with pregnancy cholestasis [a liver condition], which meant I had to stay in hospital until 37 weeks, when a baby is considered full term, and have an induced labour. I received excellent care for the almost three weeks while I was in hospital, from a team of midwives in Warsaw. I even got to choose a vegan diet.</p> \n<p> At this hospital, women in labour are taken to newly renovated rooms, where conditions are very good: there is a bath, a private toilet, birthing balls and mattresses and many other items to use for finding comfort during labour. I gave birth with the midwife on call, who was extremely patient and discreet. </p> \n<p>I’m just happy to say that we got this very warm, thoughtful care at a public hospital despite health systems in Poland and the rest of eastern European countries being systematically underfunded. While I was in the hospital, I read a notice on the wall which said that state support for this hospital covers about two-thirds of the cost of a birth and that they do need support from donations and philanthropists, but it seems that they do manage in the end to find the funds they need. Or they manage somehow to compensate with love and care. </p> \n<h2><strong>‘My mother didn’t see a doctor for her entire pregnancy’</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Name withheld, Malawi </strong></p> \n<p>This is not my birthing story but my mother’s. She had my brother at age 16 and me at 18 in Malawi. My mum never talked about her pregnancy or childbirth experiences, and it was only recently, on a return home to see her, that I found out she had given birth at home with both of us. She was with her mother-in-law and older sister both times, and she was in labour for two days with my brother. Living in the UK, my idea of homebirths is very different from my mother’s experience. She didn’t see a doctor or health professional for her entire pregnancy or labour. There was a health clinic about an hour’s drive away on public transport, but she says she never considered it an option. Her friends had all given birth at home with traditional birth attendants, and her mother-in-law had said that going to the clinic went against the family tradition of women delivering in their villages.</p> \n<p>Things were tense with her first labour, but luckily my brother didn’t require vital care when he finally arrived. Mum says she felt that God had watched over her during that labour. She says that now women in Malawi don’t have to go through the same thing, and it is the norm to go to a clinic for at least one visit, even if you are delivering in your village. All of my friends still in Malawi have received all the basic care that I would receive here in the UK, but they’re mostly in the city. My hope is that every woman gets the choice to get the care they need.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/may/28/maternal-health-african-mothers-dying-preventable-diseases-mdg5\">Empty promises mean African mothers are dying of preventable diseases | Dr Joachim Osur</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><br /></h2> \n<h2>‘The public health system is very good in Germany’</h2> \n<p><strong>Anna, Germany</strong></p> \n<p>I had monthly pre-natal check-ups up to two months before delivery, then bi-monthly check-ups until delivery, done by my gynaecologist-obstetrician. There was a week-long prenatal class to prepare for the delivery, paid for by public insurance. We hired a housekeeper as I was too large to do the usual share of domestic work. Also, privately I got weekly massages, weekly lymphatic drainages, weekly private antenatal lessons, bi-weekly pre-natal yoga classes, weekly osteopathy and acupuncture sessions, weekly prenatal pilates and aqua fitness classes. I also saw a personal trainer every week. </p> \n<p>After the delivery and two nights in hospital, we were discharged to go home. A midwife visited every day for 10 days after we arrived home. We had also hired a maternity nanny to look after the baby. A paediatrician close to our house checked the baby after two weeks. For my personal antenatal care, my insurance paid for one weekly class. Privately, I attended four others. The public health system is very good in Germany, although we live a comfortable life in an affluent part of Germany’s wealthiest city. Instead of buying a new car or expensive furniture, we paid for excellent care.</p> \n<h2><strong>‘My sister-in-law gave birth in an overcrowded refugee camp’</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Samantha, Kenya and Canada</strong></p> \n<p>My husband spent 10 years in Daadab refugee camp in Kenya, and his sister gave birth there. She was one of the lucky ones who received care at a clinic, and that saved her life because she had to have an emergency caesarean. Most of her friends gave birth in their homes in the camp, sometimes for cultural reasons and sometimes because they simply didn’t have a choice. The camp is so crowded, and is growing with around 1,000 births each month, apparently. I’m so grateful that my nephew survived and is now a healthy little boy in Tanzania, where they were able to emigrate.</p> \n<p>In comparison, I gave birth in Canada with a midwife present throughout the birth. I had weekly check-ups and had visiting home-care for the weeks after. I always felt safe and cared for, and knew that if any complications arose there would be help at hand. How is it fair that my son had a much greater chance of survival at birth than his cousin?</p> \n<h2>‘I could have saved my first child if I had had the chance to learn about maternal and child health’ </h2> \n<p><strong>Daw Nwe Nwe (sent via World Vision), Burma</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1338b87dc930b04c22caa260aa992ad41996183e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431891202795/83d98edf-6c08-4f4a-bdf0-a26a1476106d-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Daw Nwe Nwe\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daw Nwe Nwe with her family.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: World Vision</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I had never heard about antenatal and postnatal care for mothers when I was expecting my first three children. I did not understand the importance of immunisations and nutrition. When World Vision started working in our community, I got to learn about the importance of maternal and child healthcare.</p> \n<p>I think I could have saved my first child if I had the chance to learn about maternal and child healthcare earlier. Now, I always attend maternal, child health and nutrition awareness sessions. I also received iron tablets.</p> \n<p>I realised that I was not eating properly while I was expecting my first three children. But while I was expecting my fourth child, I ate nutritious foods and followed what I had learned, so there were no problems during delivery. I only breastfed my daughter until she was six months old. She is healthier than my other children. Now, I promptly go to the clinic when my children are sick. I am afraid I might lose them like my first child.</p> \n<h2>‘I lost two brothers at a young age due to no access to basic medical facilities’</h2> \n<p><strong>Darjat, Pakistan</strong></p> \n<p>I was born in a mountain village 750km away from Islamabad, Pakistan. My grandmother was there but no health worker was present. During the time of my birth in 1959, [we] only [had] the indigenous knowledge of elder women, but during my kids’ time, they were provided with all the preventative vaccines and check-ups before and after birth in the small village, and later in the town and city. My wife also had access to basic check-ups before and after deliveries. I wish we had had basic medical facilities in the village where I was born. I lost two brothers at a young age due to no access to basic medical facilities.</p> \n<h2>‘My baby had to be resuscitated but I had full trust in the medical team’</h2> \n<p><strong>Lotte, Australia</strong></p> \n<p>We had public healthcare and it was fabulous. Prenatal care was uneventful and I felt informed. When I was admitted for labour, a midwife was with us the entire time, even when there wasn’t much happening. She was there unobtrusively in the background doing paperwork if we didn’t need her, and was right there to assure, advise, and answer questions when we did. As labour progressed, things got complicated – the baby’s heart rate dropped and he had to be brought [out] quickly with forceps, then resuscitated – but the wonderful care we had received up until that point meant that I had full trust in the medical team. I am so happy with the birth, even though it was complicated. </p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>How would you describe the provision of maternal healthcare in your country?
