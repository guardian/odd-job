His third book, Lean on Pete, tells the story of a teenager who lives in a race track in the city. His latest, The Free (2014), was praised in a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/feb/07/free-willy-vlautin-review\">Guardian review</a>: </p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“It is love, in all-American, over-salted, extra-large portions, that makes The Free original and compelling. [...] Freddie and particularly Pauline waddle triumphantly out of their heaps of shopping and stacks of bills as convincing, heroic people, and provide ample shoulders over which to peek at Vlautin’s blasted vision of the US.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Not all of his works are strictly Portland, but “many of the stories centre around the Pacific Northwest and a broader theme of societal marginality in the new west,” added <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4362712\">tproland</a>. Vlautin wears a second hat as the frontman of alternative country band Richmond Fontaine, which <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/959065\">mikeollier</a> pointed out to us. Many of his lyrics also touch on the city and region.

But if you’re a fan of the Fight Club author and Portland native, you can’t miss his travel guide of sorts. Dan Glaister <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2004/mar/13/fiction.chuckpalahniuk\">wrote on the Guardian</a>: </p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Fugitives And Refugees is that most quaint of things, a travel book - but it’s not quite the book his publishers hoped for. Instead, it is a series of essays, postcards and ruminations on the underbelly of his home town, Portland. Yet beneath the profanities and the glitz of his new book [...] there is a calm, spiritual Palahniuk fighting to get out. This side also struggles out in conversation, sometimes in the most unexpected of ways.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Underground tunnels, strange customs, a self-cleaning house, sex clubs, local vocabulary, anecdotes and lots of strange facts like where Palahniuk’s tonsils currently rest await you.

Fifty years ago you could stand in the middle of the Avenue (where the Blazers play basketball today) and look up Williams past the chilli parlors, past the barbecue joints, the beauty salons, all the way to Broadway, and see hundreds of people dressed up as if they were going to a fashion show.

This Portland story might be well-known for the filmmaker’s <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089537/\">adaptation</a> (another famous Portlander, incidentally), which pretty much kickstarted the director’s career, but Curtis’s autobiographical novel is as gripping a depiction of the city in the 70s. In it, Curtis, considered the city’s street poet and often associated to the Beat authors, explained his relationships with Latino teenagers in the city’s Little Mexico neighbourhood. <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4182856\">alonk</a> said:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Mala Noche, also one of Van Sant’s first films, captures well 1970s Portland, before Skid Row residents were evicted and the area was turned into “The Pearl” and homeless shelters and cheap hotels became stores selling expensive junk.

[...] I received two South African novels, both first published in 1993 and being re-released by Archipelago this year.</p> \n <p><a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Folly.html?id=6uKZAwAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\">The Folly</a>, by Ivan Vladislavic, was wonderful. It’s a political allegory (or parable? Or something in between?) that must have been amazing to read in the context of emerging democratic South Africa in 1993 but has lost none of its power over the years. The second SA novel, <a href=\"https://archipelagobooks.org/book/this-life/\">This Life</a> by Karel Schoeman, didn’t excite me nearly as much. It’s a poetic history of an Afrikaaner family living on the frontier of the Cape in the last half of the 19th century, but it didn’t explore a lot of the issues that I would want a book like that to explore. By that really I mean the power dynamic and racism that was making the accumulation of wealth possible for the Afrikaaner families. It was beautifully written, but can you imagine a contemporary novel about a plantation that just took slavery for granted and dealt only with the lives of the slave owners?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13864797\">Tanvir Uddin</a> is going through John Steinbeck’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/dec/15/robert-mcrum-100-best-novels-observer-steinbeck-grapes-wrath\">East of Eden</a>, which prompted a discussion comparing it to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/dec/15/robert-mcrum-100-best-novels-observer-steinbeck-grapes-wrath\">The Grapes of Wrath</a>. </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12254745\">Jenny Bhatt</a>:<br /></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I loved East of Eden over The Grapes of Wrath too. Partly, I think, my bias was due to having seen the movie with James Dean – even though the movie is only loosely based on the novel.</p> \n <p>I also remember reading East of Eden during a rainy weeklong caravanning holiday in Aberystwyth, Wales when we kept having to come back to the safety of our caravan every day because it would start pouring like nobody’s business outdoors. Which, of course, I didn’t mind too much as I loved getting back to my book. Do others have memories of where/when they read some of their favorite books?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Read about other great reading location memories (Treasure Island in a hospital, John Irving at a capoeira festival on the beach in Brazil and more) <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/51710562\">here</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/551136d7e4b0545750d5c87c/1479816\">Catalina Jaime Sanchez</a> is enjoying this “gem from Japan” in the Philippines:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13af504171422c1dd268da29636c20bfb446fe28\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/11/1431356967304/a240081a-2353-42b0-8b54-18fd5ed252d7-460x309.jpeg\" alt=\"TLS\" width=\"460\" height=\"309\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/12254745\">Jenny Bhatt</a> has also finished Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/collected-stories-23.html\">Collected Stories</a>:<br /></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Having read his novels before, I found some of these stories quite like them – in that, they create similar worlds. But, the collection got off a bit slow for me. The earlier stories were harder to get into and felt like they were, likely, interesting experiments for him. As I got to the last few stories, I felt like I was back in familiar and much-loved GGM-land where unexpected things happen when you least expect them. What a yarn spinner he was, truly. Reminded me of my maternal grandfather who often told us such fantastical stories (though, of course, not quite so eloquently). Overall, though, I have to say that, if I had to pick between GGM’s novels and short stories, I’d pick his novels first. I wonder how he felt about the two forms of fiction ... which one he preferred.

I replied to one of those “you lot are all sneering Islington middle class guardianista types” comments, I’m sure you know them? Anyway, I replied that I <em>was</em> sneering but that I am working class. The response to this was that I can’t be working class because of my comment history. For the record, my comment history for the past couple of months was exclusively about books and exclusively on these TLS pages.</p> \n <p>My question (I am getting there, I promise) is this: is it only in the UK that reading is seen as something which isn’t for the plebs? I wonder what our American and French (amongst others) friends make of this. I know people don’t read as much as they used to, but didn’t realise it was a class issue?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>Interesting links about books and reading</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2015/may/10/saul-bellows-comedy-death-and-desire/\">Bellow After Death</a>: “What do we make of Bellow’s presentation of the typical intellectual as a virile many-wived, or at least many-lovered, creature, a well-traveled adventurer of the mind with butter on his patent leather shoes?” Gary Shteyngart on the American writer for the New York Review of Books, which “seems to be the literary flavor of the month here in the US,” said reader <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3828881\">Swelter</a>. <br /></li> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.themillions.com/2015/04/how-will-i-live-fame-money-day-jobs-and-fiction-writing.html\">How Will I Live?
