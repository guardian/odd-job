It’s unclear what this might mean for EU migrants living in the UK - and for Brits living in Europe. Currently <a href=\"http://epthinktank.eu/2015/01/26/welfare-in-europe-access-and-safeguards-as-regards-to-social-assistance-and-benefits/\">there are 14 million EU citizens residing in another member state</a> and a British exit could require a whole new set of rules governing economic migration, visas and leave to remain. <br /></p> \n<p>Free movement – that’s the ability to live, work and study anywhere in the Union could be restricted and future <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/14/brexit-what-would-happen-if-britain-left-eu-european-union-referendum-uk\">migration into and out of the UK </a>could theroretically be regulated by British national law. In an extreme scenario, British people could end up having to apply for visas every time they travel across the Channel. And Brits already living in other EU countries such as Spain may face integration rules, such as a requirement to speak the language of the host country, before gaining long-term residency status. Access to education, healthcare and welfare could also be in doubt. <br /></p> \n<p>We’d like to hear from people who’re concerned about what a future UK exit from the EU would mean for them – both Brits living in Europe and EU migrants to the UK. Do you feel it’s important to get dual nationality now? Have your applied for a second passport? Are you making plans to acquire citizenship? We’d also like you to tell us about your situation – are you married or in a relationship with someone from another European member state? Perhaps you’re working in the UK but your family resides elsewhere.

Thankfully, Wiggins’ personality is given room to breathe in this 45-minute <strong>Desert Island Discs </strong>episode, and he is an absolute joy.</p> \n<p>The programme has a habit of throwing up personal and original interviews that would be missed by specialist journalists – try <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b042z660\">Jack Dee</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vhdmb\">Nick Clegg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00st439\">Tony Adams</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0381l2v\">Daniel Kahneman</a> for starters – and a lot of the credit for that has to go to <strong>Kirsty Young</strong>, whose lack of sporting expertise benefits her hugely when speaking to Wiggins. Most people don’t care for the particulars of cycling; they want to know where Wiggins found his talent and drive, why he has dedicated so much of his time to his craft, how his career has affected the rest of his life and why he struggled to process his monumental success. A sports journalist might have been too interested in the pursuit of details to ask the deceptively simple questions that Young delivers and Wiggins responds to so frankly.</p> \n<p>Wiggins does not baulk at any of her enquiries and he needs no invitation to explore his own weaknesses. He speaks fluently about his childhood, his complex relationship with fame, fatherhood and knighthood, and his “weirdness”. It’s a wonderful piece of radio. If you’re a fan of Wiggins, you’ll love this, and if you’re not a fan, you will be by the end of the show. It’s also a must-listen for all Chas and Dave fans.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/P4Ape\">2) If the NBA had helmets</a> </h2> \n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.jamespoliti.com/\">James Politi</a></strong> is an “unemployed graphic designer who misses the NFL and has to watch basketball with his friends”.

O’Mahony provides a wonderful, scything summary of Keane’e book in the first section of this essay. He spends 3,000 words describing Keane’s book, cutting down its author with winning sarcasm throughout. The approach works perfectly; those of us who bothered to read the book should have waited for O’Mahony’s review, which cuts out the context we knew already and distills the writing to the four things Keane does best: contradictions, put-downs, humour and anger. <br /></p> \n<p>When it comes to Moore, O’Mahony does not roll out the red carpet of forgiveness that usually buttresses the sporting heroes of yesteryear. Instead, he tells a rather sad story about a man who was more bland than most of us would like to admit. The inscription on the giant statue of Moore that stands outside Wembey reads “Immaculate footballer. Imperial defender. Immortal hero of 1966. First Englishman to raise the World Cup aloft. Favourite son of London’s East End. Finest legend of West Ham United. National Treasure. Master of Wembley. Lord of the game. Captain extraordinary. Gentleman of all time.” But, when all the patriotic bluster is stripped away, Moore was really a quiet, unconfrontational and detached man who finished his career playing in the Danish Third Division, squandered a lot of his money in failed businesses and ended up offering anodyne punditry on the radio. </p> \n<p>The game was only good to him for so long and the same may yet be said for Keane, who admitted in his book that nothing he will ever do again come close to the experiences he enjoyed as a younger man. Keane and Moore are proper football men, but their books have not inspired in O’Mahony a great deal of confidence in the sport:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Children are constantly told that playing competitive sports builds character and teaches valuable life lesions. I wonder. Many great athletes are one-trick ponies (or hedgehogs, to use Isaiah Berlin’s classification), and the character traits that made them successful in professional sport are often a handicap in retirement. Bobby Moore’s calmness and air of detachment served him well at Wembley in 1966, but during the wet Sunday afternoons of the rest of his life this reserve gave an impression of a Chauncey Gardner-like emptiness.

I was so excited during the first half of the book that Waters was doing something different with the twentieth-century woman’s domestic novel but it fell apart in the second half. —<a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11071608\">MsCarey</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Good question. Unfortunately I can never discount the possibility that I misunderstood something in the text which has caused me to miss the point come the conclusion, I read a lot of fiction in translation whilst being about as cultured as a rusty wheelbarrow with a deflated tyre. I remember reaching the end of <em>The Master and Margarita</em> and feeling that there was something missing, given the power of the characters ... Ah crap, now I want to reread it and figure out where I went wrong. —<a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2012105\">Wordnumb</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>The most difficult experience I’ve had of loving a book and then being profoundly disappointed by its ending was with Philip Roth’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2004/oct/02/fiction.philiproth\">The Plot Against America</a>. In it he imagines an alternative American history, in which Lindbergh defeats FDR by a landslide in the 1940 election and comes to an understanding with Hitler. Though Roth has often used his Newark childhood in his work, I thought he never wrote about it so movingly and lovingly. There are scenes in it which are unforgettable, such as all of Newark staying up to hear Lindbergh’s speech to the 1940 Republican convention which wins him the nomination, people emptying onto the streets afterwards in their pyjamas, as if an earthquake had erupted. —<a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10098507\">Albertine67</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>See the rest of the conversation <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/51971236\">here</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d75e8e803674c5b9c74b7e5608da8bbf5f97ac1e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431941202648/c3b2e024-82e4-4d43-b88b-6a0944eb01d2-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Moran\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/arianhod\">arianhod</a> is reading Caitlin Moran’s latest offering, the novel <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/jul/03/how-to-build-girl-caitlin-moran-review\">How to Build a Girl</a>: “Love Caitlin Moran, have read How to Be a Woman and Moranthology so pleased that this is the first of a trilogy, I can’t put it down”.

It was a gem of a find, a superbly-written, character-driven novel about the development of a family over a decade or so. What I really loved about it was its use of a simple, basic narrative form (as opposed to post-modernist preoccupations with deconstructed narratives) that was a timely reminder that a book doesn’t have to be outlandishly different or outrageously creative to be brilliant.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3946646\">axiomparadigm</a> shared:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Oh I just finished in one sit the book Child of all Nations - by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/2006/may/03/guardianobituaries.indonesia\">Pramoedya Ananta Toer</a> (one of the Buru Quartet book series). How splendid, how thrilling, how sad, how I cried, how I even slept with the book in my hands. Anyone that never read Mr. Toer’s book is losing an opportunity to educate (including myself) in a very profound way on history, economics, othering (the act of making a person into an non entity). It is the best book I have read in a long while.

Given that Crusoe describes himself as an undutiful good-for-nothing before the shipwreck, he is incredibly ingenious in coping with his situation on the island. He’s just seen the footprint in the sand, and I was interested to note that this occurs exactly half-way through the novel, in terms of page count (in my copy, anyway). Would Defoe have planned this? Is anything known about his writing process as an early novelist?

In the land of Magna Carta, in the country that celebrates John Wilkes and press freedom, two government officials came into the Guardian and oversaw the destruction of computer hard drives and memory chips. </p> \n<p>The Guardian came under pressure both in the US and in the UK to stop publication of stories based on top secret documents leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. There were threats in the UK of court injunctions and criminal prosecution. The partner of one of the then Guardian journalists Glenn Greenwald was held for nine hours at Heathrow under terrorism legislation.<br /></p> \n<p>But the enduring image is the destruction of the hard drives and memory chips in the Guardian’s basement, watched over by the two officials from the British surveillance agency GCHQ. The event is marked by the V&amp;A museum which is exhibiting the debris.<br /></p> \n<p>None of this pressure had any impact on the Guardian, which carried on reporting the Snowden documents, helping to promote a worldwide debate on the balance between surveillance and privacy. Vindication came recently when a US federal appeals court ruled mass data collection illegal.<br /></p> \n<p>I was one of the journalists involved in the story, sent to Hong Kong to check if the then unknown source was real: he was. I contacted the Guardian’s editor Alan Rusbridger at one point from Hong Kong to check if we would hand over the GCHQ documents to the authorities or publish them. Based on the Guardian’s history, I already knew the answer. The Guardian has long demonstrated it is not averse to risk and we enjoy rare freedom and independence.<br /></p> \n<p>That privilege is largely down to the loyalty of our readers.

A mere 7% had discussed what sort of care they might want if they are unable to make their own decisions, while only 18% said they had spoken to a family member about the way they might want to end their life.</p> \n<p>Such a general lack of planning was also the case among those with dependants: of people with children under 18 living with them, little more than a quarter had made instructions as to who would look after them should the parent die, or planned for inheritance issues. Only 40% had taken out life insurance.<br /></p> \n<p>Prof Mayur Lakhani, a GP in Leicestershire who chairs the Dying Matters Coalition, said: “There are encouraging signs that talking about dying is becoming less of a taboo than previously, but too many people are continuing to avoid facing up to their own mortality and are not putting plans in place.</p> \n<p>“The public and health professionals alike need to become more comfortable talking about dying and discussing options for end of life care. We know that many people have strong views about their end of life wishes, but unless they talk about them and plan ahead they are unlikely to be met.”<br /></p> \n<p>A parallel strand of the survey, undertaken for Dying Matters Awareness Week, the sixth of its kind, which seeks to encourage debate on the subject, found a general consensus that quality of life is more important than length, with just 8% of people saying they would like to live to over 100.</p> \n<p>When asked about what constituted a good death, a third of people cited a lack of pain, while 17% named being with family and friends. Three-quarters said end-of-life care should be a fundamental part of the NHS.</p> \n<p>The Dying Matters Coalition, which is led by the National Council for Palliative Care, has more than 30,000 members, also including care homes, hospices, GPs, funeral directors and financial organisations.</p> \n<p>Claire Henry, the organisation’s chief executive, said: “Talking about dying and planning ahead may not be easy, but it can help us to make the most of life and spare our loved ones from making difficult decisions on our behalf or dealing with the fallout if we haven’t got our affairs in order.”</p> \n<p><strong>What are your feelings about discussing dying and bereavement?
