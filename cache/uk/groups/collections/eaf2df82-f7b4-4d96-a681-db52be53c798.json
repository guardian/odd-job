We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy’s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma – what are your thoughts?</strong></p> \n<p>I graduated last year with a first class bachelor’s degree in engineering, but because I was keen to avoid additional stress in the final months of my degree, I started the job search effectively a year before. </p> \n<p>I applied to graduate schemes at four companies but only got to the interview stage for one. The company in question is one of the largest graduate employers in the UK and had great ratings on various review sites. I went to the assessment centre just before Christmas 2013 and was offered a job a week later. I was over the moon, accepted the job and didn’t think about applying to any more.</p> \n<p>After graduating I started at the company and, initially, I had the excitement of the new job to drive me forward. But, after a few months, I find myself bogged down and struggling. </p> \n<p>I expected to receive a lot of mentoring in the first year but, instead, I found myself thrust into a front-line role with no experience and little moral support from my colleagues. I tried to push myself harder but a series of incidents has severely affected my self-confidence. I’m now stuck in a vicious cycle of depression and stress which has made me wonder if I really want to stay in the role. </p> \n<p>This is further compounded by performance-related pay, which all salaried employees are subject to. I like the concept, but the ad hoc way in which the management run it has made me terrified of screwing up. </p> \n<p>I can’t help wondering if I made the right choice by rushing into the first job I was offered and whether or not I should get out. </p> \n<p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?
