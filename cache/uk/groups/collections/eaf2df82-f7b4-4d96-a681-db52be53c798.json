Complete strangers have <a href=\"http://thoughtcatalog.com/parker-marie-molloy/2013/07/what-its-like-to-come-out-as-transgender-at-work/\">yelled and called me names</a> on my way to and from work,” says journalist Parker Marie Molloy.</p> \n<p>For Tara Hewitt, coming out at work led to unwanted questions about <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/careers/careers-blog/busting-myths-transgender-professionals-workplace\">her surgery and sexuality</a>. “I can’t think of any other situation where it would be appropriate for someone to ask whether you have had a vasectomy or hysterectomy. Yet when someone realises you are trans, that automatically becomes part of the conversation.”</p> \n<p>While Ashlee Kelly was working at a department store, one of her colleagues went even further, cornering her in the women’s toilets and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/busting-myths-transgender-professionals-workplace\">trying to look up her skirt</a>. </p> \n<p>Despite these stories, coming out at work can be an uplifting experience. “I am so much happier these days than I’ve ever felt before. I’m not hiding anymore,” adds Molloy.</p> \n<p>So, as cities around the world host LGBT pride events this summer, we want to hear your stories of being transgender at work. Whether you had a supportive employer or faced intrusive questions and prejudice – please share your coming out at work stories with us. How supportive were your employers? Did you face any obstacles? And what advice would you give to others looking to transition at work?</p> \n<p>We will be bringing together the most insightful stories to be published on the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/careers\">Guardian careers site</a>.

This roman a clef, written in an allusive, lucid style, is brimming with intelligent insight about the troubles faced by Nigeria – both past and present. I’ve now moved on to Gordon Burn’s novel about the underbelly of fame: Alma Cogan. The ever reliable John Self recommended this on Twitter, and luckily for me I stumbled upon a copy on my parent’s bookshelf. Burn’s novel casts dissimulation and surreality as fame’s bedfellows. I’m only thirty pages in but I’m mightily impressed with what I’ve read so far. Stylistically it’s akin to Martin Amis, it’s all fizzing adjectives and punchy description. Highly recommended.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"00a8b37a60c7f14011940f7bff5c9769ad7554e7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434371435580/770f5854-b7f3-470e-8129-4698255e82de-314x420.jpeg\" alt=\"brick lane\" width=\"314\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creating serious envy on the books desk ...

Yes, you could say there are longeurs but somehow she maintains her grip – and the sense of a constantly unfolding psychological drama silences criticism. Oates offers no glib solutions and above all wishes to present inner conflicts in all their turbulence and irrationality – thereby making her characters live long in your mind, their vulnerability magnificently exposed. </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2011/aug/31/life-fate-vasily-grossman\">Life and Fate</a> by Vasily Grossman has been sparking a number of discussions lately. <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10098507\">Albertine67</a> shared:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I am still thinking about how on Earth one can begin to talk about Life and Fate. When I finished it the other night I turned the light out and went to sleep, feeling emotionally and intellectually drained. I still haven’t picked up another book yet, I am still feeling its power.</p> \n <p>There are perhaps two things that are particularly haunting me: the choices made by the characters (and the depiction of the decision-making processes) and the ending. The main protagonist, Shtrum the physicist, makes a choice that is almost noble, saintly, given the impact it will have on him, his work, his family; and then, in a later chapter, makes a choice which is pragmatic but is completely at odds with his principles. [...] Similarly, there are many loose ends left at the end; I feel that is completely right for the book, and have to admit that I prefer that type of ending generally, but I realise it’s not for everyone.</p> \n <p>It is just unbelievably good, and I want to run out and buy copies to give out to strangers on the street, as well as my friends. Maybe that’s really all there is to say: give it a chance and read it.<br /></p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"94e0acb79f5bc2bf94b20900ddad9c124318732b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434373313645/c7378ad8-0294-4b6f-bca9-e14ed7ac1024-369x420.jpeg\" alt=\"heartburn\" width=\"369\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/nora-ephron\">Nora Ephron</a>’s Heartburn “made me want to make mashed potatoes,” said – and showed – <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/556c7974e4b04a873a5a93e2/1550583\">ihath</a>.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10021252\">conedison</a> introduced us to the concept of “sleep-reading”:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>My wife awakened in the middle of the night to find me sitting up in bed with the light on. I was sleep-reading ... again. You may consider this a strange circumstance, but what’s even stranger is that I held no actual book in my hands. My wife claims it didn’t stop me from turning the pages, though. I wish I knew what book I was reading, but ... but what if – what if it was something ... (forgive me, Lord) something low-brow? I mean something REALLY low-brow? Or even worse, what if I have an entire virtual-library of the mind made up solely of low-brow books and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/shortcuts/2013/aug/14/barbara-cartland-novelist-beyond-grave\">Barbara Cartland</a>’s the Head Librarian?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/13134881\">Audrey Schoeman</a> in China shared a brilliant discovery – and raised questions about whether a book’s accessibility can work against it:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I am bursting with excitement to let people know what I did this weekend. Wait for it ... I found a bookshop! A real one, with paper books, in English, for sale in deepest Chengdu. I piled them up and in the end was talked down by my husband and left with only four (including a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2012/jan/22/china-chinese-food-sichuan-province\">Sichuan</a> cookbook).</p> \n <p>I feel I could have justified buying more as I’ve already raced through Sarah Waters’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/aug/14/paying-guests-sarah-waters-review-satire-costume-drama\">The Paying Guests</a>. It’s a great book and a great read, but I have some lingering doubts about whether it really belonged on the shortlist for a major prize. Now this may well be me being a book snob, and I’ll take that feedback if it comes, but it didn’t feel to me like a thought-provoking or reflection-inducing enough book to merit the recognition. A ripping good yarn, yes, although perhaps a bit wordy. But able to compete against a book like <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/sep/13/how-to-be-both-ali-smith-review-novel\">How To Be Both</a>? No. Do I sound like an absolute pretentious twat?
