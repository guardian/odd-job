When the public is told that Benefits Street-type scroungers take the lion’s share, the Guardian strips the factoids from the facts: only 3% of the social security bill goes to the unemployed, while half goes to pensioners. When the bedroom tax and benefit sanctions leave families without food, the Guardian shines a light on the plight of those using food banks.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If you read the Guardian, become a Member and part of our community of writers and readers</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Britain faces a monumental decision in the EU referendum. However strict the rules for the yes and no campaigns, nothing will stop the blasts from Britain’s Eurosceptic media. A wall of sound will warp the democratic process – and the Guardian’s independent voice will matter more than ever. No press baron owns us, so we are free to think, write and report without constraint.</p> \n<p>I doubt anyone agrees with everything we publish, and indeed we make a point of encouraging a rainbow of views from contributors.

As in her other books, Moore’s novel has a backdrop of Hawaiian beauty and tradition, with a young woman’s voice as protagonist. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"525065492905ec716abee0b3f04eb35d760ceed2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434627168062/96d4c380-c74d-4bce-b7ad-512ebc52b390-274x420.jpeg\" alt=\"queen\" width=\"274\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>6. <a href=\"http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/liliuokalani/hawaii/hawaii.html\">Hawaii’s Story by Hawaii’s Queen</a> by Liliʻuokalani (1898)</h2> \n<p>The last monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai‘i gives her account of the island’s fall and its annexation by the US in 1898.

Her early life surrounded by rich pastures and Hawaiian cowboys (or paniolos) is brought to life through the eyes of a child. <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15007566\">Beth Bradshaw</a> said:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I’d add the books of noted author <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armine_von_Tempski\">Armine von Tempski</a>, who spent her childhood on the family ranch in Haleakala. Her novels, some semi-autobiographical, beginning with Born in Paradise, published first in 1940, depict a time gone by. In print and worth checking out for a lazy summer read. (She also did a trio of young adult books, best known among them Bright Spurs, about the struggles of two young sisters converting their late parent’s cattle ranch into a guest resort).</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>Extra notes: a list of excellent local writers</h2> \n<p>Reader <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2925415\">ID7477643</a>, who was born and raised in Hawaii, shared the following list of local writers who have written about the island: </p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Reading a book about Hawaii, or Honolulu, written by a local gives the reader a different perspective about a culture that is often represented by its “tourist culture”, for good or bad. So, to that end, I’d like to suggest some local writers who have written about Hawaii, have books that take place in Honolulu, and have deep and meaningful connections with Hawaii.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>This list is not comprehensive by any means – just a list of writers whose work is pretty accessible and pretty wonderful: Kaui Hart Hemmings (mentioned already), Lois-Ann Yamanaka (poet and novelist), Juliet Kono (poet and novelist), Lee Cataluna (novelist), Cathy Song (poet), Darry Lum (novelist), R Zamora Linmark (novelist), Brenda Kwon (novelist), Sylvia Watanabe
