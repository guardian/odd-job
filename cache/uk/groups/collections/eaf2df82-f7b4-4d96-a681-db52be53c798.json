It will apply to over-25s. It will start next year at &pound;7.20, rising to &pound;9 a year by 2020. 2.5 million people will receive a pay rise as result, Osborne says.<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Student maintenance grants will be replaced by loans</strong> from 2016/17. The maximum value will be increased to &pound;8,200 and will only need to be paid back when people earn more than &pound;20,000.<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Tax-free personal allowance to be raised</strong> to &pound;11,000 next year. After that, the personal allowance will always rise in line with inflation.<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Benefits cap to be reduced</strong> to &pound;23,000 in London, and to &pound;20,000 elsewhere.<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Wealthy social housing tenants to pay market rents</strong>.<br /></li> \n <li>From April 2017 <strong>&pound;1m free of inheritance tax</strong>.<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Tax credits and universal credit will only support the first two children</strong>. After April 2017, people who have an additional child will not get extra help, and people who make a new claim will only get money for two children. There will be exceptions for multiple births. There will be similar changes in housing benefits.<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Mortgage tax relief for buy-to-let landlords to be restricted to the basic rate</strong><br /></li> \n <li><strong>Apprenticeship levy</strong> to be imposed on all firms. Those that offer apprentices will get more out of this, in terms of funding for apprenticeships, than they put in.<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Permanent non-dom status to be abolished</strong> – from April 2017, anyone who has lived in the UK for 15 of the past 20 years will pay same level of tax as other UK citizens.<br /></li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong>What do you think about the budget?

Where do you stand on TTIP?<br /></p>","byline":"Caroline Bannock","body":"<p>TTIP, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is a series of trade negotiations being carried out between the EU and US. The bilateral trade agreement deals with reducing regulatory barriers to big business trade: food safety law, environmental legislation, banking regulations and the sovereign powers of individual nations. <br /></p> \n<p>The aim of the talks is to turn the EU and US into the largest free-trade area in the world. However <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global/2015/may/04/ttip-united-nations-human-right-secret-courts-multinationals\">there are concerns that the negotiations</a>, which have mostly been held in secret, could give too much power to private corporations and potentially <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global/2015/may/04/ttip-united-nations-human-right-secret-courts-multinationals\">undermine human rights</a>. <br /></p> \n<p>Growing antipathy towards the talks has sparked protests in the UK <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/german-activists-turn-out-in-force-to-protest-ttip-trade-deal/a-18391723?maca=en-rss-en-ger-1023-rdf\">and Europe</a>, so we’d like to know where you stand on TTIP.
