Many of these have been around for decades, are family businesses that span generations. They have continued to provide a service to the community over the years and contributed to the vibrant culture of the area. As in many other regeneration plans, the outcome will inevitably result in unemployment, displacement and stripping yet another neighbourhood of its unique character.</p> \n <p><strong>- <a

It’s unclear what this might mean for EU migrants living in the UK - and for Brits living in Europe. Currently <a href=\"http://epthinktank.eu/2015/01/26/welfare-in-europe-access-and-safeguards-as-regards-to-social-assistance-and-benefits/\">there are 14 million EU citizens residing in another member state</a> and a British exit could require a whole new set of rules governing economic migration, visas and leave to remain. <br /></p> \n<p>Free movement – that’s the ability to live, work and study anywhere in the Union could be restricted and future <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/14/brexit-what-would-happen-if-britain-left-eu-european-union-referendum-uk\">migration into and out of the UK </a>could theroretically be regulated by British national law. In an extreme scenario, British people could end up having to apply for visas every time they travel across the Channel.

Access to education, healthcare and welfare could also be in doubt. <br /></p> \n<p>We’d like to hear from people who’re concerned about what a future UK exit from the EU would mean for them – both Brits living in Europe and EU migrants to the UK.

We’d also like you to tell us about your situation – are you married or in a relationship with someone from another European member state?

Thankfully, Wiggins’ personality is given room to breathe in this 45-minute <strong>Desert Island Discs </strong>episode, and he is an absolute joy.</p> \n<p>The programme has a habit of throwing up personal and original interviews that would be missed by specialist journalists – try <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b042z660\">Jack Dee</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vhdmb\">Nick Clegg</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00st439\">Tony Adams</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0381l2v\">Daniel Kahneman</a> for starters – and a lot of the credit for that has to go to <strong>Kirsty Young</strong>, whose lack of sporting expertise benefits her hugely when speaking to Wiggins. Most people don’t care for the particulars of cycling; they want to know where Wiggins found his talent and drive, why he has dedicated so much of his time to his craft, how his career has affected the rest of his life and why he struggled to process his monumental success. A sports journalist might have been too interested in the pursuit of details to ask the deceptively simple questions that Young delivers and Wiggins responds to so frankly.</p> \n<p>Wiggins does not baulk at any of her enquiries and he needs no invitation to explore his own weaknesses. He speaks fluently about his childhood, his complex relationship with fame, fatherhood and knighthood, and his “weirdness”. It’s a wonderful piece of radio. If you’re a fan of Wiggins, you’ll love this, and if you’re not a fan, you will be by the end of the show. It’s also a must-listen for all Chas and Dave fans.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/P4Ape\">2) If the NBA had helmets</a> </h2> \n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.jamespoliti.com/\">James Politi</a></strong> is an “unemployed graphic designer who misses the NFL and has to watch basketball with his friends”.

Amateur captains are still filling teams at the last minute (one of my team-mates, who skippers his own occasional side, is not averse to approaching strangers in supermarkets a few hours before the game if he’s desperate enough, and sometimes it works too) but even on lazy Sundays we face many a hard-hitting young batter and hot-headed opening bowler. They attack the game madly. The single biggest change I have seen since I started playing is in how hard the ball is hit.

O’Mahony provides a wonderful, scything summary of Keane’e book in the first section of this essay. He spends 3,000 words describing Keane’s book, cutting down its author with winning sarcasm throughout. The approach works perfectly; those of us who bothered to read the book should have waited for O’Mahony’s review, which cuts out the context we knew already and distills the writing to the four things Keane does best: contradictions, put-downs, humour and anger. <br /></p> \n<p>When it comes to Moore, O’Mahony does not roll out the red carpet of forgiveness that usually buttresses the sporting heroes of yesteryear. Instead, he tells a rather sad story about a man who was more bland than most of us would like to admit. The inscription on the giant statue of Moore that stands outside Wembey reads “Immaculate footballer. Imperial defender. Immortal hero of 1966. First Englishman to raise the World Cup aloft. Favourite son of London’s East End. Finest legend of West Ham United. National Treasure. Master of Wembley. Lord of the game. Captain extraordinary. Gentleman of all time.” But, when all the patriotic bluster is stripped away, Moore was really a quiet, unconfrontational and detached man who finished his career playing in the Danish Third Division, squandered a lot of his money in failed businesses and ended up offering anodyne punditry on the radio. </p> \n<p>The game was only good to him for so long and the same may yet be said for Keane, who admitted in his book that nothing he will ever do again come close to the experiences he enjoyed as a younger man. Keane and Moore are proper football men, but their books have not inspired in O’Mahony a great deal of confidence in the sport:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Children are constantly told that playing competitive sports builds character and teaches valuable life lesions. I wonder. Many great athletes are one-trick ponies (or hedgehogs, to use Isaiah Berlin’s classification), and the character traits that made them successful in professional sport are often a handicap in retirement. Bobby Moore’s calmness and air of detachment served him well at Wembley in 1966, but during the wet Sunday afternoons of the rest of his life this reserve gave an impression of a Chauncey Gardner-like emptiness. Roy Keane’s anger was, as he freely admits, a “useful tool” during his years as a midfield enforcer, but it often backfired on him during his managerial career. </p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InNvsnJNrFk\">10) Why do footballers nearly all vote Tory?</a></h2> \n<p>Writer, illustrator, cartoonist, artist, acoustic guitar dabbler and stick whittler <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Urban_Country\">Tim Bradford</a></strong> has the answer in this short song:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InNvsnJNrFk\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/InNvsnJNrFk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431707119919/7d7edba1-612d-454b-b79d-a98cc713b657-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Martin Rickett/PA","altText":"Wiggins","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431702490969/c321e23a-a452-40aa-99db-c88ab0550089-2060x1924.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1924,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Orlando Magic. <a href=\"http://www.jamespoliti.com/\">Design: James Politi</a>","credit":"James Politi","altText":"Orlando Magic","cleanCaption":"Orlando Magic. <a href=\"http://www.jamespoliti.com/\">Design: James Politi</a>"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431958059254/a58314c8-1a10-4469-a8b8-59975fba1db2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Miguel Ángel Jiménez.

I was so excited during the first half of the book that Waters was doing something different with the twentieth-century woman’s domestic novel but it fell apart in the second half. —<a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/11071608\">MsCarey</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Good question. Unfortunately I can never discount the possibility that I misunderstood something in the text which has caused me to miss the point come the conclusion, I read a lot of fiction in translation whilst being about as cultured as a rusty wheelbarrow with a deflated tyre.

In it he imagines an alternative American history, in which Lindbergh defeats FDR by a landslide in the 1940 election and comes to an understanding with Hitler. Though Roth has often used his Newark childhood in his work, I thought he never wrote about it so movingly and lovingly. There are scenes in it which are unforgettable, such as all of Newark staying up to hear Lindbergh’s speech to the 1940 Republican convention which wins him the nomination, people emptying onto the streets afterwards in their pyjamas, as if an earthquake had erupted. —<a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10098507\">Albertine67</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>See the rest of the conversation <a href=\"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/51971236\">here</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d75e8e803674c5b9c74b7e5608da8bbf5f97ac1e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431941202648/c3b2e024-82e4-4d43-b88b-6a0944eb01d2-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Moran\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/arianhod\">arianhod</a> is reading Caitlin Moran’s latest offering, the novel <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/jul/03/how-to-build-girl-caitlin-moran-review\">How to Build a Girl</a>: “Love Caitlin Moran, have read How to Be a Woman and Moranthology so pleased that this is the first of a trilogy, I can’t put it down”.
