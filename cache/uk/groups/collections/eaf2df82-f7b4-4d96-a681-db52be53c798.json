Three things happen when they are in the lab. You fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and when you criticise them, they cry.”</p> \n<p>Despite numerous education initiatives, the number of women in science, technology or engineering (Stem) has remained low. According to statistics from HESA, computer science has the fewest amount of undergraduate female students with only 18% with only 13% of people working in Stem occupations, <a href=\"https://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/resources/2014/09/uk-statistics-2014\">according to campaign group Wise</a>. However research out last year suggests that more <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2014/feb/18/female-students-science-engineering-sixth-formers-stem-subjects\">female students are interested in studying Stem subjects beyond A-Level</a>. <br /></p> \n<p><strong>If you’re a female student studying science we’d like to hear from you.

With 93% saying they suffer from stress at work, and more than half saying they are more stressed than this time last year, learning to clock off and manage stress has never been more important. </p> \n<p>Alongside the positive and charming “I use adult colouring books”, we received frank responses that detailed the daily struggles some public service workers face. Many respondents described over-eating as a means to combat the pressure of work, while others – some 28% – said they tended to drink when stressed. Some said there’s often no time for relaxation, because with a massive workload it’s easier to just carry on doing as much as possible rather than let it pile up further.</p> \n<p>So how do you relax? Are you no sooner through the door then you’re out with the dog to walk off the day? Do you fill up the tub for a long hot soak? A bottle of wine in front of the TV? Running before breakfast? Gardening or DIY? Do you have advice you think others who experience stress could benefit from? Or do you just want to share the work week pain with a selfie to sum up your Friday feeling?</p> \n<p>We want the images and stories of how those working in public services and the voluntary sector try to find a balance between work and home. You can submit yours via GuardianWitness anonymously or with your name. </p> \n<p>We will be using these to inform our project, called Clock off, which is examining work-life balance in the public and voluntary sectors.
