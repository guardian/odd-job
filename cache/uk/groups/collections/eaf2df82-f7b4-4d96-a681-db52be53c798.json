Let us know in the comments, and we’ll feature a selection in an upcoming readers’ list</strong></li>\n</ul>","byline":"Anna Clark","body":"<p>Try as you might to hammer Detroit into a single story, it cannot be done. Detroit inspires heated poetry, painstaking realism, stories of the supernatural, riveting non-fiction, and unclassifiable imaginative works. In a city celebrated for its history of making things, the Detroit literary arts are overdue for attention.</p> \n<p>Start with Harriette Arnow’s <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dollmaker-harriette-arnow/1100366762?ean=9781439154434\">The Dollmaker</a>, the 1954 bestseller which follows a Kentucky family as they migrate north for wartime jobs and settle in the factory housing of “Flint’s Motor Company”. There is a fierce hum behind the unfolding drama of what it means to “adjust” in this crowded alleyway, tucked inside a towering city that styles itself as the engine of the world. Joyce Carol Oates called the book “our most unpretentious American masterpiece,” and she’s right.</p> \n<p>Speaking of Oates, she herself lived in and around Detroit for nearly 20 years, and has written her most interesting books here. Look for the Wonderland Quartet, her loosely arranged series examining social class. <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/them-joyce-carol-oates/1026667044?ean=9780345484406\">Them</a> is a glowering, languid novel of mid-century Detroit which straddles economic extremes as it steams toward a cataclysmic unraveling during the July 1967 uprising. In <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/expensive-people-joyce-carol-oates/1100618485?ean=9780812976540\">Expensive People</a>, Oates spins a gothic tale about the leafy upscale suburbs; the exaggerated doom has a Nabokovian ring. Jeffrey Eugenides also turned his attention to the Detroit suburbs in both <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/virgin-suicides.html\">The Virgin Suicides</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2002/oct/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview15\">Middlesex</a>, and he too dramatised <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1954975/Detroit-Riot-of-1967\">July 1967</a>, as does Bill Morris in <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/motor-city-burning-bill-morris/1116983759?ean=9781605988436\">Motor City Burning</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.pearlcleage.net/\">Pearl Cleage</a>, who holds court in a number of genres, sets novels in <a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/news/columnists/john-carlisle/2014/11/30/idlewild-michigan-hard-times/19668773/\">Idlewild</a>, the real-life African American resort community in Northern Michigan where sophisticates of Detroit and far beyond vacationed. Angela Flournoy is making waves with her new novel, <a href=\"http://www.angelaflournoy.com/theturnerhouse/\">The Turner House</a>, about an east-side neighborhood. <a href=\"http://www.elmoreleonard.com/index.php\">Elmore Leonard</a> is celebrated for his crime novels, including <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/city-primeval-elmore-leonard/1102158002?ean=9780062191359\">City Primeval: High Noon in Detroit</a>. But read him alongside <a href=\"http://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/detroit-sploi-tation/Content?oid=2178205\">Donald Goines</a>, who was essentially writing in the same mode at the same time, but for a predominantly African American audience.</p> \n<p>Novelists from Africa have also had their imaginations ignited by Detroit. In <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/noviolet-bulawayo\">NoViolet Bulawayo</a>’s acclaimed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/nov/15/we-need-new-names-noviolet-bulawayo-guardian-first-book-award\">We Need New Names</a>, Darling, a teenager from Zimbabwe, finds herself in the care of her aunt in Detroit, Michigan (“Destroyedmichigan”), where she is struck by the dissonance between abundance and scarcity. In <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/jul/24/broken-monsters-review-lauren-beukes\">Broken Monsters</a> by Lauren Beukes, a grotesque crime brushes against Detroit’s arts culture and the fervour of modern media. Stephen King declared the book to be “scary as hell and hypnotic”,<strong> </strong>but it’s the authentic voices of teenagers that Beukes does best. <a href=\"http://www.feministpress.org/books/bridgett-m-davis/go-slow\">Into the Go-Slow</a> looks in the other direction, as Bridgett M Davis tells a story of the tough aftermath of a young Black Power activist in Detroit moving to Lagos.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7050620de0d5e82fad4c4b1c4c94c7789f4d91db\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432204617415/9b6a9c75-195a-4321-8d84-940d2a7b36c5-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Detroit skyline\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A different view of the city ... the Detroit skyline.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Cummins/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In poetry, it’s tough to keep up.

Small relays the true story of when, aged 14, he awoke from what he thought was a harmless operation to find a thick scar upon his throat and a vocal cord removed. After being treated for a cancer no one told him he had, Small is now mute. Stitches depicts the brutal and haunting silences of what came before and after.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in non-fiction, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/origins-of-the-urban-crisis.html\">The Origins of the Urban Crisis</a> by Thomas J Sugrue is a benchmark work, but also check out <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Living_for_Change.html?id=qwyo2b26Yl0C&amp;hl=en\">Living for Change</a> and <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/next-american-revolution.html\">The Next American Revolution</a> by legendary Detroiter <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/06152007/watch3.html\">Grace Lee Boggs</a>.

It’s a properly big book which thinks seriously about all sorts of things and is unashamed to do so. What makes it exceptional though is that the writer is as adept at the central story as he is with the intellectual whys and wherefores. There are all sorts of fascinating digressions but it’s still a page-turner because you are so desperate to find out what has happened to the central character, who is beautifully drawn. The narrative moves from Oxford to London to New York to Islamabad to Kabul to Bangladesh in order to illuminate some of the big events of the twenty-first century. Supremely entertaining and clever light years beyond my puny abilities.

But can you do better?</p>","byline":"Tash Reith-Banks and Joshua Harbord","body":"<p>Science is full of big, complex ideas, and one of the most important skills a scientist can develop is a knack for communicating those ideas to others. It’s a difficult job, and one which is even harder if you want to condense a lot of information into a tight word count or timeframe. </p> \n<p>However, that’s exactly what we’re going to try to do over the next couple of months. Every two weeks we’ll be trying to break down a range of scientific concepts into six-second vines, which we’ll launch on the Guardian Vine account and here in the Notes &amp; Theories blog.</p> \n<p>Our first attempt is a look at the life cycle of a small star. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vine.co/v/ehn9T2xlndQ\" data-alt=\"The life of a star\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://vine.co/v/ehn9T2xlndQ/embed/simple&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;script src=&quot;https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Source: Joshua Harbord/the Guardian/Vine\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We decided to use stop-motion animation and Play-Doh to illustrate the life and death of a small star. It begins with the swirling of gases and dust from collapsing nebulae, which are drawn together by gravity, the centre growing hotter and hotter, to form a protostar.</p> \n<p>If the protostar has sufficient mass, the gas and dust burn with increasing heat, eventually reaching temperatures which allow the nuclear fusion hydrogen into helium. This turns the body into a main sequence star, producing light, heat and enough radiation pressure to stop gravitational collapse.<br /></p> \n<p>How long the star lives depends on its mass: a star with higher mass will burn through material faster due to a higher core temperature, caused by greater gravitational forces. <br /></p> \n<p>After about ten billion years, the hydrogen at the core of a small star will run out, putting an end to the nuclear fusion powering the star and causing gravitational collapse. This collapse increases the density and heat of the core until the fusion of helium into carbon is triggered. This in turn causes the outer layers of the star to expand and start to cool. The cooling turns them red: the star is now a red giant.<br /></p> \n<p>There’s now almost a repeat of the previous process: the helium runs out so no further fusion can take place and gravitational collapse resumes. The collapse will cease and stability occur once the carbon electrons become so close together that electron degeneracy pressure occurs with enough force to balance out gravity. The star’s outer layers expand and puff away to form a planetary nebula, leaving a white dwarf in place of the red giant, dimming and cooling until eventually it is a black dwarf, emitting no significant light or heat.</p> \n<p>It’s quite a lot to fit into six seconds, but we had a go.
