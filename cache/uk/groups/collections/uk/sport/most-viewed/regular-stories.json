He would not be drawn into criticising other players but told a story from his teenage days in Spain that shines an interesting light on a serious subject.</p> \n<p>“I wouldn’t want to speak about other players because I don’t know,” he said, “but when I was a junior, one of the coaches Pato [&Aacute;lvarez] that I used to work with used to do signals to a lot of his players.</p> \n<p>“I was playing a futures tournament when I was about 16 out in Spain. I won the match but it was close, not a very good match. And he went: ‘Andy, what are you doing? You never listen to me when you are on the court.’</p> \n<p>“I said: ‘What do you mean?’ He said: ‘I was telling you to serve and volley and you weren’t doing it.’ I was, like: ‘You never told me what the signals were.’</p> \n<p>“He was there at the back of the court telling me what to do and I didn’t know. He is the only coach that I have ever worked with [to do that]. Since I have been on the tour none of the coaches I have been with have ever given me any hand signals, or anything like that.</p> \n<p>“Ivan Lendl didn’t say a word, really, when I was playing matches and, no, I have not had that since I have been on the tour. I don’t think I have ever had a coaching warning. It’s possible but I don’t think so.”</p> \n<p>He might not need anything more than encouragement against Haase, whom he has beaten three times out of four, but he will hardly disregard the danger posed by a player who has taken a set off him in each of their two US Open matches.</p> \n<p>“I was cramping after an hour and 15 minutes [when they last played there, in the first round last year]. Idon’t know how I managed to come through that match, to be honest. The time when I played him before in New York [in 2011], he was coming in to it having played very&nbsp;well.”</p> \n<p>Murray and Haase have slightly differing recollections of their history, the Dutchman saying he never played him as a junior, while the Scot does remember him being around at that time of their development.</p> \n<p>“He is someone I grew up with, in juniors and stuff like that. He likes playing on the big courts as well. He goes for it, which makes things tough. I don’t know him unbelievably well. He is quiet off the court, but on it he is quite loud and open and emotional. So it should be a fun match.”</p> \n<p>Murray says he has been turning to the snooker table to relax between matches, alongside Ross Hutchins and the Delgado brothers, a habit he picked up during his spells of rehab after injury, when he would play his Davis Cup captain, Leon Smith, in Glasgow. “We get pumped to play,” he says of his time on the tables at the All England Club. “None of us is any good but it is a fun way to spend time with friends.”</p> \n<p>Aljaz Bedene and James Ward, meanwhile, have the incentive of moving closer to an all-British fourth tie – if they can beat Viktor Troicki and Jiri Vesely, respectively. The newest Brit, Bedene, has the tougher task, up against the Queen’s semi-finalist who gave Murray a good argument. He revealed he had a brief phone conversation with his mother after beating Radek Stepanek in the first round.</p> \n<p>“She was really happy and proud,” said Bedene, who was born in the old Yugoslavia before Ljubljana became the capital of independent Slovenia and was granted British citizenship in April. “But she cut the call short because she said I probably had a lot of work to do now. It was only five seconds, but they were really happy. They are on holiday – I think they followed it on the internet.”</p> \n<p>Bedene, whose partner is the singer Kimalie, says he is being recognised more often in public lately – hopefully because of his tennis. “I was talking to Kimalie – who has been working with Jeff Wayne and they will probably be releasing a song or two this year – and she said: ‘Definitely next year it will be different for us,’ and I agree. I still don’t want to be too well-known. I want to be able to enjoy my personal life – but if it happens, you cannot do anything about it.”</p> \n<p>Ward’s might be the more straightforward task against the lively young Czech left-hander Vesely, although he invariably views every match as a struggle – even his win over lucky loser Luca Vanni after the withdrawal through injury of David Ferrer.</p> \n<p>But the Londoner did take heart from the presence of three other British players in the second round for the first time in 10 years.</p> \n<p>“I think everyone’s picked their game up, playing well coming into the tournament,” he said. “Everyone’s ranking is improving. It’s good to have a few more guys playing well and winning matches. You just keep knocking at the door.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435785739348/Wimbledon-day-two-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray revealed his former coach Ivan Lendl 'didn’t say a word, really, when I was playing matches'.

I’ve had people threatening to kill me and kill my family, wishing that I get cancer and die a slow, painful death. Horrible words I couldn’t even think up in my head, to be that mean.”</p> \n<p>She said on Wednesday: “I think those people, they’ve got no life. They’re just kind of cowards thinking they can say whatever they want on the internet. They don’t understand that we’re just people at the end of the day.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think they’d appreciate people saying that stuff to them. But what can you do? I don’t think you’re going to be able to stop it.”</p> \n<p>She told reporters she continues to post on her own accounts, saying: “I think some people get sick of me posting pictures. But I like it so I’m going to keep doing it.”</p> \n<p>Her 6-4 6-2 win puts Watson into the third round where she has the daunting task of facing Serena Williams, and means she will take home at least &pound;77,000 from this year’s championships. This is the second time Watson has played in the third round at Wimbledon, having previously reached this stage in 2012.</p> \n<p>Watson, who was supported on court by her parents, grandmother and a childhood friend from Guernsey, as well as the sports presenter Colin Murray, beamed as she revealed she had recently bought her first property close to the All England Club, which had been “a big goal of mine for a long, long time”.</p> \n<p>She was surprised, she said, by the temperature on court. “It was very warm. But I’m not complaining. It’s nice weather for Wimbledon.”</p> \n<p>Asked to describe her emotions at the moment she defeated Hantuchova, she said:“I was very happy.

Even prime minister Tony Abbott weighed in: “Australia couldn’t be prouder of you”.</p> \n<p>The only catch? All these quotes come from a year ago, when Kyrgios’s blistering serve and rifled forehands were enough to impress us, before anyone had found the time to pick at the seams on his Nike shirts and before he’d been around long enough to take issue with authority figures in the way that youngsters tend to. </p> \n<p>And now apparently, the tide has turned.</p> \n<p>“Unfortunately being himself continues to rile fans who are fed up with his on-court antics,” <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/wimbledon/wimbledon-2015-nick-kyrgios-is-a-tennis-player-with-a-basketballers-attitude-20150630-gi13gh\">say the Sydney Morning Herald</a> this week. “Now he has to decide how he wants to be remembered.” </p> \n<p>Got that? A 20-year-old with barely a year in the international spotlight needs to pay close attention to his legacy. </p> \n<p>“I’m starting to feel like Nick Kyrgios is - and there’s no delicate way of putting this - a bit of a tool,” went another opinion column before Kyrgios had even laid racquet on ball this week. </p> \n<p>A year ago the world didn’t mind when this kid crashed the party because it all just looked like a hell of a lot of fun. Novelty now exhausted, Kyrgios is being relentlessly bashed over the head with all of the same personality traits that made his rise so compelling and enjoyable, that made it possible in the first place.</p> \n<p>A particular point of interest is the hiding he receives on account of the bling, the swagger and the hip-hop posturing. But besides an actual rapper, surely there’s no professional endeavor more suited to the brash individualism of the hip-hop star than a solo sport like tennis? </p> \n<p>Think about it: you’ve got no teammates; you’re followed around the world by an entourage; people pay you absurd amounts of money to use their products as ostentatiously as possible; nobody really begrudges you obscene levels of wealth, and a rebel streak helps in that sense. </p> \n<p>Rich and famous sports people like Kyrgios are the only people on earth who should act like rappers. Not even rappers should act as much like rappers as sportspeople do. With the assistance of a decent producer and autotune, anyone could release a hip-hop single - but only a minuscule percentage of human beings can regularly spear 210kmph aces into the ribs of line judges. </p> \n<p>Kyrgios’s on-court behaviour and insubordination towards officials in both his matches at Wimbledon so far hasn’t been too flash, that’s for certain. The only problem is that we’re talking about a fairly standard pitfall of youth and inexperience suffered by many of the best players. </p> \n<p>There are now countless case studies telling us that being a bit of a prat at Kyrgios’s age is no hurdle to either success or lasting fame - or have we so quickly forgotten early-era Lleyton Hewitt or, heaven forbid, even the early moments of he-that-is-above-reproach, Roger Federer?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/01/wimbledon-2015-nick-kyrgios-win-juan-monaco\">Nick Kyrgios shows his good, bad and ugly side in win over Juan M&oacute;naco</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If Australia should engage in genuine national debate about Kyrgios and his potential legacy then surely a decent amount of attention should be paid to the huge interest he’s generating for tennis. </p> \n<p>Make no mistake, every sport in Australia is engaged in a war for the attention of consumers and participants, battling not just each other but rapid societal shifts and cheaper, easier and frankly better entertainment options, ones that don’t involve sitting in the baking sun for eight hours. </p> \n<p>What place would tennis – a sport of no great fit to modern childhood life with its hours upon hours of solitary, glamourless training sessions – continue to hold in the imagination of children were a path not lit by a personality as engaging and symbolic of the times as Kyrgios? </p> \n<p>As you read this he’s probably responding to one of those kids’ tweets or Instagram comments. If the fact that Kyrgios favours the basketball world inhabited by LeBron James over tennis says anything, it’s that he’s probably more in tune with the interests of the average teenager than most sporting pundits seem to be.</p> \n<p>In fact, the closer Kyrgios’s behaviour and style matches that of the pop-cultural touchstones of the time – the LeBrons and Kanyes – the greater the chance that the sport remains relevant to kids. And rather than driving a wedge between himself and Australians, shouldn’t the admission that he doesn’t particularly like his job bond both parties in one of life’s universal sorrows?</p> \n<p>That Kyrgios isn’t in love with tennis at his age should qualify as the least surprising thing in the world given the sacrifices players make to get to the top, with all those chunks of missed childhood and hours in departure lounges. He seems to view tennis as merely the medium through which he can achieve stardom, but that itself is still a compelling incentive for him to achieve great things. </p> \n<p>Here’s something else that no one wants to acknowledge about a player so supremely talented: even the derailed or mediocre career path that’s being touted as a possibility if Kyrgios doesn’t cut the histrionics wouldn’t be that bad. If he spends a decade reaching the fourth round of grand slams he’ll still receive more solo prime-time TV coverage than almost any athlete in Australia. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"910d0850ff5bc183bc44919d0c5c529fcfc1e3fc\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/910d0850ff5bc183bc44919d0c5c529fcfc1e3fc/0_22_1972_2957/667.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Kyrgios\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">He’s polarising the sports media, but do you try and knock the edges off a guy whose swagger piques people’s interest in Tennis?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That’s the worst-case scenario. He’d remain among the most marketable Australian sportspeople, towering over us on billboards selling underpants. Maybe he’ll ‘just’ be a new generation Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, always pushing the best but never quite matching them. If he does, he’ll still be outdoing all bar a couple of players in the past 40 years of Australian men’s tennis. Again, that looks like a worst-case scenario.</p> \n<p>Didn’t we all watch far too much Chris Guccione and Wayne Arthurs to genuinely dislike this kid? The procession of no-hopers that bridged Lleyton Hewitt’s peak and this new “Special K” era are just too fresh in the mind. </p> \n<p>Tennis players don’t spend long on that dizzying, glorious “up”, when everything suddenly seems possible and anything could happen from one minute to the next. To fritter that away arguing about Kyrgios’s terrible hair and teenage tantrums would be a shame. </p> \n<p>A lot of what the Kyrgios discussion comes down to is the circular and highly distorted flow of opinion between social and traditional media, which now unfortunately replaces such quaint concepts as sober news reporting, expert analysis and the opinion of people qualified to make judgments. </p> \n<p>Looking to this human centipede of phoney consensus we get in place of those things, we’re told that “people” are sick of Kyrgios, that they’ve already “had it up to here” with his petulance. Maybe a fair few of those people genuinely do dislike Kyrgios, but then a huge number of the same people also consider Sam Stosur – Australia’s only grand slam singles winner in a decade – a hopeless choker. </p> \n<p>Sometimes you really can’t trust people.</p> \n<p>But it feels as though this will be the fate of Australian men’s tennis into the next decade; supremely talented kids, often second-generation migrants, having seven shades of shit kicked out of them for not pressing their linen like Roy Emerson and conforming to a narrow set of outdated cultural expectations. </p> \n<p>England’s identity crisis is manifested through its football team, Australia’s now through Bernard Tomic’s lap dances and Nick Kyrgios’s diamond stud earrings. </p> \n<p>This is a great pity, because if sport should achieve anything, it’s to take us outside ourselves and introduce us to people we’re not, people we could never be.

In the five weeks since Bayliss was appointed by England’s director of cricket, Andrew Strauss, the void has been filled by the ringing endorsements of those players who have worked under the 52-year-old Australian.</p> \n<p>Eoin Morgan, Mahela Jayawardene, Brendon McCullum and Brad Haddin – disciples of his regimes at Kolkata Knight Riders, Sri Lanka and New South Wales – have talked up his ability to empower cricketers by keeping their dressing room calm and delivering concise, considered messages without ever going down the route of hyperbole, or, as Morgan put it, “bullshit”.</p> \n<p>“I keep things simple. At the top level it’s about creating a good environment,” Bayliss continued. “If you’ve got a good, honest, hard-working environment where players enjoy what they’re doing, it allows them to go out with less pressure and show off the skills they’ve got.”</p> \n<p>These words could have been delivered by Paul Farbrace, who is reunited with Bayliss six years after their time together in the Sri Lanka set-up and who seemingly began the unshackling of England’s cricketers while they awaited the permanent replacement to Peter Moores. “He will be my eyes and ears early on while I get to know the system and the players,” said Bayliss, who admitted his old friend played a part in convincing him to up sticks from Sydney and start a new life in the mother country. “He is a good coach as well. I’m very lucky to have him.”</p> \n<p>The pair have been through more than just cricket together, of course, having both been on the team bus that was attacked by terrorists in Lahore in 2009 and saw six policemen and two civilians killed.</p> \n<p>“I certainly remember when the bombs and the bullets were flying around,” he said, while demonstrating he was just a matter of inches from being struck. “There was nothing you could do except keep your head down and your arse up.”</p> \n<p>Bayliss admits that ordeal, along with the tragic death of the batsman Phillip Hughes last November when playing for South Australia against his New South Wales side, has shaped his outlook on life and keeps the cricket fully in perspective.</p> \n<p>Having left his dual roles in Australia and Kolkata following a &pound;400,000-a-year offer from Strauss – an approach he neither courted nor expected having agreed contract extensions at both – Bayliss will not be joined by his wife and two children for at least 12 months because of his 17-year-old daughter’s final year at school.</p> \n<p>Now, with a working visa secured, the former first-class batsman can familiarise himself with their new home and continue passing on a message of self-determination to his players that began during their four-day training camp in Spain over the weekend.</p> \n<p>“One of my philosophies is that the best coaches are the other 10 players in the team,” he said. “The younger players look up to those older players and learn from them. If you’re watching the right things, listening to those players, asking the right questions, you will learn more about the game actually competing than you will from any coach.”</p> \n<p>Whether this player-led approach, the green shoots of which were evident against New Zealand, can bring about an Ashes victory this summer remains to be seen, with just seven days now until the first Test in Cardiff. Much has been made of his inside knowledge of Michael Clarke’s tourists, with nine of his former charges in their 17-man touring party. Yet again, it comes down those who take the field.</p> \n<p>“There are enough guys in the England team with enough experience and who have played these guys plenty of times before,” Bayliss said.</p> \n<p>How will he feel when the national anthems blare out at the Swalec Stadium just as the sledging-heavy pre-series hype turns into actual bat on ball action? “I am old enough that in the first seven or eight years I was at school I sang God Save the Queen so I know most of the words and probably more than I do of our own at the moment,” he joked.</p> \n<p>While Bayliss has worked with the one-day captain, Morgan, at Kolkata, his relationship with Test equivalent Alastair Cook is just days old. Asked if he rated his new ally’s abilities as a leader, he replied: “I’ve not seen him up close or worked with him before. What I will say is that it is a lot easier from the captain’s point of view if the team are playing a good, positive brand of cricket.”</p> \n<p>And the overall objective? “Like any other team worth their salt we want to be No1 in Test matches, ODIs and T20s. If you haven’t got those aspirations I&nbsp;think you’re kidding yourself.”</p> \n<p>With a CV that includes two Sheffield Shields, two IPL titles, winning the Big Bash League at Sydney Sixers and two ICC limited-overs finals with Sri Lanka, success has followed everywhere Bayliss has worked. To make that hot streak to continue, England’s players will be told to stand on their own two feet. There will be no spoon-feeding.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/afef8040b4ef02acda0797bb07410ab52339737e/0_173_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images","altText":"Trevor Bayliss Press Conference & England Ashes Squad Announcement<br>LONDON, ENGLAND - JULY 01:  New England Coach Trevor Bayliss gives TV interviews during a Press Conference at Lord's Cricket Ground on July 1, 2015 in London, England.

He was over on Court 18, second on after his great mate Bernard Tomic. By the time Tomic was wrapping-up the third set of his 7-6, 6-4, 7-6 victory over France’s Pierre-Hugues Herbert, the lines at all four court entrances were tailing back at least 30 metres. Everyone wanted in. Not many made it. Fanatics in green-and-gold shirts had staked out the seats early in the morning, in eager anticipation of an Aussie double-header. They provided a kind of chorus line, running through their repertoire of rehearsed chants. As Kyrgios came on to the court, they broke into: “We’re here to see the wonderkid! We’re here to see the wonderkid!” Them and everyone else.</p> \n<p>Kyrgios did not disappoint. His 7-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Argentina’s Juan M&oacute;naco made for 100 minutes of marvellously entertaining tennis, in which Kyrgios showed off an array of stupendous shots, strokes and serves. He also delivered a couple of big laughs, displayed some fine sportsmanship, and exploded with anger at an official who reported him for swearing.</p> \n<p>In the 12th game of the first set, when Kyrgios seemed to be struggling in the ferocious heat, he complained loudly “my head is fucking exploding, mate, I don’t feel very well”. He explained afterwards that he has been struggling with a sinus infection for the past fortnight, and that his vision was blurry. And he obviously was suffering. He spent much of his downtime mumbling to himself, and had the general demeanour of a man trekking through the desert in search of water. “I’m in pain,” he said afterwards, “and I’m playing a tennis match at Wimbledon, second round. So there’s a bit of stress out there.”</p> \n<p>When the line judge trotted off to the umpire to report the swear words he had heard, Kyrgios turned on him and said, with withering sarcasm: “What a champion! What a champion! What a champ! Well done, mate: did you get your message across?” Not done yet, Kyrgios continued his rant when he took to his seat. He asked the umpire what the line judge had just said. When the umpire gave him the cold shoulder, Kyrgios was overheard saying: “Is that a threat? Does it feel good to be in the chair up there? Do you feel strong up there?” All this, of course, after he got into a row with the umpire in the first round too, during his match against Diego Schwartzman. Then he threatened to stop playing and was heard <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/wimbledon-2015-nick-kyrgios-dirty-scum-outburst-diego-schwartzman\" title=\"\">using the phrase “dirty scum”</a>. He said later that he had only been chastising himself, an explanation accepted by the authorities, who decided not to punish him any further.</p> \n<p>Kyrgios made an effort not to get himself in any more trouble in his post-match interviews. “I was just asking the umpire what the line judge said there. I wasn’t causing any drama there.” But a follow-up question on the topic proved to be one provocation too many. “He thought he was top dog in the chair really,” he said of the umpire Ali Nili. “He was telling me not to speak to him, all that sort of stuff.” He seemed to think that the umpire was somehow sitting up above him, looking down in judgment. A little odd. But then Kyrgios did admit in an interview last week that he doesn’t “really like the sport of tennis all that much”.</p> \n<p>All of which makes Kryrgios sound perfectly absurd, a real little tennis brat. And perhaps he is that. But he is only 20, and in the long run he will either learn or suffer for it. While some will say his youth is no excuse, it should at least afford him a little slack.</p> \n<p>Not least because, though he may not like the game himself, lots of people love to watch him play it. He is so richly gifted that even the prissiest fans, the ones who shake their heads in despair when they hear him swear, soon forgive him. They sigh when they see him unfurl that stunning forehand, a shot of rare beauty, with a slow motion gather till the final snap, when he uncurls his body as though his joints are being yanked by elastic bands. They smile when he indulges in his back-and-forth patter with the crowd. They clap when he salutes his opponent’s winners with words such as “great shot!” and “impressive!”</p> \n<p>Mon&aacute;co is ranked 35th in the world, and no fool. He has been on the circuit for 13 years, and has been ranked No10 in the world. But once Kyrgios had ground out that tight first set, Mon&aacute;co struggled to keep up. Kyrgios made winning the second and third look easy. Now he will play Milos Raonic in the third round. It promises to be a fierce and compelling game.

All marshalled by a panicky looking Clare Balding”.</p> \n<p>Viewers were scarcely kinder. “Nice job, BBC! Why bother with tennis highlights when you can just have an hour of inane babbling instead?” tweeted one viewer, @jwatson1.</p> \n<p>A BBC spokesperson said: “We acknowledge that new formats can take some time to bed in with audiences, but we’re very pleased with the show and look forward to seeing it grow over the Championship.”</p> \n<p>The show replaced the traditional highlights programme presented by John Inverdale. </p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/03d8baa4c81f7ccda7d6ba2ccf986be253e1503a/0_0_620_372/620.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Julian Andrews/Rex Features","altText":"Clare Balding","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Julian Andrews/Rex Features"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T23:16:44Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T23:45:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":626,"contributors":[{"name":"Esther Addley","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/estheraddley"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Wimbledon","Wimbledon 2015","Sport","Tennis","BBC","Television industry","Television","Media","Television & radio","Culture","Sport TV"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC"},{"id":"media/television","webTitle":"Television industry"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/sport-tv","webTitle":"Sport TV"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Esther Addley","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/estheraddley"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/01/bbcs-new-wimbledon-highlights-show-mauled-by-critics-and-viewers","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9gn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/01/bbcs-new-wimbledon-highlights-show-mauled-by-critics-and-viewers","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/01/bbcs-new-wimbledon-highlights-show-mauled-by-critics-and-viewers"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/03d8baa4c81f7ccda7d6ba2ccf986be253e1503a/0_0_620_372/620.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Clare Balding fronts the new Wimbledon2Day show.
