The spokesman said: “If he was not adequately dressed, you could infer that he would not have been let in, but we do not comment on our guests. If he came without a jacket, tie or shoes, he would have had two choices – not staying, or going to get some extra stuff.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/12/novak-djokovic-roger-federer-wimbledon-2015-final\">Novak Djokovic beats Roger Federer in four sets in Wimbledon final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Hollywood stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Bradley Cooper and Hugh Grant were in the royal box to watch the highly anticipated men’s final, which Djokovic won in four sets.

No longer.</p> \n<p>When Novak Djokovic pounded a cross-court winner past Roger Federer on Sunday afternoon to seal his third Wimbledon championship and ninth grand slam title, the four-way hegemony that has long defined the tour never appeared more like a spot in the rear view mirror. There is the Big One, and there is everyone else.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/12/federer-praises-djokovic-after-final-defeat\">Roger Federer generous in defeat by Novak Djokovic in Wimbledon final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Djokovic had entered the showdown between the top two seeds with an 8-8 record in grand slam finals, lending it a pivotal feel with respect to his legacy despite an extraordinary run of form this season that included a 47-3 match record and five titles. He would have been the world No1 by more than 3,000 rankings points even if he had lost Sunday’s final, but the questions over his mental fortitude that have persisted through the years – never more than after last month’s shock defeat by Stan Wawrinka in the French Open final – would have redoubled.</p> \n<p>Instead Djokovic proved that when he is at his best, there is simply no stopping him. He crunched 46 winners and committed just 16 unforced errors, pounding groundstrokes with metronomic efficiency that pinned Federer to the worn-out baselines through exhausting rallies, punctuating points with winners into the corners and grace notes of deft net play.</p> \n<p>Federer’s only choice was to counter Djokovic’s artillery – weapons-grade forehand, stout defence, superior endurance in the baseline rallies – with variety. The seven-times Wimbledon champion tried it all – varying topspin and slice within the points, blending serve-and-volley with traditional baseline exchanges – with the improvisational flair of a chess grandmaster.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457476148__\n</div> \n<p>The sentimental favourite was never in question despite conditions that fluctuated wildly. The crowd rallied behind the Swiss when he fell behind in his service games and buzzed in anticipation when he staked even the slightest foothold in Djokovic’s. The roar of 15,000 fans exploded when he saved seven set points in a second-set tiebreaker to avoid going two sets down. When he was broken at 2-2 in the fourth set – a sequence that ultimately decided that match – a subdued hush fell over Centre Court as ominous as the grey sky above. Djokovic does not want to be the cowboy in the black hat, but he showed that he will if he must.</p> \n<p>“I expected that coming into the match,” Djokovic said. “I think it’s normal because Roger is a champion on and off the court. He’s a very likeable guy. He’s somebody that’s played on this level for so many years. Not judging by the results, but his character, his personality. He’s done all the right things to get that support. More or less anywhere I play against Roger it’s the same. I have to accept it, and I have to work to earn that support. One day.”</p> \n<p>Whatever doubts lingered over Djokovic’s nerve, it was Federer who looked anxious during the decisive games of the fourth set with a series of uncharacteristic errors while the world No1 rolled through his service games, at one point winning 11 straight points on his serve after holding from 30-0 down in the opening game. When Federer led 30-0 with Djokovic serving at 4-3, the champion piped in a pair of 121mph aces, then closed out the game with a service winner – and one hand on the trophy.</p> \n<p>Posterity may read it as the scalp of a lion in winter, Djokovic bagging a second straight Wimbledon title at the expense of a 33-year-old father of four. But make no mistake, this was vintage-era Federer: the balletic footwork, liquid-whip forehand, effortless serve all working in concert.</p> \n<p>While his stamina has fallen off marginally from his stratospheric peak – as an average first-serve speed that faded over the course of the match would suggest – the legitimate world No2 showed well in his record 10th final at the All England Club. Just not well enough to defeat an opponent who at the moment holds the entire tour in his thrall.</p> \n<p>At 28, Djokovic’s move from the fringe toward the forefront of the debate over who is the greatest ever seems only a matter of time. Who on the horizon stands in his way? Andy Murray, two major titles in hand, is no doubt a worthy rival. But he has won just eight of their 27 meetings, including losing eight in a row since the Scot’s epochal win in the 2013 Wimbledon final.</p> \n<p>Djokovic has performed just as well or better against the next wave – Grigor Dimitrov (five wins, one loss), Kei Nishikori (5-2), Milos Raonic (5-0) – and has yet to lose to the surprise US Open champion Marin Cilic in 13 attempts. Should he remain injury-free, there is no reason he cannot make a serious run at catching up all before him on the all-time major leaderboard: Federer (17), Rafael Nadal (14), Pete Sampras (14), Roy Emerson (12), Rod Laver (11), Bjorn Borg (11) and Bill Tilden (10).</p> \n<p>“I’m 28,” he said. “I feel good. I don’t feel old. I have hopefully many more years in front of me. I’m going to try to push my own limits and see how far I can go really with titles and with myself playing on this high level.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436774033532/21a61bd1-19a5-49c6-82cd-39a172b4230a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom Jenkins for the Guardian","altText":"Novak Djokovic kisses the trophy after his victory over Roger Federer.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-13T07:00:14Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T07:54:23Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":16,"contributors":[{"name":"Bryan Armen Graham","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/bryan-armen-graham"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Novak Djokovic","Wimbledon 2015","Roger Federer","Tennis","Wimbledon","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/novak-djokovic","webTitle":"Novak Djokovic"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/roger-federer","webTitle":"Roger Federer"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Bryan Armen Graham","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/bryan-armen-graham"}}],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-457476148","source":"SNTV","durationInSeconds":54,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/13/150713Wimbledon_FromGAus-16x9.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/13/150713Wimbledon_FromGAus/150713Wimbledon_FromGAus.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436749923453/novak-djokovic-001.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":640,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Reaction after Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer to win te men's singles final at Wimbledon on Sunday. 13 July 2015 Photograph: SNTV","credit":"SNTV","altText":"novak djokovic","cleanCaption":"Reaction after Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer to win te men's singles final at Wimbledon on Sunday. 13 July 2015 Photograph: SNTV"}}],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/12/wimbledon-novak-djokovic-roger-federer-mens-singles-final","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4atbp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jul/12/wimbledon-novak-djokovic-roger-federer-mens-singles-final","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/12/wimbledon-novak-djokovic-roger-federer-mens-singles-final"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436774033532/21a61bd1-19a5-49c6-82cd-39a172b4230a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Novak Djokovic kisses the trophy after his victory over Roger Federer.

The bowling was wayward, Brad Haddin was being forced to fling his ageing body this way and that, fielders were chugging after the ball and the captain started to look bereft of ideas. They looked diminished in stature, the mystique gone. In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy discovers that the wizard is in fact nothing more than a middle-aged man. It might stand as a metaphor for these wizards in the first game.</p> \n<p>Whatever happens from here England – brain, heart and courage intact – know there is nothing to fear. Australia have won one match, at Headingley in 2009, and lost eight of their past 15 in England and Wales. Cricket Australia’s immediate response was to put its fingers in its ears, go ‘nah nah nah’ and announce the dates of this year’s Big Bash in time for its morning bulletins.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457473252__\n</div> \n<p>Australia were outplayed in every department of the game. They attempted to match the panache of Root, Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali with the bat but foundered against skilled bowling that adhered rigidly to a game plan for each batsman – across the dangerous David Warner, fifth stump to Steve Smith and Michael Clarke, inevitably straight to Shane Watson, all to a length that encouraged the drive but made it a real risk-reward shot. Australia’s bowling was wholehearted but could not come to terms with the conditions or the Duke ball (which incidentally they had been using in the West Indies prior to coming to England).</p> \n<p>In the field England were athletic and sharp, the single chance missed that from Chris Rogers by Root on the final morning. There was a willingness to stand closer on a slower pitch, something that they had not done in West Indies or against New Zealand. During their pre-series Spanish get-together, the team had practised nothing but fielding, which has always been a focal point of the Trevor Bayliss creed, and it showed.</p> \n<p>Australia, too, held some excellent catches but they were also pedestrian at times, age showing its hand. Haddin’s dropping of Root before he had scored in the first innings will be right up there with Shane Warne missing Kevin Pietersen at The Oval in 2005, Michael Carberry dropping Haddin in Adelaide two winters ago and Ashley Giles dropping Ricky Ponting on the same ground in 2006-07 in the litany of expensive missed Ashes chances.</p> \n<p>Most telling of all was the manner in which Clarke was out-captained by Alastair Cook. It is, as Cook readily admits, pretty easy to captain a group of bowlers who know their roles to perfection and perform beautifully: they know what they want and the captain responds to that. But knowing when to ring the changes is something else altogether. Cook was proactive and obviously in charge, which has not always been the case. The decision to bowl Stuart Broad on the third morning, for example, despite the proximity of the second new ball would have been a combined management decision but not the instinct that gave Moeen the last over before lunch on the final day in which he claimed Warner’s wicket and kick-started the Australian slide to defeat. Clarke’s bowlers let him down but he appeared to do little to lift them and towards the end of the second England innings looked devoid of ideas, standing aloof, arms folded. With his form a worry along with his back he was exposed as much as anyone in this match.</p> \n<p>There is precious little time for Australia to regroup, with the second Test starting at Lord’s on Thursday, and they will find England no more accommodating than they were at Cardiff. The idea that visiting teams gain more inspiration from playing at the ground than England do is risible, a myth. Indeed England’s record there since Australia won the first Test of the 2005 series shows that of 19 matches they have lost only to South Africa and, last year, India with nine of the past 13 games won.</p> \n<p>Unsurprisingly England have named the same squad of 13 players and will no doubt play the same XI, the only debate being perhaps whether Ian Bell and Gary Ballance might swap places in the order if only to break up the sequence of left-handers.</p> \n<p>For Australia questions abound. Before the series started it looked, as with England in Australia last time, that they were trying to squeeze one last series out of a flagging unit. Already Ryan Harris has gone and there are concerns about Watson and Haddin. There also remains a question mark over the fitness of Mitchell Starc, although they seem confident enough that his ankle problem will improve sufficiently in time for the match. A guess would be that Mitchell Marsh will replace Watson, whose value as an all-rounder is diminished if he does not bowl more than a few overs, but that Haddin will retain his place for now. Yet making changes would be an early and uncharacteristic admission that they got things wrong.</p> \n<p>There is work to do for the Australian bowlers, however. Although rather too much is made of it, Lord’s is still a demanding place to bowl, with its vagaries of slope and consequent geometry. Some of the bowling angles will not come naturally to those who have not experienced it and for some reason left-armers appear to have more trouble than their counterparts although there is no obvious reason why this should be. None of Starc, Josh Hazlewood or the spinner Nathan Lyon has played at Lord’s. On the other hand Mitchell Johnson has and it has not been pretty, with four wickets in two Tests, against England in 2009 and Pakistan the following year, for an average of 76 and an economy rate of almost five runs per over. He has sharpened up his technique since those days but the thought will still linger, particularly after a modest first Test in Cardiff. Australia need to get some control from somewhere and Peter Siddle cannot be there just for the ride.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436720071467/England-v-Australia-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England will stick with the same team that played in Cardiff but Australia may look at some changes, especially in their bowling attack, for the Lord's Test.

Yet one thing was missing amid the exhilaration and joy at England’s win: the wider audience the contest deserved.</p> \n<p>Sky Sports guards its viewing figures closely, but I have discovered that Saturday’s enthralling final day had a TV audience of 467,000. To put that into context, a 1974 Columbo film – shown on ITV3 at the same time as Joe Root took the winning catch – attracted just under 400,000 viewers. Friday’s Sky ratings were lower still, with only 340,000 watching.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/12/australia-dads-army-darren-lehmann-england-ashes\">Australia’s Dad’s Army under fire but Darren Lehmann says don’t panic | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>You could argue the Wimbledon ladies’ final dented those numbers, and possibly the fine weather too. Perhaps, but it doesn’t alter the broader point. Cricket in England is viewed on TV by less eyeballs than it once was. Remember the light-headedness after England went mano a mano against New Zealand on a staggering, swaggering final day of their first Test in May? Some even talked of it revitalising Test cricket. But Sky’s audience was 577,000 – fewer than the one-sided Championship play-off final between Norwich City and Middlesbrough which attracted 757,000 viewers. Given that about a million tuned in to Channel 5’s Ashes highlights, there is still an audience for Test cricket. But it appears to be declining.</p> \n<p>Babatunde Buraimo, a senior lecturer of sports management at Liverpool University, says the average Channel 4 ratings for live coverage of the Ashes in 2001 was 1.11m. In 2005 that rose to 2.5m, with an astonishing 8.4m people transfixed by the climax of the fourth Test. Cricket really did grip the nation: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2005/aug/30/ashes2005.broadcasting\" title=\"\">at one point 48.4% of those watching TV were watching the Ashes</a>.</p> \n<p>We know what happened next. Home Tests moved to Sky. And while the England and Wales Cricket Board swelled its coffers, viewing figures tumbled. That was not surprising – in 2005 all cricket’s planets aligned. A year later you could have put Test matches on prime time BBC1 hosted by Ant and Dec, with national lottery numbers drawn during tea, and ratings would probably have suffered an Ashes hangover.</p> \n<p>Even so, while the data is incomplete – Buraimo does not have all the figures for the 2009 and 2013 Ashes series because Sky do not make them public – there is a worrying pattern based on Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (Barb) numbers.</p> \n<p>In 2009 there were 14 occasions on which Sky’s live Ashes coverage made the top 30 weekly ratings for non-terrestrial stations. The figures, of between 670,000 and 1.1m viewers, were healthy too. Yet in 2013 only two sessions attracted more than 650,000 viewers and made Barb’s top 30. We may only have had one Test, but the 2015 series is not bucking the trend. That is not a reflection of Sky’s excellent coverage, rather simple economics – more people watch stuff when it is free – and the slow unshackling of the public’s devotion to the sport.</p> \n<p>It is hardly encouraging either that fewer adults also appear to be playing cricket. The first Sport England Active People survey, conducted between October 2006 and October 2007, found 380,000 people aged 16 or over played at least once a month during the season. In the most recent survey, published last month, that figure had fallen to 259,200 – a decline of 32%. Other team sports’ participation levels are declining too, including football and rugby union, <a href=\"http://www.sportengland.org/research/who-plays-sport/by-sport/\" title=\"\">but cricket’s have fallen harder</a>.</p> \n<p>So what can be done? To some there is a simple answer. Move the clock back to when home Tests had to be shown on terrestrial TV. I am not so sure. Would the BBC, ITV or Channel 4 really free up their daytime schedules for cricket on 35 days each summer? Sky’s deal is also worth &pound;65m a year to the ECB. Lose a significant chunk of that and the sport would suffer.</p> \n<p>But wider exposure is critical. How many of us over the past 50 years have become fans by osmosis, watching Test matches on television because there was little else to do during the summer holidays, before becoming drawn in by its nuances and peculiarities? And while the ECB argues that organisations such as Chance to Shine attract youngsters in different ways by running taster sessions in primary schools, if kids don’t know Joe Root from Joe Bloggs then the chances of them persevering with the sport are surely less.</p> \n<p>So something needs to happen. And the questions the ECB should be asking are not difficult ones. What works? What doesn’t? Do young people really identify with county sides in the 21st century? And can the ECB strike TV deals that enable more people to watch cricket without a slump in its revenues?</p> \n<p>It is surely not beyond the ECB’s wit to devise a domestic Twenty20 tournament with more glamour and spice. Why not borrow some of the tricks of Australia’s Big Bash, and show one game a night only split between BBC and Sky? Why not find a way to include England’s players and the world’s best stars – you know, the players fans actually want to watch – even if it means blocking off the calendar for three weeks so that no England matches are played during that time? It’s radical, yes, but the status quo is hardly working.</p> \n<p>As things stand English cricket is in danger of becoming a sporting version of the Church of England, with an ageing demographic who attend because they always attend, and believe because they have always believed. Meanwhile younger generations will barely notice its slow and graceful slide into irrelevance.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436774820945/cad0d1ae-eb2e-4a5b-b712-5c62372f6884-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Robin Hursthouse","altText":"Cricket viewing figures in decline since coverage moved to Sky and participation also dropped.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Robin Hursthouse"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-12T18:38:07Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T08:07:05Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":189,"contributors":[{"name":"Sean Ingle","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733748340/SeanIngle.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/seaningle"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Ashes 2015","The Ashes","England cricket team","Australia cricket team","Cricket","Sport","ECB","Media"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/ashes-2015","webTitle":"Ashes 2015"},{"id":"sport/ashes","webTitle":"The Ashes"},{"id":"sport/england-cricket-team","webTitle":"England cricket team"},{"id":"sport/australia-cricket-team","webTitle":"Australia cricket team"},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/ecb","webTitle":"ECB"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sean Ingle","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/seaningle"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/12/ashes-sky-england-australia-ecb-tv","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4atah","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jul/12/ashes-sky-england-australia-ecb-tv","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/12/ashes-sky-england-australia-ecb-tv"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436774820945/cad0d1ae-eb2e-4a5b-b712-5c62372f6884-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Cricket viewing figures in decline since coverage moved to Sky and participation also dropped.

It was not to be: on the race’s first rest day Froome remains 12 seconds clear of the American. Crucially Froome also put further time into his fellow Fab Four members Vincenzo Nibali, Alberto Contador and Nairo Quintana.</p> \n<p>“Those guys have that tag, the Fab Four, which is getting a little irritating hearing that,” said Van Garderen, the disgruntled fifth Beatle.</p> \n<p>“I’m not offended not to be named in that. All those guys in the Fab Four have won Grand Tours. I’ve had a couple of good top fives in the Tour but I’m yet to finish on the podium or win one.”</p> \n<p>Team time trials are usually held on stage four or five of Grand Tours; UCI rules decree they “shall take place during the first third of the race” in order to give teams as fair a chance as possible of fielding a full-strength line-up in a discipline where the time of the fifth man to cross the finishing line is the one recorded.</p> \n<p>Including rest days this year’s Tour de France is already nine days into a total of 23, on the ninth stage of 21 in an event where 40% of the total distance has already been completed. No matter which way you look at it this was a clear case of world cycling’s governing body ignoring its own guidelines.</p> \n<p>Orica GreenEdge suffered most from the anomalous scheduling having lost Michael Albasini, Simon Gerrans and Daryl Impey to injury in the opening week while their Tour debutant, Michael Matthews, struggles on with damaged ribs that continue to restrict his ability to breathe. He was nursed through this stage by his remaining team-mates without having to do a tow in front.</p> \n<p>Truth be told, the Australian team had no complaints about misfortune for which little or no legislation could realistically have been made. They lost a third of their team to a crash that took place on stage three and treated a time trial they originally had high hopes of winning like a Sunday afternoon countryside spin, finishing just shy of five minutes behind the winners.</p> \n<p>Of the big-budget big-hitters Nibali’s Astana team were first out and set an early clubhouse lead of 32min 30sec that was quickly beaten by Quintana’s Movistar outfit, who finished 11 seconds faster. All eyes promptly turned to Tinkoff Saxo, BMC and Sky, the teams of Contador,&nbsp;Van Garderen and Froome respectively, who were last out on the road in that order.</p> \n<p>On a course that finished with a tough climb up the 1.7km C&ocirc;te de Cadoudal, Contador came off worst of the trio; his Tinkoff-Saxo team finished 28 seconds behind the eventual winners. BMC posted a time of 32min 15sec, which Sky only just failed to match.</p> \n<p>With Froome, Geraint Thomas, Leopold K&ouml;nig, Richie Porte, Wouter Poels and Roche tasked with closing out the stage after Peter Kennaugh, Ian Stannard and Luke Rowe had exhausted themselves on the flat, Poels hoisted the white flag at the bottom of the ascent and, of the remaining quintet, Roche was found ever so slightly wanting in the closing metres.</p> \n<p>“We really can’t be too disappointed with that,” said Froome. “For everyone’s morale it would’ve been fantastic to have been able to get the stage win today, but more importantly we’ve kept the yellow jersey, we’ve put time into most of our rivals. We’ve got to be happy with that.</p> \n<p>“It’s one thing not to lose any time to your rivals, but to actually gain quite substantial amounts on quite a lot of contenders – it’s put us in a fantastic position. Some other rivals – Nibali, Quintana – they’ve both lost quite a substantial amount of time already so the pressure’s definitely on them to attack once we go into the mountains,” said Froome. “It’s for the other guys to get the yellow jersey from me now.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/21114be05d50d2a25618e68b408069048bf63be4/0_0_2200_1320/2200.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1320,"width":2200,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Riders of the Great Britain's Sky cycling team, including Great Britain's Christopher Froome (L), wearing the overall leader's yellow jersey, compete in the 28 km team time-trial, the ninth stage of the 102nd edition of the Tour de France cycling race on July 12, 2015, between Vannes and Plumelec, western France.

He’ll never win another grand slam. He’s an irrelevance at the highest level these days. It’s getting hard to watch. It’s becoming <em>embarrassing</em>. You’re beginning to feel sorry for him. What is he getting out of it? Where’s the dignity? He’s got nothing left to prove. He’s only won one slam since 2010. Isn’t he time he packed it in? Isn’t it time he retired? For crying out loud, he’s losing to Sergiy Stakhovsky. How much longer can this go on before he calls it a day? He’d be doing himself a favour.</p> \n<p><strong>We should have known better.</strong> At the age of 33, a few weeks shy of his 34th birthday, Roger Federer is in the form of his life. Which is saying something. Is it better than his 03-07 peak? It’s a big call. But his performance against Andy Murray on Friday will be remembered as one of his greatest. It was made more special by the fact that Murray didn’t even play badly, rather he was unfortunate enough to come up against a man who was at the very height of his genius, a place where most people need an oxygen mask just to breathe, but where Federer glides on unhindered, zapping forehands away, making your heart melt, your knees go weak, your mouth make that weird gurgling noise, your face go all gooey-eyed. It’s okay. We’ve all been there. “When people can talk about someone like Messi, people love the way he plays the game,” Murray sayid. “He makes it look easy. It stands out more, too.”<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Federer is Messi, Messi is Federer.</strong> When Messi ripped the rug from underneath Jerome Boateng’s feet back in May, before scooping the ball over Jerome Boateng, it could have been Federer running around a forehand, or pulling off that tweener lob against Sam Querrey, or defying physics, geometry and the sheer limitations of the human body and mind with that astonishing flicked top-spin backhand winner in the final game against Murray. </p> \n<p><strong>He has been building towards this day. </strong>If everything goes to plan, Federer will have his 18th slam and he will finally have moved ahead of Pete Sampras by winning his eighth Wimbledon, 12 years after he won his first by beating Mark Phillipousis in a one-sided final, 14 years after he introduced himself to Centre Court by stunning his hero Sampras in the fourth-round. That dreadful ponytail is no more, replaced by a decidedly more stylish cut, but his love for the sport - and winning - remains as strong as ever.</p> \n<p><strong>Standing in Federer’s way, however, is the world No1 and Novak Djokovic gives up nothing easily. </strong>Yes, it’s probably about time he got a mention. He is the defending champion, after all, the world’s best player, a technician and a fighter and a runner all in one. As ever, he has maybe not been at his best over the past fortnight, a hangover, perhaps, from his defeat to Stan Wawrinka in the final of the French Open. That was a hard one to take. With Rafa Nadal out of the way, it was supposed to be a case of the king of clay is dead, long live the new king of clay, but Wawrinka had other ideas, and dreams of a calendar slam died. </p> \n<p><strong>And so Djokovic arrived in SW19 looking a little vulnerable, the scars from Wawrinka’s backhand still visible. </strong>A few drops of blood have been spilt on his way to the final. Djokovic was almost a goner in the fourth round, when he trailed by two sets to the big-serving Kevin Anderson. But he fought. Of course he fought. He knows no other way. He won and subsequent matches against Marin Cilic and Richard Gasquet didn’t cause him much bother. The defending champion wants to emulate his coach, Boris Becker, by winning his third Wimbledon title (apropos of nothing, and make of this what you will, it’s 25 years since Becker lost a five-set final here to Federer’s coach, Stefan Edberg).</p> \n<p><strong>Last year, Djokovic beat Federer in five sets in an astonishing final. </strong>He starts as the slight favourite to do so again. Although Federer leads their head-to-head record 20-19, Djokovic is closing in and there are few weaknesses to his game. Yet Federer has been imperious and his serving has been god-like throughout the tournament. Murray, the second-best returner in the game behind Djokovic, had one break point against Federer, who has only been broken once, by Gilles Simon in his quarter-final. He has won 85% of his first serves and that is a crucial statistic: Federer has won eight out of eight matches against Djokovic every time the points won on his first serve has been 79% and above.</p> \n<p><strong>Federer has been showing us the difference between big serving and great serving.</strong> He has been hitting his spots, mixing it up, using variety to keep his opponents guessing. Murray had no riposte. Now it’s up to Djokovic to come up with a solution. If he can, and his returning game is slightly superior to Murray’s, he’ll have a great chance of winning, because his own serve is not as easy to attack as Murray’s can be at times. </p> \n<p><strong>And finally, in the great British tradition, the weather could be a factor. </strong>If the forecast is right and it rains all afternoon, then the roof will be on - just as it was when Federer beat Djokovic in four sets in their semi-final here in 2012, the last time he won a slam. Time for a Swiss rain dance?</p> \n<p><strong>Play begins at:</strong> 2pm.</p>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-55a25322e4b05111b7559ba3","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-12T11:45:00Z","body":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c95724c99c3af1923248a27347335cf5c6dd585d\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c95724c99c3af1923248a27347335cf5c6dd585d/0_0_3500_2462/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The action start’s soon!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The action start’s soon!</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Davy/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-55a256eae4b07fc6a121fb87","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-12T12:01:44Z","body":"<p><strong>It’s not raining in SW19 yet, but it’s grey and cloudy out there. </strong>Amusingly plenty of punters are dressed for summer.

He’ll never win another grand slam. He’s an irrelevance at the highest level these days. It’s getting hard to watch. It’s becoming <em>embarrassing</em>. You’re beginning to feel sorry for him. What is he getting out of it? Where’s the dignity? He’s got nothing left to prove. He’s only won one slam since 2010. Isn’t he time he packed it in? Isn’t it time he retired? For crying out loud, he’s losing to Sergiy Stakhovsky. How much longer can this go on before he calls it a day? He’d be doing himself a favour.</p> \n<p><strong>We should have known better.</strong> At the age of 33, a few weeks shy of his 34th birthday, Roger Federer is in the form of his life. Which is saying something. Is it better than his 03-07 peak? It’s a big call. But his performance against Andy Murray on Friday will be remembered as one of his greatest. It was made more special by the fact that Murray didn’t even play badly, rather he was unfortunate enough to come up against a man who was at the very height of his genius, a place where most people need an oxygen mask just to breathe, but where Federer glides on unhindered, zapping forehands away, making your heart melt, your knees go weak, your mouth make that weird gurgling noise, your face go all gooey-eyed. It’s okay. We’ve all been there. “When people can talk about someone like Messi, people love the way he plays the game,” Murray sayid. “He makes it look easy. It stands out more, too.”<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Federer is Messi, Messi is Federer.</strong> When Messi ripped the rug from underneath Jerome Boateng’s feet back in May, before scooping the ball over Jerome Boateng, it could have been Federer running around a forehand, or pulling off that tweener lob against Sam Querrey, or defying physics, geometry and the sheer limitations of the human body and mind with that astonishing flicked top-spin backhand winner in the final game against Murray. </p> \n<p><strong>He has been building towards this day. </strong>If everything goes to plan, Federer will have his 18th slam and he will finally have moved ahead of Pete Sampras by winning his eighth Wimbledon, 12 years after he won his first by beating Mark Phillipousis in a one-sided final, 14 years after he introduced himself to Centre Court by stunning his hero Sampras in the fourth-round. That dreadful ponytail is no more, replaced by a decidedly more stylish cut, but his love for the sport - and winning - remains as strong as ever.</p> \n<p><strong>Standing in Federer’s way, however, is the world No1 and Novak Djokovic gives up nothing easily. </strong>Yes, it’s probably about time he got a mention. He is the defending champion, after all, the world’s best player, a technician and a fighter and a runner all in one. As ever, he has maybe not been at his best over the past fortnight, a hangover, perhaps, from his defeat to Stan Wawrinka in the final of the French Open. That was a hard one to take. With Rafa Nadal out of the way, it was supposed to be a case of the king of clay is dead, long live the new king of clay, but Wawrinka had other ideas, and dreams of a calendar slam died. </p> \n<p><strong>And so Djokovic arrived in SW19 looking a little vulnerable, the scars from Wawrinka’s backhand still visible. </strong>A few drops of blood have been spilt on his way to the final. Djokovic was almost a goner in the fourth round, when he trailed by two sets to the big-serving Kevin Anderson. But he fought. Of course he fought. He knows no other way. He won and subsequent matches against Marin Cilic and Richard Gasquet didn’t cause him much bother. The defending champion wants to emulate his coach, Boris Becker, by winning his third Wimbledon title (apropos of nothing, and make of this what you will, it’s 25 years since Becker lost a five-set final here to Federer’s coach, Stefan Edberg).</p> \n<p><strong>Last year, Djokovic beat Federer in five sets in an astonishing final. </strong>He starts as the slight favourite to do so again. Although Federer leads their head-to-head record 20-19, Djokovic is closing in and there are few weaknesses to his game. Yet Federer has been imperious and his serving has been god-like throughout the tournament. Murray, the second-best returner in the game behind Djokovic, had one break point against Federer, who has only been broken once, by Gilles Simon in his quarter-final. He has won 85% of his first serves and that is a crucial statistic: Federer has won eight out of eight matches against Djokovic every time the points won on his first serve has been 79% and above.</p> \n<p><strong>Federer has been showing us the difference between big serving and great serving.</strong> He has been hitting his spots, mixing it up, using variety to keep his opponents guessing. Murray had no riposte. Now it’s up to Djokovic to come up with a solution. If he can, and his returning game is slightly superior to Murray’s, he’ll have a great chance of winning, because his own serve is not as easy to attack as Murray’s can be at times. </p> \n<p><strong>And finally, in the great British tradition, the weather could be a factor. </strong>If the forecast is right and it rains all afternoon, then the roof will be on - just as it was when Federer beat Djokovic in four sets in their semi-final here in 2012, the last time he won a slam.

Then he sees a forehand called out, only for the umpire to overrule the line judge. Federer accepts it with good grace and he has to dust himself down quickly, because he’s down 0-30. It’s almost 0-40 but a Djokovic backhand clips the top of the net and sails wide. He makes up for it with a frighteningly good backhand return down the line to earn two championship points! This is it. Federer’s race is run. He’s out of fuel. Djokovic is all over him. He pounds Federer, forcing him back until he’s almost in the Royal Box. Federer leaves a ball short, Djokovic marches forward and you know what’s coming: a forehand into the left corner to seal his third Wimbledon title! He pumps his fists and roars! The crowd don’t exactly sound overjoyed, but what a performance from the world No1. There can be no debate about who rules the tennis world now.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3077a1c9300f51a50ab8c82f679fd31fabf4549b\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3077a1c9300f51a50ab8c82f679fd31fabf4549b/0_0_3424_1659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Novak Djokovic roars with triumph as he wins the Men’s Finals.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"485\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Novak Djokovic roars with triumph as he wins the Men’s Finals.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BPI/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","postType":"key-event"}],"paginationLinks":{}},"links":{"uri":"http://live-blogs.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/12/novak-djokovic-v-roger-federer-wimbledon-2015-mens-singles-final-live","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4at6c","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/live/2015/jul/12/novak-djokovic-v-roger-federer-wimbledon-2015-mens-singles-final-live","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2015/jul/12/novak-djokovic-v-roger-federer-wimbledon-2015-mens-singles-final-live"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/75c3220b720091c2422b3be0e2463bb7bf251c4b/0_72_3136_1881/3136.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1881,"width":3136,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Wimbledon: Novak Djokovic celebrates winning the title after beating Roger Federer.
