So I think maybe it’s time to just put it aside and not talk about it all the time because this is not what is important when there are two players on the Centre Court.

The 33-year-old claimed she was unfazed by the fuss, however, refusing to brand the crowd reaction any lack of respect.</p> \n<p>“It can be a little bit distracting sometimes, if you’re trying to listen to a line judge’s call or something,” said Williams. “It’s happened a few times, I’m kind of used to it.

Finishing on a team-mate’s bike after a puncture, his triumph means Thibaut Pinot takes over the mantle of unluckiest man in the race. The Frenchman had two punctures in as many minutes to become the only general classification contender to lose time – 3min 23sec – on a stage the peloton approached with extreme caution.</p> \n<p>In a fiendishly tricky opening week of a Tour that is beginning to look like it was mapped by scientists more accustomed to testing the intelligence of monkeys, seven teeth-loosening sectors of cobbles were the latest obstacle placed in front of the 191 remaining riders. On a dry day, most coped admirably and although Chris Froome lost the overall race lead to Martin, the Sky rider could see the positives of his team not having to defend it. “Hopefully the guys can have a bit of a rest over the next few days,” he said. “There’s a lot of racing to go and while Tony’s a good time-trialist, he won’t be up there with us when we go into the mountains.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f7caa7ac96d7215c0f246964e10b41ad34e723d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436296443864/2a94fe35-b2e2-45c5-868f-de4fd64b32da-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Martin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Martin of Etixx-QuickStep celebrates after a late dash earned him the stage win at Cambrai – and also put him in the overall lead.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Blondeau/Manuel Blondeau/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A surface for specialists and a staple of the Paris-Roubaix classic, the risk of disaster on the hellish <em>pav&eacute;</em> of the north is huge, with riders engaging in all manner of reckless tomfoolery in their efforts to get to the front of the bunch approaching each sector.</p> \n<p>With each uneven cobble or hole a potential puncture, buckled wheel or broken clavicle in waiting, tension is high and with crowds sometimes lining each side of what are ostensibly dusty country lanes, barrelling along in the comparative safety of the gutter is not really an option.

We can only surmise how the race could have unfolded if they had been given free rein, but Martin’s power as a time-trialist meant there was no catching him once he had leapt off the front of the leading bunch and zoomed off into the distance. He held on by three seconds, punching the air triumphantly at having ticked a long overdue box on his already impressive <em>palmar&egrave;s</em>.</p> \n<p>“Having a flat tyre and changing a bike [I thought I had no chance],” he said. “With five [kilometres to go], we were together. Nobody wanted to pull, so I decided to give it a try and go full gas ahead. Somehow I found some power. I don’t know what happened today. I was so nervous.

Having been taken to hospital after gingerly finishing a stage he almost certainly should have been forced to abandon on medical advice, Fabian Cancellara was, for the second time this year, found to have two broken lower vertebrae and forced to withdraw. If this was, as seems likely, his final Tour there is something poignantly foolhardy about a courageous veteran nicknamed “Spartacus” going out ashen-faced, bloodied and defiant while wearing the tattered and dirty <em>maillot jaune</em> of race leader.</p> \n<p>A day that promised so much chaos failed to deliver and thick dust rather than mud and its accompanying mayhem was the peloton’s chief tormenter. The ravenousness with which riders snatched proffered drinks on exiting each new purgatory and sent them towards open mouths was telling.</p> \n<p>In the early cobbled sectors Nibali and his team-mates briefly threatened but they were unable to shake off a chasing posse that would later blow an opportunity to drop Contador as they squabbled among themselves over who should make the pace.</p> \n<p>So after four stages, Martin is finally in yellow and seems likely to remain in it until Friday at least. After fascinating, tense and often fraught racing, stage five should be one for the sprinters to contest the first mass bunch finish as the Tour reaches the scene of one of the bloodiest battles in history and rolls into Amiens, the capital of the Somme.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/ng-interactive/2015/jul/01/tour-de-france-2015-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2015 – stage by stage</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/7/1436286068233/Tony-Martin-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tony Martin is ecstatic after winning the fourth stage of the Tour de France and winning the yellow jersey.

It had strong overtones of the manner in which Michael Vaughan’s team hit back at Edgbaston in the 2005 Ashes, in the aftermath of the heavy defeat in the first Test at Lord’s, and the message was clear. There is always talk of brave new worlds when it comes to the fortunes of England cricket but here was a side adding strong deeds to the rhetoric.</p> \n<p>The new head coach, Trevor Bayliss, enters an environment that is certainly different to that which he would have found a couple of months ago. The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/mar/14/england-world-cup-peter-moores\">wounds from the World Cup</a> and all that prefaced it (including the rescheduling of the previous Ashes series to accommodate a more thorough preparation period – that went well) were deep, the fallout had already started with the sacking of Paul Downton, and Peter Moores’ days were numbered no matter what happened on the Test tour of the Caribbean.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/alastair-cook-england-attack-minded-australia-ashes\">Ashes 2015: Alastair Cook promises more attack-minded England side</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It might have seemed a daunting challenge but Bayliss actually arrives with the foundations already laid by Paul Farbrace, who has done an outstanding job as interim coach. In this Bayliss is fortunate, for Farbrace has learned some of his trade with Bayliss and will almost certainly carry with him a similar ethos.</p> \n<p>One significant reason Farbrace got the job as understudy with the Sri Lanka team was that Bayliss saw in him a kindred spirit, who saw the game in simple terms, and with whom he could share a beer and just talk cricket. It may seem old fashioned but in such an environment are ideas and relationships forged. The success of the previous partnership will have formed part of the thinking of the director of cricket, Andrew Strauss, when he decided to approach Bayliss.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457425718__\n</div> \n<p>It will be a tough start, though, even if the teams are a lot closer in potential than many want to give credit. The Australia captain, Michael Clarke, freely admits that his team have not been the best of travellers, although they have just beaten West Indies comfortably enough.</p> \n<p>But conditions in England, and of course Wales, tend to be considerably different to those in Australia, where pitches generally are faster and bounce more. Cricket in this neck of the woods requires an adjustment in length for the pace bowlers, who must pitch the ball further up (not that easy to do when a default length is shorter), and batsmen who must learn to cope with lateral movement, and to play with softer hands at times. It is part of the reason that the Australians have not won, or even drawn, an Ashes series here since 2001.</p> \n<p>The use of the Dukes ball should be less of an issue given that West Indies use a specially manufactured version of it rather than the more familiar (to Australians) Kookaburra these days. There may be some senior England players who could bear scars from the mauling of the winter before last, but equally there are Australians – Clarke, Brad Haddin, Shane Watson – who have lost three and, in Clarke’s case, four Ashes series.</p> \n<p>If they can say that the knowledge of this only acts as a spur to do better next time, then the same can be said for Alastair Cook, Jimmy Anderson, Stuart Broad and Ian Bell.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/07/ashes-2015-mike-selvey-webchat-england-australia\">Ashes 2015: webchat with Mike Selvey</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Whether conditions in Cardiff will be conducive to providing some high-octane cricket is open to question. The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2013/may/02/20-great-ashes-moments-cardiff\">Ashes opener in 2009</a> was largely a turgid affair on a slow, unresponsive pitch, enlightened only by a dramatic final hour. There was little in it for pacemen, and while the Australian offspinner Nathan Hauritz did manage six wickets in the two England innings, Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar, playing together in anticipation of a turning pitch, managed combined figures of one for 246 in Australia’s only innings.</p> \n<p>The memory of that will surely be a factor when England come to select their final XI. Any grass this pitch had was removed on the eve of the game, probably more to the chagrin of Clarke than Cook, and it sounds as if it will end up as a sluggish, low surface that offers little to anyone. The low, slow part England will not mind but a little help laterally would not go amiss, even if the pitch itself does not prevent the ball from swinging.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/07/ashes-preparation-england-australia-first-test-jason-gillespie\">Ashes preparation is ending, time for the main event: England v Australia | Jason Gillespie</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The only debate the England selectors will have had would have concerned the inclusion of Adil Rashid as a second spinner, probably in place of Mark Wood rather than a batsman.</p> \n<p>There has been a groundswell of opinion which urges the promotion of Rashid but it seems to be based largely on his bowling in the recent one-day series against New Zealand. There is, though, a considerable difference between bowling with fielders out, to batsmen with a time constraint, and to Test players who are able to play the ball on merit and wait for the inevitable bad delivery. Cook would not be able to trust Rashid to do the necessary stock job that a spinner must do when there is no help and the seamers need a break. Moeen Ali, however, does need to rediscover the consistency that brought his success against India last summer.</p> \n<p>So unless the pitch suddenly looks as if it will transform into a big turner, Wood will have an important part to play, with his skiddy pace and potential for reverse swing. England are likely to remain unchanged from their previous Test.</p> \n<p>Australia, too, should be unchanged from their success in Jamaica, particularly now that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/ryan-harris-australia-cricket-retirement-knee-injury-ashes\">Ryan Harris is out of the equation</a>. There has been debate as to whether Mitchell Marsh could replace Watson, but the feeling is that the senior player will be chosen.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436287328040/Mitchell-Johnson-in-nets--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mitchell Johnson, in action during a net practice at Cardiff, will pose a severe threat to England't top order.

Apart from that passing concern, all is serenity and confidence in a camp that was in a state of flux this time 12 months ago.</p> \n<p>Mauresmo and Murray could hardly be getting on better after a year together. Heavily pregnant and due to return to Paris after these championships, she will leave Murray in the care of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/jonas-bjorkman-andy-murray-coach-wimbledon-2015\" title=\"\">Jonas Bjorkman for the rest of the season</a> and, almost certainly, the Australian Open in January. But she sees no cause for concern. “A lot of things [are better than last year]. For him, on the court, feeling fit and thanks to the medical part of the team, the teamwork has been going well,” Mauresmo said. “When you feel strong physically on court then you are capable of using all your tools out there. For a guy like Andy it makes a big difference. I like the relationship that we have. I would not have stayed around if the human part of the relationship wasn’t going to be good. I would also not stay around if the results were not good or if he wasn’t happy with that.”</p> \n<p>She added: “I’m happy because he is such a hard worker. Since we met again in December in Miami, he has put in so much effort in his daily practice, recovery, food, whatever you can think of. He’s a great guy to work with.”</p> \n<p>It was during that training block that Mauresmo experienced her first bouts of morning sickness. “December and January were a bit tough for me, let’s put it that way,” she said. “I don’t think he [Murray] noticed anything. You feel more tired, definitely, but it was a big challenge. Dani [Vallverdu, his long-time assistant, who is now with Tomas Berdych] had left the team and it was just me. We had not yet found someone to share the time, so basically you have no choice. I hit with him at the French Open a little bit.”</p> \n<p>So, what of the pressure of motherhood, her commitment to Murray and the travelling involved? “It’s too hard for me to say now. There are too many unknowns. I’m taking it as it comes and I’ll know more in a few months. I don’t know what to tell you.”</p> \n<p>She is certain, though, of Murray’s preparedness for the remaining matches of Wimbledon, secured in the most trying of circumstances in his four-set victory over the 6ft 11in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/andy-murray-wimbledon-2015-ivo-karlovic\" title=\"\">Croat Ivo Karlovic on Monday</a>. “I think he did great. He handled many different moments in the match in a very good way,” she said. “The focus and the concentration that you need to have against this guy are very high and he did that very well. Also the physical intensity was great.”</p> \n<p>And what of Pospisil, who comes to the match after three five-setters in a row, as well as a doubles match against Andy’s brother, Jamie, that ended in defeat after three hours and 19 minutes? “Although it’s the first time for him at this level of a tournament, I think he’s going to go out there and have nothing to lose and just go for his shots. He’s a big guy, he can release big shots on the serve and on the forehand. He can come forward as well, good at the net. He’s a pretty consistent overall player. This one needs to be taken very seriously.”</p> \n<p>Of Murray’s many fine qualities, the one to shine through here has been his versatility in dealing with four opponents of vastly contrasting styles. Mauresmo recognises that strength and says she, Murray and Bjorkman combine in working out a strategy for each occasion: “Andy has pretty much everything in his game. As coaches, that’s pretty nice. It’s a privilege.”</p> \n<p>When the last ball is struck, she will go home to Paris and Murray will take the short drive back to Oxshott. “He’s at home and after the job is done we all go our separate ways. Which is what he did all the time with Ivan [Lendl], including tournaments other than here,” Mauresmo said. “We are spending more time together and that’s the nice part.”</p> \n<p>How times change: Dimitrov, who lost here to Richard Gasquet on Saturday, has announced he is parting company with his coach, Roger Rasheed.

She won 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 – her 17th victory over the Belarusian in 20 matches – under skies as gloomy as her prospects were until after an hour of the most intense struggle had passed on Centre Court, but the title looks hers to lose.</p> \n<p>Every time she has reached the quarter-final since failing to do so in Melbourne two years ago, she has gone on to win the big prize – at Roland Garros and Flushing Meadows in 2013, again in New York last year, followed by Melbourne and Paris again this year. That screams determination.</p> \n<p>If Williams does win her sixth Wimbledon title and defends her home championship in September, she will be the first player to do the calendar slam since Steffi Graf in 1988. That would move her level with the German on 22 majors for the Open era record, with surely a year at least in which to add to her collection, time enough probably to pass Margaret Court’s all-time tally of 24.</p> \n<p>All of that is very much for the future. Williams has to beat Maria Sharapova in the semi-final to reach the final on Saturday and although she holds a 17-2 advantage over the Russian, she takes nothing for granted.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/serena-williams-caroline-wozniacki-sexist-scheduling\">Serena Williams backs Caroline Wozniacki over ‘sexist scheduling’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Maria’s been playing really well,” Williams said. “It’s always good to see her doing well.” Sure it is.</p> \n<p>More believable were her quick reflections on the quarter-final: “It was really fun out there. I found myself smiling at one point, and Vika smiling too. It’s been an up-and-down tournament. Somehow I’m still alive.”</p> \n<p>She went on to back Caroline Wozniacki’s calls for the women’s game to be given equal treatment on the show courts. “We’re still fighting on that,” Williams said. “We’ve made some progress but hopefully we’ll keep making more progress. I don’t think it’s limited to Wimbledon. We have this problem at a lot of different tournaments.”</p> \n<p>Azarenka was also keen to talk about sexism, but reserved her criticism for the Centre Court crowd’s audible laughter during the match. “It’s so annoying because guys grunt,” said Azarenka. “I was practising next to [Rafa] Nadal, and he grunts louder than me, and nobody notices that. Why?</p> \n<p>“Both women on the court were trying their hardest and giving everything, and they make noises. Is that a problem for tennis? It happens in every sport.</p> \n<p>“So I think maybe it’s time to just put it aside and not talk about it all the time because this is not what is important when there are two players on the Centre Court.</p> \n<p>“We’ve got to look a little bit past that and see: ‘Oh, my God, Serena played 24 aces.’ Look at the good stuff, stop bringing this ridiculous stuff.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/07/serena-williams-victoria-azarenka-wimbledon-2015-live\">Serena Williams v Victoria Azarenka: Wimbledon 2015 – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And the level here was extraordinarily high for the two hours and three minutes the match lasted although there was an inevitability about the result once they entered the concluding stages.</p> \n<p>It said much about their relationship that Sascha Bajin, Williams’s hitting partner and confidant for eight years, could defect to join Azarenka and the move not generate a whit of unpleasantness. On court it was all business between two rivals who are also good friends.</p> \n<p>Azarenka, who had not dropped a set in these championships, also knew she has never won against Williams on grass. So something had to give and two double-faults in the first game of the match gave the American the earliest possible opportunity to break. She battled through deuce twice to hold. And they scrapped from there pretty much to the final bell.</p> \n<p>At 5.10pm, Serena faced that novel experience: dropping a set to Azarenka on a surface she has come to dominate like no other player of her era. She was two break points down at 2-5, so she found a couple of big serves, a thrashing backhand down the line and got to deuce. Despite a double-fault, she got there. Even when her game is malfunctioning, she is still too good for everyone else.</p> \n<p>At 5.15pm Azarenka had set point and with a final swish of her backhand, she did it. The improbable had become a reality and now all sorts of possibilities opened up. Would breaking that spell liberate her or inspire the feared backlash across the net?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/victoria-azarenka-crowd-laughing-grunting-serena-williams-wimbledon\">Victoria Azarenka hits out at crowd for laughing at grunting in Williams match</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Retaliation started with three Serena aces and a hold to love. However, after exactly an hour and four games into the second set, there was nothing between them and while Azarenka had that first-set cushion to comfort her, Williams used the deficit as inspiration.</p> \n<p>Her shouts grew louder, her returns hit the turf that bit harder but not all her bombs were hitting the mark and that gave Azarenka heart. She knew if she could hold her discipline she had a chance of hanging on. Williams needed an eighth ace to fight through deuce for a slender lead midway through the set. They had entered a mutual destruction pact, it seemed, every stroke loaded and the outcome uncertain in every point.</p> \n<p>Fault lines began to appear in Azarenka’s game as Williams applied unrelenting pressure on her serve. She had to save three break points in the third game but could not save the two she handed up in the fifth, and Williams had the glimmer of a chance she needed.</p> \n<p>From here she has won so many times before – but she found herself mired again in a struggle of her own making, surrendering two break points before holding for 5-2. When Azarenka failed to hold serve, a last, weakened backhand from behind the baseline billowing the net, the balance was firmly with Williams.</p> \n<p>Azarenka pulled off the occasional stunning winner down the flanks, where Williams is always most vulnerable. She saved for deuce with a big second serve and deuce in the fourth game, and held when her opponent hit long. In the seventh game, Williams hit three aces inside a minute to pass 50 for the tournament. It was knockout tennis. Azarenka hit her seventh double fault and fourth ace to stay in the match.</p> \n<p>Azarenka somehow managed a smile as Williams’s eighth ace eluded her swing, but was not thrilled to miss the next one. Williams then saw the comical side of daft mishit to give up break point – and aced again. On match point, Azarenka hit wide. The crowd stood in universal acclamation and the combatants hugged at the net. It was as much a memorable occasion as it was a contest.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436294150126/Wimbledon-day-eight-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Serena Williams celebrates in her match with Victoria Azarenka on Centre Court during day eight of Wimbledon 2015.
