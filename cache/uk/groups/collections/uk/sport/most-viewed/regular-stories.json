It’s been wonderful early-summer fun. England’s high-throttle new era rolled on into their last match before the Ashes with a 56-run one-off Twenty20 defeat of Brendon McCullum’s cavaliers on a crisp, run-filled, valedictory evening at Old Trafford. For England this was once again a Joe Root Day as the team’s best player in all three formats was by turns innovative, orthodox and even a little slapstick in compiling 68 off 46 balls. Around him a supporting cast of all-purpose dashers chipped in to compile a healthy looking 191 that proved to be comfortably out of reach.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/23/england-new-zealand-twenty20-live\">England v New Zealand: Twenty20 – live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By the end an aggressive display in the field led by some tight, straight fast bowling by Mark Wood and Ben Stokes was enough to suggest a carry-over of the white-ball optimism of recent weeks. As Eoin Morgan said afterwards: “The guys are playing with smiles on their faces, everyone’s enjoying each other’s company, everyone’s playing fearless cricket.” Over to you then, Alastair.</p> \n<p>With the first Ashes Test just three weeks away there had been a tendency to dismiss this match as a quirk of scheduling, a piece of lint on the lapel of an otherwise perfectly spruce Test and one-day summer. But in its own way this was more significant than any of the 50-over stuff that preceded it. England now have just three confirmed Twenty20 internationals before next year’s World Twenty20 in India. The poster for the evening may have carried the strapline ‚“Live music, live action, live cricket” (in that order), but this was still an occasion from which England will have been keen to learn as much as possible.</p> \n<p>Morgan won the toss as the shadows lengthened and chose to bat first on another excellent batting pitch. England’s team was the same XI that had chased down a shortened target in Durham, with Sam Billings, David Willey and Mark Wood making their international Twenty20 debuts and confirming the new synergy between the two white-ball teams.</p> \n<p>New Zealand picked two spinners, and with familiar Brendon McCullum-ish ballsiness gave the debutant Mitchell Santner the ball for a tight first over. Jason Roy got England going, yahooing Mitchell McClenaghan’s second ball into the crowd at straight midwicket with that familiar skip down the wicket, before being run out rather softly for an adrenal 23 off 13 balls.</p> \n<p>Tim Southee was on-driven for six by Root, then ramp-cut – an extraordinary piece of mid-shot adjustment – for a jaw-dropping four to third man as the opening powerplay brought 60 runs. Alex Hales skied Santner to cover to depart for 27 off 22 and Jonny Bairstow saw his off stump pegged back in the same over. But with Root in knockabout mood, placing the ball dreamily and in between reeling out the swats and the scoops, England got to 100 in the 11th over and Root to a lovely, effortless fifty off 36 balls with a whiplash pull off Nathan McCullum. That over went for 23, including an easy flicked six into the shadow of The Point by Billings, who was out shortly afterwards for a crazed but very useful 21 off 10 balls.</p> \n<p>Stokes and Adil Rashid biffed and dinked profitably at the end to leave England with an imposing total that looked better straight away as Willey swung one back to take out Martin Guptill’s leg stump with the third ball of the reply.</p> \n<p>New Zealand were never likely to die wondering, just as nobody hits the ball quite like Brendon McCullum, who for all his strength and fast hands has a beautiful economy of movement about his attacking strokes. Here Steven Finn, Willey and Wood were all hit for six in the opening overs before Wood sent McCullum on his way, producing a fast full ball from wide of the crease that cannoned into the stumps off a thick bottom-edge.</p> \n<p>A a horrible first over from Rashid went for 17 and New Zealand were ahead at the end of the powerplay on 72 for two, with Kane Williamson playing as he has all summer, all frictionless right-handed severity. England needed wickets badly. They got the unexpected bonus of a slightly frazzled New Zealand collapse – described as “amateur hour” by McCullum – as Ross Taylor lofted Rashid to Willey at long off, Colin Munro was bowled slogging at Stokes and Luke Ronchi played a horrible attempted ramp straight up in the air.</p> \n<p>Williamson continued to play beautifully, easing to a controlled, elegant fifty off just 31 balls. But some timely tight bowling by Finn and Wood left New Zealand needing 61 off 31 with seven wickets down, the last of them a sensational one-handed pick-up and direct hit by Willey to run out Williamson. Southee holed out next ball to give Wood his third wicket. And that was pretty much that. Cue the flames, the fireworks and – up next – the Ashes.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435092761514/Joe-Root-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Joe Root continued his impressive ODI form in the one-off T20 international to help England to a 56-run win at Old Trafford.

The World Anti-Doping Association rules forbid support personnel to carry such drugs without good reason.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/mo-farah-witch-hunt-steve-cram\">Mo Farah looks like the victim of a witch-hunt, says Steve Cram</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kupczak said: “When we were at an airport together Alberto would say: ‘Don’t let anyone touch my bag – I have my testosterone cream in there. I don’t want anyone to get contaminated accidentally.’ My thought was: if you are taking testosterone for yourself there are so many ways you can do it. You can do it in a tablet form. You can do it injection form. You can do it in an implant. So why risk something that could possibly contaminate the athlete? That is nuts. But then we would say, it’s his way. That’s Alberto.</p> \n<p>“It was one of those things that was so common that we didn’t really take notice of it. We would just think he’s got his damned Androgel again.”</p> \n<p>The Guardian received no response when it put Kupczak’s claim to Salazar via email. However it is known he is preparing a detailed rebuttal to a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/03/mo-farah-training-camp-documentary-alleged-drug-use-alberto-salazar-\" title=\"\">Panorama documentary</a> that claimed he gave Rupp testosterone when the athlete was 16 and committed several other doping violations. Rupp and Salazar deny the allegations and there is no suggestion Farah has committed any wrongdoing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/mo-farah-pr-team-eases-pressure-alberto-salazar-galen-rupp\">Mo Farah’s PR team eases the pressure but plenty of questions for others</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/mo-farah-alberto-salazar-doping-allegations-false-statements\" title=\"\">a statement to the Guardian</a> earlier this month, Salazar said: “I have said all along that I believe in a clean sport, hard work and I deny all allegations of doping. Given the time and effort the BBC and ProPublica committed to making these false allegations I hope that media and fans will afford me a short time to show the accusers are knowingly making false statements.”</p> \n<p>Kupczak, who also worked at the Oregon Project for a few months in 2006, also told the Guardian of a culture “where inhalers were so prevalent, it didn’t even faze me if people had one”. Yet in Kupczak’s view that culture became increasing secretive after he returned in 2008 and had become worse by 2011, by which time Farah had joined the camp.</p> \n<p>“When I first met Alberto in 2006 he was great,” he said. “He was fun. He was open. He would help anyone. He was a good man. He gets some wild ideas – he would want to fly to altitude to do a workout and it would happen, or he would order some laser for $20,000 that is worthless. He would do crazy things like that. As a therapist it was fun. I was like, what crazy stuff will we come up with next? But when I went back in 2008 he had changed. And he continued changing by the week. Things got really secretive.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/14/john-rohatinsky-backs-drug-allegations-alberto-salazar\">John Rohatinsky backs drug allegations made against Alberto Salazar</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kupczak, the latest former employee of Nike’s Oregon Project to come forward with claims against Salazar – the tally now stands at nearly 20 – also said he spoke to Usada three years ago. “I wanted to alert them before the Olympics because I thought they could watch more closely or do something about it. I probably contacted them in June 2012, and I spoke to them later in that month.”</p> \n<p>Kupczak believes that, in the next few days, Salazar will try to discredit Goucher, the 2007 10,000m world championship bronze medallist, and Steve Magness, an assistant at the Nike Oregon Project, who made some of the more serious accusations against him in the Panorama documentary. Kupczak said he can vouch for his former colleagues’ testimony and character.</p> \n<p>“I absolutely believe Kara,” he said. “I trust completely that she is honest. And Steve has complete integrity. He’s such a science guy that he wants to do it the proper way. Doping, in his mind, would take away from his science and his research.”</p> \n<p>Kupczak expects that, when Salazar issues his reply to the BBC, there will confusion in the athletics world with people unsure who is telling the truth. He believes the best way to cut through the impasse would be for Usada – or another official body – to start interviewing every member of the Nike Oregon Project under oath.</p> \n<p>“I would love to see that,” Kupczak said. “That is always when it comes out because you can’t lie because if you do you’ll have perjury charges. I would love to see all this come under oath, let’s do it. They always catch you. They always do.</p> \n<p>“If it was anyone else but Alberto they would say: ‘Enough is enough, we have heard this from enough people.’ It’s similar to the Lance Armstrong case, where they didn’t have any positive tests but they had enough witnesses that they said you’re done.”</p> \n<p>Kupczak said the bond between Salazar and Rupp was so close the coach would sometimes take over the massage duties from him when they were at training camps. “Sometimes we’d be somewhere and Galen likes his massages in the evening, so I would start to work on him and Alberto would say: ‘Al, you take the night off, I’ll give Galen a massage.’</p> \n<p>“At first I was a little taken aback. I was thinking am I doing a good job? But then I realised they have a peculiar arrangement, it’s beyond son and father, like some people say, so I’d just laugh it off and think I’ve got the night off, good.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435068872584/Alberto-Salazar-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Salazar takes timings during the Prefontaine Classic track and field meet in Eugene, Ore.

No alcohol bans or curfews have yet been introduced but Stuart Lancaster said he will take a dim view of any further incidents involving his players.</p> \n<p>Already the head coach has omitted Manu Tuilagi and Dylan Hartley from his squad for disciplinary reasons and is still <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/23/danny-cipriani-england-world-cup-place-drink-drive\" title=\"\">awaiting a police update</a> following Danny Cipriani’s arrest on suspicion of drink-driving after an accident earlier this month. It is understood Cipriani underwent two breath tests that proved inconclusive and police are awaiting the result of a blood sample.</p> \n<p>With the World Cup less than three months away Lancaster could do without any more distractions, regardless of whether Cipriani is charged with any offence. “I think the players know their responsibilities and the consequence of poor behaviour and poor decisions,” he said. “I will be very disappointed if we have to deal with any more of these things but we haven’t talked about any specific ban in any shape or form.”</p> \n<p>The management are keeping an open mind about Cipriani’s case, with the police indicating it may be early August before they decide whether to charge the Sale Sharks fly-half. “I will feel let down if there’s a case to answer but at the end of the day he was involved in an accident from which he hasn’t been charged,” Lancaster said. “Players do have accidents in cars. There is nothing more to say until I know if there is anything he has done wrong in the eyes of the law. He is [confident] but it’s not his decision, is it?”</p> \n<p>However, the fact Lancaster was among the first people Cipriani called after the incident suggested the player was less than totally relaxed about the situation. “He was very concerned,” Lancaster said. “He had just had a great game for the Barbarians and was on his way to get packed to go to the airport [to fly to the United States] and this incident occurred. He was concerned as his first port of call was to ring me. We’ll wait and see whether the police will charge or not and I’ll deal with it as and when it’s appropriate.”</p> \n<p>Lancaster also shed some more light on <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/david-strettle-withdrawing-world-cup-squad\" title=\"\">David Strettle’s abrupt withdrawal</a> from the wider training squad, admitting he would have preferred the wing to have made his decision rather earlier than he did. Strettle’s imminent relocation to Clermont Auvergne from Saracens has caused him to rethink his priorities and he has advised Lancaster he wishes to concentrate on his move to France.</p> \n<p>It is highly likely Lancaster’s comment about favouring players available to him in the longer term in the event of any 50-50 selection decisions also helped make up Strettle’s mind. Either way, Lancaster was clearly not best pleased when the call came. “Obviously I was disappointed. I said to him: ‘Have you thought this through?’ But he had made his decision to withdraw, so as a consequence I was left in no other position than to accept that and look at the next guy.”</p> \n<p>That “next guy” will be Semesa Rokoduguni but the Bath wing is not due back from his native Fiji until later this week and will not join up with his team-mates at their Bagshot training camp before Monday.</p> \n<p>Three other players will also be playing no immediate part, with Alex Goode nursing a hip injury sustained in last month’s Premiership final and the Northampton pair Luther Burrell and Stephen Myler sidelined with toe and knee problems respectively.</p> \n<p>With Mike Brown having played so little rugby following the concussion issues that ruled him out of the latter stages of the domestic season, it is likely <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/26/chris-pennell-worcester-championship-play-off-bristol\" title=\"\">Worcester’s Chris Pennell</a> will be invited to join the camp next week as injury cover should Goode’s return to fitness be further delayed.</p> \n<p>Ben Foden, Tom Croft and Joe Simpson are already set to miss out on England’s two-week training camp in Colorado next month as they continue their recovery from long-term injury. Gloucester’s Ben Morgan is set to travel to Denver having worked hard on his rehabilitation since breaking a leg in January.</p> \n<p>For all concerned, as Lancaster keeps emphasising, it will be no holiday camp over the coming weeks. “Whether they’re at their club or working with England, pre-season is never an enjoyable place. Clearly we’ll do some light skills work but the majority of work is fitness, running and conditioning. I think they’ll be glad to see the back of the conditioners and see us rugby coaches again.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435079533623/Danny-Cipriani-England-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Danny Cipriani is currently waiting to hear whether he will face a police charge after his arrest on suspicion of drink-driving.

If you ever have the chance to follow a world-class golfer around one of the planet’s great courses, take it. The way they go after fairways, attack greens, drop shots beside pins and then spin them back to within putting distance is a sight to behold. Watching a golfer make a mockery of a course’s supposed “par” score is one of the great experiences in sport.</p> \n<p>That being said, there’s also something deliciously satisfying about seeing a group of professionals clambering their way around a course and being as baffled by it as the rest of us. If you enjoy your golf with a healthy dose of schadenfreude, you will have enjoyed the US Open this weekend. </p> \n<p>Henrik Stenson likened playing the Chambers Bay course to “putting on broccoli”. Gary Player spoke with horror about the player who missed the green by a yard and end up “50 yards down in the valley”. Welcome to our world Gary; the harder we practise, the unluckier we get. For most of us, golf will always be a mournful ballad entitled “50 yards down in the valley”.</p> \n<p><strong>Gary Player:</strong><br /></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“The worst golf course I might’ve ever seen in the 63 years as a professional golfer. The USGA, who I admire and have chosen great golf courses in this great United States of America — they’re preaching speed of play. Enjoyment. User-friendly. This golf course here, if you’re a 10-handicap, you couldn’t break 100 if you had the best day of your life. They’ve got pros putting from 20 feet and hitting the ball 20 foot to the right, a man misses the green by a yard and he’s 50 yards down in the valley. I mean I don’t understand it. It’s 7,900 yards long. The world is in dire straits with water. Can you imagine the costs to maintain this? And it’s a public course, but they’ll probably charge the public $200 to play it. I’d like to challenge anyone with a 16 handicap to do better than 40 over par. It’s basically unplayable.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Sergio Garc&iacute;a:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“Why do they do this to the course? This is a great championship with great history. The US Open deserves so much better than this. It hurts to see what they have done to the course. These greens, come on, let’s be honest, you can’t say they are good. It’s just not right.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Billy Horschel:<br /></strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“I’ve been waiting for this moment all week. I think a lot of players, and I’m one of them, have lost some respect for the USGA and this championship this year for the greens. When you have a majority of the players commenting publicly, and some of them aren’t because they don’t want to get the pushback from it, then there’s an issue. I heard someone say that the TV is making the greens look worse than they are. That’s a complete lie.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Ernie Els:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“We have to go out there in front of millions of people and putt on these things. The USGA, they have got to take a bit of responsibility.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Justin Rose:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“I had a five-foot putt on the first and didn’t have the first idea what it was going to do. It felt like outdoor bingo at that point.” </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Ian Poulter:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“What wasn’t playable were the green surfaces. If this was a regular PGA tour event lots of players would have withdrawn and gone home on Wednesday, but players won’t do that for a major. They were simply the worst most disgraceful surface I have ever seen on any tour in all the years I have played. The US Open deserves better than that.’’</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Henrik Stenson:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“It is borderline laughable at some of the greens and some of the pin positions. When we’re actually almost better off plugged in a bunker than being on the top of a ridge, like on the fourth. And it’s pretty much like putting on broccoli, as well.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Dustin Johnson, who led for most of the weekend but <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/22/jordan-spieth-us-open-2015-rivalry-rory-mcilroy\">lost out to Jordan Speith at the last hole</a>, was complimentary about the course. “From the first time I played it I liked it,” he said. “It’s a lot of fun and you need to use your imagination.” What do you think? Should courses as difficult, unpredictable and unpopular as Chambers Bay host the US Open?</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434986532516/58ee4bb3-9ea8-443f-97ab-ca0988d8c6f3-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Harry How/Getty Images","altText":"golf","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Harry How/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-22T16:02:29Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T16:04:33Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":151,"contributors":[{"name":"Paul Campbell","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/paul-campbell"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["US Open","Golf","PGA Tour","Sport","US Open Golf 2015","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/usopengolf","webTitle":"US Open"},{"id":"sport/golf","webTitle":"Golf"},{"id":"sport/pga-tour","webTitle":"PGA Tour"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-open-golf-2015","webTitle":"US Open Golf 2015"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Paul Campbell","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/paul-campbell"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/chambers-bay-golf-course-us-open","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a2mv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/22/chambers-bay-golf-course-us-open","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/22/chambers-bay-golf-course-us-open"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434986532516/58ee4bb3-9ea8-443f-97ab-ca0988d8c6f3-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The ‘unplayable’ Chambers Bay.
