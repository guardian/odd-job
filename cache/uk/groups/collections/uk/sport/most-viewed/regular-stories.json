So that was a hugely frustrating situation for me.”</p> \n<p>Under the whereabouts system, designed to support out-of-competition testing, cyclists are obliged to inform officials where they will be for a specific hour between 5am and 11pm when they are obliged to be available for testing.</p> \n<p>Most nominate a time early in the morning, as it is when they are most certain of their likely whereabouts: at home in bed. While Froome had logged his temporary holiday address on the whereabouts website, he neglected to let hotel staff know he may have callers who should be granted immediate access to his room.</p> \n<p>“I did appeal to try and explain the circumstances to the authorities but at the end of the day I take full responsibility for that case,” said Froome, who has previously claimed to have been tested more than 30 times in one three-week period.</p> \n<p>“I should have been more proactive in letting the hotel know this was a possibility that I could be tested. I’ve certainly learned my lesson there. I’ve stayed in hotels all over the world and I’ve been tested all over the world without any issues at all. Unfortunately I just didn’t see this one coming but it’s opened my eyes and I’m definitely going to be more pro-active in the future. It’s always the athlete’s responsibility to make sure he or she is available for testing.”</p> \n<p>The World Anti-Doping Agency operates a three-strike policy that means anyone who misses three tests in a 12-month period is deemed to have committed an anti-doping rule violation and incurs an automatic ban of up to two years.</p> \n<p>Despite the recent blot on his copybook, Froome is pleased with what he sees as a more rigorous approach to drug testing in cycling.</p> \n<p>Last year he observed that neither he, nor his high-profile Tour de France rivals Vincenzo Nibali and Alberto Contador, had been asked to undergo drug controls during lengthy spells of altitude training in Tenerife.</p> \n<p>“As far as I can see that has been rectified,” he said. “This year, up in Tenerife alone, I think we were tested at least three or four times during the period when we were up there. So yes, I think the authorities have acted on that.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435178957279/The-2013-Tour-de-France-w-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The 2013 Tour de France winner Chris Froome is one of the favourites to win this year's race.

The cricket they and England have played has been compelling all the way through, from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/25/england-new-zealand-first-test-match-report\" title=\"\">the first Test match at Lord’s</a>, to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/23/england-new-zealand-twenty20-international-cricket\" title=\"\">the single T20 at Old Trafford</a>. Just as much, though, has been the manner in which the game has been played, something that is sneered at in some quarters, as if the values of sportsmanship, good manners and pure enjoyment, which both teams have managed to convey, are somehow redundant ideals and secondary to success.</p> \n<p>The response of the cricket-following public to the tour as it has unfolded has shown emphatically that this is not the case, the pity only that it has all been too short. The fullness of time could well show this visit of the New Zealand team to be one of the most important in memory simply for what it has done for the game.</p> \n<p>It is against this backdrop that the Australian team has arrived, and, attending Michael Clarke’s first press conference of the tour, rather than the frisson of excitement that has always preceded an Ashes series in this country, it all seemed rather flat, as if the best, or at least most entertaining part of the summer has passed with the solstice. This has nothing to do with the Australian team itself, except in the sense that the visit of New Zealand was always regarded (not least by themselves one imagines) as the precursor to yet another Ashes series, and Clarke’s men will no more enjoy having their thunder stolen by the warm-up act any more than the Who would if Paul Weller play them off the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury on Sunday.</p> \n<p>Already the talk, largely but not entirely media-driven of course, has turned to aggression, attitude and confrontation. Clarke is probably wearied of fielding the same questions, but then there are elements within his side – <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/west-indies-v-australia-2015/content/story/886227.html\" title=\"\">David Warner’s recent interview with ESPN Cricinfo</a> a case in point – who have done little to divert the issue. But then Clarke talked of “the line” and “headbutting” it, whatever that means, and without quite explaining what that line is, and where exactly it is drawn. Or indeed whether it cannot be moved as Brendon McCullum has managed to do. It is, he said, “the Australian way”, which, repeated as it was by Shaun Marsh the next day, sounds suspiciously like the latest PR euphemism for what was once termed “banter” (as an aside, one of the first cricket books bought for me, which I stlll have, is called Cricket, The Australian Way by Jack Pollard, and I can find no reference therein to intangible lines, banter, attack dogs or sledging ).</p> \n<p>The turnaround in the England team since they slunk ignominiously away from the World Cup has been huge. There were good signs in West Indies, although some passive selections were not helpful, but since then self-belief and confidence has grown. Two months ago, the majority view would have been that England had the slimmest chance only of competing against a strong Australian side. Now though, that has changed from something beyond even guarded optimism into a feeling that the series will be a lot closer and harder fought than was anticipated.</p> \n<p>In this, there is a historical element, for although England have suffered two hideous whitewashes in Australia either side of their brilliant win there in the winter of 2010-11, there is not one member of the current Australian touring party who was here in 2001 when they last won a series in this country. In terms of matches here in that time it is 7-2 to England, a massive record of Australian underachievement away from home, and one they now must realise they will have to scrap mightily to rectify.</p> \n<p>The “Dad’s Army” jibes have been predictable and misplaced in intent for the selection of the touring party has been pragmatic: age, as they say, is just a number. Whatever the outcome of the last Ashes series in Australia, it is undeniable that the top order batting had weaknesses, and it was to England’s detriment that they could not destroy the lower order as the Australians managed to do so effectively to them. This time, much of the batting is largely unproven in English conditions, and hence the inclusion of both Chris Rogers and Adam Voges, experienced county players, at ages well beyond those at which they might once have been selected: they know the ropes. On the other hand, the rise of Steve Smith has been phenomenal but his technique will be challenged if the ball swings, so too those of Clarke, Warner and Shane Watson: Rogers and Voges are important cogs in this wheel and well chosen.</p> \n<p>The key to this whole series will rest with the respective attacks, however, and here it is hard to get away from the view that it is Australia who are better equipped. Bowlers who can swing the ball are always a great asset in England: those who can do so at pace are gold dust.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect will be to see quite how Darren Lehmann and the selectors balance the attack for in the two Mitchells, Starc and Johnson, Josh Hazlewood, Ryan Harris, and the redoubtable workhorse Peter Siddle they have performers for all conditions, the deepest pool of quality pacemen in the business. In particular it will be intriguing to see how high up the pecking order Johnson comes now. His success against England in Australia has not been matched by that in England, and as a potent threat he has been overtaken by Starc, a pacier version of Trent Boult, the New Zealander who gave England considerable trouble in May.</p> \n<p>In Hazlewood they have a relentlessly accurate seamer, likened in method and attitude to Glenn McGrath, while England have encountered no more skilful bowler in the last five years than Harris, this barn door of a man with the most gently sublime wrist action around, whose fitness will be the only issue. It may well be Johnson, along with Siddle, who is sidelined at the start. This is the group, the wolfpack, in which the destiny of the Ashes lies.</p> \n<p>Maybe us poms have seen the best of the summer – but it won’t be without a scrap.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435150867002/Australia-captain-Michael-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Australia captain Michael Clarke in batting practice during a nets session in the runup to the Ashes series against England.

Usada has interviewed more than a dozen witnesses and is actively pursuing documents and other evidence from Salazar, who coached Rupp to the silver medal in the 10,000m at the London Olympics.</p> \n<p>Usada would not comment on whether an investigation was taking place but in a statement it said it took “all reports of doping seriously and we aggressively follow up on all information we receive in order to fulfil our oath to protect clean athletes and the integrity of competition”.</p> \n<p>Salazar has largely kept his counsel in the three weeks since a Panorama documentary made a number of sensational claims, including that he gave Rupp the banned steroid testosterone as a 16-year-old. But in a 11,750-word statement published on the Nike Oregon Project website he finally tackled the allegations which he said had left “innocent athletes’ careers tarnished with nothing but innuendo, hearsay and rumour”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/alberto-salazar-statement-galen-rupp-nike-oregon-project\">Alberto Salazar statement: let the haters hate – we will keep winning</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Salazar insisted Rupp had only ever used legal testosterone supplements designed to naturally boost his levels, and that photographic evidence of testosterone being noted in his medical notes – obtained by his former assistant Steve Magness – was a recording error. “Galen has clearly stated that he did not take testosterone in December 2002 or at any other time,” he added.</p> \n<p>In Salazar’s lengthy rebuttal there were frequent references to dates, documents and exhibits. For the most part it gave his response a more formal and almost legal air. But there was no disguising his anger as he accused Magness of “spreading malicious false allegations” and suggested he left the Nike Oregon Project not because he saw anything suspicious but because he “proved to be a poor coach who had difficulty building rapport with world-class athletes”.</p> \n<p>He also claimed Magness had appeared happy when he discussed his role next to Salazar with <em>Runner’s World </em>in 2011. “Steve Magness did not leave the Oregon Project,” Salazar added. “The Oregon Project terminated his contract in 2012.”</p> \n<p>However, last night Magness revealed that he had a signed document to show that there had been a “mutual termination” of his contract. “I also have a recording of the conversation Alberto and I had when we decided to part ways, which makes absolutely zero mention of any relationship between myself and any other athlete, or any mention of departing for failure as a coach,” he said. “I did not have a relationship with any athlete during my time at the Nike Oregon Project.</p> \n<p>“Salazar goes to great lengths to use a July 2011 interview with me as evidence of my thought process at the time. I’d like to point out that since my employer was Nike at the time, I knew that speaking my true feelings would certainly jeopardise my career, so I stuck with the politically correct answers out of fear.</p> \n<p>“Since leaving Nike, this fear has been realised and demonstrated on many occasions, first with the insistence of disclaimers and phone calls following a Lance Armstrong piece I wrote, which were followed up with a confrontation at the 2013 London athletics meeting. It’s humbling to say but the intimidation and fear of speaking out is what kept me from publicly addressing my concerns at that time.</p> \n<p>“Salazar paints me as an inadequate coach, which my performance before and after Nike I dispute. In the past two years I have coached three individuals to top 20 at world championships.”</p> \n<p>Magness is one of nearly 20 former athletes or employees who have spoken out against Salazar’s methods. Some have indicated to the <em>Guardian </em>that they also plan to respond to his report in the coming days. Several of Salazar’s current athletes, including Rupp, Matthew Centrowitz and Shannon Rowbury, are also expected to speak after competing in the US Track and Field championships, which begin evening.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile a spokesman for the BBC defended its Panorama programme about Salazar, saying: “We are confident in our programme and that it was right to air the allegations of the witnesses who appeared on it. We stand by our journalism and it is now for the relevant anti-doping authorities to investigate the allegations.</p> \n<p>“The detailed allegations were put to Mr Salazar four weeks before the programme aired, giving him the opportunity to address them in full. The BBC has also invited Alberto Salazar to be interviewed about the allegations, an offer which still stands.”</p> \n<p>The back-and-forth is likely to continue in the coming days but Salazar says he has documented evidence going back to 2001 to show that another allegation, that Rupp was a frequent user of the asthma drug prednisone – which is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency for use in competition – is “completely false”. Rupp was forced to take allergy and thyroid medicine because he suffered from “severe allergies and breathing issues”, not because he was cheating, said Salazar. “He is medically diagnosed as suffering from both asthma and Hashimoto’s disease, a thyroid disease,” he added. “Galen takes asthma medication so he can breathe normally, not so he can run better. Galen takes his thyroid medication so that his body can function normally, not for any competitive advantage.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/galen-rupp-us-track-field-championships-coach-alberto-salazar-eugene\">Galen Rupp to race at US championships amid Salazar controversy</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But Salazar insisted Rupp was the exception not the rule at the Oregon Project when it came to using asthma and thyroid medication. He added that of the 55 athletes he had coached at Nike only five had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and only eight with exercise-induced asthma after he had started working with them.</p> \n<p>Salazar also rejected the claims of his former athlete Kara Goucher, the 10,000m world championship bronze medallist, that he had “coached” Rupp to try to flout the strict rules around Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUEs) certificates so he could get an intravenous drip before the 2011 world championships – and said Rupp had had only two TUEs since 2010.</p> \n<p>But Salazar did admit that John Stiner, the massage therapist who worked briefly with him in 2008, was right to say that he had seen Androgel, a testosterone gel banned by Wada, in his room. However, he said it was strictly for his own use because he suffered from low virility levels.</p> \n<p>“My excessive training as an athlete did extensive damage to my body,” he added. “One of the lingering negative effects from which I still suffer today is hypogonadism with significant symptoms, including multiple low testosterone serum levels. There is no question that I have a valid justification for my possession of Androgel as defined by the Wada code. I have never given Androgel to any of my athletes.”</p> \n<p>Salazar also dismissed suggestions that a fridge full of vials in his training camp in Park City, which was seen by Stiner, was suspicious. “Stiner has tried to imply that Galen’s allergy immunotherapy medicine is something else,” he said. “It’s not. Galen has been receiving allergy immunotherapy vaccine injections since approximately 2004.”</p> \n<p>Yet Salazar did admit he had “let his paranoia get the best of him” when he asked Dr Jeffrey Brown to conduct an experiment to find out whether it was possible for someone to rub enough testosterone cream on an athlete to make them test positive. It had come about, he said, because Justin Gatlin had blamed his positive test for exogenous testosterone on being sabotaged by his massage therapist, Chris Whetstine, and he was worried the same thing might happen to Rupp.</p> \n<p>“On May 9, 2009, Galen Rupp’s University of Oregon 4x1 mile relay team set a new NCAA record,” he said. “Shortly after the race while talking to the press, Galen felt someone rubbing his shoulders. He turned around and it was Chris Whetstiner. Galen had heard the stories. He was extremely concerned and called me. I called the US Anti-doping Agency hotline to report it. Usada may still have the tapes or notes of my call. Nothing came of it but it caused us grave concern.”</p> \n<p>Salazar concluded with a message for his detractors: “Let the haters hate; we’re going to keep winning through hard work, dedication and fair play.” But the immediate response from Usada and Magness suggests this saga will rumble on for a long while yet.</p> \n<p>Nike later released its own statement saying it had conducted its own review and found no evidence of doping.</p> \n<p>“We take the allegations very seriously as Nike does not condone the use of performance enhancing drugs in any manner,” it read. “Both Alberto and Galen have made their position clear and refute the allegations made against them, as shown in Alberto’s open letter.</p> \n<p>“Furthermore we have conducted our own internal review and have found no evidence to support the allegations of doping.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435189878618/Alberto-Salazar-has-issue-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Salazar has issued a 12,000-word rebuttal of allegations of doping.

Four years ago Rupert Murdoch was going to take over the circus and more recently everybody was talking about a move from John C Malone’s Liberty Global and Discovery Communications television group. So we have been here before.</p> \n<p>Perhaps it is because Formula One has recently been caught up in a vortex of criticism, and self-criticism, against a background of diminishing television and live audiences, and with sponsors disappearing faster than Prospero’s banquet, that the current story is being given more credence than it may deserve. But the interest is real. And a combination of Qatari money and American marketing expertise might just do the trick. But speculation that Bernie Ecclestone, the sport’s CEO who will be 85 this year, is about to quit may be wide of the mark.</p> \n<p>As one team principal said day: “History would suggest that Bernie is going nowhere. He will make a pile of money by selling his 5% shares in Formula One. But he’s already got a pile of money and he hasn’t been prepared to let go of the sport.”</p> \n<p>Even so, for one reason or another, Ecclestone’s grip on F1 will loosen in the years ahead. And that will be no bad thing. Ecclestone may well have been the sport’s very own Rumpelstiltskin but he spins gold no more and his aversion to appealing to the social media and a younger audience can only harm the sport he built up.</p> \n<p>Formula One will also be considerably better off without CVC, who have made about &pound;5bn profit since buying in 2006. They have marketed the sport very aggressively, creaming off the profits and not investing in their product. For that reason, and with a very few exceptions at the front of the grid, all the teams have struggled to make ends meet.</p> \n<p>A couple of years ago Bob Fernley, Force India’s deputy team principal, told the Guardian that CVC had been “a disaster” for the sport.</p> \n<p>He said: “I think they have done an absolutely awful job. In my view they are the worst thing that has ever happened to Formula One. They have done nothing whatsoever for the sport.”</p> \n<p>America might appear to represent an inadequate answer. After all, before its current home in Austin, F1 races were staged in Watkins Glen, Long Beach, Dallas, Detroit, Phoenix and Indianapolis among other places. And it never took root.</p> \n<p>In 1982 there were three races in America – at Long Beach in LA, Detroit and Caesars Palace – but when F1 went to Austin in 2012 it was the first US Grand Prix staged since 2007.</p> \n<p>But they do understand money and marketing. It might be “the only country in history which has gone from barbarism to decadence without an intervening period of civilisation,” according to Georges Clemenceau, but they do know how to put on a show.</p> \n<p>Bobby Epstein, the co-founder of the Circuit of the Americas (Cota), told the Guardian that F1 needs to “loosen up a bit” and “make the sport about personalities, like Nascar. People connect with people. They don’t connect with metal. They’ve got to get the drivers out front. They should take a look at the [US] PGA golfers and see how close they are to their fans.”</p> \n<p>Epstein’s very American thoughts are in sync with those of Jason Dial, the president of Cota, who said in Austin last year: “I’d like to see F1 taken off the track and be more about engagement. I think accessibility and digital social engagement could really move the needle. I want to make it younger. I want to grow the pie.”</p> \n<p>Ross is well capable of pie-growing. The young Ross was once fired from a job in Wall Street but then, on the back of a $10,000 loan from his mother, he has done rather well, building a fortune worth $6.5bn (&pound;4.14bn) according to Forbes magazine.</p> \n<p>Now 75, he lives and works in the gargantuan Time Warner Center on the south-west corner of Central Park. It represents his grandest achievement.

The Test team were about to become No1 in the world for the first time since rankings began. The Twenty20 world championship belt was still on the mantelpiece. Even the much-maligned ODI side were en route to completing a clean sweep at the top of the ICC tree the following year. In some ways those few months stand as the zenith of England’s modern cricketing history, acme of the brutal, brilliantly-engineered professionalism of The Flower Years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/jimmy-anderson-ditch-seldging-ashes-england-australia\">Jimmy Anderson calls for England and Australia to ditch Ashes sledging</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For Trevor Bayliss 2011 was also an interesting summer. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/30/trevor-bayliss-new-coach-england-australia\" title=\"\">England’s new head coach</a>, the man charged both with reviving that level of achievement and recasting it as something more engaged and sustainable, was working as an estate agent in rural New South Wales.</p> \n<p>It was, it must be said, only a brief stint spent flogging houses, an unplanned hiatus between leaving the Sri Lanka job and his appointment as the head coach of the Sydney Sixers. Nonetheless the journey from World Cup final coach to estate agent three months later is a remarkable, if rather overlooked biographical detail. One thing does seem certain given the sheer weight of warm words directed Bayliss’s way in the past month: England’s head coach will have taken something useful from the experience, if only perhaps the skills required to negotiate his own salary up from the initial offer made by Andrew Strauss – rejected by Bayliss – to a reported final figure of &pound;400,000 a year.</p> \n<p>What England are getting for their money will emerge only in time. It is impossible to find anyone with a harsh word to say about Bayliss, a remarkable achievement in any professional sport. But there is also a slightly opaque pitch to the universal praise. Brendon McCullum has called Bayliss a “champion fella”, Shane Warne “a ripper”. Riki Wessels says he’s “chilled”. Eoin Morgan, whose familiarity with Bayliss from the Kolkata Knight Riders raises an interesting current in England’s cross-format power politics, says: “He doesn’t talk a lot of BS, he gets straight to the point.”</p> \n<p>Bayliss is old school. Bayliss is straight. Bayliss doesn’t rely much on the dreaded “data” (except, that is, when he does rely on data). If it is hard to get any real sense of detail behind the unanimous backslaps then perhaps this is the real nub of the Bayliss effect, a coach whose special power seems to be the ability to help his players become more not less like themselves.</p> \n<p>One man who has shared more than purely sporting extremes is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/26/mahela-jayawardene-trevor-bayliss-england-success\" title=\"\">Mahela Jayawardene</a>. He was captain of Sri Lanka and a fellow passenger with both Bayliss and Paul Farbrace during <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2009/mar/03/sri-lanka-cricket-terrorist-attack-pakistan\" title=\"\">the terrorist attack in Lahore in 2009</a>, where players and staff were saved from certain massacre by the bravery of the Pakistani policemen guarding their bus.</p> \n<p>“He encourages a freedom for the boys on and off the field, for them to enjoy themselves and their cricket,” Jayawardene says of his former coach. “We had a lot of different personalities during his time in Sri Lanka and he handled all those guys well. One on one, he’s really good with players and understands them.</p> \n<p>“He lets people express themselves freely. He doesn’t put restrictions on players – if you’re a good talent he’ll ask you to go and play freely – and gets the best out of them. That’s what good coaches do. That’s what he’s done with the Sri Lanka team, what he did with New South Wales. All those teams have talented players and England, I’m sure, have the same.</p> \n<p>“A lot of the things he brought into the team were fun elements, allowing players to enjoy themselves, which in return led to a much more relaxed environment. Playing as a unit together is a big thing in his agenda. So I think the England boys will enjoy working under him.”</p> \n<p>The notion of a broader perspective is a recurrent theme. Bayliss was born in Goulburn, New South Wales. He worked for a while as a handyman at a local naval base before establishing himself as an attacking middle order batsman at New South Wales, enjoying his best years between 1988-1990 when he scored a hatful of runs and was thought of, briefly, as an outside bet for national selection.</p> \n<p>After which came life as an itinerant gun-for-hire coach, bringing with it an unprecedented range of global domestic trophies including the Sheffield Shield, the IPL, the Big Bash and the Champions League Twenty20. With Sri Lanka there were two losing limited-overs finals and a rise to a Test rankings high of second in the world.</p> \n<p>The bare specifics of his role in all this tend to emerge only through a veil of characteristic understatement. “It doesn’t matter where you are around the world – you’ve got the same kind of characters in the team,” Bayliss said in 2011, while he was at Kolkata. “You’ve got your funny guys, your mad guys, your happy guys. It doesn’t really change from one team to the other.</p> \n<p>“To actually coach the game is only a small part of it. These guys know how to play. It’s maybe a little reminder of what they were doing when they were playing well if they’re out of form. Otherwise it’s trying to create the right environment, a happy one and an honest one, where you allow the players to express themselves on the field and you don’t come down hard on them if they stuff up.”</p> \n<p>It is perhaps typical Bayliss to suggest his main contribution is simply to keep the engine running. For all the hands-off schtick he does have a reputation as an intense and innovative tactician. In the IPL his use of the attacking spinners Sunil Narine and Brad Hogg was a notable success, along with an emphasis on athletic, aggressive fielding, an area in which Bayliss excelled as a player. Above all he is known for his planning and strategy in white-ball cricket, with a reputation for affecting the course of a match even during the “time-out” phase in the IPL and Champions League.</p> \n<p>It is in the emphasis on dynamism and universal skills – “the best players are the best players in any format,” he has said – that the new coach’s interaction with England’s established certainties, the primacy of the Test team and the Test captain, promises to be most interesting. Bayliss knows Morgan from the IPL. He knows Sam Billings from a brief spell at Penrith but he will meet Alastair Cook for the first time on the pre-Ashes bonding trip to Spain.</p> \n<p>It is a lack of professional familiarity that reflects both Bayliss’s primary involvement over the last few years in high-end white-ball cricket and Cook’s own very specific kind of batting brilliance. In the next few weeks the pair will hope to forge a similarly productive relationship to that enjoyed by Duncan Fletcher and Nasser Hussain, who also had not met before they were yoked together as captain and coach.</p> \n<p>For now a common purpose awaits, and a common foe Bayliss knows better than his own charges, having coached nine members of Australia’s Ashes party at NSW. Not that there will be any doubt about his appetite for the fight. “He’ll definitely enjoy that,” Jayawardene says. “When we played Australia and he was coach he was really passionate about beating the Australians.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435161781806/England-head-coach-Trevor-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England head coach Trevor Bayliss once said: 'To actually coach the game is only a small part of it.
