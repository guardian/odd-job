I say things that I shouldn’t say.

With experience comes the best spots, however, and she and her niece Evelyn Wilson had bagged a coveted patch of grass on the mound that allowed them some shade, and where they could open their umbrellas (“they do us for rain or sunshine”) without obstructing other spectators. </p> \n<p>As well as hats and plentiful sunshine, Wilson had brought a facecloth, which she had moistened during a trip to the ladies’ and draped over her feet. “Just keep it wet and it’ll keep you lovely and cool,” she said with a smile. </p> \n<p>Others, however, found themselves caught out by the weather. “I’ve come without a hat and I don’t know if our tickets will be in the sun or the shade, so I’m a bit worried,” said Fiona Seitler, trying on a wide-brimmed cricket-style hat in the main Wimbledon shop, as staff restocked the rapidly thinning shelves around her. </p> \n<p>“It’s seriously hot out there. I’ve slapped on the factor 50 and I’ve just had a drink to keep hydrated, but I think I might need one of these, too.”</p> \n<p>At the small pharmacy under court one, the only place selling sunscreen, staff said they had spent the day continually re-stocking their shelves with protective lotions. They have placed a large order for more stock to arrive on Wednesday, in anticipation of an even hotter day to come. </p> \n<p>Matthew Lechtzier, a Canadian now based in west London, said he was loving the hot weather.</p> \n<p>“I’ve lived in Britain for 30 years now and there is a certain point in the middle where no one is complaining, but if it goes just a bit too hot or cold people complain about it.</p> \n<p> “Now we’ve got this heat but it will be over and back to normal in a week.”</p> \n<p> </p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/9baab60ad5e49a77659f2b7911d72616e65a9b59/0_74_4717_2833/4717.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2833,"width":4717,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ian Walton/Getty Images","altText":"A spectator shields himself from the heat at Wimbledon.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/793264c15ce6c96172ecb332e897ae397f1c58ea/0_62_3789_2273/3789.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2273,"width":3789,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray shakes hands with Mikhall Kukushkin, after winning in straight sets.

He goes through to the second round against Robin Haase on Thursday at least mildly gingered up after struggling midway through his straight sets win over the 59th-ranked Mikhail Kukushkin on Centre Court on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Murray, who has been in splendid form all summer, on clay and grass, spent almost twice as long on court as Roger Federer did in his far easier win over the Bosnian Damir Dzumhur.</p> \n<p>While Murray expressed no interest in the Federer match, the comparison is relevant in terms of where each of them is placed after the first round of a tournament that may bring them together in the semi-final. Federer was pretty much faultless against an opponent he also destroyed at Roland Garros three weeks ago; Murray was less convincing against an opponent with whom he shares the distinction of being coached by a woman and who played with the freedom of an acknowledged outsider.</p> \n<p>Still, beating an out-and-out shot-maker like Kukushkin 6-4, 7-6, 6-4 in two hours and 11 minutes, while lacing his performance with some breathtaking ground strokes and delightful dinks near the net, told Murray he should not be rushing back to his psychiatrist just yet.</p> \n<p>He did come perilously close to blowing a 5-2 lead in the second set as his serve disintegrated for no apparent reason and he acknowledged that it is an area of his game he needs to address before playing Haase.</p> \n<p>Murray did play some terrific tennis against Kukushkin, which was reciprocated in several dazzling exchanges in the first and third sets, but that dip in the second disturbed his equilibrium.</p> \n<p>“I made it hard for myself at the end of the second set,” he said. “Then he started playing some very aggressive tennis, low over the net. Towards the end of it, I missed 10 or 11 first serves in a row. I wasn’t surprised [by Kukushkin’s occasionally high level].</p> \n<p>“I’ve seen some of his results in big matches. He’s a tough opponent when he goes for his shots. Credit to him … but there’s definitely work to be done.”</p> \n<p>From the beginning, Kukushkin was not shy in the shot and hit some of his forehands with rasping power at the lines to stay on level terms in the opening exchanges and for much of the second set.</p> \n<p>The 11th game of that session was an odd one. Murray double-faulted, aced, made a lousy challenge and then watched a Kukushkin return skim the white lines. Kukushkin then lost focus entirely as Murray broke yet again to force the tie-break, and take the set. The third was a more comfortable ride for Murray, who looked relieved at the end.</p> \n<p>Haase, who has lost to Murray in three of their four encounters, took two hours and 22 minutes to beat Alejandro Falla 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 on Court Seven, and admitted he had misgivings beforehand because the Colombian has been dangerous on grass, most memorably when taking the first two sets off Federer in the first round here five years ago, before blowing match point in the fourth set. (Federer, incidentally, has not lost a set in the first round at Wimbledon since).</p> \n<p>Haase, a couple of months younger than Murray (although they never met as juniors) and ranked 78 in the world, took a set off him in each of their matches at the US Open, but might struggle to do so on grass.</p> \n<p>“Last time I played him in New York, I don’t know exactly what happened,” Murray said. “But I had terrible cramps from very early on in the match. It was a very tough match for me to get through. He’s a tough opponent, likes grass, enjoys playing on big courts.”</p> \n<p>Murray said he was glad to be back on a court where he has seen more good days than bad. “It’s a great court. I’ve had some of my best matches on there. It doesn’t happen at all of the events from where the first day it’s a packed crowd from start to finish. It’s always nice to play in front of that sort of crowd.”</p> \n<p>From the reaction to his victory, the feeling would seem to be mutual. It’s a little while now since any comedian has felt the urge to yell, “Come on, Tim!” during one of Murray’s matches (although if they read this, that may change). There is a genuine empathy between him and tennis fans, wherever they come from, and the suggestion in other parts of the media forest recently that his support for Scottish independence was something of a “public relations disaster” would seem to have lost traction.</p> \n<p>At 28, Murray is not only a matured and distinguished athlete, he is operating at the height of his powers. He will not be perfect in every match, nor will he avoid defeat now and again but a feature of his flawed victory was his ability to overcome the frustration of losing his way and powering on to the right result.</p> \n<p>As John McEnroe, the three-time Wimbledon champion, said afterwards: “I don’t think the result was ever in doubt.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435688644147/002b5baf-b262-4da1-ad06-7e1b32c87fa6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom Jenkins for the Guardian","altText":"Andy Murray","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T17:06:34Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T23:01:39Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":83,"contributors":[{"name":"Kevin Mitchell","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741641/KevinMitchell.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/kevinmitchell"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Andy Murray","Wimbledon 2015","Wimbledon","Tennis","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/andymurray","webTitle":"Andy Murray"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Kevin Mitchell","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/kevinmitchell"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/30/andy-murray-wimbledon-mikhail-kukushkin","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9f3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/30/andy-murray-wimbledon-mikhail-kukushkin","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/30/andy-murray-wimbledon-mikhail-kukushkin"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435688644147/002b5baf-b262-4da1-ad06-7e1b32c87fa6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray struggled in the second set before regaining his composure to win in straight sets.

In August 2012 Mark Cavendish had landed 23 stage wins in five Tours, a rate more prolific than any sprinter’s in the race’s history. The all-time stage-victory record of 34, held by Eddy Merckx, looked mathematically within his reach if he kept it up but that was before the rise of Marcel Kittel, the only sprinter who has truly troubled the Manxman since he hit his stride in 2008.</p> \n<p>A brace of stage wins for Cavendish in 2013 could not hide the fact that on a straight road, side by side, Kittel was faster time after time. In 2014 worse occurred: having hit his best form for the Tour de France start in Yorkshire, Cavendish’s Tour was over almost before it had begun <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/05/mark-cavendish-crashes-marcel-kittel-tour-de-france-stage-one\">thanks to his finish-line crash in Harrogate</a>, a double disaster because it meant the question of whether Kittel was truly the fastest in 2014 was not answered.</p> \n<p>Roll forward 12 months and Kittel is on the sidelines after a season where he has been plagued by illness, unable to hold the pace when he competes, and has notched up one abandon after another. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/marcel-kittel-not-picked-2015-tour-de-france-cycling\">The German powerhouse is out of the Tour</a>, unhappy with his Giant-Alpecin team’s decision not to select him, and his future is in question. Cavendish, on the other hand, was in flying form en route to the silver medal at the British road championships on Sunday, looking lean and hungry and devouring the one-in-four climb of Lincoln’s Michaelgate time after time.</p> \n<p>If Cavendish is in form now,<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/nov/26/mark-cavendish-never-taken-tour-de-france-for-granted-interview\"> it is the fruit of a campaign that began last July</a> when the collarbone he broke in Harrogate was operated on; he returned rapidly to racing and took a minimal break in the winter, electing to hone his speed in six-day track racing at Gent and Zurich before racing on the road in January.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/28/mark-cavendish-peter-kennaugh-british-championships\">Peter Kennaugh lands British road race title from close-at-hand Mark Cavendish</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>More recently he has followed training at his base in Tuscany with the Tour of Switzerland – the toughest stage race he could remember riding for several years in terms of workload – and more big days training on his native island.</p> \n<p>“What people forget when they compare Cav and other riders is that Mark has been at the top for so long,” said his long-standing confidant Brian Holm in Lincoln. “It takes something very special to win so much over so many years. He has been on his game since 2007, always hungry, always winning. Not many manage to do that. They are good for a while, they fade, they come back.”</p> \n<p>“Kittel not being there has opened the door for Cavendish but Cav is riding really well anyway,” says the three-times green jersey and 12-times stage winner, Robbie McEwen of Australia. “His form this year is so good, the way he’s been riding in general, the way he looked on Sunday, that he could take on Kittel anyway but Kittel was the one rider he really had to fear.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/may/02/mark-cavendish-life-saddle-i-love-to-win-tour-of-turkey-cycling\">Mark Cavendish on life in the saddle: 'I just love to win'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Given there are bonus seconds on offer in the early stages, a decent time trial on Saturday could put Cavendish in contention for the yellow jersey. But the points winner’s <em>maillot vert</em> may prove a bridge too far given the number of hillier stages that will favour better climbers such as the double points champion Peter Sagan, Australia’s Michael Matthews and the Norwegian Alexander Kristoff.</p> \n<p>Kittel’s absence alters the balance of the entire sprint battle; the dominant force in the last two Tours is absent and Giant’s No2, John Degenkolb, is not the equal of his fellow German. That sets up a generational battle. On the one side are the 30-year-old Cavendish and his former HTC-Colombia team-mate Andr&eacute; Greipel – now 32 but as consistent a force as the Manxman in recent years – and on the other an emerging generation spearheaded by the Frenchman Nacer Bouhanni, a former boxer who was deprived of the chance to ride in 2014 because of a dispute with his then-team manager, Marc Madiot.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/nov/26/mark-cavendish-never-taken-tour-de-france-for-granted-interview\">Mark Cavendish: ‘I’ve never taken the Tour for granted. I missed it so much’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Greipel, in McEwen’s view, is Cavendish’s biggest worry, mainly because his team look to have fractionally more horsepower. “[Cavendish’s] Etixx aren’t the strongest sprint team. They aren’t completely built around Cav,” – the Manxman has described them as a stage-winning team rather than a pure sprint team – “and, if Greipel’s team, Lotto-Soudal, can get their sprint train over Etixx, he’ll threaten. They might just have the edge when it comes to controlling the sprint.”</p> \n<p>Bouhanni’s form is in question after his heavy crash on Sunday in the French national championship and his Cofidis team is untested at this level. France can look to two other decent sprinters although neither Arnaud D&eacute;mare nor Bryan Coquard has Bouhanni’s record, and they have yet to prove themselves in the Tour. “D&eacute;mare hasn’t made big progress in the last two years and Coquard lacks the horsepower in a flat sprint,” says McEwen. “All things being equal Cav should be untouchable.”</p> \n<h2>Contenders for green jersey</h2> \n<p><strong>Mark Cavendish</strong> The Manxman is set to hit the Tour in his best form, having looked light and sharp at the British national championship on Sunday. He has had a trouble-free season, apart from a crash at Tirreno-Adriatico, and has notched up 13 wins already. He has a team built around him and eight years of experience to call on, meaning he can target stages which arenot pure sprint days. <strong>Prediction</strong> Three stage wins.</p> \n<p><strong>Andr&eacute; Greipel </strong>Cavendish’s former team-mate is now 32 but keeps rolling out the wins, this year adding a stage in the Giro; he has taken at least one stage in all the four Tours he has ridden and should add to the list. Whereas Cavendish relies on pure speed and technical skill, the German is a straight-road sprinter who works off wattage. His poor climbing means the green jersey is unlikely. <strong>Prediction</strong> Two stage wins.</p> \n<p><strong>Peter Sagan</strong> The 25-year-old Slovak will be in the mix from day one as the 20-odd corners in the time trial will suit his technical skill and speed. An all-rounder rather than a pure sprinter he will be an outsider in the flat stages, but can target the win on a dozen days and should take a third points title. The only worry is how Tinkoff-Saxo will aligning his needs with their leader’s, Alberto Contador; most likely he will get a free rein but minimal support. <strong>Prediction</strong> Two stage wins and green jersey.</p> \n<p><strong>Alexander Kristoff</strong> The most successful rider this year with 15 victories, the Norwegian is the world’s best at races which marry climbing, sprinting and tactical nous. Like Sagan he lacks the pure speed to outgun Cavendish or Greipel but he will fight hard for the green jersey and will shine on hilly stages such as Rodez, Valence and Gap. He will enjoy better team support than Sagan,but that may not be enough. <strong>Prediction</strong> Two stage wins.</p> \n<p><strong>Nacer Bouhanni</strong> France’s biggest hope for a pure sprint stage win after his victories last year at the Giro and Vuelta, Bouhanni is strong, fast and brave – and can get over the hills - but his team is his Achilles heel: Cofidis are inexperienced compared to Greipel and Cavendish’s “trains”. His good form in June – two stage wins at the Dauphin – was marred by a crash last weekend, but a single victory in his second Tour will suffice for him and his team. <strong>Prediction</strong> One stage win.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435680895387/Mark-Cavendish-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mark Cavendish was in flying form en route to the silver medal at the British road championships on Sunday, looking lean and hungry.

He said Salazar deserves the “benefit of the doubt” but said he would definitely leave his coach if the allegations are ever proved. Farah welcomed investigations by Usada and Ukad into the claims against Salazar but said his accusers should talk to the authorities rather than making allegations in the media.</p> \n<p>“They need to go to the right people. And I encourage anyone, Kara [Goucher], the rest of the guys, to go to the right people and let’s get to the bottom of this,” he told Sky Sports News from his training camp in the Pyrenees, where he is preparing for a return to the track next week in Lausanne. “It’s killing me, it’s killing my family. There are people there who are the painting the picture of me: ‘Oh, Mo Farah he’s on this.’ I am not anything. Trust me.”</p> \n<p>Goucher is one of 19 witnesses who have lined up to testify against Salazar and the Nike Oregon Project since the BBC and the US website ProPublica made the initial allegations.</p> \n<p>“I was shocked. I couldn’t believe what I saw. For me when I saw it afterwards I wanted answers so I spoke to Alberto and he gave me answers. I was the first person to say: ‘What’s going on?’”Farah said.</p> \n<p>The long-distance runner has since said he was satisfied with Salazar’s 11,700-word rebuttal against allegations that included claims he had given the 2012 Olympic silver medallist Galen Rupp testosterone when he was 16 and that he abused the Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) process.</p> \n<p>“I wanted him to come out because these are allegations about him, not me. I wanted him to come out publicly and tell the people,” said Farah.</p> \n<p>“I work so hard to do what I do. It’s taken me half of my life to achieve what I have achieved and for people to think I’m taking a short cut is not right. I’m 100% clean. I love what I do and I want to continue to win medals but I want people to know I’ve never taken any drugs.”</p> \n<p>But he said if it was proven Salazar had “crossed the line” or manipulated the system he would sever ties with the coach. “Boom! I’m out. Trust me. I work every day hard, I put my body through hell. Every year, seven months of the year, I’m away from my family. Year in, year out. I don’t see my family. I miss my kids. I miss my kids’ birthdays, our anniversary,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Those are times I can never go back and share with my kids. And that really kills me. To be labelled something you are not, to have people label me as a cheat, it’s not fair and it’s not right.</p> \n<p>“If I am a cheat, prove that I am cheat. Or just leave me alone. Let me do what I do best. And that’s to run, to represent my country and make my country be proud. Seventy-five-thousand people were there in London, cheering for me, shouting out my name. I will never let them down. If people say I am a cheat, I am crossing the line, then prove I’m crossing the line.”</p> \n<p>UK Athletics has promised to complete its own review into whether it should retain Salazar as a consultant by early August, while the Usada and UKAD investigations are ongoing.</p> \n<p>“These are just allegations. If they are proven and UKAD and Usada find something wrong then I am the first person to run but you have to give people a chance in life,” said Farah. “Someone who has helped so much in your career you have to give them the benefit of the doubt.”</p> \n<p>Farah also attempted to explain in detail why he missed two drug tests before London 2012. If he had missed a third within the same 18 month period, he would have missed the Olympics. “I was in Teddington. I was staying in one of the Kenyan’s houses. I was just racing. I was staying at the top floor. And I didn’t hear the buzzer. I was sleeping in my tent. I didn’t hear it. That was the genuine thing. I am not going to lie about it. I know I shouldn’t have done it,” he said.</p> \n<p>“There are a lot of athletes who have missed tests and they never seem to come out in public. So why me? Let me tell you this: I have taken 148 tests since 2007, I have taken 103 tests since 2012 Olympics. And every single one of them has been negative. So I can’t win.”</p> \n<p>Farah’s agent Ricky Simms subsequently tried to prove that he couldn’t hear UKAD’s doping control officers ringing the bell in a failed attempt to get the missed test struck from the record.</p> \n<p>The runner was backed by other athletes after his missed tests were made public, with Steve Cram suggesting he was the victim of a “witch hunt”.</p> \n<p>Farah also attempted to explain why his performances had improved markedly once he made the decision in 2011 to train with Salazar in Oregon.</p> \n<p>“I have always had the talent. As a youngster I had the talent but I never learned to win big races. It always came down to the last lap,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Now I’ve learned how to have more speed at the end of the races. It’s about taking advantage of the facilities and being stronger at the end. Alberto has helped me.”</p> \n<p>In a passage of the interview that echoed Lance Armstrong’s admission of drug taking in his interview with Oprah Winfrey, Farah was challenged over whether he had ever taken testosterone, EPO, HGH or any performance enhancing drugs.</p> \n<p>“No never,” he insisted, adding that the only medication he took was for the asthma he has had since he was a child.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/30/1435682416393/Mo-Farah-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mo Farah says the uncertainty over doping allegations is 'killing' him and his family.

Graham Rowntree, England’s forwards’ coach, is in no doubt that the time his squad have together now will lend them an advantage over the southern hemisphere teams, who will spend the next couple of months contesting this year’s truncated Tri Nations.</p> \n<p>“Absolutely, I would choose to do it this way,” Rowntree said, as he took time out from his squad’s conditioning programme — for which read anguish and flagellation — to assure that the hosts will be in the shape of their lives come September. The trade-off is between fitness and match hardness, with England relying for the latter on three warm-up games against France (twice) and Ireland.</p> \n<p>“We’ve planned this for two years. And those warm-up games are good. These guys need time to build sufficient base-level fitness. You can’t do what we’re doing now in a Six Nations or an autumn campaign. This way we get plenty of time to get hold of them. You can change a player, how he looks, get him as fit as possible. What we’re putting them through is very tough, the toughest I’ve seen.”</p> \n<p>The sunny terraces and dickie-bowed waiters of Pennyhill Park cut a wicked contrast with the toil Rowntree spoke of just a couple of hundred yards down a leafy lane. The Surrey hotel has been England’s base, off and on, since the Clive Woodward era, but it has been colonised by them in recent years.</p> \n<p>The press have yet to be admitted to the training centre they have built next to the full-size rugby pitch, so unspeakable are the tortures practised within. “They’re working as hard as they can,” said a deadpan Rowntree, “and we’ll continue to push them. We’ve got a horrible session lined up for them this afternoon, which is as it should be. They need that training to reach the fitness levels we aspire to.”</p> \n<p>Rowntree apologised repeatedly as he dabbed the sweat from his brow. He had been running himself in the heat a couple of hours earlier. He often referred to the meticulous planning behind England’s campaign but the coincidence of the heatwave represents a bonus to cheer any sadistic fitness coach. With all the gizmos attached to the modern rugby player in training, one can be sure that when a coach tells us this is the hardest his boys have ever trained he has the data to prove it.</p> \n<p>The All Blacks are held up as setting the standard to aspire to — indeed, to surpass. England finished the Six Nations with a try-fest against the French and they are promising more of the same this autumn. “We are aspiring to high ball-in-play minutes. There are teams around the world who are leading that at the moment and we want to be at the front of it. We’ve played New Zealand a lot recently, and the ball has been in play more against them than against anyone. Minute-wise, it’s in the late 30s. And that’s challenging. We want to get to around 40 minutes a game, ball in play, challenging teams, playing exciting rugby.”</p> \n<p>Next week the 50-man squad will be trimmed by five before leaving for two weeks of more pain, albeit with the promise of a rugby ball thrown in, at altitude in Denver. Ben Morgan, whom Rowntree described as in the shape of his life, is well on track to feature there, following the broken leg he suffered in January.</p> \n<p>After the disciplinary disruptions of the past few weeks, there is a mood of positivity in England’s camp. And, on that discipline front, they seem to have struck upon an effective policy of prevention. No one can misbehave if they do not have the energy.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435698493670/Graham-Rowntree-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The England forwards coach, Graham Rowntree, has been promising pain for the players as they attempt to get into the shape of their lives before this autumn's World Cup.
