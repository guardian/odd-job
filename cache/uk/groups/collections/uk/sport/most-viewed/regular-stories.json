The emails, sent just a month before Magness left the Nike Oregon Project in June 2012, show Salazar was happy for Magness to lead sessions in a 10-day period while Salazar was away and to become the coach of the 3,000m steeplechaser Lindsay Allen.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/allegations-alberto-salazar-response\">Ten allegations against Alberto Salazar, his response and where this leaves us</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was Magness who made the most serious allegations against Salazar and Galen Rupp, the 10,000m silver medallist at London 2012 – including claims that Rupp had used testosterone as a 16-year-old and that Salazar had tested testosterone gel on his son, Alex, to see how much could be used without breaking anti-doping rules. But while the two men have fallen out spectacularly, emails sent in May 2012 suggest Salazar still respected and trusted his No2.</p> \n<p>In one email, sent on 8 May, Salazar tells Magness: “I just spoke with Lindsay and I think that’s a great idea for you to take over her coaching. I was trying to move to that eventually but didn’t want Lindsay to think that I didn’t want to coach her. She needs to train with other top woman runners to fulfil her potential. With Tara [Erdmann] hopefully coming in you will have three women all training together. If you injure her, I will kill you. Ha ha! See you both on Friday.”</p> \n<p>Salazar’s joke shows that he is a much more rounded character than his critics, who tend to focus on his intense, win-at-all-costs mentality, appreciated. At the same time, they call into question his account in his open letter in which he is deeply critical of Magness. In it he wrote: “Magness lacked the personality, inter-personal skills and drive to be able to coach elite athletes. He appeared to be intimidated by them and he retreated. He could not run a practice session by himself. He appeared to be unable to motivate the athletes as they ran or observe them. Ultimately, my top runners refused to work with him.”</p> \n<p>But another email from Salazar in early May – which was sent to David Hendry, the strength and conditioning coach at the Nike Oregon Project, and Darren Treasure, the high performance sports consultant – told them: “I’m going to stay with Matthew [Centrowitz] in Portland and keep him motivated. Steve knows the guys good enough that I have complete confidence he’ll take care of all of them.”</p> \n<p>As Magness said in a statement sent to the Guardian: “it seems strange that he would hand over his star athletes for 10 days leading up to the Olympic trials and say that he has ‘complete confidence’ in my ability to look after them if he felt what he now claims about my abilities as a coach. That doesn’t fit the narrative Salazar is currently attempting to weave.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Dr Jeffrey Brown, the doctor who Salazar says carried out tests to ensure his athletes were not sabotaged by testosterone cream, also appeared to dispute his claims. In an interview with the US news website ProPublica, which cooperated with Panorama, Brown said he had not prescribed a controlled substance for Salazar’s sons or other research subjects as part of an experiment.</p> \n<p>“No, absolutely not,” Brown said. “I didn’t do that, and would not do that. I would never do that.” He said that he was merely advising Salazar on how to conduct research on potential sabotage “in a hypothetical situation”. He said that Salazar’s exploration of potential testosterone sabotage was admirable.Brown also denied claims that he had prescribed the thyroid medication Cytomel to Kara Goucher in 2011 for her weight loss, telling ProPublica that while he could not discuss individual patients, “I would never, ever give somebody Cytomel for weight loss, ever”. The massage therapist John Stiner also insisted he was telling the truth when he revealed that Salazar had told him he was taking AndroGel, a banned testosterone gel, for his heart. Salazar had claimed that he told him it was for energy but Stiner told ProPublica: “I told 100% the truth. I’ll take 20 lie detector tests.Of course he said I’m lying.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/alberto-salazar-statement-nike-steve-magness-mo-farah-bbc-panorama-claims\">Alberto Salazar rebuttal: starting pistol for a race heading for the courts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>However Salazar received a glowing endorsement from Greg and Jamie Rupp, the parents of Galen Rupp, who said that he had been like “a second father” to their son. “I was very jealous of Alberto for a little while when Galen was in high school,” said Greg Rupp. “He would tell Galen to do something, and Galen would hop to it. But I couldn’t have picked a better role model for Galen to be involved with.

I think that’s lifted everyone’s morale. I think for myself personally, I feel as if I’ve come into the race with a lot less pressure on my shoulders.</p> \n<p>“I feel a lot more relaxed this time around, not coming in as the defending champion. I’ve got a really strong team around me. The way the Tour is structured this year, I think it’s really building up to be such an epic battle between the big rivals, the big GC contenders; probably the biggest battle we’ve seen for years in the Tour de France. It’s exciting; really exciting and we can’t wait to get the show on the road.”</p> \n<p>A sizeable obstacle was removed from his path on Thursday when the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/tour-de-france-organisers-stage-20-col-du-galibier-landslide\" title=\"\">Col du Galibier climb was taken off the schedule</a> for the 20th stage due to landslides. However another was swiftly put in its place when the route from Modane to Alpe d’Huez was diverted over the Col de la Croix de Fer. One show Sky will not be getting on the road is the motor home Froome had been hoping to sleep in each night, after the UCI put a stop to their wheeze of having their team leader avoid hotels designated by the race organisers.</p> \n<p>“I think it’s unfortunate they’ve taken that decision,” said Froome.“I think it was purely just from a performance point of view. I could only see it as being a good thing to be able to control those factors, where you get into some of those race hotels and one night you’re on a hard bed, one night you’re on a soft bed and you wake up with a sore back. Some of the rooms without air conditioning in mid-July in France … you’re just going to be sweating for 10 hours.”Froome will need all the good sleep he can get, as his uninterrupted nights of rest are numbered – the cyclist looked chuffed to announce that he and his wife Michelle are expecting their first child at the end of this year.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435238540255/Chris-Froome-in-Tour-de-F-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chris Froome will be hoping, once again, to be out in front when the Tour de France begins.

Honestly, you should be right to be depressed about the near-future of your team. The Batum trade, they sent him to the Charlotte Hornets for Gerald Henderson and Noah Vonleh, was a clear signal that the Trail Blazers weren’t expecting LaMarcus Aldridge back, a feeling that was reinforced by rumors that came out this afternoon.

The British No1 is hungry to learn both about her chosen profession and the world that exists beyond the baseline grind.</p> \n<p>“I absolutely loved school,” Watson says, suddenly sounding like she is in a job interview. “I don’t think many people say that but you have all your friends there, you’re learning, you’re having fun. I really enjoyed it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/eugenie-bouchard-aegon-international-retires\">Eugenie Bouchard retires hurt but says ‘I’ll play Wimbledon on one leg’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Watson has an inquisitive mind. Perhaps that is not surprising. Tennis players are always thinking, even when it looks as if they are acting on instinct alone. Sometimes it must appear that way to them when they are playing. The speed of the exchanges compels them to react in split-second moments which can make it seem as though the thought process is nonexistent, yet their brains are constantly whirring, telling them which shots to hit at different pointsin a rally, and straining to keep negative thoughts at bay when the chips are down.</p> \n<p>During Watson’s swift <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/johanna-konta-beats-garbine-muguruza-eastbourne\" title=\"\">6-2, 6-3 defeat to Sloane Stephens</a> in the third round of the Aegon Open on Wednesday the importance of positivity was clear. When Watson twice dropped her serve to trail 3-0 after 10 one-sided minutes she must have feared that Stephens would bagel her. It could have happened. Stephens, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/28/heather-watson-sloane-stephens-french-open\" title=\"\">who beat Watson in the French Open last month</a>, was threatening to devour her.</p> \n<p>In her first two matches Watson scrapped to wins over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/heather-watson-varvara-lepchenko-eastbourne\" title=\"\">Varvara Lepchenko</a>, the world No38, and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/23/jo-konta-beats-ekaterina-makarova-eastbourne\" title=\"\">Elina Svitolina</a>, the world No17. This time her battling instincts could not save her against an opponent who now has two wins over her this summer but at least Watson could tell herself that she refused to fold. Although it does not look like much to the naked eye, especially with Wimbledon starting on Monday, it could be something to build on.</p> \n<p>Watson is interested in psychology. “I’ve always thought about taking up a college course while I’m on the road, just to keep my mind going, but I actually haven’t done it yet,” she says. “Tennis does keep me quite busy. I was very interested in psychology at school. Maybe later on something in finance, even though that sounds quite boring.”</p> \n<p>As Watson grows older, she is becoming wiser.</p> \n<p>She has learnt from her past mistakes and knows that she returned too soon after she had <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/apr/03/british-no2-heather-watson-glandular-fever\" title=\"\">glandular fever two years ago</a>. Having reached the third round of Wimbledon in 2012, losing to the eventual finalist <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2012/jun/29/heather-watson-agnieszka-radwanska-live\" title=\"\">Agnieszka Radwanska</a>, she lost badly to Madison Keys in the first round.</p> \n<p>“I came back too soon,” she says. “I wasn’t fully better yet. I was just desperate to come back. I didn’t want to miss a slam or anything like that. Last year when I had the rib or shoulder injury, I missed one of my favourite tournaments of the year in Estoril because I knew it wasn’t right. You have to be patient, even though it sucks. It took me a while and I lost a bit of confidence because I wasn’t winning matches straight off the bat and I expected myself to. I just had to be patient and really fight my way back.” Despite Watson’s defeat to Stephens this is a promising era for women’s tennis in Britain, with Laura Robson back from the injury that has kept her out for 17 months and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/23/jo-konta-beats-ekaterina-makarova-eastbourne\" title=\"\">Johanna Konta wowing the crowds in Eastbourne</a>.</p> \n<p>Watson has slipped to 64th in the world but she is resolute in her belief that she can be a top-20 player one day. Although she has never been past the third round of a grand slam, the 23-year-old is still developing.</p> \n<p>“I think I’m kind of a late bloomer,” she says. “I did well in the juniors but later on, towards the end. Even in my career, I’ve had a few hiccups. I haven’t had amazing results and then terrible ones,I’ve just been gradually climbing my way up. I think I definitely have the tennis for it. I need to keep working on my mind and help that bring it out.”</p> \n<p>Watson says she remembers all of her matches, even when she was in the juniors, and she recalls going to Wimbledon as a little girl.</p> \n<p>“I went there once actually,” she says. “My mum’s friend from Guernsey had two tickets that year and she could have brought anybody but she told my mum: ‘Look, I’ll take Heather.’ She took me there and it was for the semi-finals. It was Venus Williams against … I can’t remember.” That probably annoyed her.“I was about seven or eight and it’s amazing that Venus is still playing and I can say I’ve played on tour against her,” she continues. “Just seeing it, I remember telling her: ‘I’m gonna play here one day,’ and everybody’s like: ‘Yeah, OK, Heather.’ To be playing there now, I’m just so pleased.”</p> \n<p>The Wimbledon draw is on Friday and Watson will find out who she is playing in the first round in her own time. Then she will focus. “That’s the tournament I want to do best in,” Watson says. “I always look forward to it. I really, really, really want to do well there this year.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435268844578/Heather-Watson-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"British No1 Heather Watson is eager to improve her record at Wimbledon.

The hosts could not have been more accommodating.</p> \n<p>They delivered a warm, sunny day, a placid, brown pitch and upon winning the toss they decorously invited the tourists to bat first. This was not because Sam Northeast, Kent’s captain, spotted any moisture in the pitch, nor because he sensed his patchwork attack was in the mood to knock over the Aussies. The tourist game is a moneyspinner for impoverished counties and it is important that it should last four days. And Kent have not been batting very well.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/ashes-2015-four-key-australia-players-steve-smith-mitchell-starc-adam-voges-josh-hazlewood-england\">Ashes 2015: Four key Australia players for England to contend with</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The grassy banks were full and those reclining there watched the Australians gently take apart a team which are languishing at the bottom of Division Two. It would be a grave disappointment to Andrew Strauss and Trevor Bayliss, and the rest of the nation, if batting continued to be as straightforward for the Australians throughout the rest of the tour.</p> \n<p>No one failed unless the 56 and 84 compiled by Michael Clarke and Chris Rogers respectively is considered failure in these days of hyper-inflation (we are talking cricket scores here, not ticket prices). Perhaps the tourists would have preferred something more demanding despite earnest spells from Mitchell Claydon, originally from New South Wales, and an encouraging effort from the 21-year-old Matthew Hunn, who took the only wickets to fall.</p> \n<p>Shaun Marsh hit a smooth century. He is a dry West Aussie and the son of Geoff, and he admitted to being a “bit surprised” when the Australians were invited to bat before adding “but we’re not complaining”. Clarke and Steve Smith, captain and heir apparent, enjoyed themselves in the final session. Smith has scored runs in these parts before. He once had a season for Sevenoaks Vine CC in the days when no one was quite sure whether he was a wrist spinner or a batsman. For Smith there is no identity crisis anymore.</p> \n<p>The Australians, World Cup winners and on a roll in Test cricket, have a fair amount to be confident about but there are issues to be decided before the first Test in Cardiff in just under a fortnight. One of them is the identity of David Warner’s opening partner.</p> \n<p>Rogers is now 37, not the sort of age when one is selected to carry the drinks in what will be his last Test series. However, there is the slight complication that Rogers missed the Test series in the Caribbean because he was suffering from concussion. So technically he is not the incumbent. On 21, he offered one straightforward chance to Adam Riley at second slip off the perspiring Claydon and it was dropped. Thereafter he played with his usual pragmatism – he never aspires to elegance – until he was lbw to Hunn.</p> \n<p>Marsh, a slightly more beguiling left-hander, took a little longer to find his touch but was soon tapping the ball to the boundary with barely a hiccup. So the selectors have the happy knowledge that both openers are in reasonably good touch.</p> \n<p>Hence they are likely to trust their original instincts, which is probably good news for Rogers. He has first-hand knowledge of England and of Lord’s in particular. Marsh himself admitted Rogers had been “fantastically helpful in passing on his knowledge of English conditions”. There was no evidence of attempted run-outs. This feels like a happy and unified Australian team.</p> \n<p>There are other issues to decide before Cardiff. The expectation is that Adam Voges, who made his Test debut in the Caribbean at the age of 35, will be another Middlesex captain to make the final XI there. Meanwhile Shane Watson must be the favourite to keep Mitchell Marsh, Shaun’s younger brother, on the sidelines.</p> \n<p>On the bowling front there is the dilemma over Ryan Harris. He missed the Caribbean tour but he has been the scourge of the Poms in recent Ashes series – 57 of his 113 Test wickets have been against England at 20 apiece. However, to find a place for Harris, which must seem like a good idea, Josh Hazlewood would have to give way and he performed superbly against West Indies. Hence Harris’s fitness and potency will be examined closely today.</p> \n<p>Apart from Hunn’s trio of illustrious wickets there was not much to celebrate for the home side – except that the crowds flocked in. The match offered a chance for the highly rated Adam Riley, the 23-year-old off-spinner who often, but not always, keeps James Tredwell out of the Kent championship side, to display his wares.</p> \n<p>In exacting circumstances he did not make much of an impression. Riley is a tall man but is not making the most of his height as he delivers the ball. No matter who bowls spin against them on this tour the Australians are minded to give him a hard time.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435259632658/Shaun-Marsh-Australians-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Shaun Marsh hit 114 for the Australians in an opening stand of 181 with Chris Rogers against Kent.

I&nbsp;actually took a picture of it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/alberto-salazar-defence-doctor-magness-emails\">Alberto Salazar’s defence under strain as witnesses dispute coach’s version of events</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>In his open letter, Salazar claimed Rupp was taking a natural and legal testosterone supplement – possibly Testaboost, Alpha Male or ZMA – that was incorrectly recorded. “My clear recollection is that when [Magness] showed it to me, I stated that the entry was ‘crazy’ as Galen had never taken testosterone. I then stated that Galen, as a 16-year-old kid, must have misspoken about the supplements he was taking. I told Magness to take it back to the lab and have them straighten things out. I didn’t think much of it afterwards since I knew it was a mistake and because Magness never mentioned it again.” Both Salazar and Rupp strenuously deny the athlete took testosterone.</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Photographic evidence exists of the reports, so it comes down to whether it was incorrectly recorded. Meanwhile Magness has responded, saying: “I came to my superior, Salazar, and asked for answers. It would have been a simple clarification to make at the time for him to contact Dr Loren Myhre [the Nike lab’s then head physiologist, who died in 2012], someone who he had worked with for at least a decade, to clear up the confusion. If I saw an official medical chart naming one of my athletes being on testosterone, I think it’s any normal person’s reaction to get to the bottom of it.”</p> \n<h2><strong>2. Rupp used prednisone, a powerful asthma drug banned in competition, aged 16</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>The Panorama presenter Mark Daly spoke to Stuart Eagon, a former running colleague of Rupp, who told him of an incident in 2003 involving prednisone, which can block pain and enhance oxygen consumption and is prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency in competition. “We were going on our morning run and Alberto said to Galen: ‘Have you taken your prednisone yet this morning?’” said Eagon. Daly added: “I have heard from various sources that Rupp has used prednisone regularly, but he has asthma and allergies, which could account for its use.”</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>An emphatic denial. “The claims that Galen has been on prednisone continuously since he was 15 are absolutely false. The BBC and ProPublica ‘reporters’ were informed that these allegations were completely false, and they should not have printed them. Printing false statements to harm Galen is irresponsible journalism that damaged an innocent athlete’s reputation – Galen has never taken prednisone for a competitive advantage.” Rupp has always denied taking any banned substances.</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Salazar appears to have strong evidence that Rupp was not taking prednisone regularly. However as David Epstein, the ProPublica reporter who worked closely with Panorama, points out, that was not the claim. “The BBC published a document showing that Rupp had apparently taken prednisone during one time period when he was 16. The story did not report allegations of continuous use nor cite the age 15.”</p> \n<h2><strong>3. Testosterone (AndroGel) was found at a Nike Oregon Project training camp</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Panorama spoke to John Stiner, a massage therapist who worked for Salazar in 2008, who said that Salazar told him he was using AndroGel – a banned steroid – for his heart. “He said to me: ‘I don’t want you to get the wrong idea.’ And I said: ‘OK.’ I was really unsure what he meant and he goes: ‘There’s a tube of AndroGel in the bedroom and it’s under some clothing.’ He said: ‘It’s for my heart, it’s all fucked up.’” The BBC said that using testosterone gel could actually make a heart problem worse.</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>He accepts that he uses testosterone but says he never told Stiner it was for his heart and has never given it to his athletes. “My excessive training as an athlete did extensive damage to my body,” he said. “One of the lingering negative effects from which I still suffer today is hypogonadism with significant symptoms, including multiple low testosterone serum levels. There is no question that I have a valid justification for my possession of AndroGel as defined by the Wada code. I have never given AndroGel to any of my athletes.”</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>With broad agreement that Salazar was on testosterone. However Stiner insists he was right to say Salazar said it was for his heart. “I told 100% the truth,” he told ProPublica. “I’ll take 20 lie detector tests. Of course he said I’m lying.” The BBC says Salazar did not respond to questions sent regarding the reason he would be prescribed testosterone that were sent in early May.</p> \n<h2><strong>4. Salazar brought assorted vials and needles to a training camp</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Following the original Panorama and ProPublica revelations, Stiner also told the Daily Mail that he found vials in the fridge labelled “allergy one” and “allergy two” and a bag of unused hypodermic needles in the bathroom of one of the apartments the Nike Oregon Project rented while in Utah in 2008. Meanwhile the Mail also reported that Magness had also made allegations to the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada), claiming he found an unmarked vial in France that belonged to Rupp.</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>That these vials were simply allergy medicine for Rupp. “Galen has been receiving allergy immunotherapy vaccine injections since approximately 2004. His allergy specialists at the Allergy Clinic in Portland have specially mixed two vaccines for him. Vaccine A: Allergens &amp; Molds contains the following extracts: Cat, Dog, Dust Mites and two types of Molds. Vaccine B: Pollens contains: Mixed Grasses, Ragweeds, and 3 different Weeds common in the Pacific Northwest. Galen must receive weekly injections to help control his allergies and his asthma. All documents related to these medicines and Galen’s treatment for his allergies were provided to Usada in 2013. There is no issue here.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/allegations-alberto-salazar-response\">Ten allegations against Alberto Salazar, his response and where this leaves us</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Salazar’s response is convincing – although it is slightly odd Magness was sent emails from Salazar and Rupp requesting the return of “Galen’s allergy serum” from France given such medicine appeared to be used so frequently.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. Salazar tried to get a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) certificate for Rupp at the 2011 world championships</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Kara Goucher, the 10,000m bronze medallist at the 2007 world championships, told Panorama and ProPublica that Salazar had coached Rupp to try to get a TUE for an intravenous drip before the 2011 World Championships. Under Wada rules, such drips are prohibited and anyone caught manipulating the TUE process to get one would be liable for a ban.</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>That the allegation is false – and he has documentation that backs him up. “As the US team doctor has confirmed, at no time did I request the US team doctor to give Galen an IV or saline drip while he was in Daegu in 2011,” he said. “Galen did not receive any vitamin shots in Daegu. The US team doctors did not have any needles and UK Athletics doctors could not treat a US athlete.”</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Again at a stalemate. ProPublica says other people back up Goucher’s claim but Salazar is adamant it wasn’t the case.</p> \n<h2><strong>6. Rupp said he was tired after the 2011 World Championships in South Korea yet ran a personal best soon afterwards</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>The BBC quoted Goucher, who appeared to suggest Rupp’s improvement between races was suspicious. “I had a conversation with Galen in 2011 and he told me how tired he was and how he was so excited to have the season be over,” she said. “You don’t get to the end of a long year burnt out and take two weeks off and come out and run the best race of your life, that’s not how it works.”</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>As Salazar points out, when Rupp ran in Daegu it was 80F (26.6C) and the heat wouldn’t have suited him because he weighed more than other athletes, while in Brussels – where Rupp broke the US record – it was only 59F (15C). He added: “It should be noted that even while making these false allegations against me, neither Kara nor Adam ever claim that I violated the Wada code or IAAF anti-doping rules.”</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Another impasse. Salazar claims Rupp’s improvement in 2011 was no surprise because he had steadily got better throughout his career. Others who have worked at the Nike Oregon Project have told the Guardian that they did not expect Rupp to improve as much as he did in 2011 and 2012.</p> \n<h2><strong>7. Salazar wanted to give Goucher a prescription thyroid drug because she had put on weight after giving birth</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Goucher claimed to Panorama that Salazar had tried to get her to take the prescription thyroid drug Cytomel, saying: “Alberto was always unhappy about my weight after I had Colt, like it was almost as if I didn’t have a child, I’d just like gained 30 pounds. He said: ‘You need to just take some Cytomel.’ Maybe four or five days goes by and Alberto brought me this prescription drug that I didn’t have a prescription for. It has Alberto’s writing on it clear as day.”</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>Salazar has published a trail of email correspondence between the pair which appears to suggest that he did not want Goucher to lose weight more quickly. “I was thrilled with Kara’s weight, body composition and fitness in 2011,” he added. However, he did admit: “There was one time when I gave Kara Cytomel. It was in August 2011 in Daegu, South Korea. I did so after being expressly directed to do so by Kara’s endocrinologist, Dr Brown.”</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Salazar’s evidence appears to back up his claims regarding weight loss. However ProPublica has since spoken to Dr Brown, who says that while he could not discuss individual patients: “I would never, ever give somebody Cytomel for weight loss, ever.” As to the bottle, Brown said: “I don’t write on frickin’ bottles, and if it was mine, you wouldn’t be able to read it.”</p> \n<h2><strong>8. Salazar was happy for his athletes to take banned testosterone medication</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Panorama spoke to another unnamed runner, who worked with Salazar for several years, who said that in 2007 he was feeling run down and went to see Dr Loren Myhre, who “suggested that I go and see an endocrinologist that Alberto and most of the athletes work with, to get testosterone and thyroid. He said: ‘This is what Alberto does. You’ll feel better and you’ll be able to train better,’ and so then I said: ‘Well, isn’t that cheating?’ And he goes: ‘Well no, Alberto does it.’ I did mention something about being, like: ‘Wouldn’t it test positive?’ He said: ‘No, no, no. We’ll get you into the normal range.’”</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>A fierce and emphatic denial. Salazar called these allegations “a remarkable display of irresponsible journalism” adding: “I do not know of a single instance where Dr Myhre ever recommended that an athlete that I was coaching take testosterone whether with a prescription or otherwise.” He added: “To claim ‘That is what Alberto does’ is completely false. It is not what I did then; it’s not what I do now and it’s not what I have ever done.”</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Another impasse. Dr Myhre passed away in 2012, which makes it particularly hard to prove or refute the allegations.</p> \n<h2><strong>9. Rupp received unspecified pills in a paperback thriller</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Magness and Rupp were in D&uuml;sseldorf when Rupp told him he wasn’t feeling well. Magness called Salazar, who he says told him to expect a package. Two days later, a box arrived at his hotel room. Inside it he found a paperback thriller. Confused, he flipped it open. A section of the pages had been hollowed out to form a compartment into which two pills were taped. “At that point,” Magness says, “my mind was like: ‘This is stuff you see in movies, this is extremely strange.’” He handed the pills to Rupp, who he says promptly swallowed them and laughed off the clandestine packaging as typical Salazar antics.</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>Neither Salazar nor Rupp responded to Epstein’s original questions about the hollowed-out book containing pills. But in his statement Salazar says: “Allegations around prednisone in D&uuml;sseldorf are false, and Steve Magness is fully aware of what occurred because he was involved.” Salazar also quotes another time, in Birmingham, where he used unusual packaging via mail. “Noting my peculiar packaging, Galen wrote: ‘You went all Shawshank Redemption on that book and nasal spray. I loved it!!!’</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/alberto-salazar-case-expert-says-athletes-are-particularly-asthma-prone\">Alberto Salazar case: Expert says athletes are particularly asthma-prone</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Depending on your point of view, this either shows that Salazar – for all his reputation for being intense and win-at-all costs – is a secret practical joker, or needs to explain why he didn’t send medicine to his athlete in the normal way.</p> \n<h2><strong>10. Salazar tested testosterone on his son, Alex, in a laboratory to see the levels needed to evade tests</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Salazar’s son was involved in tests to see how much testosterone cream would trigger a positive test. According to Magness, Alex told him they were worried that someone could rub some cream on one of their athletes after a race. Magness said he believed that explanation to be “ludicrous” – and that they were instead trying to figure out how to cheat.</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>Salazar does not mention Alex in his response but does say he “let his paranoia get the best of him” when he asked Dr Brown to “set up an experiment” to see whether it was possible for an athlete to be sabotaged by someone rubbing testosterone on them. Salazar says that when Justin Gatlin, the 100m runner, blamed his positive test for exogenous testosterone on being sabotaged by his massage therapist, Chris Whetstine, a claim Whetstine denied. Salazar claims he was worried the same thing might happen to Rupp – especially when Whetstine rubbed Rupp’s shoulders in 2009.</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>ProPublica have since spoken to Brown, who said he did not prescribe a controlled substance for Salazar’s son or other research subjects as part of an experiment. “No, absolutely not,” Brown said. “I didn’t do that, and would not do that.” He said that he was merely advising Salazar on how to conduct research on potential sabotage “in a hypothetical situation”. He said that Salazar’s exploration of potential testosterone sabotage was admirable.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435264278597/Alberto-Salazar-in-1984-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Salazar, left, running at the US Olympic marathon trials in 1984.
