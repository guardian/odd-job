It should be shown at schools, or at the end of particularly grim EastEnders episodes. During times of extreme global strife, the video should be beamed directly onto the surface of the moon. Because, no matter how hard you try, you will never see a more uplifting video so long as you live.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/13/wimbledon-2015-review-of-the-tournament-guardian-sport\">Wimbledon 2015 review: the best and worst of this year’s tournament</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Why? Because it shows Williams and Djokovic wheeling around joyously, gleefully liberating themselves of the self-imposed pressure it takes to become best in the world at something? Because it shows that even fiercely goal-fixated superbeings are able to cut loose and have fun sometimes?</p> \n<p>No. The video is life-affirming because Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic are rubbish at dancing. In fact, that doesn’t even do it justice. What they do barely even exists in the same galaxy as dancing. Here’s what happens: after they’ve both become Wimbledon champions, Williams and Djokovic find themselves onstage together. Night Fever by the Bee Gees is playing. The pair clasp hands and perform a jokey little victory dance. They stop, but the music doesn’t. So, foolishly, they start dancing again.</p> \n<p>Except it’s not dancing. Not really. It’s the sort of self-conscious imitation of dance that people reluctantly perform at wedding receptions before they get drunk enough to really hammer out some moves. Serena opts for the dead-armed two-steps-forward-two-steps-back style beloved by elderly aunties, while Novak half-heartedly performs what can only be described as a satirical interpretive performance art piece inspired by peak-era John Travolta.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f5c4278856840427400521035b24644d47b4412\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436788549730/29ddca38-56c0-4db0-a529-e52aad672b30-460x460.jpeg\" alt=\"Wimbledon champions/ Clowns 😜 congrats @djokernole we brought back the dance! #championsdinner #Wimbledon #renasarmy I have a lot of pictures get ready!\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wimbledon champions/ Clowns 😜 congrats @djokernole we brought back the dance! #championsdinner #Wimbledon #renasarmy I have a lot of pictures get ready! <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/5EoRgDsTGg/\">Photograph: serenawilliams/Instagram</a></span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But the embarrassment is too much for him, so he quickly drops to his knees. The focus is now solely on Williams, who responds by awkwardly wobbling around and intermittently clapping her hands. He’s put this whole sorry saga on her shoulders. </p> \n<p>Eventually, after the longest six seconds of anyone’s life, he realises the scale of his transgression, clambers to his feet and brings the whole ugly saga to a messy conclusion. It’s the sort of video you can only really watch with your fingers over your eyes and your fist in your mouth.</p> \n<p>But it still needs to be watched, because it is beautiful. It’s a perfectly-timed reminder that these honed, hardbodied athletes, these intimidating reminders of humanity’s limitless potential, are regular people after all. For the smallest possible amount of time, they’re both plunged into terrifyingly unfamiliar territory. They’re raw and exposed, and the best they can hope for is damage control. For 24 wonderful seconds, they’re just like us. They’re us, pulling on a push-door in full sight of our employers. They’re us, asked to improvise a speech on a subject we know nothing about, or tripping up on a cobble in front of a girl we fancy, or accidentally calling our year nine science teacher ‘Mum’.</p> \n<p>Being forced to dance in front of people after a historic sporting victory is the perfect way to ground someone. After seeing the charming hash that Williams and Djokovic made of it, this sort of ego control should really become mandatory after any important accomplishment. Won Wimbledon? Dance. Crowned as King of England? Assemble a Billy bookcase for me. Cured cancer? Great, now ride this unicycle up a wet hill in your pants. </p> \n<p>Forget tennis, this video was the real victory of the weekend. It’s proof that nobody is good at everything. It’s proof that, no matter how red our cape, we’re all still Clark Kent inside. It’s proof that, if he had any sense whatsoever, Andy Murray deliberately threw the semi-final to avoid all of this.

There were questions about our team and not so much about Australia.</p> \n<p>“But that is credit to how our players have played and it’s nice to get that win when everyone contributes. It was not just two people carrying the team home but everyone can walk away from that game feeling like they have contributed.”</p> \n<p>He added: “Because first Tests of a series – especially an Ashes series – are nervy affairs, so no one wants to walk away with no wickets or no runs, feeling like you are trying to find your feet in the series. It is important that not everyone gets too carried away with one Test match.”</p> \n<p>Broad has warned England that, at 1-0 down in the series, Australia will be doubly motivated to correct their performance in that opener and the best way to damage them further will be to win the early exchanges. Either way, the 29-year-old expects another result “It all starts again on Thursday, so we need to get into the game and start well,” he said. “We know Australia have a lot of experience and will come back strongly. Having been in a team who have lost the first Test and are all up for winning the next one, if a team comes out and just hits you straight away with skill it can be quite deflating. So we need to start well. We are also well aware we had a bit of the rub of the green in the last Test. We won the toss, Joe Root got dropped [second ball before scoring a century]and a few decisions went our way. That happens in cricket and it might not be the same this week, so we’re going to have to work hard to get a win. We won’t change the way we play. We want to play attacking and aggressive.”</p> \n<p>With the turnaround between Test matches extended by a day by virtue of the quick result in Cardiff, Broad is happy that England needed only 70 overs to skittle the tourists for 242 on Saturday and are able to head into Lord’s with energy reserves intact.</p> \n<p>“When you are playing good cricket you want to keep playing,” said Broad, speaking at an event for the sponsors Hardys. “We have had back-to-back Tests in the past where there have been 200 overs in the field and you are knackered. But what did we field on Saturday? 60, 70 overs? It’s not taken too much out of the bodies. We are fresh and ready to go. So back-to-back Tests will suit us I’m sure. It’s a pretty good wicket to bat on but there have been a lot of results here. I expect it to be 1-1 or 2-0 at the end of the week.”</p> \n<p>While the two sides did not share a beer after the Cardiff Test, the England team did find a friend to celebrate with in Sir Ian Botham. The former all-rounder spent the Sunday before the series opener speaking to the team as part of a move by the director of England cricket, Andrew Strauss, to tap the knowledge of the greats.</p> \n<p>“We’re trying to get this relationship between ex-players and current players closer because ex-players offer us so much as a team and have so much useful information,” said Broad. “Beefy was a prime example of that, offering us advice and spurring us on each day. So we had a drink with him after the game.</p> \n<p>“When you hear someone like Beefy saying what it meant for him to play in an Ashes series and how proud he was of his playing career, it does spur you on. He gave us a congratulations chat after the Cardiff Test and the whole changing room was in awe of him. Those things are inspiring.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/13/1436814670302/Stuart-Broad-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Stuart Broad said that every member of the England team contributed to the defeat of Australia in the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.

A six-foot tall blond-haired Australian with boundless natural talent, a shirt-busting body and the willpower to bend a match with both bat and ball: this man should have inherited the cricketing earth. Alan Davidson, Richie Benaud, Steve Waugh: in the early years the greats of the local game were queueing up to hail Watto as the next messiah of Australian cricket, a homegrown all-rounder balm to our post-Freddie blues. But we all know what happened next: <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fYjaUdWkAt8/UhqnPYCl86I/AAAAAAAAniQ/JGEgk-qkyP8/s640/Shane+Watson+2.jpg\">the nude calendar work</a>, the frightened night in Brett Lee’s bedroom after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2014/jul/22/the-joy-of-six-sports-ghost-stories\">seeing a ghost in Durham</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/story/265573.html\">the heart attack that turned out to be diarrhoea</a>. </p> \n<p>There was the memoir, Watto, released mid-career at the age of 30 before anything meaningful had been achieved. There were the injuries, many of them, dwarfed only in number by the jokes they spawned. Say what you want about Watto as a batsman, there can be little doubt he had the full range of pulls, nicks and nudges – all of them played from within the confines of his own hamstrings. There was the rejigged bowling action, the move away from weights and the embrace of pilates, the move up the order then back down the order, the constant debate – a national obsession – over whether Watto would be able to keep galloping in like an athletic fridge to send down those monotonous, clumping, sometimes successful looseners. </p> \n<p>But above all, as the selectors have continued to indulge Watson’s long decade of potential, there has been the sense of a player who has steadfastly refused to play the part of the golden child that was thrust upon him from the start. Former coach Mickey Arthur claimed Michael Clarke considered Watson a “cancer on the team”, and as Watto’s booming potential has faded to a squeak, it’s been difficult to shift the images that entrench Watto’s status as an outcast: the hands in the pockets at slip, the forced banter with Clarke and Haddin in between deliveries, the sense, even through Australia’s post-Ashes celebrations in early 2014, that he was only pretending to enjoy himself. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1799adb535f55f93283cb9d6b637029709eaf8d\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a1799adb535f55f93283cb9d6b637029709eaf8d/0_596_3425_1504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watson departs after being dismissed in that most-familiar of ways – leg before – in the second innings of the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"439\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson departs after being dismissed in that most-familiar of ways – leg before – in the second innings of the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is why we should not cry for Watto. Nor should we decry him. Don’t rue the wasted potential, or the frazzled aggression, or the promising starts thrown carelessly away. Give Watto instead the place he deserves in Australian cricket’s rich tradition of outcasts – men who played the game at the highest level, sometimes even with distinction, but somehow never quite fitted in. There are two broad character types that run through the history of Australian cricket: the rebel-larrikins and the brooders. Keith Miller, Neil Harvey, Ian Chappell, Dennis Lillee, Rod Marsh, Merv Hughes, Shane Warne, Ian Healy, Ricky Ponting – these are the type of gregarious, expressive, hot-tempered, hard-drinking cricketers Australia likes. </p> \n<p>But the greats of the 1970s – when our cricketing larrikinism was arguably in its pomp – famously detested Australia’s greatest player of all. Don Bradman was everything Chappell and his cohort were not: remote, spiky, formal, perhaps even a touch intellectual. These qualities made life difficult for Bradman during his playing career, but his supreme talent trumped all.</p> \n<p>In the decades since, however, Bradman has emerged as a kind of spirit father to Australian cricket’s other story: the story of the non-conformists, the dressing room oddballs, the nearly-theres and the not-quite-evers. Several have followed in this less heralded personality mould. Stuart MacGill was so eccentric he drank wine; this, combined with his difficult, over-thinker’s character, made him a marginal presence in the Australian dressing room even in those moments when his career-long deputisation for Shane Warne was at its peak of success. </p> \n<p>Simon Katich played with the neurotic, scratchy intensity of a post-punk frontman. At times throughout his career it was like watching David Byrne open the batting, his strokeplay a concatenation of yelps and squeaks through midwicket. He also gave good brood, as Clarke discovered one night via <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-07-17/history-of-tension-in-australian-cricket-team/4824926\">the application of a Katich hand to his throat</a>. Kim Hughes resigned the national captaincy in tears because, essentially, Lillee and Marsh bullied him out of the job. It was great TV, and even better brooding. Ashley Mallett was Australia’s most successful offspinner until Nathan Lyon, but his contribution has arguably been overlooked amid the fallout of an epic personality clash with the rebel-larrikin and beloved Channel Nine commentator Bill Lawry. The brooder and the hooter: in history’s eyes, only one was going to win.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/12/australia-dads-army-darren-lehmann-england-ashes\">Australia’s Dad’s Army under fire but Darren Lehmann says don’t panic | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What makes Watson so special among this broody group is that, in contrast to many of the others, he looked the part of an all-Australian great. Most of the leading brooders were unlikely athletes: Bradman, Katich, MacGill. But Watto was different. Watto was tall. Watto was strong. Watto was handsome. Watto married a person off TV. Everything about the man, physically, had set him up for success. Perhaps part of the national envenomation towards Watson over the past few days comes from the misery of jilted expectations.</p> \n<p>As a player, Watson never quite figured himself out. At the beginning of his career, he was known more for his bowling than his batting; in the frenzy of Cricket Australia’s post-2005 search for an answer to Andrew Flintoff, he became the solution to The All-Rounder Riddle; later he became a specialist opening batsman, in both forms of the game; then he was tasked with filling the Test team’s Ponting-sized hole at number three. On this Ashes tour, Watson has been preferred as a middle-order batsman over Mitchell Marsh, essentially, on the strength of his bowling. The thinking around how to play Watson has been some of the knottiest, most complex intellectual work produced in Australia this century. </p> \n<p>In sympathy with these sudden, jolting shifts across the spectrum of play, Watson’s management of his own body has been, perhaps inevitably, similarly confused: bulky one day, lissom the next, he’s never hit on the best strategy to tune his frame – this fragile tuba – to its optimal pitch. It’s almost as if the man, having tested seemingly every position in the batting lineup and experimented with wildly divergent styles of bowling and muscular conditioning, has ended up estranged from himself. He’s become a stranger to his own physique. </p> \n<p>In the process, he’s also become a stranger to the Australian dressing room. One of the most illuminating passages in Watto, his 2011 memoir, is where Watson describes his awkward teenage years:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“I never went to parties in high school because I always had cricket the next day, and I never used to smoke pot like everyone else. I loved playing cricket and I wasn’t interested in anything that might interfere with that. As for girls, when I was at school I suppose I was always a bit of a nerd in a way. We weren’t that well-off and I never had all the new fashions. Also, whatever my dad wore, I thought was cool. I guess I was an under-achiever on the social side.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is the credo of the outsider, and that sense of Watto as a liminal presence, despite his physical immensity, has carried over into his place within the national cricketing consciousness. Always wasting the review, a “cancer on the team”, Watto has never truly appeared to be a friend to many in the Australian dressing room. </p> \n<p>Fidgety and watchful, Watson would have made a great Camusian anti-hero. Elsewhere in Watto he explains his reason for pursuing a career in cricket: “I wanted to do something so that people knew I existed.” Making it big in cricket was Watto’s answer to shooting the Arab on the beach. He could have been Australian cricket’s Meursault, a cult legend of affectless indifference and self-estrangement, a kind of Dougie Walters without the tinny and the smile. But to pull the act off, Watto would have had to stop caring. And Watto could never do apathy. The one thing everyone agrees on about Watto is that he cares – too much.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c3562bbc4ca2442c8d01fe6e620b74c4be4052aa\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c3562bbc4ca2442c8d01fe6e620b74c4be4052aa/0_0_3525_2249/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watson, pictured in the slips with captain Michael Clarke and Steve Smith during the first Test in Cardiff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"638\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson, pictured in the slips with captain Michael Clarke and Steve Smith during the first Test in Cardiff.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Brown/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When I was eight, and still dreaming of a career in the baggy green, I would burst into tears whenever I got out. Fortunately, I outgrow the habit by the age of 10. Watto, even at the age of 34, greets every dismissal as if still in the throes of that impending juvenile trauma. He bristles with purpose, but it’s a purpose with no team solidarity; his sporting will is entirely self-centred. This is no criticism. It only reinforces the sense of Watson, assertive but insular, as a richly textured character, his career so layered with missed chances, what-ifs, self-pity and regret, it should really be set to music – perhaps the swampy and disorienting exoticism of Brahms’s Double Concerto or the twilight zone yowl of David Bowie’s I’m Deranged. </p> \n<p>But Watson is not alone, and that’s the point. Katich, MacGill, Hughes and many others have all walked this path before him – a path of lush neurosis and wistful melancholy. As the curtain comes down on this decade-long farce of food poisoning and back pain, the lingering image of Watson will be of the golden boy staring glumly from his tower, trapped in the prison of his own immaculate physique. </p> \n<p>But in time we will see that this was a career fully lived, filled with volatility but somehow so densely predictable in its non-deviation from a mid-30s batting average. In time we will understand Watto not as a beautiful disaster but as the last and most beguiling of the baggy green brooders, these saturnine loners whose guiding athletic purpose has been to supply the minor mode to Australian cricket’s major scale, to live and play – thriving only some of the time – in the shadows on the other side of the mountain. </p> \n<p>Good night, sweet Watto. We thought we loved you, once.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/66728d955c1860123e47b05925a20dd2186e6b7d/0_28_3000_1801/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1801,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Gareth Copley/Getty Images","altText":"“The thinking around how to play Watson has been some of the knottiest, most complex intellectual work produced in Australia this century.”","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a1799adb535f55f93283cb9d6b637029709eaf8d/0_596_3425_1504/3425.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1504,"width":3425,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Watson departs after being dismissed in that most-familiar of ways – leg before – in the second innings of the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.
