There is more to come, the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/21/chris-froome-tour-de-france-paris\">2013 Tour de France winner</a> said, and with the critical final phase of the 2015 Tour still five weeks away, that is precisely as it should be.</p> \n<p>“If I have to be honest, I’d say I’m not quite at my best,” Froome said. “I still have a lot of work to do. I’m exactly where I need to be. We have under three weeks to the Tour now. I still have one or two little things to touch on in term of preparation. Things are looking good.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/14/chris-froome-criterium-dauphine-victory-tour-france-boost\">Chris Froome roars to Dauphin&eacute; victory in pre-Tour de France boost</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After the Dauphin&eacute; Froome was set to remain in the Alps for a few days, to look over some of the mountain stages that run from the Tour’s final Wednesday to Saturday and which will decide the race, as they did when he took the 2013 event.</p> \n<p>The Dauphin&eacute; included one stage over a route identical to the Tour’s stage 17, from Digne to Pra-Loup, and also went over a new Tour climb, the Lacets de Montvernier, but there are two classic major ascents, the Col de la Croix de Fer and Col Galibier, which have not been climbed by the Tour since 2012 and 2011 respectively.</p> \n<p>Froome’s season kicked off strongly, with a stage win and overall title at the Ruta del Sol in southern Spain, but illness then intervened and he was forced to miss the Tirreno-Adriatico stage race in March.</p> \n<p>He did not show strongly at the Ardennes Classics in late April but shortly afterwards at the Tour de Romandie his form looked to be arriving as he rode to third place. That was followed by a three-week spell training at altitude, as is now the norm.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know how Contador and Quintana are going but they’ll be ready just like Nibali will be,” Froome said. “Nibali has got the ability always to be at his best for the big races. However, until we start [the Tour], it’s difficult to say how everyone’s form really is.</p> \n<p>“But it’s important to consider the route too. Look at the first part, until the first rest day [after nine days in the saddle]. There’s the time trial, the Dutch coast, the Mur de Huy, cobbles, the Mur de Bretagne and the team time trial.” Strong rides by Peter Kennaugh, Ian Stannard, Philip Deignan and the Dutchman Wout Poels make it clear his support riders in Team Sky are hitting form at the right time as well.</p> \n<p>Froome is one of four favourites for the Tour and he was the second to show his hand after Alberto Contador <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/01/alberto-contador-giro-ditalia-tour-de-france\">took a close-run victory</a> two weeks ago in the Giro d’Italia; the 2007 and 2009 Tour winner has since returned to altitude training in Livigno.</p> \n<p>The third man on the list, Vincenzo Nibali, rode the Dauphin&eacute; with Froome and rode cagily apart from a couple of obvious displays of strength. It was uncannily similar to the way he raced the event in 2014 <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/27/vincenzo-nibali-tour-de-france-win\">before winning the Tour.</a></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/15/women-cycling-race-apologise-bikini-models-belgium-lotto\">Women’s race apologises after winners are greeted by bikini-clad models</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The big absentee has been the fourth Tour contender, Nairo Quintana of Colombia, who won the Tirreno-Adriatico race in March and made a single outing on cobbled roads during the Belgian Classics with this year’s stage four of the Tour into Cambrai in mind.</p> \n<p>But most recently Quintana has been preparing quietly at home in Colombia, as he did before performing sensationally well in the 2013 Tour.</p> \n<p>The 2014 Giro d’Italia winner’s only race outing before Utrecht will be the Route du Sud, a four-day event in the south-west of France which starts on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Contador will use it as his final pre-Tour warm-up as well and both men will be expected to shine on Saturday, when stage three crosses the immense Port de Bal&egrave;s climb en route to Bagn&egrave;res-de-Luchon.</p> \n<p>As every year, the runes after the Dauphin&eacute; make intriguing reading. The French climber Romain Bardet, sixth in last year’s Tour, and the sprinter Nacer Bouhanni – winner of two stages – both showed well but last year’s Tour runner-up, Jean-Christophe P&eacute;raud, lost more than 40 minutes and finished 31st.

They play New Zealand in Saturday’s final.</p> \n<p>It is the third time the two sides will have met in the final, with New Zealand having won the previous three encounters, the most recent in 2011. The All Blacks will be heavily backed to continue that run, after they dismissed France – who had beaten England 30-18 in their pool game less than a week earlier – 45-7 in their semi-final.</p> \n<p>England’s path to the final was very different, with the forwards dominant in a game of few try-scoring chances. South Africa suffered through indiscipline, with both their captain, Hanro Liebenberg, and second-row Jason Jenkins receiving yellow cards in the first half-hour. England’s Nick Tompkins finished the game in the sin-bin, allowing the Springboks to score two tries in three late minutes, through Malcolm Jaer and Daniel du Plessis, whose father Michael played eight Tests for South Africa in the 1980s.</p> \n<p>An attritional opening saw the sides trade penalties, with England going 3-0 and 6-3 ahead through Rory Jennings only to reach the 20-minute mark level at 6-6. But while Jenkins was off the pitch England drove their way to their first try, James Chisholm eventually touching down, and from a scrum they were given a penalty try moments before half-time, which England reached 18-6 in front.</p> \n<p>In the second half South Africa passed up several presentable opportunities to kick for goal, choosing instead to go for touch and failing to make England pay. Jennings, meanwhile, converted his one opportunity to stretch England’s lead to 21-6 and, when Brandon Thomson finally kicked for goal for South Africa, it sailed wide of the target.</p> \n<p>When Tompkins scored England’s third try with nine minutes remaining, taking the score to 28-6, the die looked cast but he was yellow-carded for an illegal tackle five minutes later, giving South Africa a glimmer of hope. Though the baby Boks capitalised clinically on their numerical superiority, they did not quite have time to turn the game round.</p> \n<p>“We looked at the performance against France and we weren’t happy,” the England captain, Charlie Ewels, said. “Individuals worked really hard this week and we trained well as a team and we are far happier with that performance. This team didn’t win the last two years. The Under-20 team is different every year, so this team is trying to build its own legacy.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434404928821/Englands-James-Chisholm-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"James Chisholm of England moves between South Africa's Ivan van Zyl, left, and Brandon Thomson during the World Under-20 Championship semi-final in Calvisano.

Defending a US Open title won in flawless style is not the domain of many golfers. Many celebrated players of this era, such as Phil Mickelson, are yet to win one.</p> \n<p>The theory, however, would be incorrect. When Kaymer looked ahead to this season, it was an occasion in Scotland in July that instantly captured his thoughts. He pinpointed the Old Course and Claret Jug.</p> \n<p>“It is a bit boring to say you only focus on the majors and all that sort of stuff but my main focus is the Open,” Kaymer says when asked of his ambitions for 2015. “That is huge.”</p> \n<p>He continues: “ I have won on that course. In 2010 I finished seventh in the Open there. It is my favourite course in the world. The whole atmosphere around St Andrews is just so pure, so natural. That is the place where I feel the most comfortable.</p> \n<p>“I’m not going to play the week before, I will just chill out – go to Wimbledon maybe, watch a couple of days of tennis – then head up the weekend before to Kingsbarns and Carnoustie, just get used to it. I really want to start off that week fairly calm and enjoy it. For me, it is the most important week this year.</p> \n<p>“I have thought about the Open since January or February because I think I have a chance. I just need to make sure that my excitement is not in my way. It is important you try to lower that excitement and let things fall into place.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b869c06c157f692076f28264fbdc88e554cb7d86\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434438818576/5a7fb077-a751-4c46-996c-8a5a6b4a8f45-460x321.jpeg\" alt=\"Martin Kaymer during a practice round at Chambers Bay.\" width=\"460\" height=\"321\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin Kaymer during a practice round at Chambers Bay.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Redington/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For someone who is so dedicated to his work and meticulous in planning, this serves as a warning to the Open Championship field. To Kaymer, thinking about something means putting in the necessary work to ensure he has the shots to fit a venue.</p> \n<p>The curious Kaymer major dynamic relates to the first one of the year. In eight appearances at the Masters he has missed five cuts and has a best finish of tied 31st. For a former world No1, a player so talented, this makes little sense. “Too much respect,” answers Kaymer instantly when asked for an explanation. “I have too much respect for the holes. It was the same again this year.</p> \n<p>“At the end of the day, it is just green grass, a white ball and a hole. Honestly, if you break it down to the facts, that is it.”</p> \n<p>For now, Kaymer insists he will relish the sentiment a US Open defence will bring. Last June,<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jun/13/martin-kaymer-us-open-report-day-two\"> back-to-back rounds of 65</a> at Pinehurst No2 on Thursday and Friday meant the only person who could defeat Kaymer was the German himself. He led by six.</p> \n<p>The US Golf Association tried their best to halt the procession. Doubtless riled by Kaymer’s ability to score low and with such ease, they insisted on a host of Saturday pin placements to the left side of greens. “My natural shot is left to right,” Kaymer says. “I was walking up the 18th fairway, the pin was in the middle of the green. I said to [Kaymer’s caddie] Craig [Connelly]: ‘At last, a pin I can play to.’” Kaymer was to make birdie, signing for a 72 and a five-stroke lead over Rickie Fowler and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2014/jun/17/why-erik-compton-tie-second-us-open-astonishing-feat\">Erik Compton</a>. By the close of play on Sunday, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jun/16/martin-kaymer-wins-us-open-second-major\">the margin of success was eight.</a></p> \n<p>But was he at any stage inwardly nervous, or scared of letting such an advantage slip away? “It was none of those things,” Kaymer says. “It was a great mindset that I had and it is a difficult one to get. It is difficult to keep going, just to focus on yourself.</p> \n<p>“I said to Craig on the range on that final day: ‘This is probably going to be the most difficult round that we are ever going to play.’ Because leading by that many shots is hard. People always think that should be easy but there are inner expectations that you have to lower.</p> \n<p>“Mentally it is very difficult. I am playing in America, with an American player [Fowler] who is fairly famous. That is going to be tough.</p> \n<p>“I was focused so much on myself, on getting the job done mentally. I didn’t need to worry about the way I was playing the game, there was a reason I was leading by five shots. I was playing well enough.</p> \n<p>“Early on, Rickie wasn’t really pushing me but I have experienced it myself, I have watched it many times on television. There is no lead that is really big enough for you to relax.</p> \n<p>“You saw it with me <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jan/27/martin-kaymer-abu-dhabi-collapse-golf-dubai-desert-classic\">this year in Abu Dhabi </a>when I was ahead by 10 shots [with 12 holes to play; he finished third]. It is never enough. You have to keep going. And where is the problem in keeping it going? If he was only one or two behind you, that’s what you would say to yourself. So why not when the lead is six or seven? Challenge yourself. That is what I did very well.”</p> \n<p>The fresh nuances of Chambers Bay make it difficult to predict whether Kaymer will prevail again. There is also the rarity of successful major defences. “These days there are 60, 70 guys who can be up there. Defending or not, it is very tough to compete for major championships,” he insists.</p> \n<p>What is without question is that the 30-year-old is better placed than in 2011, when he headed to the Atlanta Athletic Club as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2010/aug/16/us-pga-martin-kaymer\">the holder of the US PGA Championship.</a> By his own admission, he was basically lacking in maturity.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t play good golf at all,” he says. “I was too inexperienced to really notice and understand what I had done. I didn’t see it, really, I was surprised. It wasn’t something I could reach out and touch therefore I wasn’t really in the moment. I was just playing.</p> \n<p>“<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/aug/11/us-pga-2011-live\">Then in 2011</a> when I went back, I just didn’t play good golf at all. 2011 and 2012 were tough times for me, anyway.</p> \n<p>“Now, I am very proud. This is something you can be very proud of: to win a major is nice but to win two and the way I did it last year, you should be very proud of your achievement. That’s the way I will approach Chambers Bay. I will try to use all the positives that I experienced last year, take that into the first and second rounds and then see where I am.”</p> \n<p>It was pertinent that Kaymer spent the weekend completing preparations at Whistling Straits, where he won the 2010 US PGA. The policy of staying away from Chambers Bay was as typical for Kaymer as it was deliberate – designed, in essence, to avoid boredom.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-dd14db75-fd01-41bf-8732-e77215db0151\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434384127599/63c3513b-9c0e-4dcf-9d04-20bf7ea025bc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Martin Kaymer of Germany\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kaymer celebrates with the trophy after winning the US Open, his second major victory.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aflo/Rex</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He will spend the opening two days in Washington state in the company of Rory McIlroy, whom every other golfer currently looks up to. To his credit, Kaymer is perfectly happy to admit as much.</p> \n<p>“It is very inspiring,” says Kaymer of McIlroy’s rise. “It is always inspiring when you see someone playing so well. Rory has already said he saw me winning the US Open and that inspired him to play well.</p> \n<p>“That’s the great thing about this situation we are in now, we can inspire each other. It is nothing to do with jealousy, it is a positive thing where you see how great somebody can play and it makes you wonder: ‘Maybe I can get there, too.’ All of a sudden you can have a couple of weeks where you think, ‘Wow, if I play like this I am unbeatable.’ Not a lot of players can say that about themselves.</p> \n<p>“Obviously eras change. If you look right now at the Ryder Cup teams, there are a few young guys in there, mid to late 20s, who can play for the next 15 years against each other. That is why you are an athlete, that is why you play sport – it is about the competition. You try to compare yourself to others at the same time as staying within yourself.

He received the call-up from national selector James Whitaker less than 36 hours after all-rounder Craig replaced side-strain victim Chris Jordan, though he was unused for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/12/england-new-zealand-royal-london-one-day-series\" title=\"\">the three-wicket loss at the Ageas Bowl</a> that saw the tourists take a 2-1 lead.</p> \n<p>Were the 21-year-olds to take the field together in either Wednesday’s fourth one-dayer at Trent Bridge or the series finale at Chester-le-street on Saturday, it would represent the first time twin brothers have been named in the same England side and the first siblings to do so since Adam and Ben Hollioake played together in the 1997 one-day series with Australia and the Ashes series that followed.</p> \n<p>While Craig, a correct and aggressive batsman who bowls right-arm fast-medium, has been a more regular member of the Somerset team in the County Championship this summer, taking seven wickets in his last outing away at Durham, brother Jamie’s addition to the England ranks represents a greater surprise, having only fleetingly shown the form that led to his only previous call-up as a reserve for the one-day series against Australia two years ago.</p> \n<p>“Obviously it’s really pleasing that we have both been picked in the England squad,” said Craig, who toured South Africa with England Lions at the start of the year before flying home due to an ankle injury. “When Jamie was picked before me a couple of years ago I was really pleased for him but it was also an extra incentive for me to keep working – you’ve always got to think positive.”</p> \n<p>The quicker of the two but with a touch less control, Jamie spent the bulk of last season playing in the Devon Premier League after slipping down the pecking order at Taunton, but has featured in five&nbsp;games in the NatWest T20 Blast this year and one championship fixture against Yorkshire, sharing a last-wicket stand of 76 from just 35 balls with Craig in what was just their ninth first-class game together.</p> \n<p>In terms of attributes - he sends the ball down from a 6ft 5in frame – Jamie represents a prospect England are keen to develop further, having worked with him in their fast bowling performance programme in Potchefstroom, South Africa at the start of 2015.</p> \n<p>“Jamie has been bowling quick,” said Craig. “None of the boys have been looking forward to facing him in the nets, put it that way – especially me, because he always gives me a bit of extra ‘brotherly love’.”</p> \n<p>“I’ve probably always been a bit more the outgoing one,” said Jamie. “Craig has been more consistent as a bowler, and he’s technically the better batsman. But I’d like to think I’ve settled down a bit this year. We’ve not played that many games together for Somerset but we’ve been playing together all our lives so we’re pretty used to each other.”</p> \n<p>Asked if brotherly rivalry, from their first games together at North Devon Cricket Club to the present, has driven both careers, Jamie added: “That’s probably helped us a little bit. One is always one step ahead of the other, and that makes the other want to catch up. That bit of competition has probably helped us get to the next level. I’m not sure many people can say they’ve got a brother playing cricket just as well as they can.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5cdbf728ee1f4727d09927fee46b8e254414cf4f/0_81_4672_2802/4672.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2802,"width":4672,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Harry Trump/JMP/REX Shutterstock/Harry Trump/JMP/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Somerset’s Jamie and Craig Overton have both been called up to England’s ODI squad.

We have probably not seen the best of Freddy Head’s grey and he will surely do well here, but this is a much tougher test than those he has met in his two Group Ones so far.</p> \n<p>Hong Kong’s Able Friend is a big beast with a potent turn of foot and the pin hovered over him for a lengthy period. But few horses can run to their best form having travelled so far and this race being run on a straight mile may not suit him as he has been performing on a round course his whole life.</p> \n<p>Straight miles hold no fears for <strong>Night Of Thunder (2.30)</strong>, who won last year’s 2,000 Guineas, beating Kingman and Australia, as well as this year’s Lockinge in such circumstances. On Ascot’s straight mile he looked a most unlucky loser on Champions’ Day.</p> \n<p>Night Of Thunder has sometimes looked a bit short of pace when racing round a bend but take out the turns and he has time to build up a head of steam. He hit it off with James Doyle when they first paired up at Newbury last month and they look overpriced at 5-1.</p> \n<p><strong>3.05</strong> From the stable that won this three years ago, <strong>Round Two</strong> seems a most impressive animal. Having made a winning debut over six furlongs, Jim Bolger’s colt was stepped back to five for a Listed race last time and briefly looked like being collared before powering away from his rivals.</p> \n<p><strong>3.40</strong> Naturally a case can be made for many of these, including Sole Power, who seeks a hat-trick of wins in the race and gets his ground. The French colt Rangali may run above his odds but <strong>Muthmir</strong> appeals as the winner, being not far short of a rocket when things go right. A strong pace over this uphill five could be close to his ideal.</p> \n<p>4.20 Make Believe had the run of the French Guineas and Consort may be a bigger danger to the favourite, Gleneagles. But danger is all he is because <strong>Gleneagles </strong>overcame trouble in running to win the Irish Guineas and should be extremely hard to beat in this smaller field.</p> \n<p>5.00 <strong>Lycidas</strong> warmed up for this by landing the same York handicap which was a springboard for Well Sharp, who took this two years ago. Lightly raced for a six-year-old, Lycidas still has scope for better and seems a proper stayer.</p> \n<p>5.35 Beaten only by Round Two at The Curragh last time, <strong>Washington DC</strong> may give Aidan O’Brien a long overdue first success in this race.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434392278114/Ascot-Races-Night-of-Thun-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Night of Thunder, far side, was an unlucky loser in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot last October.
