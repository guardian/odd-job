Stuart Broad, galloping towards the river Taff, set the tone by dismissing three of the top four in a lineup that was looking emasculated and a tad decrepit by the end of the day. Only when the twentysomethings were together – David Warner and Steve Smith – did Alastair Cook have much to fret about.</p> \n<p>England were not quite flawless; Joe Root dropped a slip catch and Moeen Ali bowled a horrible second over that cost 17 runs, which briefly surrendered the initiative, but throughout a memorable day they were vibrant, innovative and very skilful. Broad may have been flattered by some of his recent figures – his five-wicket haul against the Kiwis at Leeds springs to mind – but that was not the case here. He barely bowled a bad ball; he beat the outside edge frequently, particularly when the bat was held by Warner in the first hour.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/england-ashes-australia-alastair-cook\">Alastair Cook hails relentless England bowlers after win over Australia</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Broad reminded us how he relishes an Ashes battle – especially when bowling – but the rest of the attack was outstanding as well. Jimmy Anderson was wicketless in the second innings, in part because of that dropped catch, yet he was always on target and testing Australia’s resolve and skill.</p> \n<p>Mark Wood was something of a revelation. Having produced a vital cameo with the bat on Friday evening, Wood, who always seems to be irrepressible, was given the task of bowling into a stiff breeze. He bounded in, gave the Aussies nothing and more than earned his two wickets. After that 17-run over Moeen was looking oh so vulnerable. Late into the afternoon he sometimes had five men around the bat as England closed in on victory.</p> \n<p>There were outstanding moments in the field. Captain Cook (you know, the one who could not helm a rowing boat on the Serpentine) magically – or was it mischievously? – juggled catches as if employed by Barnum &amp; Bailey (and there have been times recently when that really seemed to be the case). In between all that Cook was setting funky fields, making funky bowling changes. Somehow or another they very often worked.</p> \n<p>It is one match out of five, but the odds on this series are surely as wobbly as the euro now. The scrutiny is turning upon Australia, whether it be their birth dates or their creaking ankles and knees. In this match they have been outbowled and outbatted, which makes it look as if they have been outcaptained as well. Hence the anticipation of Lord’s becomes ever more fevered alongside a growing curiosity about what sort of pitch Australia will find there. A prediction is that they will be grumpy if it lacks the pace of the excellent pitch prepared there for New Zealand in May.</p> \n<p>However, England have been so impressive here that perhaps the nature of the surface does not matter so much. On Saturday morning Broad and Anderson were bang on target from the start. In the third over Anderson found the edge of Rogers’s bat, but was dropped by Root, standing unusually close at third slip. No matter; Broad induced another edge within the hour and the ball just carried to Ian Bell at second slip.</p> \n<p>Cook stuck with his plans to give an early bowl to Moeen; they backfired. Five runs came from Moeen’s first over, 17 from his second as Warner capitalised on some nasty long-hops.</p> \n<p>Briefly the initiative was lost. Moeen was hastily removed to be replaced by Wood from the Taff End; then came Root for a couple of overs whereupon Cook tossed the ball back to Moeen for the last over before lunch. His third delivery took the pads and the review confirmed that Warner would not be returning after the interval. If not funky, this was jolly handy and it certainly relaxed the bowlers.</p> \n<p>In the afternoon session Australia lost five wickets for 65. Broad delivered another exceptional spell during which Smith was pocketed by Bell at second slip <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/australia-michael-clarke-alastair-cook-first-test-ashes\">and Michael Clarke</a>, his weight loitering on the back foot, drove to cover point. Then Wood’s perseverance was rewarded when he found the outside edge of Adam Voges’s bat.</p> \n<p>The next two wickets were a source of merriment to the fans revelling in England’s domination. First, there was Cook’s juggling act at short midwicket to dispatch Brad Haddin off the bowling of Moeen. Then there was the demise of Shane Watson, who has gathered a reputation for seeking to benefit from the review system as frequently as Broad.</p> \n<p>A delivery from Wood thumped into his ample front pad. Yet again Watson spied the umpire’s raised finger. It may well be that he did not wish to review the decision and that he was advised by his partner, Mitchell Johnson, to do so.</p> \n<p>Whatever the reason Watson sought a review and his dismissal was duly confirmed by the third umpire amid much hilarity. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/shane-watson-lbw-australia-england-first-test-ashes\">Watson’s reputation was intact</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/11/ashes-2015-england-v-australia-first-test-day-four-live\">Ashes 2015: England v Australia –&nbsp;first Test, day four –&nbsp;as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The dismissal of Mitchell Starc also raised a smile – outside the Aussie dressing room. An outside edge against Root was parried by Cook at gully thereby enabling Adam Lyth at slip to catch the rebound.</p> \n<p>Only Johnson offered any resistance in a carefree display of controlled hitting. No matter who was bowling, Johnson timed the ball superbly throughout his 77, which was terminated when he edged a drive to slip off Root, a deserved man of the match (though more for his batting than his bowling). It is fair to say that Johnson preferred batting to bowling on this pitch.</p> \n<p>Moeen took the final wicket to finish with figures of three for 59, augmenting his two vital wickets in the first innings. Perhaps the Beard was insufficiently feared.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Cricket/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436632278709/First-Ashes-Test-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England players including Stuart Broad, left, who took three key wickets, celebrate beating Australia in the first Ashes Test.

The wait is over after a topsy-turvy, tooth-and-nail women’s doubles final in which the 34-year-old Swiss and her partner, India’s Sania Mirza, defeated the formidable Russian pairing of Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina.</p> \n<p>The match started on Centre Court in bright sunshine and finished under the roof and floodlights, two and a half hours later, with Hingis and Mirza finally prevailing 5-7, 7-6, 7-5. Hingis may have won bigger individual prizes but the way that she and Mirza bunny-hopped around the court after coming through match point, finishing with a celebratory arse-bump, suggested that few victories have given her such satisfaction.</p> \n<p>“It feels like it was in another life,” said Hingis, reflecting on those previous titles. “But 17 years, usually you’re lucky to win it once or happy to be out here and play on the Wimbledon grounds. It’s above my expectations.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/sep/05/us-open-martina-hingis-doubles-final-retired-flavia-pennetta\">Martina Hingis reaches US Open doubles final eight years after retiring</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Mirza was making history of her own: she became the first Indian woman to win a grand slam event. “It means everything to be here today,” she said. “To come out at Wimbledon Centre Court and have the whole crowd behind you is pretty incredible. But I think for me, as an Indian, I’m in Little India here. There are so many Indians in England. Thankfully there are a lot of us everywhere, but in England especially I’ve always had amazing support.”</p> \n<p>It was, to be frank, a match that Hingis and Mirza, the No1 seeds, rarely looked like winning. For most of it Makarova and Vesnina, the No2 seeds, were powerful and merciless. Vesnina, who announced each involvement in a rally with a glass-shattering shriek, smashed volleys as if they had personally insulted her, while Makarova served faultlessly, at least until she had to do so to win the match at 5-3 in the final set.</p> \n<p>Doubles tennis, by its nature, is collaborative but it was hard for this final not to be dominated by the narrative of one person with a long, complex history at SW19. Almost inconceivably, Hingis won her first Wimbledon prize, the girls’ singles title, as a precocious 13-year-old in 1994. She first claimed the senior doubles title two years later, aged 15, and then won her one and only singles championship here the following summer. Her last significant victory at Wimbledon came in the women’s doubles in 1998, when she was partnered by Jana Novotna.</p> \n<p>It has certainly been an eventful decade and a half since then. Hingis retired, for the first time, in 2003, aged 22, after a pair of ankle surgeries, first on her right, then her left. She announced she wanted to spend more time horse riding, maybe even patch up an education fractured by an adolescence on the tennis circuit. Hingis returned in 2005, rose to the world’s top 10 again but then <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2008/jan/04/tennis.seaningle\" title=\"\">tested positive for cocaine</a> at Wimbledon in 2007. The amount was minuscule – and she still denies taking anything – but she was banned for two years.</p> \n<p>The third coming of Hingis – “no longer a spring chicken,” as she said recently – has been as a doubles specialist since 2013. And she has clearly lost none of her skill at the net and astute reading of the game: with Flavia Pennetta, she reached the final of the US Open in 2014, losing to Makarova and Vesnina; she then won the mixed doubles final of this year’s Australian Open with India’s Leander Paes.</p> \n<p>“I had one comeback when I came back in singles, now another one in doubles,” said Hingis. “I always believed in it. Without that you can’t come out here and play and compete at this level. I always felt like I had one of the best volleys in the world, one of the best backhands in the world, so you got to believe in something if you want to win.”</p> \n<p>Hingis, who was obviously drained by a long fortnight at Wimbledon, will be reunited with Paes on Sunday afternoon in the mixed doubles final against Austria’s Alexander Peya and Hungary’s Timea Babos. One of the most unexpected stories in tennis is set to have another chapter.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436650763006/Martina-Hingis-left-and-S-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Martina Hingis, left, and Sania Mirza celebrate with their women's doubles trophies after winning against Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina.

Watch Broad from afar enough times and you start to see the signs, little hints that England’s streakiest, delicately engineered, match-winning new ball bowler could be about to clank into high gear.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/england-win-ashes-opener-as-stuart-broad-breaks-australias-top-order\">England win Ashes opener as Stuart Broad breaks Australia’s top order</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For a long-time England observer the feeling can be similar to watching one of your own offspring in action. You get to know – or at least imagine that you know – the ticks and tells, each little gathering hint of spring and snap that suggests the rifle sights narrowing, torpedoes locked in, the force beginning to crackle.</p> \n<p>On a day of passing cloud and tepid high summer heat, Broad bowled with wonderful urgency and precision, in the process turning this first Test decisively England’s way. There is an ease to his approach at his best, this great slender conifer of a man leaning forward at first, ears pinned back, then gradually, almost bashfully unfurling himself to his full height at the point of delivery. Not so much a wrecking ball, he was instead a relentless, suffocating presence running in from the Cathedral Road end.</p> \n<p>Broad bowled fast and full here, finding enough nip and bounce in the fourth-day pitch to discomfit every batsman who faced him. The first hour brought him the wicket of Chris Rogers, caught by Ian Bell at second slip as Australia lost their first wicket at 19.</p> \n<p>Most compelling of all was Broad’s duel with David Warner, a pedigree attacking opener but a man in need not just of a way into this series, but of a start in England, a method of playing in a country where he averages 22 after six Tests, against 46 elsewhere. England won here in part because they batted with new-found brio and aggression. But also because of the same-old same-old, England’s most prolific fast-bowling pair performing as required in occasionally helpful conditions. That it was Broad rather than Jimmy Anderson who produced the decisive spell on day four might have come as a surprise to some.</p> \n<p>Only Broad will know for sure if he really was irritated by the pre-series talk of Australia’s greater fast bowling hand, a strength offset, the assumption was, by the presence of Anderson. Broad barely got a mention in the previews, despite that going back to March 2013 his record reads 120 wickets at 26 with seven five-fors, just about edging Anderson’s own 118 at 27 with five five-wicket hauls.</p> \n<p>This is not to downplay Anderson’s influence here. Between them in the first two hours, England’s new-ball pair produced a sublime, high-pressure period of sustained accuracy from around and over the wicket that, while it didn’t quite skittle the Australian top order, established a hand on the throat that was never relaxed.</p> \n<p>With the crowd still fluttering into place Anderson produced an in-ducker with the second ball of the day that hit Rogers square in what we might perhaps now call the Alastairs. Rogers grinned and walked it off. Ten minutes of leave-and-prod later he was dropped by Joe Root off Anderson in a close third slip position. It was, though, the action at the other end that defined the morning’s play, and which will perhaps leave the greatest impression on the rest of the series. Either way Broad versus Warner was box office.</p> \n<p>First Warner was beaten by a full ball that seamed away, inducing a spasm of a short-arm drive, the batsman playing the line then furiously reeling his hands back in. A shorter ball zipped past a narrow defensive prod. Then Warner was struck on the pad, producing an appeal from Broad that while loud and prolonged, was still a little short of the full jazz-hands. To his credit Warner stuck at his methods, playing not just late but too late at times, staying compact at the crease and enjoying a little good fortune too.</p> \n<p>He is not just a fine batsman but a fascinating one, Australia’s frontiersman of the new world and a player who for all his runs, his uncluttered method and his thrilling talent is still learning this longer game on the job.</p> \n<p>If Warner was to provide a match-turning hundred here it would simply arrive in the flow of things, incidental to the unchanging methods of a man who seems to keep playing the same, unceasing innings across every format, offering not a selection of gears and modes but another draught whatever the weather of pure unadulterated David Warner.</p> \n<p>He spent 23 balls toying with the idea of playing like a Test opener in England, scoring one run in the process and hanging in against three straight maidens from Broad. In all Broad beat Warner’s outside edge eight times through a combination of nip, bounce and simple accuracy.</p> \n<p>In between times Broad fielded at close funky-mid-off for his new-ball partner, diving full length to take a bunted drive from Warner almost hand in hand with the bowler, a move completed with a mutual pat of the rump, confirming the impression of two bowlers working, as was said of Braque and Picasso, “like two men roped together on a mountain”.</p> \n<p>Warner fought on, reaching 50 off 72 balls, with six fours and one six, periodically stretching out to thrash or pummel a loose ball to the fence, crouched very deep in his crease, reminiscent at times of Gary Ballance’s much more frightening Australian cousin.</p> \n<p>Mark Wood bowled well, producing some genuine skimming pace off that somersaulting tumbler’s run-up. But it was Moeen Ali who finally got Warner just before lunch with a straight ball that scuttled into his pads.</p> \n<p>Broad returned after lunch to remove Australia’s captain and vice-captain.

He is understandably pleased after emerging from the first eight stages injury-free, looking superior to his main rivals and with the yellow jersey on his shoulders after a series of attritional stages in which the garment has at times seemed cursed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/09/tour-de-france-2015-tony-martin-race-in-doubt-stage-six-crash-zdenek-stybar-cycling\">Tour de France 2015: Tony Martin quits after breaking collarbone on stage six</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Fabian Cancellara and Tony Martin have already been forced to withdraw with broken bones sustained in heavy falls while wearing the <em>maillot jaune</em>. Indeed, it is a testament to their courage that both men – Cancellara with broken vertebrae and Martin with a shattered collarbone – seemed content or foolhardy enough to soldier on regardless of the injuries that eventually forced them out of the race and into hospital beds.</p> \n<p>Crosswinds, cobbles and one spectacular crash that resulted in several riders being catapulted into a roadside lamppost at over 40 kilometres an hour have all contributed to make the opening to this Tour punishing and the original field of 198 riders is already 13 down with as many stages to go. Twelve have succumbed to injury, while the Katusha rider Luca Paolini was withdrawn on Friday night after testing positive for cocaine.</p> \n<p>With its shark’s teeth profile featuring a relentless series of small jagged climbs, a fairly uneventful stage eight took the bunch through the chateau-speckled landscape of Brittany from Rennes to M&ucirc;r-de-Bretagne, where a sharp right-hand turn into the 2km kick towards the finish line precluded the field from hitting it with any kind of momentum.</p> \n<p>With 15km to go, a three-man breakaway had a dwindling 33sec gap, with Lars Bak and Michal Golas dropping Bartosz Huzarski before inevitably being reeled in themselves.</p> \n<p>Around the right-hander they went, onwards and upwards into the home straight with the tireless Geraint Thomas towing them along and Froome placed handily.</p> \n<p>Just inside the <em>flamme rouge</em> marking 1km to go, Froome attacked only to see the hideous brown shorts of Ag2r-La Mondiale’s Alexis Vuillermoz streak off into the distance as a vulnerable looking Vincenzo Nibali was simultaneously shelled out the back of the leading group. It was Vuillermoz who won the stage before collapsing exhausted against a barrier. The Frenchman, claiming the first home victory of this Tour, finished five seconds clear of Dan Martin, who pounded his handlebars in frustration.</p> \n<p>Finishing in the same group as Alberto Contador, Nairo Quintana and Tejay van Garderen, with Nibali a further 10sec back, Froome maintains his 11sec lead over Peter Sagan, who leads both the points and best young rider classifications.</p> \n<p>The Slovak also ended a depressing sequence of consecutive second and third-placed finishes by being fourth across the line.</p> \n<p>“That was a tough climb,” said Froome. “I think the main thing was just not to lose any time on any other contenders. “I was quite surprised to hear that I even gained a little bit of time on Vincenzo Nibali and hopefully we’ve kept a little something in reserve for tomorrow. Hopefully we’re going to be up there with the best.”</p> \n<p>Froome was referring to the team time trial with its uphill finish in Plumelec, where he will do well to maintain his lead. Similar to its corresponding stage in the Crit&eacute;rium du Dauphin&eacute;, the route does not hold fond memories for Sky. A month ago, they were significantly beaten into sixth place in a stage won by BMC and a similar result would almost certainly put the Swiss team’s leader, Van Garderen, ahead of Froome on general classification.</p> \n<p>The American has been cycling below the radar with a minimum of fuss, but has yet to put a foot wrong and currently looks a more legitimate GC contender than Nibali or Quintana.</p> \n<p>“It’s a very important stage,” said Froome. “I can see 20 or 30 seconds being won or lost between some of the teams that go well and some that don’t. We’re all going to give it absolutely everything we have as a team given that it does carry so much weight.</p> \n<p>“You need big engines who can do the work and you need climbers to get you up there to the finish, but I think we’ve got that mix within our team.”</p> \n<p>One team Sky will not concern themselves with unduly is Orica GreenEdge, who were among the pre-race favourites to triumph in stage nine.</p> \n<p>Having already lost three riders to injury and with another competing with broken ribs, they are to all intents and purposes already down to the bare minimum of five riders required to record a time-trial time and have already promised to treat a stage they originally hoped to win as “a rest day before <em>the</em> rest day”.</p> \n<p>Should Sky lose time on Sunday they will be fairly unperturbed after a week that could not have gone much better for them if it had been scripted by Sir David Brailsford himself.</p> \n<p>With Froome in yellow, his eight team-mates looking hale and hearty and Thomas riding out of his black skinsuit, the British team are splendidly placed to test the mettle of their rivals after Monday’s rest day.</p> \n<p>The Pyrenees and Alps await and on what few significant climbs the peloton has tackled thus far, Froome has looked to have the beating of his rivals.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436629799861/Tour-de-France-2015-8th-s-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alexis Vuillermoz celebrates winning stage eight of the Tour de France between Rennes and Mûr De Bretagne.

If she retains the US Open she will have become only the fourth woman to claim a calendar-year grand slam. That is a lot to celebrate on a warm Saturday afternoon. But it might all have turned horribly wrong. The best player in the world did not make it easy for herself in this her 25th slam final.</p> \n<p>It is all very well having the biggest serve in tennis – Williams finished the fortnight with 80 aces, 13 more than Roger Federer, who put 20 on Andy Murray on Friday – but if you fail to land six of them in the box in the first game of a grand slam final against a hungry young player such as Muguruza, life gets complicated.</p> \n<p>Spanish eyes lit up when her vaunted opponent gifted her the first game on the fourth break point, pushing a trembling backhand long after seven worrying minutes.</p> \n<p>Sharapova had three double faults in her first service game against Williams in the semi-finals and lost.

These were different circumstances. Muguruza, seeded 20th, had worked her way assiduously through the draw, finishing off the challenges of Caroline Wozniacki and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/09/garbine-muguruza-beats-agnieszka-radwanska-wimbledon-2015-final\">Agnieszka Radwanska to earn a place in her first slam final</a>. Her confidence and her daring were sky-high.</p> \n<p>She held for two-love and took two points off the Williams serve, which had dipped to an alarming 20%, before the world No1 got a grip. It finally clicked and she trailed 1-2 after quarter of an hour. She had a look at deuce in the fourth game but her footwork was sluggish and her face anguished; she had plenty of catching up to do.</p> \n<p>A second ace settled her nerves as she held in the fifth, but she still struggled for rhythm off the ground. Muguruza was hanging tough and saved two break points to maintain her lead. The question that whispered its way around Centre Court now was: could she keep it up and take the first set?</p> \n<p>After half an hour, Williams struck something like her best serving form, holding to love for 3-4, but her ground strokes and her balance needed work. She got another two break points, the first saved by the Spaniard’s second ace, the second surrendered with a loose forehand and they were back to parity.</p> \n<p>A fourth double fault did not slow the Williams fightback and Muguruza found herself serving to stay in the set just 20 minutes after having the world No1 at her mercy. After an ace got her to game point, she again hit wide for deuce then double faulted. Williams had set point – and took it, after 44 minutes, with an angry, relieved forehand.</p> \n<p>She closed her eyes and breathed deep during the break. Soon, the familiar pattern would emerge: an opponent in contention introduced to the reality of sustaining the challenge.</p> \n<p>Williams broke, held and was 3-1 up in the second, and banging down her eighth ace nearly an hour after those three double faults had given Muguruza hope. A ninth ace induced panic at the other end and the Spaniard’s forehand drifted long.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/martina-hingis-sania-mirza-win-wimbledon-womens-doubles-final\">Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza win Wimbledon women’s doubles final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Williams was now a couple of games away from confirming her dominance – if she could crack Muguruza’s serve again and finish the way she knows best. But Muguruza was not quite done and broke her to love in the seventh game.</p> \n<p>The ninth game of the second set encapsulated the struggle. Muguruza, having held through deuce to force Williams to serve for the title, the world No1 double faulted for the eighth time and, watching two ground strokes whirr past her, faced three break points.</p> \n<p>She struck a 10th ace for 30-40 and one more for deuce. Her 12th, at 121 miles an hour, delivered her championship point, but Muguruza saved, advancing to the net to land a perfect forehand in the deuce corner. They both hit long, Muguruza by a millimetre, within the margin of error.</p> \n<p>Williams netted a forehand from the baseline and the crowd went wild as the Spaniard lived again.

But he is struggling, under pressure for his place from Mitchell Marsh and retaining it for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/england-win-ashes-opener-as-stuart-broad-breaks-australias-top-order\" title=\"\">this first Test</a> on reputation rather than performance. In the first innings, though, when he had made 30, Broad had pinned him on the crease, the ball thundering into the massive magnet that is his front pad. He reviewed the lbw decision – of course he did – and, as happens more often than not, it was in vain. Now, in this second innings, Australia were struggling for survival, and Watson’s career was on the line.</p> \n<p>He made 19 unspectacular runs, trying so hard to play straight rather than around his front pad as the downfall of the lbw laureate so often suggests. Alastair Cook set three slips and a gully. But, for good measure, there were three close fielders on the drive, one on the off and two to leg, one of them almost standing on the cut strip. If you want to get the ball away, Cook was saying, you are going to have to hit across the line. Just once Anderson was belted back down the ground to the boundary, too straight and firm for anyone to stop and Ben Stokes was pulled dismissively to square leg for a second four. It all looked a struggle, a voice in his head telling him to play straight, keep the pad out of the way. After 57 previous deliveries, came the inevitable.</p> \n<p>Mark Wood, already a star in this new England team, slanted one into him, the bat came around his pad as he looked to angle the ball away and it thudded into it. The appeal was wholehearted and vociferous, the response of Marais Erasmus almost preordained, and with it Watson’s reaction.</p> \n<p>In the media centre, the universal plea came for him to review it, maybe for the last time in his Test career. The advice from the non-striker, Mitchell Johnson, may well have been not to bother but such was the situation that he had little option, even if it might have been for old times sake. So he did, grinning sheepishly as he did so. Maybe he could put DRS after his name. In the press box, arms went up gleefully. Then came the drama: the bowler had not overstepped, and nor did the batsman feather the ball on to his pad. Finally, trial by the automated decision review system: red light was followed by another, and then the orange umpire’s call. The ball would have been taking a big chunk out of a chocolate leg stump and Watson turned to trudge resignedly from the field, lbw for the 29th time. “Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio,” chanted the crowd. Someone posted a picture on Twitter of a Hawk-Eye screen grab captioned “Shane Watson’s passport photograph”: genius. Perhaps if the decision is taken to end his career he will review that as well.</p> \n<p>The opprobrium heaped on Cardiff before the match had begun was largely unwarranted and, if the pitch has been slower than some might like, it suited the home side and the first three innings were scored at four runs per over or more: it has been an enthralling match and supported to the full. Before play, the crowds had filled the coffee shops near the castle and the crocodile of spectators wound through the gardens and along the path by the Taff to the Swalec Stadium.</p> \n<p>Most press boxes these days have excellent views but as much atmosphere as the moon, so while it is easy to watch the match it is difficult to feel it. But go down one floor from this one and there is an open terrace from which to watch and it lends a different perspective. There is a hum between deliveries, gathering noise as the bowler runs in and there was an explosion of sound as five Australia wickets fell in the half-hour either side of lunch.</p> \n<p>For most of the first hour, though, there were mostly gasps, as the new ball darted and jagged past probing blades without finding the edge. A wicket seemed likely every ball but never came. In the third over, Chris Rogers got a thick edge to Anderson and the ball flew to the left of Joe Root at third slip but, whereas England’s catching had been exceptional otherwise, he could only parry this so that Rogers escaped. Those at third slip on both teams have been standing closer than normal, the slips tending to be <em>en &eacute;chelon</em> rather than in an arc, and this was no exception. But this was the new ball, which will always go through a little quicker and come faster from the bat: he may have been too close. Root lay prone as the crowd groaned: was it going to be this sort of a day?</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/11/stuart-broads-urgency-and-precision-win-vital-duel-with-david-warner\" title=\"\">Broad bowled magnificently</a>, as he had done throughout the match. This is a bowler who sometimes slumbers only to wake and deliver devastating spells; but that was not the case here, hitting the splice more than anyone and always challenging. He has never bowled better.</p> \n<p>Somehow Rogers and David Warner, a pair of left-handers, had survived until Broad went round the wicket to the former, moved one away and Ian Bell took the catch at bootlace height, low enough for the batsman to delay his walk back while the umpires checked the legitimacy. There was no doubt and up went the first real roar of the day.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436640758980/Shane-Watson-England-Aust-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Shane Watson was out lbw to England's Mark Wood in Australia's second innings to follow the all-rounder's dismissal by Stuart Broad via the same method.

But it was not to be as Murray and his partner, the Australian John Peers, lost 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 to the No4 seeds, Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau.</p> \n<p>One of Godfree’s other claims to fame was that he played the first match on Centre Court when it opened in 1922. According to legend, his opening serve went into the net so he walked up to his ball and put it in his pocket as a souvenir. After this final Murray’s pockets will also be a little heavier: both he and Peers, the 13th seeds, walked away with &pound;85,000 for being runners-up.</p> \n<p>Yet after a positive opening they were second best for much of the match.</p> \n<p>Tecau, in particular, played textbook doubles tennis. His serve was impenetrable. His volleys were as sharp as any blade. And his return never stopped asking questions. As Murray admitted: “I felt they got momentum early and that was the difference. If we could have snuck out a break early, things could have gone completely different. But they deserved to win.”</p> \n<p>Most of Centre Court was taking a breather after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/serena-williams-beats-garbine-muguruza-wimbledon-grand-slam\">the women’s final</a> when the players arrived on court but the noise that greeted them was passionate and partisan. One wag summed up the mood moments before play started: “Come on Jamie, do it for Scotland!” Seconds later Murray hit a crosscourt winner against Rojer’s serve to go up 0-15 up and the volume went even higher.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b636f131980dd63d905e968b06d759335cf24a59\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b636f131980dd63d905e968b06d759335cf24a59/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Murray plays a forehand return at the net during the men’s doubles final. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Murray plays a forehand return at the net during the men’s doubles final. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And while Rojer and Tecau just about held their opening service game from 15-30, the tone was set for the opening 30 minutes of the match – with Murray and Peers pressing for a break and their opponents doggedly holding them at bay.</p> \n<p>They had two breakpoint chances at 1-1 only for Tecau’s muscular serve to dig him out of a hole, and another one at 2-2 when Murray’s vicious dipping return swirled and stung Rojer’s shoelaces. Yet Peers was unable to take advantage, first hitting a return straight at Tecau then sending his lob wide.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately while the Australian was serving well, his return game was as streaky as zigzag-cut bacon: he went games without disturbing the wall that Rojer and Tecau put up at the net before suddenly whipping up a couple of passing shots in quick succession before going arctic cold again.</p> \n<p>Murray, though, was playing well and dropped only one point on serve and also saved a breakpoint at 4-5 down before the first set went to a tie-break. His brother Andy, who had been unsure whether he would watch for fear of jinxing him, watched on discreetly from three rows above the players’ box, quietly urging him on.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t know he was coming until I heard him shouting encouragement,” admitted Jamie to laughs afterwards.</p> \n<p>But Rojer and Tecau were gradually finding their feet on their return game and at 3-2 on the tie-break they drew a crucial mistake from Peers at the net. That mini-break proved enough, with Rojer and Tecau clinching the tie-break 7-5 after a final point that was a mini-classic.</p> \n<p>Three times Peers and Murray dived to get smashes back before Tecau settled the argument with a thunderbolt bludgeoned down the middle.</p> \n<p>The loss of the opening set meant that Murray and Peers had to regroup quickly but they soon went a break down in the second when Peers lost his serve.</p> \n<p>At 4-3 on Rojer’s serve, there was a glimmer of hope at 15-30 but it was soon strangled as Rojer saved the game and, shortly afterwards, a flying Tecau smash put them two sets up.</p> \n<p>Murray and Peers had twice won five-setters during this Wimbledon but never looked like knocking their opponents off their stride. And at 4-4 in the third Peers tossed in a double fault at 30-30, allowing Rojer and Tecau to pounce. A game later it was all over.</p> \n<p>With this victory Tecau became the first Romanian player to win a Wimbledon men’s doubles title since Ilie Nastase in 1973 with Jimmy Connors. And that he finally triumphed after losing in his three previous finals here in 2010, 2011 and 2012 might give encouragement to Murray. Not that he was feeling it last night.</p> \n<p>“I guess it’s a missed opportunity,” he sighed. “We may never have a chance to play a grand slam final again.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/10459c7851e4359c2505b9d3cf3e46f2cbbe6d3e/0_16_5070_3045/5070.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3045,"width":5070,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom Jenkins for the Guardian","altText":"Andy Murray shouts encouragement to his brother Jamie in the men’s doubles final at Wimbledon.
