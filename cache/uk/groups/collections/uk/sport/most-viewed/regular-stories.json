The German hit numerous drop shots, some unbelievable returns and generally kept the 10th seed off balance and out of kilter, clinching a 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/rafael-nadal-bounce-back-wimbledon-defeat-dustin-brown\">Rafael Nadal vows to bounce back from Wimbledon defeat to Dustin Brown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Remarkably, it was Nadal’s fourth straight Wimbledon loss to an opponent ranked outside the top 100 and, after losing his hold on the French Open title last month, he must now find a way to pick himself up on the North American hard courts later this summer.</p> \n<p>“I’m happy I got to play him on that court win or lose,” said Brown. “All the kids that play tennis dream about being able to play on that Centre Court. Playing against him there is special. Also being able to put that performance together, it was definitely very difficult and I’m very happy that I held it together for the whole match.”</p> \n<p>It was not quite the shock it would have been a few years ago – Nadal lost in the second round in 2012 and the first round a year later, and also lost to Brown on grass in Halle last year. But it was still a surprise for the man who has won 14 grand slams and picked up the title here in 2008 and 2010 to lose to a someone ranked 102, who had lost in the first round in each of his past five grand slam events. But the 30-year-old Brown has a playing style all of his own and for once he put it together on the biggest stage to record the best win of his career, slamming 58 winners in the process.</p> \n<p>Born in Germany but raised in Jamaica before switching his nationality back to that of his native land in 2010, the dreadlocked, athletic Brown has the kind of unorthodox game that can infuriate many a better player, causing them to lose rhythm.</p> \n<p>Nadal wore a forlorn expression on his face for much of the match, never able to relax as Brown came forward at every opportunity. Slicing forehands and hitting drop shots at will, he looked to be enjoying the whole experience, which cannot be said for Nadal.</p> \n<p>Still, the Spaniard had his chances. An early break gave him a 2-1 lead in the first but some poor serving gave Brown the break back for 3-3. Nadal’s serve looked vulnerable and when he offered Brown a set point at 5-6, he was almost knocked over by a blistering backhand return and the set was gone. As in the first, Nadal broke for 2-1 in the second set and this time he held on, breaking for a second time to level the match.</p> \n<p>It seemed unlikely that Brown would be able to maintain his standard of play but that is what Nadal thought when Lukas Rosol beat him in round two in 2012. As then, so Brown continued to attack and after a double fault from the Spaniard, another brilliant drop volley gave Brown a 4-3 lead, which he maintained to take the third set.</p> \n<p>Nadal’s mental resilience has never been in doubt – after all, he had won the title in Stuttgart on grass the week after losing his French Open crown, having lost to Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals. But against such a big server and free hitter as Brown, he knew that one mistake could be fatal. It came in the opening game of the fourth set when, having saved one break point with a good serve, he missed two bread-and-butter forehands to hand Brown the break.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/roger-federer-sam-querrey-wimbledon-2015\">Roger Federer shows sublime touch to beat Sam Querrey at Wimbledon 2015</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nadal’s last hope was that Brown’s nerve would fail him but, though he blew a chance for a double break, missing a break point in the fifth game, he continued to press. The only time Brown’s nerve failed him was when, at 5-3 and 15-40 on the Nadal serve he held two match points, but let a pass go that he could have made, only to see it land smack on the baseline.</p> \n<p>Nadal then saved the second match point and held serve to force Brown to serve it out. Suddenly the comeback seemed a possibility but Brown served brilliantly, sealing it with an ace for a remarkable victory.</p> \n<p>His reward is a clash with Viktor Troicki of Serbia, a four-set winner over Britain’s Aljaz Bedene. Nadal had been a possible last-eight opponent for Andy Murray but if Brown continues to play like this, then it is not beyond the realms of possibility he could make it there himself.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435862732799/Dustin-Brown-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dustin Brown celebrates after winning the third set against Rafael Nadal in their second-round match at Wimbledon.

He won the equivalent of the Rising Star award for best young player, and was poached by Richmond the following year. He joined Brisbane in 1987, picking up the club’s best and fairest award.</p> \n<p>A handy wingman, it was as an old-school coach – “a hard man, a hard taskmaster,” Adelaide legend Graham Cornes said – that Walsh left his biggest imprint on the game.</p> \n<p>He became Geelong’s strength and conditioning coach in 1995, joined Port Adelaide as an assistant coach four years later and then West Coast in 2009. Last year he re-joined Port, before applying for the vacant spot at the Crows and winning it.</p> \n<p>“He bloomed, it was the opportunity he had been waiting for,” Cornes said on Friday.</p> \n<p>This obsessive focus on football left little room for anything else. Asked if he was a good father, he admitted “that’s a really hard question”.</p> \n<p>“The bonus of me taking the Crows job is my son is 26 and my daughter is 22, so the collateral damage isn’t so big. But have I been a good father? To my son, I had a disconnect because of footy,” he said.</p> \n<p>“In a selfish way, I taught my daughter to surf, and that’s my release, so when I go surfing, I take her. Now I’ve got my son into it as well and that’s what I should’ve done a long time ago.</p> \n<p>“A couple of months ago we all went surfing together at Middleton and it was almost the best day I’ve had ... ever,” he said.</p> \n<p>“We all got a wave, went to the bakery on the way home, we smiled, and laughed and there was none of this stuff, that I’ve got Melbourne, then the Bulldogs, then Port. Just none of that.”</p> \n<p>Single-mindedly was the way you played sport in Hamilton, a town set among sheep pastures in Victoria’s west. The grass never got a chance to grow at the Walsh house, trampled by his five hockey-playing sisters and his own backyard heroics.</p> \n<p>“Those days, you were either playing or training virtually every night of the week, except Sundays, even as kids,” a friend, Brian Guy, <a href=\"http://v\">told the Adelaide Advertiser</a>.</p> \n<p>His qualities as a leader were obvious. Walsh was elected school vice-captain at Monivae College, where he is still listed as a wingman in the school’s team of the century.</p> \n<p>“I’d say Walshy was limited skill-wise, but jeez, he was fit,” former Collingwood team-mate, Gavan Bell said. “That was his key. He was a good player, courageous, all that stuff. He was a hard working, defensive winger. That’s what he was about.”</p> \n<p>A near-death experience in Peru in late 2012 – he was hit by a bus and flown back to Australia for treatment – had broadened his horizons. “I saw the white light, had the drowning sensation,” Walsh said. “I thought I’d die.”</p> \n<p>He quit drinking, dedicated himself to mastering Japanese and kept an image of the Peruvian street as his screensaver. “That’s my wake up call every day, as soon as I turn my computer on,” <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/adelaide-coach-phil-walsh-invites-mark-robinson-into-the-inner-sanctum-of-the-crows-and-his-life/story-fnp04d70-1227308300112\">he told the Herald Sun</a>. “Don’t get too angry, Phil.”</p> \n<p>Walsh had yet to complete his first year as Adelaide’s coach when he died on Friday, aged 55. The level of esteem he had built over two decades in the coaches’ box was only beginning to be known.</p> \n<p>“He spoke at [former Melbourne coach] Dean Bailey’s funeral, and he spoke so beautifully and eloquently and without notes,” Cornes recalled on Friday. “You gained the sense immediately there there was a depth and a side to this man the rest of the world needed to see.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7563a63c6aaa3268f3a7256a7e3990a36a36b336/0_129_2500_1500/2500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1500,"width":2500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Michael

prospect of facing her childhood idol Serena Williams for the first time in the third round at Wimbledon on Friday would appear to be no more daunting than the likely consequences of an unlikely victory there: a fourth-round match against her sister, Venus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/heather-watson-serena-williams-alize-cornet\">How Heather Watson can beat Serena Williams – according to Aliz&eacute; Cornet</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Venus, not for the first time, is in her sister’s quarter of the draw and must beat the Serbian Aleksandra Krunic to play either Serena or Watson, whom she beat the only time they met, in Beijing last year, 6-3, 6-1.</p> \n<p>Double-Williams: that’s quite a challenge for Watson, but, when asked if the more immediate task against the younger and considerably more dangerous of the two brilliant sisters was the biggest match of her career, the British No 1 was encouragingly relaxed.</p> \n<p>“Don’t know,” she said. “Haven’t really thought of it like that. I just really look forward to playing her. Draws are funny like that. Sometimes you can play the same person three weeks in a row, and then you might not play one person for maybe three years. She is a great champion and a legend in the game, so it will be a great experience for me – and where better for me to play her than here at Wimbledon?”</p> \n<p>Watson has gone this deep after a fighting come-from-behind win over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/30/heather-watson-caroline-garcia-wimbledon\">Caroline Garcia</a> – the French player identified a few years ago by Andy Murray as one to watch – and an even more impressive 6-4, 6-2 victory over the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/01/heather-watson-daniela-hantuchova-wimbledon-serena-williams\">Slovakian Daniela Hantuchova</a> on Wednesday. It has buoyed her occasionally flagging spirits. Serena, the world No1 and obvious favourite, gave up just five games to the Russian qualifier <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/serena-williams-margarita-gasparyan-wimbledon-2015-first-round\">Margarita Gasparyan</a> then beat the Hungarian <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/01/serena-williams-beats-timea-babos-wimbledon-2015-heather-watson\">Timea Babos</a> by the same margin. She has not been remotely stretched yet.</p> \n<p>Watson said she first became aware of the Williams sisters on her initial visit to Wimbledon as a child.</p> \n<p>“It was when I came to Wimbledon and I bought two posters. I was like seven or eight years old. One was Venus and Serena together and one was Roger Federer. Those were the three players that I liked. They went straight up on my wall.”</p> \n<p>She next saw Serena at Nick Bollettieri’s academy in Florida. “When I was 12 or 13 at school there it was a big thing for her to come and train, so all of our teachers let us out of school to go and watch her practise and play. We were just hundreds of us schoolkids there. I don’t know if she signed autographs there. And now I might get the opportunity to play her, and it’s really exciting. When people that don’t know much about tennis find out I play tennis, one of the first questions is: ‘Have you played Serena?’ And I’m like: ‘No – but I have played Venus.’”</p> \n<p>Watson says she does not know either of them socially, adding: “Yeah I would say hello – but I say hello to everybody!”</p> \n<p>As for Serena’s legendary regal presence in the locker room, Watson said: “I always find I don’t see her that much. I don’t know what time she practises. Some people you see all the time, but I hardly see her. But she does have a presence about her. She is a strong woman, and even if she wasn’t a tennis player she would have a presence.”</p> \n<p>All of that will count for nothing at all when they confront each other on Friday. Watson has had stretches of form this year that promised more than they delivered. Playing at Wimbledon might well provide a significant edge to her game but she will do well just to stay in the contest with one of the greatest players of all time.</p> \n<p>Serena is not just No1 of this and many other years, and of her era, but a contender for consideration at the very peak of her sport. Watson will hardly admit beforehand that the privilege of playing her would be enough for her, but, on balance, that is not a bad result.</p> \n<p>And she would likely prefer this match against a legend than a softer one in another part of the draw.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435855320362/Wimbledon-Championships-2-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Heather Watson has impressed at Wimbledon this year but now faces Serena Williams.

No boundary here is sacred now.</p> \n<p>Ward – who will keep his Davis Cup place ahead of Bedene after the ITF recently denied his right to represent his adopted country – next plays the accomplished young Canadian Vasek Pospisil, who beat the eccentric, dangerous Italian Fabio Fognini 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 in just over two hours on Court 12.</p> \n<p>Murray, however, remains the kingpin of the British game. After coming through a tougher examination in the first round against Mikhail Kukushkin, he hit another level against Haase, beating him 6-1, 6-1, 6-4 in under an hour and a half.</p> \n<p>His opponent on Saturday is the Italian Andreas Seppi, who finished impressively to see off the precocious challenge of the rising Croatian star Borna Coric 4-6, 6-4, 6-7 (3), 6-1, 6-1.</p> \n<p>Murray, who is enormously supportive of other British players, was particularly pleased for Ward, who bears the perennial mien of the put-upon underdog, although he was quick to put his achievement in perspective.</p> \n<p>“Obviously the draw opened up,” Murray said. “He was to play [David] Ferrer in the first round – an extremely difficult draw. Then playing a lucky loser [Luca Vanni] in the first round, he’s taken advantage of the opportunity that he’s had at a very important time for him, as well, because he hadn’t won so many matches lately.</p> \n<p>“After here, he has quite a lot of points to defend. It was very important for him to capitalise on that. He’s won a couple of good matches. Today I saw the last couple of games. Vesely is a tough opponent. It was a good win for James today. He has an opportunity again in the third round.”</p> \n<p>Ward was plainly thrilled about his progress, although typically downbeat in his response to even the slightest praise. “It’s great,” he said. “Obviously my ranking goes up, into third round of Wimbledon … I can’t ask for anything more at the moment.”</p> \n<p>Asked whether winning back-to-back matches at Wimbledon was comparable to Arsenal, his team, winning two FA Cups in a row, he said, “Winning third round would probably be like Arsenal winning the league next year, to be honest. After that, we start thinking about Champions League finals. Let’s think about Saturday first.”</p> \n<p>Ward and Murray have an interest in the north London club, Ward’s driven by birth – he is the son of a Euston cab driver – Murray’s by an admiration for their football. It is a bond that has contributed to the good feeling between them, either as Davis Cup team-mates or campaigning in a slam, which they are doing side by side now, rather than Ward going home early.</p> \n<p>“He’s just a good friend above all,” Ward said. “We get on really well. We have a lot of the same interests as well outside of tennis. He’s always there supporting, he’s always watching matches. A lot of people know that he follows live streams of challengers, is always there to send you a message when you’ve done well, or pick you up when you need a bit of support.</p> \n<p>“A lot of stuff that he does and says really doesn’t get reported that much. As I said for few of us, it’s nice to have that support from such a great player.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/02/wimbledon-2015-day-four-live\">Rafael Nadal knocked out of Wimbledon 2015 by Dustin Brown – day four as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Murray added: “I’ve spent a lot of time with him over the last 12, 18 months.We’ve done a few training blocks together. He stayed with me in Miami a few times. I watch a lot of his matches online when he’s playing challengers and stuff.”</p> \n<p>As for their joint assault on the third round, Ward remains cool-headed rather than sentimental. “Everyone is concentrating on their own thing,” Ward said. “It’s great for British tennis and it’s great for everyone involved that more people are winning matches and doing well. But, as I say, I’ve got to worry about my match. Andy worries about his. Aljaz worries about his as well.”</p> \n<p>Murray is looking only towards his match against Seppi. “He has had such good results this year. He made the final a couple of weeks ago in Halle, plays well on the grass. He won against Roger [Federer] at the Australian Open this year. He’s capable of playing some top tennis.”</p> \n<p>Ultimately, they are all on their own here.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435871384916/487fd76a-a7fb-4c2e-9a9e-229b6e9f52c1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media/UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media","altText":"James Ward","cleanCredit":"Photograph: UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media/UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T21:15:59Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T23:55:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Kevin Mitchell","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741641/KevinMitchell.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/kevinmitchell"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Wimbledon 2015","Andy Murray","James Ward","Wimbledon","Tennis","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/andymurray","webTitle":"Andy Murray"},{"id":"sport/james-ward","webTitle":"James Ward"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Kevin Mitchell","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/kevinmitchell"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/andy-murray-james-ward-wimbledon","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4abgv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/02/andy-murray-james-ward-wimbledon","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/02/andy-murray-james-ward-wimbledon"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435871384916/487fd76a-a7fb-4c2e-9a9e-229b6e9f52c1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"James Ward celebrates his four-set victory against Jiri Vesely at Wimbledon.

If I win just another grand tour it’s not going to change my career but if I achieve the double this is something people are going to remember. I take a lot of motivation from this.”</p> \n<p>The winner of the 2007 and 2009 Tours added he would have preferred to be on the start line feeling as he did in 2014 before his race was curtailed after breaking his leg in a fall during the 10th stage. “It’s new to me, how my body will respond to the effort.”</p> \n<p>The Spaniard believes the 2015 race is “one of the most open in Tour history”: “In the first nine days there are six intense stages. It will be a Tour without respite.”</p> \n<p>He rates the 2014 Giro winner, Nairo Quintana of Movistar, as favourite in a Tour “for the climbers”. But he also sees his major challengers as last year’s winner, Vincenzo Nibali of Astana, citing the Italian’s consistency, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/video/2013/jul/23/chris-froome-tour-de-france-2013-video-highlights\" title=\"\">and the 2013 champion, Sky’s Chris Froome</a>. “On his day he has a change of rhythm that nobody can follow,” Contador admitted.</p> \n<p>While those four appear to be the main contenders to wear the yellow jersey into Paris, Trek Factory Racing’s Fabian Cancellara has his eyes firmly set on winning Saturday’s prologue in the Netherlands, in what may prove to be his final Tour. Nicknamed Spartacus for his aggressive riding style, the Swiss crashed badly in March and missed the Cobbled Classics. He battled back at the Tour de Suisse, narrowly losing the opening prologue to the Dutchman Tom Dumoulin of Giant-Alpecin, who will meanwhile carry local hopes at the Grand D&eacute;part in Utrecht.</p> \n<p>“I’m looking forward to this,” Cancellara said. “I have my goals and my ambitions but first I will try also to enjoy the race and all the experience I have to put it into the race because it is a special one, a tough one.”</p> \n<p>Among his challengers will be Tony Martin (Etixx-Quickstep), the three-time world time trial champion and Britain’s Alex Dowsett (Movistar) who held the Hour record until Sir Bradley Wiggins broke it in style in June.</p> \n<p>After his press conference, some Dutch journalists presented Contador with a canary – he bred them before turning professional – and the Spaniard named it Yellow.

None of us knows what’s going to happen over this five-Test series. It would be wrong for me to speculate but I do know that Alastair is incredibly motivated for this series and he is in a better frame of mind going in to it than he has been for a quite a while”.</p> \n<p>Strauss, who knows more than anyone how life as England captain evolves, believes that his Test captain recognises that there is a new style of cricket that England need to continue playing to be successful and to keep the public on side. “I think everyone involved in English cricket got a real lift from the two series against New Zealand, in the way those games were played and the type of cricket England played. It made us all appreciate and understand the importance of engaging with the public.</p> \n<p>“Ultimately we are in the entertainment business and people have a choice whether they turn on cricket on television or go and watch a cricket match or do something different. We’ve got an obligation to make the product one that people want to watch.”</p> \n<p>The last time Strauss sat down in front of the media things looked very different. He was under fire about Kevin Pietersen, for the way the sacking of Peter Moores was handled and in the shadow of England’s disastrous World Cup campaign. Fast forward two months and things could not have really gone any better for him, his decision to back Eoin Morgan as one-day captain has already been vindicated by the attractive limited-overs matches against New Zealand. Strauss is too classy to be smug but in a very short space of time he seems to have achieved at least one of his goals; reconnecting with the English cricket watching public.</p> \n<p>Strauss was speaking at the Kia Oval to promote Cricket for Heroes, an all-star T20 match in which he will playing alongside many other cricketing stars.</p> \n<p>The match is being played to raise money for Help for Heroes and Strauss was keen to remind us, that despite all the pre-Ashes aggression, this is cricket not war.</p> \n<p>“In the context of what we’re talking about today, it makes you realise it’s not about life and death, it’s games of cricket between two very passionate sides who want to desperately win. But I don’t think we need to build it into something it’s not. I think the war rhetoric when it comes to the Ashes is unhelpful.”</p> \n<p>In that vein, Strauss thinks that Bayliss is absolutely perfect for the job. “He won’t take it too seriously but as an Aussie he will be determined to win.

The Spaniard, who won the title in 2008 and 2010 but who has slipped down to No10 in the rankings after struggles with form and confidence, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/dustin-brown-rafael-nadal-wimbledon\">was beaten 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4</a> in the second round by Dustin Brown, a German qualifier ranked 102.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/dustin-brown-rafael-nadal-wimbledon\">Rafael Nadal crashes out of Wimbledon after bravura Dustin Brown display</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Looking more down than ever as he tried to sum up the effect of another early defeat – his fourth consecutive loss before the quarter-finals here – Nadal said the only thing he can do is keep trying to get back to the form that took him to 14 grand slam titles. “I lost,” he said. “Sad today for that, obviously. But end of the day, that’s sport. Good moments, bad moments. Obviously today is a bad moment for me.</p> \n<p>“I just need to accept these kind of things that can happen. I did all my career. Keep going. It’s not the end. It is a sad moment for me but life continues. My career, too. I have to keep going and working more than ever to try to change that dynamic.”</p> \n<p>When he lost in round two in 2012 and in the first round in 2013, Nadal had been struggling physically, with his knees a real problem. Last year, when he lost in round four to Australia’s Nick Kyrgios, he was blown off the court and on Thursday, Brown outgunned him with power and finesse.</p> \n<p>“It is obvious that 2012 and 2013 were not an issue,” he said. “I was not competitive. Too much problems on my knees. Last year and this year, no problems at all with my knees. I was ready to compete. I lost. I don’t know if I will be back to the level of 2008 or 2010 or 2007 or 2006 or ’11.</p> \n<p>“My motivation is try to be back to that level. I am going to keep working on that. But if I don’t make that happen, actually I played five times here the last day, had the trophy back home two times, so it is not bad. At the end of the day, today I lost. Don’t forget I played five finals here. I don’t know how many players did that.”</p> \n<p>Nadal, who lost his French Open title last month when he was beaten by Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals, rued a series of missed chances to beat Brown, who played well above his ranking and threw the Spaniard off his game with aggressive net play backed up by stunning shot-making and dozens of drop shots.</p> \n<p>The Spaniard admitted he had simply made too many mistakes and left himself too much to do. “On this court especially, you meet players that don’t want to play from the baseline sometimes,” he said. “You cannot have mistakes against a player like him with that big serve, nothing to lose, serving first and second almost the same speed. Without having rhythm at all. I didn’t hit three balls in a row the same way. Then when you need to hit that ball, extra ball, you don’t have the confidence to do it. That’s what happened.”</p> \n<p>Having gone two sets to one down, Nadal said the start of the fourth set had been the final straw. “First game of the fourth set was terrible for me,” he said. “A very disappointing moment. Two forehands that I should not make the mistake with. I did not play that forehand during the whole match. Arrive at that one, you lose confidence, you miss another.</p> \n<p>“Then I fought at the end, but no chance at all on the return. That’s it.”</p> \n<p>Nadal will return home to Mallorca, try to forget the experience and move on. “I had the right preparation, all the things I thought were going to be fine to play a good Wimbledon,” he said. “I am not a person that will be thinking about it for the next two weeks. But obviously today it’s tough.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435870987411/Rafael-Nadal-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rafael Nadal suffers during his defeat to Germany's Dustin Brown in the second round match at Wimbledon.
