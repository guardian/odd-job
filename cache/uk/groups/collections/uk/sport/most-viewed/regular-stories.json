This year, he has trebled that number.</p> \n<p>Fifteen years to the day since Woods won the US Open by 15 shots, he topped a three-wood from the middle of the 18th fairway at Chambers Bay into the deepest bunker on the course. Already nine over par, his hopes of breaking 80 suddenly vanished. He has rarely looked so dejected, so beaten, so incapable of the rousing return for which many golfing fans long. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/henrik-stenson-dustin-johnson-us-open\">Henrik Stenson and Dustin Johnson rise above mishaps to lead US Open</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This has become painful viewing, which leaves onlookers to wonder just how Woods truly feels about his sharp demise. For all he has been adamant that more competitive play is the key to improved performance, the 14-time major winner is suffering embarrassment after embarrassment in front of the watching world. Cole Hammer, a 15-year-old amateur, outscored Woods by three here. </p> \n<p>After what seems an inevitable missed cut on the outskirts of Seattle, it would be no real surprise if Woods opts to take another break from tournament play. Despite his positive comment to the contrary, there is no evidence whatsoever that Woods can threaten, let alone dominate, leaderboards. Woods has more rounds in the 80s during this season than the 60s. Some form of reassessment is required. </p> \n<p>Prior to Thursday, his highest-scoring single US Open round was 77; that was as an amateur in 1996. Chambers Bay witnessed the fourth highest round of Woods’s professional career. To his credit, and in a departure from what plenty others would do in the same lamentable scenario, a sanguine Woods faced the media thereafter. He had just produced a back nine of 41. </p> \n<p>“I’m not very happy, that’s for sure,” said the 39-year-old. “It was a tough day. I got off to a bad start and then just couldn’t quite get it turned around.</p> \n<p>“It’s one of those things, just got to work through it. I’m trying as hard as I can to do it, and for some reason I just can’t get the consistency that I’d like to have out there.</p> \n<p>“I fought, I fought hard. And that was my number. I couldn’t grind out any harder than that. So that’s just the way I played and unfortunately it was a high number today.”</p> \n<p>Woods admitted this is as challenging a period as he has ever encountered. His solution? “Keep working. Keep grinding and keep working.”</p> \n<p>The 13th hole at Chambers Bay has the widest fairway in US Open history; Woods missed it. He triple bogeyed the 14th. Earlier, at the 8th, his club flew into the air from his hands as he played from wild rough. The 16th witnessed his solitary birdie. </p> \n<p>There was also a smile. If Woods’s score wasn’t a shock, the 81 of Rickie Fowler, one of his playing partners, certainly was. “The bright side is, at least I kicked Rickie’s butt today,” Woods said. That sense of humour has never been more necessary. </p> \n<p>Fowler has been the model of recent major championship consistency and was many people’s tip to claim this event. Barring something astonishing, he won’t survive for the weekend. Only one player, a club professional named Rich Berberian, scored worse on day one than Fowler.</p> \n<p>Henrik Stenson and Dustin Johnson shared the lead at five under par 65. Patrick Reed lies a shot adrift.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/82b691e5dc926d147a3df7473be9d4d868a07ed1/0_108_4928_2957/4928.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2957,"width":4928,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Harry How/Getty Images","altText":"A frustrating day at the office for Tiger Woods","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Harry How/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T03:54:11Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T08:08:40Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":89,"contributors":[{"name":"Ewan Murray","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/26/1401131130466/Ewan-Murray-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ewanmurray"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["US Open Golf 2015","US Open","PGA Tour","US sports","Golf","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/us-open-golf-2015","webTitle":"US Open Golf 2015"},{"id":"sport/usopengolf","webTitle":"US Open"},{"id":"sport/pga-tour","webTitle":"PGA Tour"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"sport/golf","webTitle":"Golf"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ewan Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ewanmurray"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/us-open-day-one-tiger-woods","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avk7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/19/us-open-day-one-tiger-woods","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/19/us-open-day-one-tiger-woods"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/82b691e5dc926d147a3df7473be9d4d868a07ed1/0_108_4928_2957/4928.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2957,"width":4928,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tiger Woods reacts to a shot from the rough on the eighth hole during the first round of the 115th U.S. Open Championship at Chambers Bay.

However, anti-doping officials on Thursday confirmed they would have tried repeatedly to rouse him during the hour in question by knocking on his door every 10-15 minutes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/18/mo-farah-protect-reputation-alberto-salazar\">Mo Farah being left on back straight in race to protect reputation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Meanwhile Nicole Sapstead, the UK Anti-Doping chief executive, said that, while she was not at liberty to discuss individual cases, it was “not common for athletes to miss two tests” in a 12-month period. A third missed test would have counted as the equivalent of a failed drugs test and could have led to Farah receiving a possible four-year ban.</p> \n<p>Farah, who is training in Font Romeu in France, is now taking advice from the public relations agency Freud’s, which calls itself “the world’s leading strategic marketing and communications consultancy”. It is also well-known for providing discreet advice to clients and celebrities.</p> \n<p>One expert with intimate knowledge of the situation called Freud’s “experts in crisis management”. Given the intense focus on Farah during the past fortnight, the agency will need to be.</p> \n<p>It is also understood that Farah wants to put his side of the story but feels unable to speak until his coach, Alberto Salazar, has responded fully to allegations that he broke anti-doping rules. A further complication is that Farah’s agent, Ricky Simms, also manages Galen Rupp, the American who was also accused by the BBC’s Panorama of wrongdoing.</p> \n<p>Among the charges against Salazar are that he gave the banned steroid testosterone to Rupp when he was 16, coached him to get a therapeutic use exemption so he could use an intravenous drip before the 2011 world championships and flouted several other doping rules. Salazar and Rupp deny all allegations and Farah has not been accused of anything illegal.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/mo-farah-alberto-salazar-denies-relationship-breakdown\">Alberto Salazar denies his relationship with Mo Farah has broken down</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>However, Farah is facing renewed scrutiny after a report in the Daily Mail, which revealed an email exchange between Ukad and Farah’s representatives suggesting the runner missed one test in 2010 and another in early 2011 shortly after he had joined Salazar’s training group in Oregon.</p> \n<p>The paper said that Farah had stated he did not hear the doorbell when missing his second test and that his agent, Simms, submitted video evidence filmed in Farah’s house in which he tried to show that it was difficult to hear the doorbell from his client’s bedroom, due to a noisy altitude machine used to help athlete’s breath oxygen-reduced air to improve performance. Ukad decided despite the video that Farah was guilty of negligence in missing the test, rather than the more serious offence of evasion, which could carry an automatic ban.</p> \n<p>Under the so-called “whereabouts” system introduced in 2009 elite British athletes have to specify where they will be for an hour a day in each 24-hour period. During that time testers can turn up unannounced.</p> \n<p>Graham Arthur, Ukad’s legal director, said that the agency followed a “detailed protocol” if an athlete did not answer the door to a doping control officer immediately at the prescribed hour.</p> \n<p>“They are required to make reasonable efforts to locate the athlete. Ringing the doorbell every 10 or 15 minutes, knocking and staying for the full hour,” he said. “We often ask them to stay just past the hour on the off-chance the athlete is running late. We want to collect the sample, we don’t want them to miss the test.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/18/missed-drug-tests-mo-farah-wada\">Missed drug tests happen but three strikes and out feels about right | Owen Gibson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Arthur said that, if Ukad had evidence that an athlete was deliberately avoiding testers, it would attempt to take action under Wada’s code for evasion, which carries a ban of up to four years. But he conceded that such cases could be difficult to prove, with Ukad having to prove to a standard of “comfortable satisfaction” that the athlete was deliberately evading the testers.</p> \n<p>Sapstead added: “One missed test isn’t serious for us. Clearly if an athlete acquires a second one, it escalates our concern because they are that much nearer to three. They have three chances at this before they face a sanction.”</p> \n<p>Ukad published figures showing that during 2010 there were 43 missed tests among the 394 athletes across all sports in its elite testing pool. In 2011 it rose to 66 of 365 and in 2012 stood at 40 of 361. Each of those athletes would have been tested at least three times in a 12-month period.</p> \n<p>Arthur added: “Three strikes is the rule. That’s the formula that has been agreed by Wada, sport and government that strikes the correct balance between their privacy and an athlete who might make one or two genuine mistakes and an athlete who evades the system. Once an athlete has made one mistake, our experience is that is usually enough and they comply with the system after that.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/18/1434637730143/mo-farah-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mo Farah reportedly did not hear the doorbell when drug testers arrived at his house.

Chambers Bay has its critics but already some of the world’s best players are in prominent positions, which is an undeniable positive.</p> \n<p>“Walking off the 16th, both feet in the air, he got trapped with a wrist under the bag,” Stenson explained of Lord’s accident. “It might be broken or just torn ligaments. So he’s not in a good place with the hand but he managed to caddie and did a good job for me anyway. I had to caddie for him a little bit, as well.</p> \n<p>“It’s definitely dangerous with those slopes. The grass gets shiny and lays down. It gets a bit like ice skating out there. So I’m sure the spectators are going to have to watch themselves as well.”</p> \n<p>Day one controversy was not entirely linked to matters of health and safety. Chronically slow play, with rounds stretching to more than five hours, was branded “pathetic” by Bubba Watson. Inevitable as that scenario was, it does nothing for golf either as a spectator sport or one to which youngsters will be drawn.</p> \n<p>The chronic state of this eight-year-old venue’s putting surfaces was not lost on competitors. Colin Montgomerie branded them “very poor for a major championship” and Sergio Garc&iacute;a confirmed they are “as bad as they look on television”.</p> \n<p>Rory McIlroy was more diplomatic after his disappointing opening round of 72. It was solely on the greens that the world No1 struggled, which was not entirely his own fault. It was clear from early in the round that McIlroy’s confidence had been jolted by a lack of certainty as to how putts would run. He had encountered the same issue at recent events in England and Ireland.</p> \n<p>“They aren’t the best greens I have ever putted on but I still feel that, if you have a good stroke and the right speed, there is a chance the ball will go in,” said a diplomatic McIlroy. “I just need to find some rhythm in my stroke over the next three days.</p> \n<p>“It is frustrating, especially because of how I felt I hit the ball from tee to green. I gave myself enough chances which I couldn’t take and then I missed a couple of short ones coming in. I definitely felt there was a low score out there and I didn’t take advantage of that.”</p> \n<p>Martin Kaymer, the defending champion, matched McIlroy’s score. There was an even-par Thursday for Garc&iacute;a but another European Ryder Cup player, Jamie Donaldson, slipped to a 74.</p> \n<p>Johnson had a chance to match the lowest opening round in a major championship when six under par through 17 holes. He duly dropped a shot on the 9th, his 18th, but was understandably content with this start.</p> \n<p>Johnson can lay claim to being the most talented American of this era who has yet to win one of the game’s big four titles. Like Stenson, his lead-up was hardly ideal; Johnson withdrew during the first round of last weekend’s St Jude classic because of illness. “Before now I had been a little frustrated,” Johnson explained. “I’ve been playing pretty well, I had some good finishes but just wasn’t striking it like I wanted to.</p> \n<p>“I have done a lot of good work with Butch Harmon and felt really comfortable when I came out here on Saturday. I was really swinging well. I’ve really got a good feel for the golf course because I’m swinging a lot better than I have been in the past few weeks. And that carried right over into today.”</p> \n<p>Experience lurks with intent. Phil Mickelson, seeking to win finally the one major to have eluded him, reached three under at the turn before shipping two shots back to the course. The 45-year-old maintained he was “very pleased” after signing for 69. Just days before his 52nd birthday, Montgomerie was even happier with the same score.</p> \n<p>Stenson and Johnson were resting up by the time Tiger Woods took to the links. The 14-times major winner’s start was entirely, sadly predictable; a bogey continued a run of failure to make par or better on the opening hole of a tournament in 2015. Woods used to create staggering statistics for altogether different reasons. The changing of golf’s guard has been a wounding process for Woods. Oh, how it carries on apace.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/19/1434670388785/Henrik-Stenson-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Henrik Stenson hits his tee shot on the 6th hole at Chambers Bay during his first round at the US Open.

It has to be dramatic, passionate, funny where possible, but above all memorable. Here are the OSM top 10.","standFirst":"","byline":"Lee Honeyball","body":"<b>1</b> 'Lord Nelson! Lord Beaverbrook! Sir Winston Churchill! Sir Anthony Eden! Clement Attlee! Henry Cooper! Lady Diana! Maggie Thatcher - can you hear me, Maggie Thatcher! Your boys took one hell of a beating! Your boys took one hell of a beating!'\n<br /> \n<b>Said by </b>Bjorge Lillelien on Norwegian TV\n<br /> \n<b>When </b>Norway beat England 2-1 in Oslo in a World Cup qualifier in Sept 1981\n<p>Lillelien's gloriously over-the-top response to Norway's unlikely victory over Ron Greenwood's side marked the high watermark of football commentary as social commentary. Passionate, uninhibited and a bit weird, football fans everywhere from Scotland to Argentina knew exactly what he was saying: that there is no pleasure as sweet as beating England at their own game.</p>\n<p><b>2</b> 'Suddenly Ali looks very tired indeed, in fact Ali, at times now, looks as though he can barely lift his arms up... Oh he's got him with a right hand! He's got him! Oh you can't believe it. And I don't think Foreman's going to get up. He's trying to beat the count. And he's out! OH MY GOD he's won the title back at 32! Muhammad Ali!' <br /> <b>Said by </b> Harry Carpenter <br /> <b>When </b> Muhammad Ali beat George Foreman in Oct 1974</p>\n<p>When Ali's rope-a-dope tactic exploded into life in the eighth round few people could believe their eyes, least of all it seemed Harry Carpenter. Just as he suspected Ali was teetering on the verge of defeat, a thunderous right hand did the unthinkable. Shouting to be heard above the din in Zaire, Carpenter's is one of the few pieces of sports commentary that does justice to the moment being described.</p>\n<p><b>3</b> 'He didn't quite manage to get his leg over...'<br /> <b>Said by </b> Jonathan Agnew<br /> <b>When </b> England v W Indies, 1991</p>\n<p>After an attempted hook Ian Botham spun and became unbalanced as he tried to step over his wickets to avoid standing on them - but in narrowly failing to do so Beefy brushed the leg-stump with his inner thigh and was out. Agnew's gag, while sat alongside Brian Johnston in the radio booth, was the cause of much juvenile sniggering. 'Do stop it Aggers!' Johnston was heard to splutter in the background while struggling to stifle his laughter. Reduced to tears the pair were barely able to talk for several minutes. Not everyone was amused though and they were, in true schoolboy fashion, banned from commentating together again.</p>\n<p><b>4</b> 'And Desert Orchid's beginning to get up as they race towards the line. There's a tremendous cheer from the crowd as Desert Orchid's gonna win it. DESERT ORCHID has won the Gold Cup. Yahoo is second. Charter Party is third. Simon Sherwood punches the air. Dessie's done it...'<br /> <b>Said by </b> Peter O'Sullevan <br /> <b>When </b> Cheltenham Gold Cup, 1989</p>\n<p>Not usually one to get too carried away, even O'Sullevan lost his cool amid the drama of Desert Orchid's Gold Cup win. Heavy ground and Cheltenham's stamina-sapping hill had never suited Dessie, yet as the grey improbably started to edge his way in front O'Sullevan sensed victory and with the rest of the crowd stood to roar the people's favourite home.</p>\n<p><b>5</b> 'It is only twelve inches high... It is solid gold... And it undeniably means England are the champions of the world.'<br /> <b>Said by </b> Kenneth Wolstenholme <br /> <b>When </b> England were crowned world champions, 1966</p>\n<p>Not the 'they think it's all over... it is now' line you might expect from that match, but surely superior to the one that has become a tired cliche. Wolstenholme once told The Observer's Will Buckley that he was much prouder of this line than the more famous one because it was replayed at Bobby Moore's memorial service in 1993. Which is good enough for us.</p>\n<p><b>6</b> 'The big Cuban opened his legs and showed his class'<br /> <b>Said by </b> David Coleman<br /> <b>When </b> Montreal Olympics, 1976</p>\n<p>The man who gave his name to a commentary cock-up (the Colemanball) could sometimes be so bad he was good. Like here, for instance. As Cuban Alberto Juantorena - nicknamed 'El Caballo' (the horse) for his muscular appearance and nine-foot stride - powered to 400m and 800m gold medals in Montreal, Coleman began his fine foot-in-mouth tradition with this observation.</p>\n<p><b>7</b> 'And Damon Hill exits the chicane and wins the Japanese Grand Prix... and I've got to stop, because I've got a lump in my throat'<br /> <b>Said by </b> Murray Walker<br /> <b>When </b> At the Japanese Grand Prix in 1996 as Damon Hill become world champion</p>\n<p>Rather than select one from his vast array of Murrayisms ('The car in front is absolutely unique, except for the one behind which is identical'; 'Mansell can see him in his earphone', etc) this was the moment when Walker's favourite driver, Damon Hill, became world champion. 'It was the most emotional moment of my broadcasting life' he said later. 'I felt everything welling up and thought &quot;Christ, I'm going to burst into tears&quot;. In my heart of hearts, I was worried that Damon wasn't going to get the job done.'</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>8</b> 'He's a poor lad' <br /> <b>Said by </b> Eddie Wareing <br /> <b>When </b> After Don Fox's woeful miss in the 1968 rugby league Challenge Cup final</p>\n<p>The most dramatic miss in rugby league history, but where others might have banged on endlessly, this was all Wareing said about Fox's woeful kick in the dying seconds. Somehow it fitted the moment, as if Wareing did not want to intrude on Fox's obvious grief. As the Wakefield Trinity player sank to his knees, hands on head, he'd just handed Leeds the cup. Wareing's reaction has now become almost as famous as the miss itself.</p>\n<p><b>9</b> 'Oh I say' <br /><b>Said by </b> Dan Maskell <br /><b> When </b>Every Wimbledon for 43 years.</p>\n<p>Maskell was a commentator of few words whose golden rule was that 'a second's silence is worth a minute's talk'. In addition to the lovely 'Oh I say' he also favoured 'quite extraordinary' and 'a peach of a shot' as his other stock phrases. Not one for risking the unpronounceable, though, Maskell famously always referred to Martina Navratilova as simply 'Martina'.</p>\n<p><b>10</b> 'It's up for grabs now...'<br /> <b>Said by </b> Brian Moore <br /> <b>When </b> Just as Michael Thomas was about to score Arsenal's second at Anfield and steal the title from Liverpool in 1989</p>\n<p>Moore at his brilliant best. 'In my commentating life I've churned out a few repeatable lines,' he later wrote, 'but this one, even a decade later, Arsenal fans are happy to use as a form of greeting. I was in a taxi driving round Piccadilly when the driver suddenly and joyfully started repeating the last full minute of my commentary on that night. He knew it word for word.'</p>\n<p><b>Justifying the selection...</b></p>\n<p>This month's 10 was selected by OSM writer Lee Honeyball. Here he justifies his choice:</p>\n<p>A great piece of sports commentary must contain several elements. It has to be dramatic, passionate, funny where possible, but above all it must have something that makes it memorable enough to stay in public consciousness for years afterwards.</p>\n<p>In his over-the-top exaltations following Norway's 2-1 over England in 1981, Bjorn Minge almost impossibly managed to fulfil all of the above criteria in one go - so the mighty Norwegian had to be No 1.</p>\n<p>Great sporting moments aren't necessarily always accompanied by great bits of commentary. Indeed it is rare for the two to combine. When they do though, as with Harry Carpenter's impeccable calling of the Rumble in the Jungle, it can turn a great sporting moment into a golden one. For his faultless commentary Carpenter had to placed at No 2.</p>\n<p>The remaining selections, from Botham nearly getting his leg over against the West Indies to Brian Moore's 'it's up for grabs' all contain varying degrees of one or more of the outlined criteria and have been placed in terms of the resonance that they have today.</p>\n<p>This isn't a list about gaffes either - which means there's no room for any Big Ronisms or Kevin Keegan howlers, although as the standard bearer in that department David Coleman's assertion about Alberto Juantorena had to be permitted.</p>\n<p>Near misses include former snooker commentator Jack Karnehm's whispered 'Good luck mate' to Cliff Thorburn as the Canadian got down to pot the black in the first televised 147, and John Motson screaming 'Radford again... oh, what a goal! Radford the scorer, Ronnie Radford! And the crowd are invading the pitch...' during Hereford's win against Newcastle in the FA Cup third round giant-killing of 1972.</p>\n<p><b>Now you have your say...</b></p>\n<p>Have we left out your favourite bit of commentary? We thought so. Write and tell us what it is and explain why. If you are feeling really energetic you could even give us a full 10 along, with a justification for your selection in no more than 50 words.

I’m never coming back.” </p> \n<p>De La Hoya had teased fans in a radio interview earlier this month, in which he suggested a comeback was on the cards. “There’s not one day that passes by that I [don’t] think about making a comeback. If I did make a comeback, I’d want to fight the very best,” he said. Did that mean Mayweather?</p> \n<p>Mayweather triumphed in the pair’s only fight, winning a split decision victory after a closely fought 12 rounds for the WBC light middleweight championship in May 2007. At the time, the bout was the most lucrative boxing match ever, with over $130m generated in revenue, and tickets for the bout went within three hours of going on sale.</p> \n<p>The pair continued to trade barbs after De La Hoya retired. After Mayweather beat Manny Pacquiao in May in a fight that lacked vim and vigour, but which the American won on points, De La Hoya said: “Call me old school, but I like the fans getting their money’s worth by watching an action-packed fight.”</p> \n<p>De la Hoya won 10 world titles in six different weight titles and finished his career with a 39-6 record, including 30 total knockouts, but his last professional fight ended in defeat against Pacquaio.</p> \n<p>Mayweather, 38, has one fight remaining on his Showtime contract and has suggested several times that he intends to retire after a final fight in September. He was dismissive of the undefeated Gennady Golovkin, who has been touted as a possible opponent.</p> \n<p>“He can’t beat me,” Mayweather said of the 33-year-old Kazakh. “I thought he was straight up and down. No special effects. He can punch, but I seen him in his last fight [against Willie Monroe]. I don’t even know who that guy was. If I worked with the guy, the guy would have beaten him.</p> \n<p>“It’s my dream fight.
