Such is the confidence coursing through the veins of the team that, after compiling <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/england-new-zealand-first-odi-match-report\">their first total north of 400 runs</a> at Edgbaston on Tuesday, Joe Root believes they can better that performance when they take on New Zealand in Friday’s second one-day international at a sold-out Oval.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/11/matt-prior-announces-retirement-professional-cricket-england\">Matt Prior announces retirement from professional cricket</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Root’s point – and it is a fair one – is that four of their biggest hitters in Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Ben Stokes and Sam Billings contributed only 33 runs between them to an otherwise 50-over all-you-can-eat buffet in Birmingham that saw 408 for nine posted before the tourists were bowled out for 198. Get those three firing and Eoin Morgan’s side, on another batsman-friendly pitch, can continue kicking off the shackles that dogged the winter’s harrowing World Cup campaign.</p> \n<p>“You’ve got guys who are explosive batters who didn’t get off the ground the other day,” said Root, after England trained in glorious south London sunshine. “We have shown that we can do it now and what we want is to try and replicate it. We won’t do it every week but we’ll take that approach into every match.”</p> \n<p>Asked if the mood in the dressing room had changed significantly since their troubled winter, Root added: “It’s not massively different. There are still a lot of the same blokes in that team and it is just nice to see us come back so strongly from that World Cup so quickly. Obviously it is only one performance and our main thing going forward is to be more consistent.”</p> \n<p>England, who are expected to remain unchanged, are certainly on a ground that produces for them consistently, with wins in seven of their past eight games played at The Oval. New Zealand, meanwhile, will probably recall the rested Tim Southee in place of Matt Henry, as they look to move level in the five-match series. Root is certainly wary of a backlash from Brendon McCullum’s World Cup finalists.</p> \n<p>“We’re not naive enough to think New Zealand won’t come back hard at us, because they’re a great side,” said Root, whose 71-ball century powered Tuesday’s monstrous effort. “They’ve proved that now for the last couple of years in one-day cricket and we’re going to have to play extremely well to get another win under our belts.”</p> \n<p>Root’s positive outlook for a repeat of Edgbaston’s pyrotechnics should come as no surprise, of course. It was the Test vice-captain who said at Headingley that his team-mates would come out <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/01/england-all-guns-blazing-win-second-test-new-zealand\">“all guns blazing”</a> in their final-day pursuit of 455 only to see them bowled out for 200 short of that target and draw the series 1-1. While those juicy soundbites drew more guffaws than sage nods, in modern one-day cricket such a mind-set is the only option.</p> \n<p>Despite losing wickets at regular intervals on Tuesday, not once did they contemplate that very English of fallback positions – consolidation. Instead they continued their rapid ascent to the summit of the mountain. The plaudits duly flowed the way of the batsmen, with Root’s third-fastest century in English history quickly moved down a spot by Jos Buttler’s 66-ball effort before the bowlers rolled the tourists.</p> \n<p>Among the wickets was the leg-spinner Adil Rashid, who followed his 50-ball 69 with figures of four for 55 in only his seventh ODI and who now has cricket’s cognoscenti pondering whether he can make the jump to Test cricket in time for this summer’s Ashes series. Root has few doubts that his Yorkshire team-mate, who claimed 46 victims in last season’s title win, has the ability.</p> \n<p>“Why not?” said Root, when asked about Rashid’s prospects of challenging Moeen Ali for his place. “I’ve seen what he has done in county cricket – and you’ve seen he can perform at international level in one day cricket – so I’m sure if given the opportunity he’d love to show everyone what he can do. He is a phenomenal talent and I’ve known that for a long time now.</p> \n<p>“I’m absolutely thrilled to bits for him. He’s a cheeky little chap in the changing room. He doesn’t really say much but when he does it’s great value. To see Rash perform like that was great. I obviously knew he was capable of it but again I’m thrilled for him and he’ll be excited to get back out there and replicate it.”</p> \n<p>Rashid’s white-ball prowess has already received interest from teams in Australia’s Big Bash League, with Adelaide Strikers, who will be coached <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/mar/22/jason-gillespie-yorkshire-adelaide-strikers-big-bash\">by Yorkshire’s Jason Gillespie this winter</a>, the 27-year-old’s expected destination should England decide against naming him for their Test tour to South Africa.</p> \n<p>First up for the wrist-spinning all-rounder will be proving that Tuesday’s haul was not a one-off, with New Zealand’s batsmen hoping to have wised up to a googly that their No3 Kane Williamson admitted was “well-disguised” and that Root confessed he often fails to pick in the nets at Yorkshire.</p> \n<p>The tourists were not surprised by England’s attacking intent with the bat, however, with Williamson admitting he expected fast scoring when he saw the make-up of the squad that showed six players from their doomed World Cup campaign dropped.</p> \n<p>He said: “I saw they had made a lot of changes and I’m familiar with most of the players, having played county cricket over here, and I knew to expect they’d play aggressively. There’s a lot of stroke-makers in that line-up. But to score 400 is not something that happens very often and it was a great effort.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434047217003/Englands-Sam-Billings-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Sam Billings takes a catch during nets as the team prepare to take on New Zealand in the second ODI at the Oval.

But a recent advertising blitz – including peak-time spots during ITV’s Champions League final coverage, full page newspaper adverts, a deal to show the Games live on BT Sport and logos on the shirts of Atl&eacute;tico Madrid – has raised its profile.</p> \n<p>Among those attending the opening ceremony will be the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The British Olympic Association chairman, Lord Coe, is expected to watch Nicola Adams, a gold medallist from London 2012, lead a team of 160 athletes behind the union flag. The junior minister Tobias Ellwood will represent the UK government.</p> \n<p>Also watching will be Simon Clegg, the former BOA and Ipswich Town chief executive who is chief operating officer for the organising committee, and Patrick Hickey, the Irish International Olympic Committee member who has long dreamed of Europe having its own event to rival the Asian Games and the Pan-American Games.</p> \n<p>But the only state Hickey, having worked up the idea, could find willing to host it was run by a rich autocrat who has ruled Azerbaijan with a combination of crude repression internally and sophisticated networking internationally, quickly dubbed “caviar diplomacy”.</p> \n<p>Some sports are taking the new event seriously but swimming and athletics, two of the most attractive to television audiences, will compete only in junior and third tier events respectively.</p> \n<p>Outwardly the European Games has all the accoutrements of any major modern sporting event. The mascots, the venues, the athlete’s village, the volunteers, the transport shuttles, the sponsors – including BP, which has long had a presence in the country – have all been willed into being in 30 short months. Baku’s rulers are keen to promote an image of a youthful, modern nation open for business.</p> \n<p>The familiar rhetoric – that major sporting events are good for business and help rebrand a nation in the eyes of the world – is employed by the legions of contractors brought in from across the world. But behind the glitz and ambitious plans to host other events from the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/mar/05/bernie-ecclestone-deal-f1-grand-prix-azerbaijan\" title=\"\">first Baku Formula One race next year</a> to four matches in the Euro 2020 football championships, there lies an unprecedented crackdown.</p> \n<p>Reporters Without Borders ranks <a href=\"http://index.rsf.org/#!/\" title=\"\">Azerbaijan 162 out of 180 countries</a> for press freedom.

When Baku hosted the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest, the event was accompanied by a string of negative stories about human rights. Rasul Jafarov, who was involved with the Sing for Democracy campaign, is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/23/azerbaijan-jails-two-rights-campaigners\" title=\"\">among those now in prison</a>, sentenced to six and a half years on trumped up charges.</p> \n<p>Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, and the first lady, Mehriban Aliyeva, will watch the opening ceremony and events across 20 sports in 16 venues from the best seats in the VVIP section. A Wikileaks cable from 2010 described Aliyev, who took over from his father in 2003, as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/03/azerbaijan-european-games-human-rights\" title=\"\">a mixture of Michael and Sonny Corleone</a> from The Godfather.</p> \n<p>While his Michael side was marked by “pragmatism, restraint and a helpful bias toward integration with the West”, his inner Sonny was “increasingly authoritarian and hostile to diversity of political views”. Azerbaijan’s many critics would argue that his Sonny side has come to the fore as the Games have approached. They say civil society in the country has been all but destroyed by intimidatory tactics, frozen assets, threats and arbitrary arrests.</p> \n<p>For the oil-rich state on the shores of the Caspian, the first European Games fits into a plan that included failed bids for the 2016 and 2020 Olympics and a likely tilt at the 2024 Games.</p> \n<p>The event, which cost a reputed &pound;6.5bn to put on, has accelerated attempts to quash free speech and unleashed fresh criticism from human rights campaigners.</p> \n<p>Amnesty has identified at least 20 prisoners of conscience while activists within the country list more than 100 political prisoners. Many more have fled or been silenced.</p> \n<p>In December Khadija Ismayilova, an investigative reporter who uncovered corruption among Aliyev’s family and friends, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/greenslade/2014/dec/08/azerbaijani-journalist-detained-on-outrageous-charge-editor\" title=\"\">was arrested on what appeared trumped up charges</a> of inciting attempted suicide in a former colleague. Weeks later the studios of Radio Free Europe, the last independent broadcaster in Azerbaijan, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/dec/26/us-funded-radio-station-azerbaijan-baku-raided\" title=\"\">was raided and sealed</a>. Ismayilova faces up to 12 years in prison.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile the human rights defenders Leyla and Arif Yunus <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/aug/28/azerbaijan-activists-leyla-arif-yunus-charges\" title=\"\">were arrested in July last year</a>, five days after Leyla called for a boycott of the Games. They are awaiting trial on charges of fraud and treason. Intigam Aliyev, a human rights lawyer who had taken over 300 cases to the European Court of Human Rights, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/23/azerbaijan-jails-two-rights-campaigners\" title=\"\">was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison</a> in April following a trial condemned as unfair by the US and British governments.</p> \n<p>“Rasul Jafarov, Leyla Yunus and Khadija Ismayilova, along with the other jailed journalists and human rights defenders, are prisoners not just of the Azerbaijani regime but also prisoners of the European Games,” says Rebecca Vincent, of the Sport for Rights campaign. “While Europe watches the Games and turns a blind eye to the human rights crackdown taking place in the background, it is the country’s political prisoners who are paying the price.”</p> \n<p>From Hitler’s annexing of the Olympic rings for the Berlin 1936 Games to the Argentinian military junta hosting the 1978 World Cup, using major sporting events for political ends is not new. However, the scale of the investment – from the $51bn spent by Putin on the Sochi Winter Olympics to the hundreds of billions being sunk into the desert to make Qatar ready for the 2022 World Cup – has raised the stakes on what autocratic leaders expect in return.</p> \n<p>Yet even Putin did not try to quell dissent to the extent that Ilham Aliyev is attempting by banning international reporters. In addition to refusing the Guardian’s request for accreditation, Human Rights Watch said at least three other journalists had been denied entry.</p> \n<p>“Media freedom is a central pillar of the Olympic movement,” said Rachel Denber, deputy Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “By denying visas to reporters covering the Games, Azerbaijan and President Aliyev are rejecting one of the basic rules for hosting the event.”</p> \n<p>So far only the German and Swedish Olympic Committees have criticised Azerbaijan’s human rights record. Bill Sweeney, the BOA chief executive, said it was supportive of the European Games as a concept – even if its future is now in doubt after the Netherlands on Wednesday <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/10/netherlands-pulls-out-european-games\" title=\"\">pulled out of an agreement</a> to host the next edition in 2019.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Sweeney criticised the decision to ban the Guardian but earlier this week insisted it was not the BOA’s place to comment on human rights issues. “We are here purely for the sports reasons and not political reasons,” he said. “Once the venue is selected our primary focus is the sport.”</p> \n<p>The Guardian revealed earlier this year that the Baku 2015 organisers were effectively <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/feb/26/azerbaijan-european-games-baku-athletes-bill-human-rights\" title=\"\">paying the majority of the expenses</a> of the 50 competing nations. In that context the argument over whether to speak out against the hosts is complicated further.</p> \n<p>The widespread criticism is also awkward for the IOC and its president, Thomas Bach. It recently agreed to take human rights considerations into account when deciding on host cities; this week it heard presentations from Almaty in Kazakhstan and Beijing in China – the only bidders for the 2022 Winter Olympics.</p> \n<p>“This increases the pressure on the BOA, on the EOC and on national Olympic committees around Europe to finally break their silence over the human rights situation in Azerbaijan,” said Naomi Westland of Amnesty International, who was also refused entry to the country. “There comes a point where silence becomes complicity. And if athletes want to speak out, they should be allowed to do so.”</p> \n<p>Despite being almost expressly designed to glorify a ruthless regime, the Games have also provided a platform for criticism; banning journalists and respected NGOs is likely to have the paradoxical effect of raising awareness of Azerbaijan’s issues. When the Guardian visited Baku in December, a string of activists, underground opposition politicians, bloggers, journalists and campaigners expressed hope that it could have the opposite effect to that intended by Aliyev. Yet the staging of these Games raises troubling and urgent questions for a global sports community that cannot simply continue to put its fingers in its ears.</p> \n<p>Last year even Bach admitted: “In the past people have said sport is nothing to do with politics, or with money and business. This attitude is wrong and we cannot afford it any more.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434044330466/European-Games-Baku-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A reported £6.5bn have been invested in the European Games, yet human rights groups and journalists have been refused visas to attend.

It’s hard not to get caught up in the Delly madness just because he’s been such an integral part of the Cavs’ run over the last couple of series, but I think it’s important to remember that the context of this series matters when trying to determine whether or not he’s actually any good. First, the refs are letting him hand-check Curry with virtual impunity; it’s borderline shocking given how much the league’s cracked down on it these last few years. It’s a lot easier to look like a great defender when you’re being allowed to make illegal physical plays against the skinniest guy in the league. Secondly, the Dubs are straight-up giving him open shots, because LeBron needs extra coverage and Delly’s a shaky shooter. Seriously, when was the last time you saw a guy throwing up multiple underarm lobs around the paint in Playoff ball?! Give 90% of NBA ballers the consistent open looks that Dellavedova’s getting and they’ll suddenly look like offensive threats too. Finally, the Cavs are playing caveman, attritional basketball which suits Delly’s demented grizzled wallaby game perfectly. Ask him to play Golden State or Spurs-style basketball and I think you’d pretty damn quickly see his limitations. In other words, he’s the right guy in the right place at the right time and somebody - probably GM LeBron - is going to pay him more than he’s worth because of that.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>I would definitely say that this success is more of a byproduct of what LeBron is doing this series than anything else. It’s also kinda boring to keep hitting the “LeBron James is great at basketball, so it’s a more fun story.”<br /></p>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-557a2ee8e4b0d852ce137734","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-12T01:00:33Z","body":"<p><strong>Predictions</strong></p> \n<p>Email from Jesse Harrington:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I am predicting an 91-83 GSW win today.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>A part of me wishing I went for a bigger margin in a Warriors win today.

And yet results tell a positive story: since the start of 2006, in the supposed autumn of his career, the Spaniard has finished in the top 13 in at least one major per season.</p> \n<p>In 2012, 2013 and 2014, he won European Tour events. Earlier this year, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/23/miguel-angel-jimenez-pga-championship\" title=\"\">Jim&eacute;nez set a European Tour record</a> for holes in one, having notched two in as many weeks. He is ranked inside the top 10 on the European Tour’s order of merit and top 50 in the world. Any element of external shock over this is met with a shrug.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/23/miguel-angel-jimenez-pga-championship\">Miguel &Aacute;ngel Jim&eacute;nez thrills Wentworth crowd with hole-in-one record</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I don’t know what people think but what I love to do is what I am doing now,” Jim&eacute;nez explains. “I love to compete with the best, I love to compete with modern golf.</p> \n<p>“My game is not as powerful as the new generation but I still can control the ball, I still can play the game. I still like to test myself against them. I love what I do. When Thursday comes and I am competing against them, that is what I want to do. That has never changed.”</p> \n<p>One battle Jim&eacute;nez lost was when seeking to become Europe’s Ryder Cup captain for the trip to Hazeltine next year. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/feb/18/darren-clarke-europe-ryder-cup-captain-2016\" title=\"\">Darren Clarke beat him and Thomas Bjorn to the role</a>. “No, no,” insists Jim&eacute;nez when asked if he was wounded by that scenario. “I have a lot of respect for Darren, who will do a great job there.</p> \n<p>“It was fine. I have a lot of respect for the decision made. It is not as if we are fighting against people there. I said to Darren: ‘You have all my support, for everything you will do at the Ryder Cup’. I told Darren if there was anything at all he needed, I am here.”</p> \n<p>Jim&eacute;nez offers a firm “yes, of course” when asked if he will again set his sights on the captaincy for the 2018 Ryder Cup in France. He is similarly forceful on the topic of captains from continental Europe being a necessity.</p> \n<p>“It is important that the captain has a good connection with the players,” he says. “It doesn’t matter where you are from. British, Irish, continental Europe, what is the difference? We are European people and you need to connect with others.” And understand some of golf’s dark arts: Jim&eacute;nez indulged in some of them during a row with Keegan Bradley at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in May. Bradley later admitted he was “schooled” by the wise Spaniard. “He got under my skin,” added the American. Jim&eacute;nez won the match, just as he had earlier thumped Bubba Watson 5&amp;4.</p> \n<p>Jim&eacute;nez is a clear example of how modern-day equipment can add longevity to a golfer’s career. However, this isn’t an exact science, otherwise every player over 50 would still be a threat and capable of finishing fourth in the Masters, just as Jim&eacute;nez did in 2014.</p> \n<p>“The help is unbelievable,” he concedes. “The ball is harder, the ball is going far longer than 20 years ago. Even for myself, I can hit it far longer than 15 years ago and I’m 51 now. Golf courses are lengthening and lengthening but we need to find other ways to make the game difficult. We should have target golf, not only power golf. You need to prepare the golf course more as a target, not for power.”</p> \n<p>Jim&eacute;nez is hardly slowing down. Last weekend at the Nordea Masters he teed up for a fourth week in succession. There were two second-placed finishes in that run. A brief hiatus will be followed by an appearance at next week’s US Open before the man from M&aacute;laga heads immediately to its senior equivalent. He has already won twice on the Champions Tour, including in January.</p> \n<p>“It is difficult to combine both Tours because it means a lot of travel, mainly, and the golf courses can be very different in America to Europe. But it comes, age comes, 50 comes,” Jim&eacute;nez says. “It has probably come too early for me but I don’t want to let the European Tour down because I feel like I am still competitive there. And I want to play. With the seniors, I want to see a lot of people who I haven’t met for a long time; it is very competitive there.</p> \n<p>“It is a little more friendly, perhaps. But it is still competitive; we compete, that is what we do. That is what we love to do.”</p> \n<p>Jim&eacute;nez will not win at Chambers Bay – the US Open is the major he retains the worst record at, having made five cuts in 12 appearances – but this presents the latest opportunity for his talented compatriot Sergio Garc&iacute;a to end his major drought. Four of the past five US Opens have been won by Europeans But can Garc&iacute;a eventually claim one? “I think so,” says Jim&eacute;nez. “He is a great player. He has been close to that major several times but this seems like his time. Phil Mickelson hadn’t won majors until quite late and then won a few of them.”</p> \n<p>Never mind Mickelson, a veritable pup at 44; if anyone knows a thing or two about profiting when all forms of logic point to the contrary, it is Jim&eacute;nez.</p> \n<p><em>Miguel &Aacute;ngel Jim&eacute;nez is an ambassador for polarised Hawaiian sunglasses brand Maui Jim, official eyewear supplier of the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth</em></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/11/1434030791386/Miguel--ngel-Jim-nez-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Miguel Ángel Jiménez says he would happily help Darren Clarke in his role as Europe's 2016 Ryder Cup captain despite missing out on the position.

It’s time for a change. The recent downward trend in participation has demonstrated that the current approach has had its day. It’s not the return we expect to see for a large investment of public money.”</p> \n<p>The figures also show the number of people playing no sport at all had increased by 1.2 million on last year. Almost six in 10 adults still do not play sport regularly.</p> \n<p>Sport England’s figures show that between October 2014 and March 2015, 15.5 million people did some kind of sport once a week, every week.</p> \n<p>That figure hit a high of 15.9 million in October 2012 in the wake of the London Games, leading to confident claims that Britain could deliver where no previous Olympics had done and inspire a lasting uplift in participation.</p> \n<p>However, the trend is now firmly in the wrong direction. There are widespread fears that Britain is becoming a two-tier sporting nation, with the figures showing that lower socio-economic groups are doing less and less sport.</p> \n<p>Sport England continues to put pressure on individual governing bodies that it feels are not performing but Crouch intends to construct an entirely new strategy for the next four-year funding period from 2017.</p> \n<p>“I will consult with the sector on a new approach that will strengthen sport across the country, focus support on those that can deliver the goods and look to take a more joined-up approach to sport and physical activity across Whitehall,” she said. Before London 2012 the system was recalibrated to funnel around 40% of Sport England’s annual spend through national governing bodies such as British Cycling, the Football Association and the England and Wales Cricket Board.</p> \n<p>The decline is also more pronounced among those sports that rely heavily on local authority facilities, with swimming recording the biggest decline. Gym and keep fit also recorded its first decline since the current measuring system began, falling by 153,000.</p> \n<p>Government cuts to local authority budgets have led to disproportionate reductions in sport and recreation spending, which tends not to be ringfenced.</p> \n<p>“It’s a disaster. It’s showing government cuts are having a major impact on facilities and participation. The last coalition government set about destroying everything that had been put in place to make the most of the legacy,” said Efford.</p> \n<p>“There is some fundamental rethinking that needs to go on at Sport England about how they use their resources. We can’t go on the way we are. We’re not getting enough cut through in the right places.”</p> \n<p>Efford offered to sit down with Crouch in an effort to reach a cross-party consensus on the best way forward. “Unfortunately what we keep getting is a sticking plaster to cover up a set of disastrous figures,” he said. “My challenge to the government would be: sit down and talk to us. Let’s get together a long-term, cross-party plan to deal with this.”</p> \n<p>The Sport England chief executive, Jennie Price, said that the Amateur Swimming Association had to work better with local authorities and leisure operators to make pools more attractive and to encourage casual swimmers. The number of people swimming once a week has plummeted by 390,700 in the past year alone.</p> \n<p>The ambition to increase participation through spending &pound;9.3bn on hosting the London Games has long proved contentious.</p> \n<p>While the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games were firmly focused on delivery, there was little thought given to legacy. Locog chairman Lord Coe had a shortlived role as a legacy ambassador in the Cabinet Office but soon left to pursue his other roles.</p> \n<p>A lack of joined-up thinking across Whitehall departments and an initial concentration on persuading those already active to exercise more rather than tempt those who had never played or were lapsed back into sport also stymied progress.</p> \n<p>Price said governing bodies that were delivering could expect to see their funding maintained but suggested that many others would face major cuts.</p> \n<p>Basketball and running were among the sports to deliver increases in the latest set of figures. Sport England’s budget is also likely to come under renewed pressure in a new round of cuts this autumn.</p> \n<p>“There are governing bodies that can deliver growth. There are governing bodies that can change and improve – the LTA is a good example of that,” said Price. “British Cycling is an example of a governing body that does a great job. But there will be a tougher, more nuanced approach.” Price pointed to its approach in basketball, where it now works alongside a range of charities and other delivery partners as well as the governing body, as a possible way forward.</p> \n<p>She said the LTA had also revolutionised its approach to participation, focusing more on park tennis and links with local authorities, and had seen an increase of 38,200 to 422,400 a week as a result.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434046536267/Newcastle-City-Pool-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"City Pool in Newcastle, which was closed in 2013 because of cuts to council budgets.

Bowlers bowl through to them, fielders return the ball to them.

Both Knott and Alec Stewart, as keeper, scored more runs – 4,389 and 4,540 respectively – than his 4,099 but neither came close to matching his average of 40.18, a figure exceeded for England only by Les Ames, 2,387 runs at 43.4.</p> \n<p>In global terms, others, in addition – Adam Gilchrist, Mark Boucher, MS Dhoni, Andy Flower and Brad Haddin – have scored more runs and, as well as Ames, Gilchrist, Flower, AB de Villiers, BJ Watling and Kumar Sangakkara (marginally) have better averages of those who have played a meaningful number of games behind the stumps.

Right from his first innings, he pulled willingly and witheringly, drove venomously through the off-side and cut and carved ferociously.</p> \n<p>There was another side, however, exemplified by the last of his Test centuries, an epic <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/mar/26/matt-prior-draw-new-zealand\" title=\"\">unbeaten 110-run rearguard innings</a> at Eden Park in Auckland which marshalled the tail so skilfully that it saved the match for his side, and prevented a series win for the Kiwis. It was an innings that seemed to drain the life from him, for he made a pair in his next match, and in a further 24 innings, only twice reached a half-century.</p> \n<p>His keeping, certainly in the early years, was cumbersome – hamfisted even – the work of a stopper rather than a glovework artist. At The Oval in 2008 he let through 33 byes in the first Indian innings, while in Trinidad the following winter it was a world record 52 byes in the match, figures that no team can sustain. The campaign for real keepers was in full voice.</p> \n<p>His response was to work with Bruce French, who countenanced greater mobility rather than better glovework as a remedy. So Prior trained even harder but rather than bulk up, he slimmed down. At his peak he had been transformed in the same way as had Stewart, and so in the fullness of time will Buttler. No England cricketer of his time strove harder for improvement.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434043396014/8abd68b2-1978-46b1-8444-5a322837a61c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom Shaw/Getty Images","altText":"Matt Prior , England cricketer","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tom Shaw/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434033043111/bab9bfab-af53-4103-b186-06e9b23c15de-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Matt Prior celebrates his maiden century for England on his Test debut against West Indies at Lord’s in May 2007.

Whether it’s expedited TUEs [therapeutic use exemptions], Astana, Cookson is not very good at taking people down.” Seasoned Armstrong watchers will appreciate the distancing devices – “plenty of people” and “you guys can decide”. Armstrong’s real motivation here is not whether Cookson has done a better job than his predecessors Pat McQuaid and Hein Verbruggen, both lambasted in the CIRC report for their close relations with the Texan, but rather that Cookson publicly voiced his opposition to Armstrong <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/11/lance-armstrong-fears-trial-voldemort\" title=\"\">riding the Tour de France route a day before the race</a> with the cancer campaigner and former footballer Geoff Thomas. This is back to the Armstrong of old, denigrating those who criticise him or dare to stand in his way. One would like to think he had become a more humble person but on this evidence he has not.</p> \n<h2><strong>He feels nothing has changed in cycling since he was there</strong></h2> \n<p>Armstrong states: “I absolutely don’t think [cycling] is in a better place.” Perhaps he does not remember how cycling was when he was in his pomp, and just after. Cycling is far from being pure – and may never be – and there are still doubts that should be voiced, but certain things have clearly changed. Needles are outlawed. A host of top riders post-Armstrong have been caught and banned. The biological passport has given cycling a human face. There has been a massive and very public culture change in the way many teams engage with the doping issue. The UCI has put unprecedented pressure on one of the biggest teams, Astana, over doping. Indeed, you could now argue that the question for a rider is not “why not dope?” but “why take on the trouble?” Armstrong has at least been consistent on this: he says what he did was necessary and the sport cannot be redeemed. Until he publicly gets his head around the fact that cycling has moved on – and has done so without him – everything he says should be given the Mandy Rice-Davies response: “Well, he would say that, wouldn’t he?”</p> \n<h2><strong>He wants reintegration into the cancer community</strong></h2> \n<p>With Armstrong and Livestrong, as time went on, it was always hard to define the area where his devotion to the cancer community melded into the propaganda that built him into an American hero and the same problem exists around the ride with Thomas. The worth of the cause cannot be denied but the extent to which Armstrong is using it to rebuild his profile and as a platform to campaign for his reintegration into the sport has to be questioned.</p> \n<h2><strong>He is fearing financial ruin as the $100m lawsuit drags on</strong></h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/11/lance-armstrong-fears-trial-voldemort\">Lance Armstrong admits fears over trial – and compares himself to Voldemort</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The true financial victims of the Armstrong era – of cycling’s blood doping culture of the 1990s and 2000s as a whole – were the riders who made the decision not to dope, or not to do so as intensely as their peers, and whose careers suffered immeasurably as a result. One rider from back then – who was clean himself but got by through winning what he could – pointed to a team-mate who opted not to dope and ended up as a taxi driver. In that context, as Armstrong vents his concerns from a holiday home in Colorado, sympathy should be tempered.</p> \n<h2><strong>He is adamant that he won seven Tours</strong></h2> \n<p>“If I didn’t win them, then who did? If you ask all the people who [rode], they will tell you who won. That’s the most important part.” Here Armstrong has a point of a kind, but it’s not one that has anything to do with him personally. It arises simply because of the confusion that exists in the record books. There is no adequate explanation why Bjarne Riis – who confessed to doping with EPO en route to victory in the 1996 Tour – is listed as a Tour winner, while Floyd Landis and Armstrong have been expunged. What the confusion does is permit Armstrong to claim he has been victimised, which suits the script he is attempting to write for himself: everyone did it; I have been singled out for unfair treatment. But not everyone did dope in cycling between 1998 and 2010, and of the many who did dope, not all did so with the intensity and public aggression that marked Armstrong. Doping is a shades of grey issue, but Armstrong has never done nuance.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/11/lance-armstrong-fears-trial-voldemort\" title=\"\"><strong>He feels he is treated like Lord Voldemort</strong></a></h2> \n<p>“I’m that guy everybody wants to pretend never lived. But it happened, everything happened. We know what happened. Now it’s swung so far the other way … who’s that character in Harry Potter they can’t talk about? Voldemort? It’s like that on every level. If you watch the Tour on American TV, if you read about it, it’s as if you can’t mention him.” We are back to Armstrong’s need to portray himself as a victim, which goes back to his explanation for his doping: everyone did it, I had no option. Amusingly, Armstrong was actually nicknamed the “Dark Lord” among journalists at one point because his control freakery meant that, as per JK Rowling, “The Dark Lord always knows.” One key point about Voldemort is that he never quite understands the human qualities that set Harry Potter apart. Perhaps we should now add: “The Dark Lord never learns.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434043638495/afda64cc-b016-40c3-8599-a5fcf17edf27-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Thao Nguyen/AP","altText":"Lance Armstrong","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Thao Nguyen/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-11T16:51:17Z","lastModified":"2015-06-11T23:45:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":129,"contributors":[{"name":"William Fotheringham","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/williamfotheringham"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Lance Armstrong","Cycling","US sports","UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale)","Drugs in sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/lance-armstrong","webTitle":"Lance Armstrong"},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"sport/uci","webTitle":"UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale)"},{"id":"sport/drugs-in-sport","webTitle":"Drugs in sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"William Fotheringham","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/williamfotheringham"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/11/lance-armstrong-interviews-deconstructed","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49yj6","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jun/11/lance-armstrong-interviews-deconstructed","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jun/11/lance-armstrong-interviews-deconstructed"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434043638495/afda64cc-b016-40c3-8599-a5fcf17edf27-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lance Armstrong does not appear to have become more humble in the years that have passed since he admitted to having doped while cycling.
