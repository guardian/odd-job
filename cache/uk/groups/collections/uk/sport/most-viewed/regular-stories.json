while pointing at umpire <br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Kyrgios earlier warned over ‘audible obscenity’</p>","byline":"Owen Gibson at Wimbledon","body":"<p>Nick Kyrgios could face a heavy fine after apparently refusing to try in protest at receiving a code violation for swearing during his fourth round defeat to Richard Gasquet. The Australian, who has divided opinion with his on court antics but often delighted crowds during the first week, was warned by umpire James Keothavong for an “audible obscenity” early in the second set.</p> \n<p>In the following game, which Gasquet won to take a 3-0 lead, Kyrgios appeared entirely uninterested, tapping his returns back into the net while pointing at the umpire.</p> \n<p>He denied he had stopped trying during the game in question, deflecting the question, but pointed instead to his subsequent resurgence to claw his way back into the match.</p> \n<p>“I mean, today, there was a lot of ups and downs. Obviously, you know, it was a tough, tough time, especially when he’s not missing any balls,” he said.</p> \n<p>“I’m getting frustrated myself. I feel as if I’m not playing not how I should be playing. I’m angry at myself.”</p> \n<p>International Tennis Federation rules state: “A player shall use his best efforts to win a match when competing in a grand slam tournament. Violation of this section shall subject a player to a fine up to $20,000 [&pound;12,860] for each violation.”</p> \n<p>An ITF spokeswoman confirmed that even though Kyrgios, who lost to Gasquet in four sets, was not warned by the umpire for lack of effort action could still be taken against him retrospectively once the video had been reviewed.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think I was treated unfairly,” said Kyrgios, who split with his coach Todd Larkham the week before the Championships. “If they decide to fine me they can fine me.”</p> \n<p>Even in defeat, the 20-year-old was the talk of the All England Club during a match in which he also complained about “external bullshit” and got into a lengthy exchange about the amount of time it took to change his socks after the umpire urged him to hurry up at a change of ends.</p> \n<p>“You know, I’m not perfect out there. I’m going to have ups and downs,” he said. “It’s the way you respond from that. I think it takes some serious balls to respond the way I did.”</p> \n<p>At other points, he loudly admonished himself for his serving or kept up a running dialogue with the crowd and his entourage.</p> \n<p>He refused to elaborate on his external issues, saying they were personal. “There’s a lot of things going on at the moment that aren’t focusing on actual tennis. There’s just a lot of stuff going on,” he said.</p> \n<p>Of an episode where he hugged a ballboy, he joked: “I just felt like a hug, I guess. Everyone now and then wants a hug.”</p> \n<p>Gasquet, who exorcised the demons of last year when he lost to Kyrgios in five sets and forfeited nine match points, said his opponent was “a very nice guy” but “was a little bit angry, a little bit frustrated” during the contentious episode in the second set.</p> \n<p>The French player went on to win the set 6-1 as Kyrgios threatened to fold completely. But he rallied in the following set only to lose the fourth on a tie-break.</p> \n<p>The Australian’s on court demeanor has attracted praise and opprobrium in equal measure, split between those who think the game needs more characters and those who find his behaviour unbecoming.</p> \n<p>During his first round match he received a code violation after refusing to play on following a disputed line call and was also picked up by a microphone muttering “dirty scum” - a comment he insisted was aimed at himself and not the umpire.</p> \n<p>During his second round victory over seventh seed Milos Raonic he was warned for bouncing his racket into the ground and failing to control it as it flew into the stands.</p> \n<p>“It is true, he likes the show, of course. Everybody can see that. But I still think it’s good to have some players like that on the circuit,” said Gasquet afterwards.</p> \n<p>“Sometimes people are talking because the players are boring or something. Now we have someone who is doing different things.”</p> \n<p>Following his defeat, a smiling Kyrgios later headed out to play mixed doubles with his partner Madison Keys as though he hadn’t a care in the world. They eventually lost in three sets, with far less controversy, to Lukasz Kubot and Andrea Hlavackova.</p> \n<p>Kyrgios said it was the best part of his day. He also supported his teammate Bernard Tomic, who has been dropped from the Davis Cup team after accusing the Australian Tennis Federation of abandoning him following injury.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436214236432/Australias-Nick-Kyrgios-t-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Australia's Nick Kyrgios has a disussion with the umpire during his fourth-round defeat against Riachard Gasquet at Wimbledon.

He has been in two of them, first wrestling with the bitterness of defeat by Roger Federer in 2012, then savouring the sweet triumph over Novak Djokovic the following year, as if the experience were a trial of his resolve.</p> \n<p>On a deceptively mild Monday afternoon, then, with a capricious breeze to sooth his reddening brow, he endured another hazardous part of the journey leading towards the ultimate test of his character, when he laboured for just over three hours to beat the Croatian mountain masquerading as a tennis player, Ivo Karlovic.</p> \n<p>Karlovic is a remarkable athlete. The physical advantage of a lithe, taut frame that stands 6ft 11in when stationary and extends perhaps another couple of feet towards the clouds when animated, is also the very vehicle of his demise. While he can routinely belt a tennis ball across the net at up around 135mph – as he did here many times in adding 29 aces to the 136 he had accrued in the first week – his crane-like legs do not always serve him well on the turn.</p> \n<p>And, in fashioning an artful, occasionally magnificent exhibition of defensive tennis to win 7-6, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 and secure a place in the quarter-finals for the eighth year in a row, Murray turned the big man as if he were calling Dick Whittington’s cat. If winning grand slam titles was easy, Murray would be in the wrong job.</p> \n<p>Only Federer of this generation brings ease of execution to a sport riddled with difficulties for even the very best. So there was inevitability about a win that began in struggle, moved smoothly through dominance, back to anxiety and finished in tightly orchestrated drama. He had to resist four of those booming aces in the first 20 minutes and time and again was frustrated as Karlovic got out of trouble with his serve.</p> \n<p>But the 36-year-old Croatian, the oldest player left in the draw after three rounds, also showed several delightful bits of touch, none sweeter than a back-hand half-volley struck behind his spindly legs in the closing moments that delivered Murray one final sliver of angst.</p> \n<p>In the beginning it was all high-energy blasting. It is difficult to recall a rally that lasted longer than five shots in the first quarter of an hour.</p> \n<p>And the Croatian’s fifth ace, 134mph down the middle, banged the woman calling the lines on her head and set up his 40-love hold to level in the eighth game after half an hour.</p> \n<p>Subtlety arrived in the 12th game, when Murray twice lobbed his towering obstacle, then forced an error from him with a third effort, en route to a tie-break where the serve, surely, was favoured to prevail.</p> \n<p>It was the 563rd of Karlovic’s career, almost twice as many as Murray’s, and his 36th of the year (to Murray’s 15). This was Ivoland. But Murray forced an overcooked forehand to take the shootout.</p> \n<p>The second set was far more straightforward, Murray striking his fourth ace on his way to going 2-0 after an hour and a half.</p> \n<p>When they last met here, in the second round in 2012, Karlovic was positively red-lining with anger after being foot-faulted 11 times on his way to defeat.</p> \n<p>On Monday, it happened again – thankfully just once, and he aced to stay in touch in the third set. Maybe that was the spur he needed. By the end of the frame, he was on fire, and they went to a fourth.</p> \n<p>In the home stretch, which lasted 42 minutes, Karlovic still gave Murray occasional fits and it was not until near the end where the world No3 dipped further into his bag of class to make his obdurate opponent err for the 32nd and final time, hitting tired and long.</p> \n<p>“I came up with some good lobs, passing shots, able to use the angles a bit more, trying to keep him from coming to the net so much,” Murray said courtside.</p> \n<p>“Physically it is quite quick but mentally it is very tiring. It wasn’t going to be the best tennis, but I felt like I passed well. When he missed his first serve, I got the return on his second serve to his feet.</p> \n<p>Murray at least has what should be a less physically demanding assignment in the quarter-finals on Wednesday, against Vasek Pospisil, who has not taken a set off him in their three matches.</p> \n<p>The young Canadian earlier endured his third consecutive five-setter to beat Viktor Troicki 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 over two hours and 39 minutes on Court 12.</p> \n<p>Murray said: “Pospisil is a tough match. He had a very close match with James Ward, came back from two sets to love today. He might be a little tired but confident for coming back. He has a game that suits grass, likes to come to the net, big serve.”</p> \n<p>If the 25-year-old Pospisil is leg weary on Wednesday, he will have good reason. After beating Troicki, he returned to Court 12 to partner the American Jack Sock in a third-round doubles match against Murray’s brother, Jamie, and the Australian John Peers. They kept Pospisil out there for almost three and a half hours, winning 8-6 in the fifth set – that’s brotherly love for you.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436202405390/Andy-Murray-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray is in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon for the eighth year in a row after his defeat of Ivo Karlovic.

On a stage interrupted by a spectacular crash that could have been a lot worse, the Sky rider made his move on the vicious final kick up Mur de Huy but was passed by Joaquim Rodr&iacute;guez, Katusha’s Spanish climbing specialist, in an astonishing show of strength from both riders. Froome will begin Tuesday’s stage as maillot jaune, happy to have punched more time into his main rivals.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t wake up today thinking I was going to be in yellow,” he said. “That was a real surprise.

Most got it, but only up to a point: specifically the steep run-in to the finish at Liege that is Mur de Huy. Four didn’t even make it that far.</p> \n<p>The Mur is considerably less than two kilometres in length, but this Tour de France hat-tip to the Belgian Ardenne classic La Fleche Wallonne features a reasonably gentle climb under the <em>flamme rouge</em>, before veering heavenwards at a leg-sapping gradient of 19%. Also known as <em>Le Chemin des Chapelles</em>,<em>it</em> offers out-of-shape amateurs no fewer than seven different chapels in which to stop and light a candle in search of assistance for ascensions of the literal and metaphorical kind.</p> \n<p>After Saturday’s time trial and Sunday’s filthy weather, this was the first chance for roadside spectators to enjoy this Tour as it ought to be enjoyed: wine-fuelled al fresco dining, the gaiety of the publicity caravan soundtracked by overhead choppers and a couple of garish blurs as the riders in the early escape enjoyed their 15 minutes in the spotlight, followed by a peloton whirring along in largely leisurely but guarded pursuit.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457419717__\n</div> \n<p>Among the group: a visibly suffering Adam Hansen, the Australian Lotto-Soudal rider struggling on with a dislocated shoulder as he chases the completion of a record 12 consecutive Tours. Movistar and Astana towed them along, the teams of Sunday’s big losers Nairo Quintana and Vincenzo Nibali always mindful of the final climb and the fact that in this race every single second counts.</p> \n<p>The first real action occurred around the 50 kilometre to go mark, courtesy of a crash so violent the race director Christian Prudhomme felt compelled to controversially neutralise the race. With the peloton humming along several minutes after passing through the feed zone, FDJ’s William Bonnet clipped a wheel, went down and skidded along the asphalt, bringing down at least 20 other riders, among them the race leader Fabian Cancellara, who appeared to suffer a concussion. Clocked at 42km-per-hour, several of the fallen were catapulted towards the stout metal base of a roadside lamp-post but had a reasonably thick grass verge to lower the velocity with which they hit it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/06/tour-de-france-2015-day-three-live\">Tour de France: day three – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The race was eventually stopped so the lame and halt, many of whose kit was now in tatters, could have their cuts, bruises and sleep-depriving road-rash ministered to properly. It was a dangerous precedent to set so early in such a high level bike race, but organisers later justified it by citing a paucity of medical personnel to follow the peloton, because they were all busy tending riders at the scene of the crash.</p> \n<p>A by now ghastly looking Cancellara remounted his bike and prepared to carry on, while a conscious but horribly flayed Bonnet was found to have broken cervical vertebrae which will require surgery. Giant-Alpecin’s Tom Dumoulin and Orica-Greenedge’s Simon Gerrans were among the bigger names forced to abandon and at the 50km-to-go mark, the stage was given a new start.</p> \n<p>The stage once again underway, the riders of Astana and Tinko Saxoff attempted to escape only for the black-clad predators of Sky to zero in on them with Great White precision, allowing Monday’s stage winner Andr&eacute; Greipel to increase his grip on the green jersey by winning the intermediate sprint. He promptly relaxed, dropping back to a 70-strong group, including Cancellara, that would finish over 11 minutes behind the eventual winner.</p> \n<p>At the business end of the field the Etixx-Quick-Step rider Tony Martin led the main bunch uphill, before the riders of Saxo-Tinkoff hitched anyone who could keep up to their wagon. Sky’s Geraint Thomas soon took over, repeatedly looking over his shoulder to check on the whereabouts of Froome. He need not have worried; once inside the flamme rouge and with 500 metres to go, his leader hit the front and looked a good thing only to be passed for the win by Rodr&iacute;guez.</p> \n<p>Froome’s six-second time bonus will be no small consolation. He leads the race by one second from the luckless Martin, who missed out on his first day in yellow - again - because of bonus time won by others, while BMC’s Tejay van Garderen is back in third. Tomorrow they take to the cobbles, where more carnage is almost certain to ensue.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5fae417416285d7da3526fe8a0e86490d9663d9f/0_103_5184_3114/5184.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3114,"width":5184,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christophe Ena/AP","altText":"Scores of riders lie on the road after crashing during the third stage of the Tour de France cycling race over 159.5 kilometers (99.1 miles) with start in Antwerp and finish in Huy, Belgium, Monday, July 6, 2015.

success","trailText":"Fresh from winning the British Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton says he is excited about the next race on the Formula One calendar in Budapest","standFirst":"<span class=\"bullet\">•</span> World champion has won four times at the Hungaroring\n<br />\n<span class=\"bullet\">•</span> ‘It has been a great track for me, I’m excited,’ Hamilton says","byline":"Paul Weaver","body":"<p>The Hungaroring in Budapest, tight and twisty, bumpy and challenging, is not every Formula One driver’s cup of tea but when Lewis Hamilton travels there in a couple of weeks he will be in a serene state of mind.</p> \n<p>No driver has had more success there than Hamilton, whose four wins were in 2007, 2009, 2012 and 2013, when he won in a Mercedes for the first time. That was one of his most emphatic victories.</p> \n<p>Another win on 26 July would see him move from strength to stranglehold in this year’s championship after winning the British Grand Prix and extending his lead over his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to 17 points.</p> \n<p>“It has been a great track for me in my career, and I’m excited about that, and then we have the break,” Hamilton said. “I will be training like crazy over the break to make sure I am strong for the next part of the season. Generally in my career the second part of the season has been the stronger part for me.”</p> \n<p>It has not been lost on Hamilton that when he previously won at Silverstone, in 2008 and 2014, he went on to take the title.</p> \n<p>“That’s the plan,” he said. “That is what I am working towards. It is five out of nine now and I have had eight out of nine poles. I am told it’s been as strong a year performance-wise from me personally. Last year was exceptional for me and to think that I am doing it just as much as that but a little bit better this year, I didn’t think I could do that.</p> \n<p>“So I am overall really happy with that and now as I go to Hungary. I am happy, it has come together since last year but I am definitely enjoying it more now. I am enjoying life and racing more than ever.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton will go there given further confidence after his brilliant call to come in for fresh rubber on the 43rd lap at Silverstone just as rain and Rosberg closed in on him. He is an outstanding natural driver, but not necessarily renowned for the quality of his calls to the pitwall.</p> \n<p>“I never felt that was a strength of mine in Formula One, making those calls,” Hamilton added. ”Generally because the driver only has one view of everything and the guys outside have a better view, and so generally I would rely on the team. And definitely in the past there were times when they got it right and some times when they got it wrong.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton said the only other time he made a call at Silverstone was in 2008, and even though he was right he was overruled by his McLaren team. “That was the only other time I got the decision right apart from today. I don’t know how the future is going to go with that but I am glad I have ticked that one off.</p> \n<p>“I trust my judgment and I trust myself and all the decisions that I am making inside and outside of the racing world. There are opinions for and against those things but I am still driving the way I am driving, I am enjoying the racing and you can see it is all paying off.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton went to Silverstone knowing that Rosberg had won three of the previous four races, but he said: “The last race [in Austria] was the first time I felt he was particularly quick in the race.” Rosberg’s win in Monaco followed a mistake by the team on a weekend in which Hamilton had been totally dominant.</p> \n<p>The world champion added: “I knew how many people were going to be [at Silverstone], I knew the pressure, I’d been here before, I knew how important it was for me to really deliver.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436220980438/Lewis-Hamilton-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lewis Hamilton knocks back the bubbly after winning at Silverstone.
