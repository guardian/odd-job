As Chris Froome rode through the bend in his yellow jersey towards the little summit which marked the finish line there was no sign of the second man on the road, Nairo Quintana, nor even of one of the motorbikes which precede key riders close to the finish.</p> \n<p>It was as good an image as any of the devastating impression the Kenyan-born Briton made on the first mountain-top finish of this Tour but there was more. When Quintana did come into view, just about a minute after Froome had headed towards the finish line, the Colombian was accompanied by none other than Richie Porte, Froome’s team-mate at Team Sky, who left Quintana standing to take second place on the stage.</p> \n<p>The first mountain-top finish in any major stage race is always a key moment as the contenders discover precisely where they stand. The bluffing ended here with a brutal reckoning on a climb which is, in essence, the lengthy, steep drag up the north side of the Col du Somport, with early passages that looked as steep as the side of a house and a steadier drag into the finish.</p> \n<p>The 2014 winner, Vincenzo Nibali, will now struggle to finish on the podium having been dislodged a massive nine km from the finish and losing well over four minutes.</p> \n<p>“I am not even the little brother of last year’s Nibali,” said the Italian, who complained of being unable to breathe or follow his team-mates.</p> \n<p>Alberto Contador’s thoughts of a Tour-Giro double died here; he still has a chance of making the first three but is now more than four minutes back in the standings and sixth overall. “I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t turn my legs,” he said.</p> \n<p>Contador lies one place behind Geraint Thomas, which should worry him because, if the Welshman continues to climb with this brio, he will act as a perfect second foil for Froome, able to mark any threatening attacks.</p> \n<p>Froome was poised for attacks from Nibali, Contador and Quintana but they never came; instead came the news that Nibali and Contador had lost ground. That was the prompt for the hammer to go down; the final attack came while the gradient was still steep enough to make a difference, with enough level road to the finish for the time gaps to be stretched out painfully before he took what looked close to a carbon copy of his Bastille Day win on Mont Ventoux in 2013.</p> \n<p>Of Froome’s “Fab Four” fellows only Quintana came near to living up to his billing, surviving when Porte put in the initial surge just over seven km out to dispose of Contador and most of a select 11-rider group that had got through the toughest section of the climb alongside the yellow jersey. But a second searing attack, this time from Froome a kilometre later forced the Colombian to cede ground as the 2013 Tour winner sprinted to open the initial gap.</p> \n<p>Both Quintana and the “fifth Beatle”, Tejay van Garderen, opted for damage limitation and, while the American finished 2min 30sec back, his first-class opening week means he lies second overall but nigh on three minutes behind Froome, just ahead of the Colombian.</p> \n<p>There were surprises: Thomas was the first, the biggest was the 22-year-old Briton Adam Yates climbing seamlessly into seventh on the stage but another was the accident-prone Dutch climber Robert Gesink. His Lotto-Jumbo team have had a quiet season and he has not performed at this level – for a variety of reasons, some physical, some domestic – since finishing sixth in the 2012 Vuelta but he is now eighth overall.</p> \n<p>This was, as already mentioned, Bastille Day, when French spirits stir and their cyclists come under immense pressure to win the Tour stage on the day of La F&ecirc;te Nationale. They have been frustrated since David Moncouti&eacute; won in 2005 and the pattern continued as their brightest overall prospects, Romain Bardet, Thibaut Pinot and Jean-Christophe P&eacute;raud, slipped inexorably behind well before the final attacks began.</p> \n<p>The home nation retains Tony Gallopin in seventh overall while Warren Barguil crashed but fought through to lie ninth in the standings.</p> \n<p>But it is light years from the hopes that were raised when P&eacute;raud and Pinot finished on the podium last year.</p> \n<p>Underneath the mountain top where this finish is situated lies one of the world’s greatest cave systems, Le Gouffre de Saint Martin – the Gulf of Saint Martin – up to 2.1 km deep and covering 140 sq km. With characteristic understatement Froome said he would not like to be in his rivals’ shoes on Tuesday night; the best-laid plans of Quintana, Contador and Nibali might as well have been torn up and thrown down the vast cavern as the gulf between Sky and their adversaries was there for all to see, with two more days climbing through this mountain range to come.</p> \n<aside class=\"element

Peter Nevill will make his Test debut in place of Haddin, while Mitchell Marsh will step in for the veteran all-rounder Watson.</p> \n<p>With two of the old Australia heads removed from the line-up, Stokes said England would go into the match buoyed by the confidence gained by their assertive performance in Wales. “When Rooty caught the catch at the end it was like revenge,” the all-rounder said. “When they were eight wickets down I was thinking about how we felt when we were getting beat every game. To be on the verge of winning when they were eight wickets down and after what they did to us in Australia was pretty cool.</p> \n<p>“The whole day itself was amazing and the atmosphere was electric. It was similar to Lord’s here <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/25/england-new-zealand-first-test-match-report\" title=\"\">when we beat New Zealand</a>. It is always a special place to play cricket so, if we can walk away at the end of five days, or four days if we can, and we are 2-0 up, then we will be in a really good position to win the Ashes.”</p> \n<p>The 24-year-old Durham player expects the tourists to be more vocal and aggressive on the field at Lord’s, given the pressure they are now under. He said: “There wasn’t hardly as much said in Cardiff as there was in Australia. I’m not quite sure why. Maybe the match referee had a word with the two captains, I’m not sure. But I think it might be a bit different here,” said Stokes, who made 52 and 42 with the bat in Cardiff as England triumphed by 169 runs.</p> \n<p>“Australia are 1-0 down and they’ll want to get some revenge on us because we obviously beat them in four days, which was probably a shock to them. This game might be played in a different way but hopefully it won’t overstep the line.”</p> \n<p>Despite lacking the overt antagonism of the last Ashes tour in Australia Stokes dismissed as “silly” attempts by Nathan Lyon and David Warner to stop his habit of sweeping the wicket with his bat at the end of each over. “I just said: ‘You can stand there all day because I’m not moving until you move. If you want to get your captain’s over rate down, then so be it.’”</p> \n<p>Stokes, a key member of the side that minted a fresh attacking style for England during the visit of New Zealand, said they had been encouraged by the new head coach, Trevor Bayliss, to maintain the approach throughout the series.</p> \n<p>Speaking at an Investec event, Stokes said: “We’re not going to be able to play how we want to play 100% of the time. But if there comes a game when we don’t particularly play how we want to play, that doesn’t mean we’ll go back to square one and start just trying to survive.</p> \n<p>“When we were in our second innings at Cardiff, Trevor said it’s not about time, it’s about runs. So when your head coach is saying that it doesn’t matter how much time we bat, it’s all about runs and getting a big lead, then you go into the middle with a lot of confidence.”</p> \n<p>Stokes said he embraced the pressure that came with being compared to Andrew Flintoff or Ian Botham, insisting that it came with the territory.</p> \n<p>“Being an all-rounder you’re probably going to get compared to the Bothams and the Flintoffs, as I have done recently. I’m not looking to emulate them,” he said. “I’m Ben Stokes; I’m not Flintoff or Botham. I’m just going to go about my cricket in the way I want to do it.”</p> \n<p>England are expected to name an unchanged side after their victory in the first Test but Australia have been forced to make changes.</p> \n<p>Haddin, 37, was absent for most of Australia’s practice session at Lord’s, instead speaking to the head coach, Darren Lehmann, and the team psychologist, Michael Lloyd, on the pavilion balcony.</p> \n<p>His replacement, Nevill was, in contrast, put through his paces with the rest of the side. Cricket Australia confirmed the news on Tuesday evening. “I can confirm that Brad Haddin has withdrawn himself from the second Test at Lord’s for family reasons,” the team’s media manager, Kate Hutchison, announced. He looks likely to be joined on the sidelines by Watson, the 34-year-old having done himself no favours with two dismissals leg-before in the first Test, for 30 and 19.</p> \n<p>Haddin endured an indifferent performance in Cardiff, where he dropped Joe Root on nought in the first innings before England’s man of the match went on to score 134.</p> \n<p>The Australia bowler Peter Siddle backed Nevill, who topped the batting averages for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield this season with 76 from 14 innings, to perform well, despite the pressure of making his debut at Lord’s – a notoriously testing ground for wicketkeepers.</p> \n<p>Siddle said: “He has had a couple of great years in first-class cricket and, if it’s this Test or in future, then I’ve no doubt he will be ready to go.” Nevill is 29.</p> \n<p>The fast bowler Mitchell Starc, who took seven wickets in Cardiff, is expected to be fit to play despite problems with an ankle injury. Siddle was in line to replace him if he was not fit.</p> \n<p>“Starcy got through well today, bowled out in the middle off the long run, both ends, he’s feeling good,” said Siddle. “I guess it’s just a waiting game at the moment for myself. Everyone’s fit at the moment which is nice.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436894351473/England-Ben-Stokes-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ben Stokes, in action during a nets session at Lord's, says the head coach Trevor Bayliss tells his batsmen that 'it's not about time, it's about runs'.

He will enjoy more time with his long-time partner Rachael Cordingley (they will marry soon) and their children, Rocco and Natalia.</p> \n<p>But what Froch will miss, without doubt, is hitting people with ferocious intent. As his friend and trainer of 13 years, Rob McCracken, said of the world super-middleweight champion who confirmed on Tuesday <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/14/carl-froch-retires-from-boxing\">the retirement that had been coming for a while</a>, “Carl is a throwback.

It was calculated, delivered on his own terms and invested with the scary viciousness that lurks inside an otherwise quiet, even shy, man.</p> \n<p>He’d set it up like the businessman he is: feinting a left and persuading his young irritant to stick his own right glove close to his chin, now vulnerable to the freight train that drove painfully down the middle on to his slackened jaw. It left Groves with his feet tangled and his brain mangled, as he clambered to rise from the position of least dignity. He didn’t make it.</p> \n<p>They embraced, as fighters do. But they will never be friends. That is the other side of Froch. As polite and accommodating as he can be, he is a man of very definite opinions as one American boxing writer discovered.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/14/carl-froch-retires-from-boxing\">Carl Froch retires to bring curtain down on glittering boxing career</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In recent months Froch was considering a farewell fight against the awesome middleweight Gennady Golovkin – one weight division down from his own – but did not reckon it was worth the effort, a reasonable view but one which inspired Dan Rafael of ESPN to Tweet: “If <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carl_froch\">@Carl_Froch</a> thinks he’s too big and strong for @GGGBoxing wonderful. Then fight the guy and prove it. Simple as that. Otherwise, silence.”</p> \n<p>Froch seriously dislikes that sort of high-handed advice, especially from someone whose connection to his business is restricted to banging on a laptop. He replied: “@danrafaelespn You should know as much as anyone, boxing is never that simple So say something constructive. Otherwise, silence.” In the rough-and-tumble world of boxing, it was an everyday exchange. Froch has had plenty in his time. But it was not always so.</p> \n<p>It is 17 years since I first saw Froch fight, on a Saturday night in Barnsley against a tough soldier from Portsmouth, and neither of us imagined he would retire a multi-millionaire, a celebrated world champion and, ultimately, a man in a suit holding a microphone in front of a TV camera while his mobile phone buzzes with news of his latest business transaction.</p> \n<p>Indeed, when Sergeant Chris Bessey, the England amateur team captain, showed the flash, hands-down kid from Nottingham what the game was all about to win the ABA 71kg title in 1998, Froch dedicated himself to making the Great Britain squad for the Sydney Olympics two years later. He had no interest in boxing professionally.</p> \n<p>He seemed like a straight-up young amateur, fit, dedicated and determined, with good skill and power. Froch did not make the team but the lure of money, and all the problems it could bring, had still not gripped him so he kept his amateur vest until McCracken persuaded him to turn over in 2002 with his London associate, Mick Hennessy.</p> \n<p>On that Barnsley bill 17 years ago were two other boxers who, in different ways, would have an impact on the professional game: Jim Twite, a light-hitting amateur middleweight, went on to make a name for himself by <a href=\"http://\">knocking out the future world heavyweight champion David Haye</a> with a single punch at York Hall in Bethnal Green a year later; and the 91kg champion Audley Harrison, who would win gold at the Sydney Olympics but was destined to be knocked out by Haye <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2010/nov/18/carl-froch-coward-audley-harrison\">in three rounds of pure farce</a> in Manchester 10 years after that.</p> \n<p>What is significant about that circled coincidence is that Froch, just turned 38, has decided after 15 years as a pro that he has had enough.</p> \n<p>Haye, at 34 but inactive for nearly three years, promises on a monthly basis he is coming back while the 44-year-old Harrison also regularly teases boxing fans with the dubious prospect of a return.</p> \n<p>For all that Froch began as a reluctant professional he not only became a terrific one, but a smart one too. His goodbye words from the active side of his sport hit the mark as accurately as the night he knocked out George Groves: “I have nothing left to prove.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436896082157/Carl-Froch-George-Groves-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Carl Froch stands over George Groves after knocking him out in their IBF and WBA World Super Middleweight bout in May 2014.

That was accompanied by the removal from YouTube of a video marrying what purported to be Froome’s power-meter and pulse data with television footage from the 2013 Tour finish at Mont Ventoux.</p> \n<p>The following morning Brailsford said he would prefer to focus his attention on the day’s stage from Tarbes to the hill-top finish at Pierre Saint Martin but the genie was out of the bottle. Froome, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/14/chris-froome-tour-de-france-team-sky-cycling\" title=\"\">having won the 10th stage in convincing style</a>, was emphatic the video was a “sideshow” and that any suggestion it might imply he was using performance- enhancing methods or substances was “nuts, especially as the data in question is two years old”. It was even being reported that the 2013 champion was willing to undergo independent physiological testing and release the results to prove his innocence.</p> \n<p>“What haven’t I done? I’ve tried to be as much a spokesman as I can for clean cycling,” Froome said. “I’ve spoken to the CIRC (Cycling Independent Reform Condition), I’ve made suggestions to the governing body to implement things like night-time testing. I’ve pointed out when I’ve felt there hasn’t been enough testing, in places like Tenerife. What else is a clean rider supposed to do?”</p> \n<p>As Pau enigmas go, Hackgate was as nothing compared with the vexed question of how <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2010/sep/30/alberto-contador-positive-test\" title=\"\">a minute quantity of clenbuterol got into Alberto Contador’s urine sample</a> in 2010 – a contaminated food supplement, concluded the court of arbitration for sport - or <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2007/jul/26/cycling.tourdefrance\" title=\"\">just where Michael Rasmussen had been training</a> and where the Dane went after his midnight flit from the 2007 race.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/14/chris-froome-tour-de-france-team-sky-cycling\">Tour de France 2015: Chris Froome makes huge statement with stage win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The release and removal of the video did raise a spectre from the past, however, but of a different kind to those in the Contador and Rasmussen stories and further back Lance Armstrong’s infamous drug-denying press conferences in Pau in 1999 and 2001 during the Tour. The spectre was the 2013 race when Froome spent much of the final week protesting his probity. The media and fans were split between sceptics, believers and benefit-of-the-doubters. As he pointed out after the finish here, there is little more that he can do.</p> \n<p>The man behind the video was a blast from several cycling pasts as well, a genial Frenchman named Antoine Vayer, who tweets under the handle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/festinaboy\" title=\"\">@festinaboy</a>, an ironic reference to his period spent in the mid-1990s as a trainer at the notorious French squad who were thrown off the 1998 Tour amid one of the Tour’s most dramatic doping scandals.</p> \n<p>Vayer spent his time at the team trying to shield the handful of riders who wanted to race clean and later became a fervent campaigner against doping, in which capacity he produced a column at the Le Monde newspaper discussing his estimated power-output figures for the riders in the Tour. It is impossible to assess the accuracy of Vayer’s figures but his articles were taken seriously enough by Team Sky during the 2013 Tour for Brailsford to meet him in an attempt to convince him of Froome’s probity. The video was removed from YouTube but copies remained <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2xyt27_chris-froome-tour-de-france-2013-mont-ventoux-srm_sport\" title=\"\">available online</a> and Vayer remained defiant, stating on Twitter: “Soon a new video impossible to hack even by the best hacker lawyer.”</p> \n<p>The video did not offer any evidence of doping or superhuman performance, always assuming the figures are genuine, which is of course impossible to say. To muddy the waters further, the bulk of the footage at the key moments does not actually show Froome but other riders. The spectacular manner in which Froome turned his legs on the Ventoux in 2013 raised questions at the time but it corresponded to the way in which the team trained, the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/15/team-sky-chris-froome-tour-de-france\" title=\"\">Sky trainer Tim Kerrison told the Guardian</a>.</p> \n<p>Whether the figures are genuine or not, what is on show does not look suspicious. The power figures constantly oscillate but that is familiar to anyone who has used a power meter. There is a visible increase in pulse rate when Froome makes the key effort to drop Alberto Contador - as would be expected - but critically, that increase comes with a distinct time lag, which is normal. The human body is not a car where the rev counter responds instantly.</p> \n<p>The mystery is why Sky should feel it necessary to make it public that they feared Froome’s data had been hacked, and their lawyers were on the case. The answer probably lies in the memories of 2012 and 2013, when Bradley Wiggins’ and Froome’s Tours were both infected by innuendo: strike first, in the hope that the mutterings on Twitter can be nipped in the bud. It is a blunt instrument and it remains to be seen whether it works.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436890748978/4fcb1d42-8a53-4628-82e5-051f5c85af7a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Eric Gaillard/Reuters","altText":"Chris Froome rides clear of the field to win stage 10 of the 2015 Tour de France.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Eric Gaillard/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-14T16:12:26Z","lastModified":"2015-07-14T23:40:07Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":75,"contributors":[{"name":"William Fotheringham","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/williamfotheringham"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Tour de France 2015","Chris Froome","Cycling","Drugs in sport","Sport","Tour de France"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/tour-de-france-2015","webTitle":"Tour de France 2015"},{"id":"sport/chris-froome","webTitle":"Chris Froome"},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling"},{"id":"sport/drugs-in-sport","webTitle":"Drugs in sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"William Fotheringham","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/williamfotheringham"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","navigationButtonColour":"#ffffff","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","quoteColour":"#fdadba","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/14/chris-froome-team-sky-hacking-tour-de-france","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ak5p","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jul/14/chris-froome-team-sky-hacking-tour-de-france","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/14/chris-froome-team-sky-hacking-tour-de-france"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436890748978/4fcb1d42-8a53-4628-82e5-051f5c85af7a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chris Froome rides clear of the field to win stage 10 of the 2015 Tour de France.

But he was the scourge of England in their 2013-14 Ashes whitewash defeat, topping Australia’s batting averages with five half-centuries, including a top score of 118.</p> \n<p>Haddin could make only 29 runs across the two innings in Cardiff and it may be that Nevill has been brought in for his batting as much as his wicketkeeping, having averaged 76 in the recent Sheffield Shield season.</p> \n<p>There was better news for Australia in that their paceman Mitchell Starc, who has been suffering from an ankle injury, looks like being fit for Lord’s, according to his potential replacement Peter Siddle.</p> \n<p>“Starcy got through well today, bowled out in the middle off the long run, both ends; he’s feeling good,” Siddle said. “I guess it’s just a waiting game at the moment for myself. Everyone’s fit which is nice.”</p> \n<p>There were problems, meanwhile, before the pending one-day series which follows the Tests when Australia announced that James Faulkner would not be considered for selection after being charged with drink-driving.</p> \n<p>The 25-year-old World Cup-winning all-rounder was charged this month, during a stint with Lancashire, and <a href=\"http://www.cricket.com.au/news/james-faulkner-suspended-by-cricket-australia-after-drink-driving-offence-in-the-uk/2015-07-14\" title=\"\">Australia put out a statement</a> on Tuesday which read: “Cricket Australia has charged all-rounder James Faulkner with a level-three offence under its code of behaviour, after he was found to have been drink-driving in the United Kingdom.</p> \n<p>“Faulkner has been charged under the code for conduct that is unbecoming of a representative and that is or could be harmful to the interests of cricket.”</p> \n<p>Faulkner has received four suspension points, which will effectively rule him out of a one-day international against Ireland at the end of next month and then the first three of five against England.</p> \n<p>The statement added: “Given he will be unavailable for a significant component of that series, Faulkner will not be considered for the Australian T20 or ODI squad when it is announced in mid-August. He may be considered as a replacement for an injured player following his suspension if required.</p> \n<p>“Faulkner will also have to undergo an alcohol management counselling programme, as determined by the Cricket Australia chief medical officer, and pay for any damage to property caused by his actions while driving.</p> \n<p>“He has also been formally reprimanded by Cricket Australia for his behaviour.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/53b46607b1064f31f539c6f52997df414e123052/0_161_2287_1372/2287.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1372,"width":2287,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ryan Pierse/Getty Images","altText":"Brad Haddin, right, is closeted with the Australian coach Darren Lehmann during their nets session at Lord’s","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-14T18:15:00Z","lastModified":"2015-07-14T20:43:13Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Guardian sport","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/guardian-sport"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Brad Haddin","Australia cricket team","England cricket team","Ashes 2015","The Ashes","Cricket","Sport","Australia sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/brad-haddin","webTitle":"Brad Haddin"},{"id":"sport/australia-cricket-team","webTitle":"Australia cricket team"},{"id":"sport/england-cricket-team","webTitle":"England cricket team"},{"id":"sport/ashes-2015","webTitle":"Ashes 2015"},{"id":"sport/ashes","webTitle":"The Ashes"},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Guardian sport","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/guardian-sport"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/14/brad-haddin-left-out-australia-second-test-lords","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ajpk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/14/brad-haddin-left-out-australia-second-test-lords","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/14/brad-haddin-left-out-australia-second-test-lords"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/53b46607b1064f31f539c6f52997df414e123052/0_0_2287_1535/2287.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1535,"width":2287,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Brad Haddin, right, is closeted with the Australian coach, Darren Lehmann, in the pavilion during the side’s nets session at Lord’s.

Over here, it’s just hard wind and sideways rain sometimes.</p> \n<p>“I think the biggest thing for me was going out and trying to make it as fun as possible and kind of embracing the challenge. Looking back to St George’s [at the 2011 Open], the Saturday we had there, it was nasty. That was probably one of the best rounds I’ve played.</p> \n<p>“The thing that helped me a little bit was Joe, my caddie, saw Tom Watson go out and it looked like he was out there having fun and kind of soaking it in and trying to make the best of it, because there’s probably some guys in the field that may look down on it and may think it’s going to be harder than it should be.</p> \n<p>“I try to just go out and have fun with it. It may not be the warmest weather, the driest weather, but you’ve got a tee-time, go tee it up and make the best of it.”</p> \n<p>The 2010 Open, also played on the Old Course, was suspended on day two because of wind issues. At that point, balls were moving upon address by players on greens, particularly the exposed 11th.</p> \n<p>Speaking at the weekend, the R&amp;A’s chief executive Peter Dawson admitted the recent levelling of the putting surface on the 11th, which has allowed more pin positions, was made with that issue in mind.</p> \n<p>“What we have now is a green that will still be puttable in a high wind, which it wasn’t before,” Dawson said. “It was this green that caused the suspension of play back in 2010.</p> \n<p>“We also have a lot more pin positions. Before we had to stick the pin behind the Strath Bunker. Now we can have it back-left, near the Hill Bunker, one that no one went in at the last Open.</p> \n<p>“A back-right pin position is also available, so the hole has a lot more variety to it.”</p> \n<p>In 2013, the Women’s British Open at St Andrews was suspended because of 40mph gusts.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/14/1436887815875/Jordan-Spieth-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jordan Spieth is due out on Friday afternoon when the weather is likely to be at its worst.
