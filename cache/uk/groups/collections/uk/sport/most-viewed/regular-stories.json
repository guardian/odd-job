He said the money would be used to help him continue his quest to climb the rankings and would enable him to do so in greater comfort.</p> \n<p>“That money will go away down a hole somewhere. I’ll keep that one safe. It will just be there, when I need it for the tournaments and for the travel; I know that I’ve got that security, so it’s great. I’ve got some fantastic friends and they’ve been patient with me over the last couple years, sharing beds and stuff. I get my own bed every now and then. But, to be honest, I travel more than anything. That’s what the money’s good for, because I probably spend 35 to 40 weeks on the road. And even then I’m back in Nottingham or at the National Centre [in Roehampton] training, so I spend very little time back at home.”</p> \n<p>Broady hit back superbly to level the match against Matosevic, the world No138 who has been as high as 39, but he looked to be in trouble when he dropped his serve for 0-2 in the fifth. He rallied superbly, though, to win six of the next seven games for the biggest victory of his career. It was the first five-set match played by Broady, a finalist in the boys’ singles here in 2011.</p> \n<p>“It means everything, to be honest,” he said. “To the guys that have supported me up until now, my trainer Ric [Moylan], my coach Mark [Hilton] and my mentor Adrian [Tannock]. I do it as much for myself as I do for those guys. I know how much time they put into it. But personally, it’s my home tournament. I’ve had good success here before. It’s been a long road to finding myself in the main draw of a slam. Couldn’t be happier.</p> \n<p>“I’m not sure how much I believed I could win a round of Wimbledon before today, even going into the match. But I knew that belief didn’t really matter as long as I focused on point by point. I’m hoping that it will sort of push me on and give me a bit more fire to want to get back here.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/andy-murray-mikhail-kukushkin-wimbledon-2015\">Andy Murray faces Mr and Mrs K’s plan A – ‘do something good’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Andy Murray immediately tweeted his support for Broady and the left-hander said the world No3 had been a huge inspiration, helping him believe in his ability and work ethic, even when things got tough. “It’s just good to be around Andy,” he said. “He wants the British players to do well. He really puts his time back into the game, back into the British players. I think to have someone like that is invaluable for British tennis. It’s just fantastic. He doesn’t have to do it but he does it anyway.”</p> \n<p>Broady is estranged from his father, Simon, who disapproved of his son’s return to the Lawn Tennis Association fold a few years ago, but his sister Naomi, who later lost her own first-round match, was in the stands to watch, along with most of the family, and their support, he said, had been imperative in his success. “To be honest, my dad’s not even popped into my head with the result,” Broady admitted. “But it was fantastic to have my sister there and the rest of my family watching. That’s what makes it more special, is being able to share such a moment with so many people I love.”</p> \n<p>His reward will now be a match with David Goffin, the No16 seed from Belgium, a match he cannot wait to play. “Today was massive for me. To have my first ever first-round men’s win at Wimbledon. I feel good about my game now.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435605529786/Liam-Broady-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Liam Broady shows he can control with his feet as well as his racquet against Marinko Matosevic at Wimbledon.

I think he must relax and try to do something good.”</p> \n<p>Indeed he must, probably over five sets, and their respective and mutual histories do not suggest that is likely. They are worlds apart in achievement, money and prospects, with Murray, the world No3, many people’s favourite to win his second Wimbledon title, and Kukushkin, ranked at 59, probably grateful to be picking up &pound;29,000 as his first-round cheque.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/liam-broad-wimbledon-first-round-win-friends-floors\">Liam Broady hopes Wimbledon win will get him off friends’ floors</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Murray has won their only two encounters fairly easily. However, where Kukushkin and Murray have common ground is more obvious: both are coached by women, as is Denis Istomin (uniquely tutored by his mother, Klaudiya), who is on their side of the draw. It is a trio unique in the ATP top 100, rarely in the whole of the game.</p> \n<p>Anastasia played until she was 16 and was a coach at the famous Moscow club, Spartak. “She was working there for a couple of years,” Kukushkin says. “When we met and she started to help me, then she start to go full-time with me. She had to quit [the club] because there was not time enough for that.”</p> \n<p>While Murray has been hailed as a pioneer for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/28/amelie-mauresmo-coach-who-made-andy-murray-mint-again\">hiring Am&eacute;lie Mauresmo</a> a year ago to succeed Ivan Lendl and lauded as a feminist for his stalwart defence of her, as well as the protective sentiments he has expressed as she approaches the delivery of her first child in August, the Kazakh of Russian origin has been allowed to tour with his wife without much fuss.</p> \n<p>His ranking probably explains why – although he is a clever player with a fine tennis brain. And he does not lack for ambition.</p> \n<p>“To get a draw with Andy Murray at his home, one of his favourite tournaments, it’s tough for sure,” he says. “But it’s one of the challenges that I met a lot in my career. I played twice here in the Centre Court against Roger [Federer] and Rafa [Nadal]. I won one set last year against Rafa – I play good in the first set and after that … not really.”</p> \n<p>Murray beat him in Brisbane then Melbourne two years ago but Kukushkin says: “It is different to the Australian Open. It was fourth round, I played already a couple of matches before so it felt inside the tournament. Now it’s the first round, just preparing, waiting for your match. It’s a bit different but I’m not that nervous.”</p> \n<p>For Anastasia, it has not always been an anxiety-free experience, watching her husband play, week in week out, often on outside courts away from the glamour and noise of the Tour.</p> \n<p>“But I’m not so nervous, like three or four years ago,” she says. “Now I’m just relaxing and try to give him some more …power?” She laughs again.</p> \n<p>“Confidence,” he smiles.</p> \n<p>Kukushkin is not surprised there are few women coaching men on the Tour. “All of us [Murray, Istomin and himself], we are happy with it but I believe most other tennis players, they don’t support it. A lot of people around tennis, they think that it’s not good.”</p> \n<p>“Not professional,” offers Anastasia. They have what she calls, “sceptic vision”. She adds: “In my opinion it doesn’t matter with whom you are coaching. If you have a result, it doesn’t matter if it is a female or a male.”</p> \n<p>There is a level of irritation emerging, although Mr and Mrs K are impeccably polite. Still, Anastasia does not like the fact she is not allowed near the locker room – as well as other manifestations of exclusion. “I don’t have access,” she says. “Maybe I can go in but not everywhere.”</p> \n<p>Kukushkin reveals his wife has even had trouble getting accreditation as a coach, as tournament organisers regard her as just his girlfriend. “There are always problems.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/lleyton-hewitt-bids-farewell-to-wimbledon-after-nieminen-loss\">Lleyton Hewitt bids farewell to Wimbledon after Nieminen loss</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He explains also why he switched his allegiance from Russia to Kazakhstan in 2008. “As I remember, I was about 150 in the rankings and everyone, all the coaches, thought I could be a top-100 player but there were a lot of good Russian players [ahead of him] back then.</p> \n<p>“I knew I had to do something to break through. The Kazakhstan federation came to me with good support, the kind of support which I believe is important to every player. I think it was a good decision to move to Kazakhstan and I have lived there seven years. I have had good results in the Davis Cup as well as my own good results on the tour. I believe it has helped me a lot – to become a better player.”</p> \n<p>Kukushkin regards himself – as do many players – as an “internationalist”. “I feel more international,” he says, “because for 51 out of the 52 weeks of the year I travel and stay in hotels. When I have a week out of a tournament [when losing early], now I just go to practise somewhere. If I have time during the off season, I go on holiday, so I am never at home.

The BBC will have the chance to sub-licence some of the rights. We’ll open up those discussions in every market,” he said.</p> \n<p>“We want to give them the opportunity to sub-licence. In some markets we will run free to air, pay TV and all devices and in others we’ll partner with others.”</p> \n<p>But even if the BBC is ultimately able to sub-licence some of the rights, it will no longer be able to market itself as the home of the Olympics across all platforms.</p> \n<p>The BBC’s sports portfolio has come under unprecedented pressure in recent years as pay TV broadcasters have tussled over rights. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/feb/03/sky-sports-buys-open-championship-golf-bbc\">The Open golf was the latest event to move to Sky</a> and it is also expected to face a fight to hang on to the rights to rugby’s Six Nations.</p> \n<p>Under the complex deal Discovery, which owns Eurosport, has dramatically seized the rights to both the summer and winter Olympics across Europe, excluding Russia, from 2018 onwards.</p> \n<p>But in the UK and France deals had already been signed for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and the 2020 summer Games in Tokyo, with the BBC retaining the rights to those two Games following its triumphant coverage of London 2012.</p> \n<p>Unless existing legislation changes, Discovery will still have to broadcast the entire winter and summer Games free to air. Zaslav said it would come to different arrangements in different markets across the European territories covered by the deal.</p> \n<p>“We understand the great legacy of Olympic programming across Europe and we have great respect for the quality of content produced by the BBC, by French TV and German TV,” he said. “Now we have the exclusive rights to the Olympics on every platform, we’ll begin discussions with all the different players in every market.”</p> \n<p>For many years, the IOC has signed deals with a consortium of public broadcasters throughout Europe but more recently has started to examine the possibility of working with pay TV groups, as long as they guaranteed to show at least 200 hours of the summer Olympics and 100 hours of the winter Games free to air.</p> \n<p>In 2012, the Guardian revealed that the then IOC president Jacques Rogge was considering just such a deal in the UK but the BBC managed to retain the rights to the 2018 and 2020 Games.</p> \n<p>Last year, the IOC signed a $7.5bn broadcasting deal in the US with NBC that runs until 2032. The deal, signed by the IOC president, Thomas Bach, without a bidding process, will help underwrite his ambitious plans for an IOC television channel between Games.</p> \n<p>“This agreement ensures comprehensive coverage of the Olympic Games across Europe, including the guarantee to provide extensive free-to-air television coverage in all territories,” said Bach, who took over from Rogge in 2013.</p> \n<p>“Discovery and Eurosport have demonstrated a major commitment to the Olympic Games, to Olympic sports and to the future of the Olympic Movement.”</p> \n<p>As part of the deal, Discovery will help develop the new Olympic channel. Zaslav said it was a “historic day”.</p> \n<p>“With Eurosport’s proud and long-standing tradition of broadcasting many winter and summer sports showcased during the Olympics, adding the Olympic Games, the greatest live event in the world, is a perfect editorial and strategic fit,” he said.</p> \n<p>“But most of all, this new partnership is an exciting win for European sports fans as we will deliver record amounts of content across platforms to ensure the Olympic flame burns bright all year long.”</p> \n<p>The Olympics currently remains on the government’s list of events protected for free-to-air television. The list was last officially reviewed in 2009 but no changes were eventually made after the coalition government came to power in 2010.</p> \n<p>The then sports minister Hugh Robertson said the list would be reviewed again when the digital switchover was complete but there is little mood at present to revisit the issue.</p> \n<p>Discovery bought Eurosport last year and has ambitious plans for the pan-European broadcaster. It seriously considered bidding for the live UK Premier League rights that ended up costing Sky and BT Sport &pound;5.1bn between them and has been linked with several other major sports rights.</p> \n<p>Zaslav said it would work with the IOC to promote Olympic sports between Games, both on Eurosport and the mooted new Olympic television channel.</p> \n<p>“There is no more unique property anywhere on the globe. It’s live, it’s must have, it has universal appeal from male to female,” said Zaslav.</p> \n<p>“With the change with the way content is being consumed, live programming where people can come together and watch – this is a two-and-a-half week Superbowl across Europe. It’s very unique and a great opportunity to get the most compelling programming to our viewers.”</p> \n<p>Timo Lumme, the managing director of the IOC’s television and marketing services, said the deal with Discovery gave it a “partnership made in heaven” as it developed plans for a new channel that would promote Olympic sport between Games. “We would hope the outcome will be some sort of Olympic channel contract where people can connect 365 days a year, 24 hours a day,” he said.</p> \n<p>The BBC’s director of sport, Barbara Slater, recently warned that cutting the licence fee could lead to the BBC no longer being able to compete for major sporting events.</p> \n<p>“Having had for a number of years now [the same] flat licence fee, which has resulted in smaller budget for individual divisions such as sport, there is going to come a tipping point at which the BBC does need investment if it is going to continue to compete for, I think, events that people really treasure on the BBC, like the Olympics and some of the major championships,” she said.</p> \n<p>“And, of course, we’re exploring a multitude of different solutions to that, including sharing with other broadcasters etc. And there is still a very, very significant investment that we’re currently making.</p> \n<p>“But to see that on a significantly downward trajectory, I think, would be enormously damaging to the ecology of sports broadcasting.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e5ea82728bf77d970ec0d1899698be45a4e39a90/585_102_3579_2148/3579.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2148,"width":3579,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Todd Antony/BBC","altText":"Clare Balding was a popular host of the BBC’s swimming coverage at the London 2012 Olympics but the broadcaster has now lost control of the rights form 2022 onwards.

Tens of thousands of tennis fans fortunate enough to have tickets made their traditional dash to the best spots on Murray Mound, or ambled contentedly to their seats above the perfectly striped suede courts, pausing here and there for a glass of something chilled in the sunshine.</p> \n<p>“It’s just bliss today, isn’t it?” said Championships regular Jane Smith, who had found a seat under a rose-trailed pagoda to sip Pimm’s from a can with her husband Peter. <br /></p> \n<p>“Hazy sunshine, not too hot, nice breeze ...” The couple from West Sussex bid for tickets through the public ballot every year without fail: a summer without Wimbledon, she explained, was “just not summer at all”.</p> \n<p>On court, too, the tournament was delivering a faultless opening for British tennis, in the form of 21-year-old Liam Broady, on his Grand Slam singles debut, who made the most of his wildcard place to dispatch Marinko Matosevic in a thrilling contest in which he came back from two sets to love to squeeze out the former world No 39. </p> \n<p>The victory over the Australian, ranked 43 places above him (Broady is currently No 181 in the world), “means everything”, he said after the match. “It’s my home tournament, I’ve had good success here, and it’s been a long road to finding myself in the main draw of a slam, and I couldn’t be happier.”</p> \n<p>(Well might he be delighted: the &pound;47,000 he will pocket even if he loses his next match is not far short of his entire career earnings to date of &pound;62,795.)</p> \n<p>Broady, the runner-up in 2011 in the boys’ singles at Wimbledon, and the current British No 6, has never before played in the main singles draw; the participation in this year’s tournament of his older sister Naomi, also thanks to a wildcard entry, makes them the first British siblings to compete in the men’s and women’s draw since Buster and Linda Mottram in 1978. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/liam-broad-wimbledon-first-round-win-friends-floors\">Liam Broady hopes Wimbledon first round win will get him off friends’ floors</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“What an amazing Grand Slam debut for him,” said his 25-year-old sister. “This will mean a huge amount for Liam. Just competing like he did in the first two sets, never mind coming back and going on to win. It’s amazing.”</p> \n<p>But even for the delighted Broady junior, the perfect day wasn’t quite all it appeared. He has been estranged from his father Simon for three years, since the player opted to join the LTA’s coaching programme and accept its financial support. <br /></p> \n<p>Simon Broady vowed to have nothing to do with the governing body of British tennis after his daughter, then 18, was stripped of her LTA funding in 2007 after posting several indiscreet photographs on the social network Bebo. </p> \n<p>While his son was on court, Simon Broady was at the Aorangi practice courts elsewhere in the grounds with Naomi, whom he coaches. She dashed over to court 18 to catch her brother as he left the court; her father stayed put.</p> \n<p>His father, Liam Broady said pointedly in his post-match press conference, had “not even popped into [his] head” since his victory, “but it was fantastic to have my sister there and the rest of my family watching. What makes it more special is being able to share such a moment that I’ll remember for the rest of my life with so many people that I love.” <br /></p> \n<p>Was there any chance the result could lead to a reconciliation? “I doubt it.”</p> \n<p>Asked if the win had vindicated his decision to take the LTA funding, he said: “It was always the right decision for me whether I got the results or not.” (“Broadys,” he has noted previously, “can be pretty stubborn.”)</p> \n<p>Other complications, too, intruded on the idyllic scene inside the gates of the All England Club, most notably the heightened security threat in the wake of the Tunisian shootings. </p> \n<p>Security arrangements at the club, always very thorough, have been tightened further, with extra uniformed and plainclothes officers deployed around the grounds, and some additional road closures in place, according to the Metropolitan police. <br /></p> \n<p>While the police and security presence was undoubtedly visible, it was discreet, with most tournament regulars saying they had noticed little change on previous years. </p> \n<p>One innovation for 2015, however, is an explicit instruction to the 840 private security staff deployed each day to stop anyone entering in possession of either a drone or a selfie stick, the extendable devices used to hold cameraphones to take self-portraits.</p> \n<p>The ban on flying cameras, often used for surveillance, follows an incident on Saturday when police seized a drone that was being flown close to the grounds. <br /></p> \n<p>Less explicit is the reason why selfie sticks have been outlawed and consigned to the list of proscribed objects that includes knives, oversized flags, vacuum flasks and vuvuzelas. </p> \n<p>Perhaps there was a fear that the gadgets might generally lower the tone.

Instantly he recognises the drawl of his former team-mate Darren Lehmann, head coach of Australia and larrikin in excelsis. “I’ve got some pretty grumpy players here after what you said about them … ”</p> \n<p>The faux tension lasts for a split second before the chuckling begins. Lehmann has known Gillespie ever since he walked into the South Australia dressing room 22 years ago and is fully aware that the former fast bowler’s recent <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/21/micahel-clarke-australia-old-england-ashes-jason-gillespie\" title=\"\">headline-grabbing comments</a> about his touring geriacticos have been spun like a Shane Warne ripper out of the footmarks. For Gillespie, the current head coach of Yorkshire who has enjoyed his fair share of column inches already this summer after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/22/jason-gillespie-ecb-england-dream-coach\" title=\"\">being interviewed for the England job</a>, the explanation is pretty simple.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/darren-lehmann-stuart-broad-steve-smith-australia-england-ashes-cricket\">Australia’s Darren Lehmann brushes off Stuart Broad’s Steve Smith comments</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“It certainly caused a stir, didn’t it? But it was very simple, I was asked the question as to how, if I was in the England camp, would I try to beat Australia,” he says during our time together at Headingley. “Now I saw no glaring weaknesses in the Australian team. Their batting is sound, the seam bowling is quality, the spin is very good but the opposition still need to find a way in. So I looked at the ages and thought England could target that. They have 10 players over 30 years of age, how can England use that to their advantage?</p> \n<p>“So if I was England coach, I’d keep those guys out there for a long time. If Chris Rogers is out there for two days then has 10 minutes to strap on his pads and get his feet moving, could that work to England’s advantage? Brad Haddin is 38 this year, so test his fitness. The same with Michael Clarke, he’s had back problems; test him out and keep him in the field. Ryan Harris, it’s well documented he has a dodgy knee, so why wouldn’t you try to keep that guy on the ground bowling lots of spells? It’s just common sense. So I was asked a question and I’m not the sort of person who dodges them. I didn’t say anything that isn’t true.”</p> \n<p>For all the angry Australians on social media asking him to hand back his passport – one can only presume they remained silent and cross-armed after all 402 of his international wickets as part of <em>that</em> great side – Gillespie is not rowing back on this analysis. It is the same plain speaking that led to the 40-year-old guiding Yorkshire to their <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/sep/12/yorkshire-win-county-championship-nottinghamshire\" title=\"\">first County Championship title in 13 years</a> in 2014 and earned him a shot at the England job in May, before <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/25/trevor-bayliss-england-cricket-head-coach\" title=\"\">eventually missing out</a> to his lesser-known, but more decorated, compatriot Trevor Bayliss. There is no bitterness about the rejection.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The Australian bowlers versus Alastair Cook will be fascinating and could well shape the series</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“It was so humbling to be invited to interview. The England job is one of the biggest in world cricket, so to be spoken about in those circles was something I’ll remember for ever,” he says. “I walked out of our conversations just thinking that, regardless of what happens, England will be in a pretty good place going forward. They have the right people in charge – I spoke to [Andrew] Strauss and the chief executive, Tom Harrison, and both were very impressive. They have a vision and a drive to make it work. I didn’t get the job, ultimately, but I can stick it on my r&eacute;sum&eacute; and the experience stays with me.”</p> \n<p>It leaves Gillespie happily continuing his job at Headingley, which he will combine with a role at Adelaide Strikers in the winter, and with something of a foot in both camps before this summer’s Ashes series, one which he hopes will result in England continuing to ride the wave of positivity witnessed already this summer in one-day cricket. “It was crying out for someone to break the shackles,” he replies when asked for his take on the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/england-new-zealand-fifth-odi-cricket\" title=\"\">recent series win over New Zealand</a>. “It makes you wonder what prevented them from doing that before. You can mull it over but the reality now is there is an air of freedom with how they are playing and, as a cricket fan, I want to see that. And, of course, I expect Australia to match that and we get a great series.”</p> \n<p>Having been taken to the hearts of cricket supporters in Yorkshire – both during his two seasons as overseas professional until 2007 and his three and a half as coach – Gillespie takes enormous pride at seeing his players represent England. Mention Joe Root, Gary Ballance, Adam Lyth, Liam Plunkett or Adil Rashid and his face lights up instantly. Equally, however, those 10 years wearing the Baggy Green for Australia mean he is not the naturalised pom some are calling him back home; inquire as to how Australia can win their first Ashes series on English soil in 14 years and you get similarly forthright replies.</p> \n<p>“The Australian bowlers versus Alastair Cook will be fascinating and could well shape the series,” he says. “They have implemented a gameplan to him in the past and I don’t see that changing. You will hardly see him play a cut or pull, or nudge one away off his hips, because Australia will be ruthless in their line to him – just on off-stump or outside. They know that if they get something off the pitch or through the air they will ask questions of his technique and if he’s not spot-on with movements he will be found out. Cook should go into the series with a positive outlook as he’s scored Ashes runs in the past but Australia will believe they have the wood over him.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5047893c78d444aba1203d795bcc764c9fffd5d\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c5047893c78d444aba1203d795bcc764c9fffd5d/0_0_2359_3000/786.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Gillespie, left, has known the Australia coach, Darren Lehmann, since their South Australia days\" width=\"786\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Gillespie, left, has known the Australia coach, Darren Lehmann, since their South Australia days.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Lewis/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While a former fast bowler himself – he grins when proclaiming Mitchell Johnson “has a mental edge” over the home side following his 37-wicket Ashes series in 2013-14 – it is the subject of England and spin bowling that gets Gillespie really fired up. Cook’s side remain, in his opinion, too timid in how they play the turning ball and their own selection in that department. For the first time since Warne retired in 2007, Australia have the edge, with Nathan Lyon 30 matches deeper into his Test career.</p> \n<p>“Lyon will play a big role for Australia and that is somewhere where England simply have to be proactive – they cannot let him settle,” he says. “That’s where England missed a massive trick in the Test series against New Zealand; they let Mark Craig bowl and go at 1.8 runs an over in the first innings at Headingley and it played a big part in why they lost. That’s just unacceptable batting. There is not an off-spinner in world cricket who should go at under two runs an over, so they cannot let Lyon settle into a groove. They need to put pressure back on him. You can be sure as hell that Australia will do that to Moeen Ali. They will go hard and make Cook go back to Jimmy Anderson, Stuart Broad, Mark Wood, Ben Stokes and get them bowling lots of spells.”</p> \n<p>Should the leg-spinner Rashid, who took 46 wickets in Yorkshire’s title win last summer, therefore get the nod instead? “Yes. And the reason I would look to push for Rashid – and forget the county allegiance – is that you have Root and Lyth who can bowl off-spin. Why wouldn’t you have a spinner who turns it both ways? Is that harsh on Moeen Ali? It probably is and if he was top six you could look at it differently but the fact is he’s at No8, and what is best for the side would be to have a leg-spinner to complement the four quicks and the two lads who can bowl decent off-breaks. But I just can’t see England going down that path.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Jimmy Anderson is a person who winds Australia up like no one else I have seen in cricket</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite></cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Gillespie, of course, played with Warne, the greatest leg-spinner to draw breath as part of that fabled attack in which the now Yorkshire coach shared the new ball with Glenn McGrath for 58 of his 71 Tests – with support from one of Brett Lee, Andy Bichel, Damien Fleming or Michael Kasprowicz – and was part of three Ashes-winning teams, starting in England in 1997.</p> \n<p>“When you have those sorts of bowlers at the other end you know you are part of something special,” he says when recalling the glory years. “Warnie and Glenn both attacked and defended at the same time, so I think opposition saw me as an opportunity to score runs and be a little bit looser against me. I always liked that because it was an opportunity to take wickets. There was no doubt bowling at the opposite end to those guys allowed me to do my thing.”</p> \n<p>Were the team that won a record 16 consecutive Test matches under Steve Waugh the greatest of all time? “It’s hard to compare eras, it opens a can of worms. But we would have been highly competitive in any era – and I’ll leave it at that‚” he replies diplomatically, before adding with a glint in the eye. “You can’t compare us to the great Yorkshire side of the 1960s, of course.”</p> \n<p>Gillespie became the first Australian Test cricketer of indigenous heritage when he made his debut against West Indies in Sydney in 1996 aged 21 – a fact that did not garner public attention until four years later – and believed he was always destined to wear the Baggy Green cap, having been given his first cricket bat aged six by his late father, Neil, himself a prominent activist for aboriginal legal rights.</p> \n<p>“My dad was a wonderful man. His nickname was ‘Have a chat’. He was so talkative he could probably talk underwater with a mouthful of marbles. He taught me how to bat and always told me to play straight and watch the ball. He never got involved beyond my early years though; he handed me over to the coaches. Ever since I can remember I knew we were of indigenous heritage. It was just what we were. We were proud of it but I wasn’t one to sing from the rooftops and beat my chest. I had no idea I was the first and it wasn’t until years after my debut the media cottoned on. Maybe it was naivety but I was sure there would have been lots before me; we’re all Australians after all.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/ashes-2015-four-key-australia-players-steve-smith-mitchell-starc-adam-voges-josh-hazlewood-england\">Ashes 2015: Four key Australia players for England to contend with</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I saw my Baggy Green cap as a symbol of my journey as a player. Mine started aged six with my mum or dad taking me to the net sessions, playing in the driveway with me, ferrying me to games around the state, so that whole accumulation of hard work and sacrifice is what the Baggy Green is about for me. I got my cap before the presentation ceremonies started happening – it was just there in my kit bag. The night before, when I knew I was playing, I just kept putting it on and looking in the mirror. I sat there in my hotel with it on watching the telly and kept going back to check how it looked.

People who say otherwise are ill-informed.”</p> \n<p>How about Clarke’s instruction to Jimmy Anderson to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/nov/25/michael-clarke-captaincy-sledging-james-anderson\" title=\"\">“get ready for a broken fucking arm”</a> in Brisbane during the 2013-14 series? “A lot is made of that and, yes, it wasn’t the ideal choice of words.
