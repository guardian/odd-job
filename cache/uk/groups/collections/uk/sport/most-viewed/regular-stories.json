He didn’t mince his words. If he liked you, you knew that. If he didn’t, you knew that too.”</p> \n<p>Collins played Super Rugby for the Wellington-based Hurricanes until 2008, then played for Toulon in France, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2009/may/11/jerry-collins-ospreys-toulon\">Ospreys in England</a> and Japanese side Yamaha Jubilo.

It is just a game.”</p> \n<p>“In the two weeks of grief we’ve witnessed, we realise what an impact he had in the game,” Smith said. “In his own unique way he left the world a better place.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2dbff510a19ae712d6adf7299f39ec6bdf7f5857/484_317_4544_2727/4544.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2727,"width":4544,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Pool/Getty Images","altText":"PORIRUA, NEW ZEALAND - JUNE 17:  Tana Umaga (2nd L) and Chris Masoe (2nd R) carries the coffin of Jerry Collins at his funeral service at Te Rauparaha Arena on June 17, 2015 in Porirua, New Zealand.

But in the end, it wasn’t so simple for James, and the Golden State Warriors won game six in Cleveland 105-97 to take their first NBA championship in 40 years.</p> \n<p>The key to the Warriors’ win was that they appeared not to have a “best” player. NBA regular-season MVP Stephen Curry had 25 points, but it was a balanced attack for Golden State that put the Cleveland on their heels most of the game, chasing after a team that could run the break, dunk, and hit threes when needed. Five of the Warriors scored in double figures.</p> \n<p>Klay Thompson knew who he thought was the best. “We’re the best team in the world with the best player in the world,” Thompson said in the post-game interview as he looked at Curry sitting next to him.</p> \n<p>Curry was modest. “It’s about winning. Stats don’t really matter. Little things make a championship possible,” he said.</p> \n<p>James – wearing shiny gold shoes – finished with 32 points (on 13 of 33 shooting), 18 rebounds and nine assists. But the key stat in the game was the turnovers. The Cavs turned the ball over an incredible 19 times (a team-leading six by James), and those turnovers led to 25 Warrior points. Golden State turned the ball over just nine times, and those led to just 13 Cavs points.<br /></p> \n<p>LeBron said afterwards: “We were under-manned. I don’t know any other team in the history of the NBA that got to the finals without two all-stars. We had our playmakers in suits. For a good playoff run, you have to be healthy and little bit lucky. We weren’t healthy and we weren’t lucky.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457183674__\n</div> \n<p>Cavs coach David Blatt admitted: “Their depth over time did have an impact.”</p> \n<p>Warriors forward Andre Iguodala was the difference maker in victory. He did a decent job defensively on James, ran the floor on the break, drove to the hoop and finished with 25 points, five rebounds and five assists. He was versatile and played with size and speed, and making Warriors coach Steve Kerr look like a genius for putting him in the starting lineup for games five and six.</p> \n<p>Iguodala was named NBA finals series MVP. Golden State coach Steve Kerr said: “It is fitting the [MVP] award went to Andre [Iguodala]. He sacrificed his starting role this year. He did that to make our bench better, to make our team better. He set the tone for everything we accomplished.”</p> \n<p>Thompson said of Iguodala: “He is the ultimate professional … he stepped up when we needed him both on offense and defense. He deserved the NBA finals MVP.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"445ec4eb19ebf77b4341b352cbb0f68520742f4c\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/445ec4eb19ebf77b4341b352cbb0f68520742f4c/0_0_2316_1390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andre Iguodala: MVP\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andre Iguodala: MVP</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Richard/USA Today Sports</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Timofey Mozgov only played a total of 9:19 minutes and had no points in game five as the Cavaliers reacted to the Warriors going small in game four. But the Cavs switched gears in this one, playing Mozgov 10 minutes in the opening quarter and 32 minutes in the game. James drove and dished to Mosgov for an easy layup and the Cavs’ first bucket. Mosgov finished with a double-double: 17 points and 12 rebounds in 32 minutes.</p> \n<p> Cavs jumped to a 7-2 lead at the start of the game, but the Warriors outscored the Cavs over the final nine minutes of the first quarter by 26-8, to take a 28-15 lead. The Warriors – with a starting lineup that was basically four forwards and one guard – showed balance in their offense, with a combination of driving layups and long range shooting. Curry led the Warriors in the opening quarter with nine points.</p> \n<p>And the Warriors played big men Andrew Bogut and David Lee very little in this game (just one minute for Lee and a DNP for Bogut), preferring to let Tristan Thompson and Mozgov get points inside. Mozgov and Thompson scored 32 points between them, but the Cavs had little scoring other than those two and James. </p> \n<p>The Cavs hurt themselves with poor execution. Matthew Dellavedova seemed unable to keep pace with Curry, and the Aussie point guard had just one point and two assists in the game. A three point field goal by Iman Shumpert halfway through the second quarter was nullified by an offensive foul away from the ball by Tristan Thompson. James missed three of four free throws in the first half.</p> \n<p> But despite the poor play, Cleveland was behind by just 45-43 after an 8-2 run to close out the half. James has 15 points on six of 14 shooting in the first half. </p> \n<p>The Cavs took the lead early in the fourth quarter on a jump hook in the lane by Thompson (47-45), but the Warriors went on a 9-0 run with 8:13 left in the third quarter to lead 54-47. A fast break dunk by Iguodala with 5:12 left in the third extended the Warriors’ lead to 61-51. Golden State never looked back.</p> \n<p>James did make a steal and ran the floor for a dunk with 10:13 left in the game to cut the Warrior’s lead to seven, 75-68. But after a timeout, Curry hit a three and the lead was up to 10. The two teams traded baskets down the stretch, but it was obvious the Cavs looked tired, and the Warriors continued to move without the ball. It was that team effort that won the game; five in double figures for the Warriors and 28 assists for the NBA champions, compared to just 12 for the Cavaliers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acb9953a064d95af44dda1c95e747c5a8be88976\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/acb9953a064d95af44dda1c95e747c5a8be88976/0_99_4134_2482/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LeBron James couldn’t propel his Cavs team to victory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LeBron James couldn’t propel his Cavs team to victory.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So the team that had versatile scoring, passed the ball well, and didn’t turn it over much, beat the team with the self-proclaimed “best player in the world.” During one of the official timeouts in the first quarter, the Cavs game presentation crew played Dream On by Aerosmith from 1973 and showed highlights from old Cavs teams – teams that also failed to win it all.</p> \n<p>For Cleveland fans, in a city which has not won a major sports championship since 1964, the mantra looks like it will be “Dream On” once again. But for Warriors fans, who have also been suffering for what seems like forever, the dream came true, because the team played unselfishly and with little ego.</p> \n<p>“The sacrifice this team made, different guys stepping in … just pride. This is an amazing group of guys,” Kerr said as his team celebrated. </p> \n<p>“There’s been all this talk about us only winning by shooting the three-point shot, but what was overlooked was our combination of great offense and great defense. It’s about the balance. It turned into special season as a result.”</p> \n<p>Iguodala said: “I was just happy winning the ring, I don’t care about the MVP stuff.</p> \n<p>“For me it was just playing my game … when I am scoring the ball or not, I try to be an effective force on the court in all the other aspects of the game.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0a865a2c5da271b1e4057199c03ad11391f17da5/0_103_3155_1893/3155.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1893,"width":3155,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jason Miller/Getty Images","altText":"Golden State Warriors celebrate their victory.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jason Miller/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/445ec4eb19ebf77b4341b352cbb0f68520742f4c/0_0_2316_1390/2316.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1390,"width":2316,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andre Iguodala: MVP Photograph: David Richard/USA Today Sports","credit":"David Richard/USA Today Sports","altText":"Andre Iguodala: MVP","cleanCaption":"Andre Iguodala: MVP","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Richard/USA Today Sports"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/acb9953a064d95af44dda1c95e747c5a8be88976/0_99_4134_2482/4134.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2482,"width":4134,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"LeBron James couldn’t propel his Cavs team to victory.

In the meantime, here are some thoughts on tonight’s game from Les Carpenter:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> are tired now. The relentless zeal that pushed them to two early victories in the NBA finals has drained away. The series has grown long and the injuries to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love have proven all but fatal to the title dreams that burned just a week ago. LeBron James and a whole lot of enthusiasm are no match for the speed and depth of Golden State.</p> \n <p>Even with the series in Cleveland for Game 6 on Tuesday night, it feels like a last gasp for the Cavs. The way the Warriors raced past them in those final few minutes in Game 5 makes the result of this series seem a certainty. </p> \n <p>And yet because this is the finals and Cleveland have James, there remains that shred of doubt. If James is going to have that career-defining moment of pure greatness he never had to have in his title with the Miami Heat, tonight would be the time to do it. </p> \n <p>“One thing I’ve learned playing with LeBron for three years, you never count the man out,” his former team-mate Shane Battier said on a Monday conference call for the American Century Championship golf tournament. “If he scores 50 points, the Cavs will win. If he doesn’t I have the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> ending the series at six.”</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-5580baa7e4b0e91d8f409675","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-17T00:11:04Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T00:38:05Z","body":"<p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

In the meantime, here are some thoughts on tonight’s game from Les Carpenter:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> are tired now. The relentless zeal that pushed them to two early victories in the NBA finals has drained away. The series has grown long and the injuries to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love have proven all but fatal to the title dreams that burned just a week ago. LeBron James and a whole lot of enthusiasm are no match for the speed and depth of Golden State.</p> \n <p>Even with the series in Cleveland for Game 6 on Tuesday night, it feels like a last gasp for the Cavs. The way the Warriors raced past them in those final few minutes in Game 5 makes the result of this series seem a certainty. </p> \n <p>And yet because this is the finals and Cleveland have James, there remains that shred of doubt. If James is going to have that career-defining moment of pure greatness he never had to have in his title with the Miami Heat, tonight would be the time to do it. </p> \n <p>“One thing I’ve learned playing with LeBron for three years, you never count the man out,” his former team-mate Shane Battier said on a Monday conference call for the American Century Championship golf tournament. “If he scores 50 points, the Cavs will win. If he doesn’t I have the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> ending the series at six.”</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-5580c95de4b0e91d8f4096a8","title":"Tip-off!","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-17T01:12:46Z","body":"<p>Cavs score first at 11:31 of the 1st quarter on a made free throw by Iman Shumpert.

He saw the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/16/rafael-nadal-beaten-alexandr-dolgopolov-queens\" title=\"\">first set of Rafael Nadal’s shock defeat by Alexandr Dolgopolov</a>, and reckoned it looked a tricky assignment for the Spaniard, before following him on to Centre Court to beat the Taiwanese qualifier Lu Yen-hsun 6-4, 7-5 in a fairly untroubled 79 minutes, although he dropped serve in each set.</p> \n<p>To compensate for those minor lapses he thrashed 12 aces, 10 of them in the second set, and generally looked comfortable switching from clay – where he has had his most successful season – to the more familiar charms of grass. As Wimbledon preparations go this was a nice way to start, in relatively new shoes too, which aided his balance and movement.</p> \n<p>“Miami in March was the first time I really tried them,” he said. “These ones are good. I moved well today which is pleasing. The first couple of days on the grass here [previously] I have slipped a lot and fell over a couple of times. But I felt like I moved and changed direction pretty well today.</p> \n<p>“It was nice to be back on grass, also [Centre Court] was full from the beginning, a nice atmosphere. I started off a little bit slow, didn’t serve so well, but started hitting better from the back of the court. It’s about getting the balance right, aggressive tennis – but when you play that style first back there’s more of a chance to lose.”</p> \n<p>He will find Fernando Verdasco a considerably more difficult opponent on Thursday and has not forgotten the Spaniard took the first two sets before he tamed him <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/03/andy-murray-wimbledon-fernando-verdasco\" title=\"\">in the quarter-finals on his way to winning Wimbledon</a> two years ago.</p> \n<p>“He’s very dangerous. When he is on his game he’s an extremely tough guy to beat. You can sometimes go a couple of games where you don’t get to see the ball because he’s serving big and hitting his forehand huge,” Murray said. “Then there can be periods in the match where he makes a few mistakes and it’s up to you to capitalise on them and also to try to play a very solid, stable match because he does tend to have ups and downs throughout.</p> \n<p>“If you can stay consistent and solid throughout you’ll get some opportunities. But it’s not an easy thing to do against him. He does hit the ball so hard and he’s flashy. He doesn’t give you much rhythm. It will be tough.”</p> \n<p>If players had to have an adjective as a middle name Murray’s would be Tough. it didn’t quite fit. On Thursday it could be an entirely different matter – and that is just the way he likes it.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434481865693/Andy-Murray-Queens-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray hits a backhand during his first-round 6-4, 7-5 defeat of Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun at Queen's.

Saeed Ajmal, for a time before the crackdown the premier spinner in the world, was bowling the final over before a second new ball became available to Worcestershire, and three times Warwickshire’s beefy, dangerous lower-order leftie Keith Barker belted him unceremoniously to the ropes. “Rubbish,” they grumbled. “Take him off, what have we signed him again for?” These are harsh critics with short memories that if they cared to delve would tell them that last season, before he returned to Pakistan for a Test series, he took 63 wickets for the county in nine matches, and played no small part in their eventual promotion.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/16/wg-grace-cricket-book-the-spin\">The Spin | WG Grace: a cricketer of contradictions who lived for his duel with the ball</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But that was then and this is now. Ajmal played in that series in Sri Lanka last August but it was to be his final first-class match until this return to New Road. Following that Test, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/sep/09/icc-suspends-saeed-ajmal-bowling-action\" title=\"\">he was suspended from cricket</a> pending scrutiny of an action that had always appeared, as Fabian might have said to Aguecheek, on the windy side of the&nbsp;law.</p> \n<p>The biometric tests showed a degree of flex that was way beyond ambiguous and into the realms of darts and Alexandra Palace. To his credit, he has worked hard at a total remodel of his action but it is not even close to the same and, deprived in particular of his doosra, neither is his effectiveness. Pakistan resisted the temptation to recall him for the World Cup and when he did make an international comeback, in two ODIs against Bangladesh in April, he was slaughtered by Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim. Despite everything it was, to be honest, just a little sad to watch.</p> \n<p>His action is fine now as far as legality goes, a ramrod straight arm from start to finish, but no longer is there any spark to it. For the most part, he bowls flat and gets a little spin without it being anything extravagant. Any variations he gets appear to be restricted to occasional changes of pace, and an equally occasional alteration to the height of his bowling arm to what is termed round arm. He looked efficient enough, but innocuous as well on a dry pitch that was showing a few signs of wear even after two days. The Worcestershire supporters were right to be suspicious.</p> \n<p>Frustration rather than suspicion would have been the overriding feeling of the national selector, James Whitaker, who was watching this unfolding. He had come to Worcester to watch Ian Bell, who shrugged off his indifferent Test match form and obliged with a composed, skilled century; and Moeen Ali, whose batting has fallen away a little although not significantly, but whose bowling, as England’s first-choice spinner, has been under scrutiny.</p> \n<p>Last summer, his first in international cricket, he took 22 wickets at 28 runs apiece and, at the Rose Bowl, bowled England to victory with six for 67 against an India team containing some of the finest players of spin in the world. Since then, it has not been so good. A lengthy period of ODI cricket does not allow any spinner to settle into a rhythm and his injury sustained at the back end of the World Cup prevented him from joining the start of England’s Caribbean tour.</p> \n<p>When he did arrive, the trust was such that he was rushed straight into the second Test in Grenada, subsequently to have a disappointing match there and in Barbados, followed by an indifferent series at home against New Zealand. Since his return, he has taken 11 wickets at 41 apiece.</p> \n<p>Now, with the profile that Adil Rashid has acquired during the current ODI series against New Zealand, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/02/england-drop-jimmy-anderson-stuart-broad-ian-bell-odi-squad-new-zealand-cricket\" title=\"\">from which Moeen has been rested</a>, he is seen, in some quarters anyway, to be under pressure for his place.</p> \n<p>Here, though, is the problem for him. Implicit in him being rested from white‑ball cricket is the idea that he would instead get good overs in the bank and so regain the rhythm of bowling that has deserted him. A spin bowler needs to be able to get into a spell, book himself in at one end as it were, without feeling under pressure to make things happen immediately.</p> \n<p>Watching Moeen in the Caribbean, it was clear that he was trying to force his game. But instead of being able to bowl himself back into form – essential with the approach of the Ashes, for which he should still be the first-choice spinner – he was accorded a single token over at the end of the first day against Warwickshire and a further five overs in tandem with Ajmal as Bell was approaching his hundred: six overs for 18 runs in total. There was no conclusion to be drawn by Whitaker from this: he bowled OK.</p> \n<p>Worcestershire have two more fixtures: against Middlesex at Uxbridge starting next Sunday; and on 29 June against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, where their teenage off-spinner Matthew Carter has just taken seven wickets in the first innings of his first‑class debut. The latter match will almost certainly coincide, or at least directly follow, an England camp with the new coach, Trevor Bayliss. With the old Ajmal, one might understand Worcestershire’s dilemma. This, though, is helping neither themselves, England nor Moeen himself. Maybe some dialogue is necessary.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434460410811/Moeen-Ali-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Moeen Ali has been rested by England but has not been getting overs at Warwickshire.

I have a very good relationship with Jos&eacute;, too. It is good to have the support of the crowd, but it’s not an inspiration, not an extra pressure. I play my game. I try to do my best in every single match of the year and not try to be better if there is somebody or not on the crowd.”</p> \n<p>Nadal deflected a suggestion that Mourinho might have been in a position to give him advice. “He’s a football manager. He’s one of the best of the world. And I have my team. I will never give him advice on football and probably he will not be giving me advice on tennis.”</p> \n<p>Having complained of nerves and self-doubt during four defeats on European clay before Roland Garros, Nadal does look rejuvenated. It was his misfortune to strike Dolgopolov on one of his best days. “He’s difficult on every surface and his serve today was great, huge.

The latest – an MBE for services to athletics which was announced on Saturday – left her “shocked and thrilled” and feeling things were all “a bit surreal”. There is also still a slightly stunned humility to Pavey’s words when she describes that crisp night in Zurich in August when, a month or so short of her 41st birthday, she bounded away from the 10,000m field and into the history books by becoming the oldest woman to win a European&nbsp;title.</p> \n<p>Such was Pavey’s popularity among her team-mates, who nicknamed her Granny, that many were in tears when she claimed what was the first gold medal of her career. In her quiet moments, though, Pavey wonders if there were other medals that got away. “Sometimes I have come off the track feeling like a failure, only to subsequently find out that I was racing against drug cheats,” she says. “In sport there are ups and downs but for any athlete it is extremely frustrating if people are prepared to cheat.”</p> \n<p>One race in particular sticks out: the 5,000m in the European Championships in 2006. Pavey finished fourth. One athlete ahead of her was Liliya Shobukhova, the Russian whose results from October 2009 onwards were annulled because of anomalies in her biological passport.</p> \n<p>“I would have liked to have got more medals in my career,” Pavey continues. “Sometimes I have got to major championships and run really badly for some reason but on other occasions I know I have gone up against athletes who were cheating.”</p> \n<p>Pavey, who has long been one of the loudest voices against drugs in sport, believes authorities such as the World Anti-Doping Agency need to be better funded. “Definitely,” she says. “The biological passport has been a really positive step – I felt the Europeans last year was a much cleaner championship – but you always fear the bad guys are one step ahead.”</p> \n<p>She also wants a far greater spotlight shone on sport’s greyer areas including the – for now legal – use of thyroid medicine. Before Zurich Pavey had a blood test that suggested she had slightly irregular thyroid levels and it was suggested she might consider treatment, something that outraged her. Like the UK’s anti-doping agency she wants thyroid medicine banned except where there is a genuine medical need.</p> \n<p>“I believe there should be a strict Therapeutic Use Certificate-type process where you get an exemption form if you do need it,” she says. “Because at the moment some people are taking thyroid medicine unethically because it can improve energy levels and help athletes lose weight. Remember human growth hormone and EPO were things that were used in hospitals to help people who were ill but then people misused them.”</p> \n<p>Following the BBC’s Panorama programme that made several claims about Mo Farah’s coach, Alberto Salazar, Pavey said she would “run a mile” from anyone she had suspicions about. But she stresses it is up to Farah to decide what is best. “We have to be clear there are no allegations against Mo and the allegations against Salazar and Galen Rupp are just allegations,” she adds. “I can only talk about what I would do and I would want to distance myself from any situation which could be an unsafe environment.”</p> \n<p>Despite athletics regularly making the news for the wrong reasons Pavey would still encourage her children, Jacob and Emily, to take up the sport seriously if they so desired. “I love athletics and I’ve loved my career in it,” she says. “Hopefully if we come through this patch it will give the sport a brighter future.”</p> \n<p>Pavey will not compete at the world championships in Beijing because she wants to spend more time with her family and also keep her body ticking over as she prepares for an almighty push to make next year’s Olympics in Rio, which would be her fifth Games in a row. “That’s my big motivation,” she says. “But it’s not going to be easy. I’m getting older and older and there are some good young girls coming through.”</p> \n<p>Only one British track athlete – the race walker Chris Maddocks – has been to five Olympics, but if circumstances had been different Pavey might now be thinking of her sixth.</p> \n<p>“I’m old enough to have done five if I’d got my act together, because I was 21 in 1996 but I was backpacking around the world,” she says, laughing.</p> \n<p>“At that point I didn’t have the confidence to go on training camps so my husband Gavin and I decided to travel and train instead. We did things like run up an inactive volcano in Bali. I remember thinking: that will toughen me up but I could hardly walk for days.”</p> \n<p>Pavey will be nearly 43 by the Rio Olympics but she is tempted to plough on, possibly to the world championships in London in 2017 or to attempt a personal best in the marathon.</p> \n<p>There is one thing that she is sure of, though: there will be no big send-off like Paula Radcliffe’s in the London Marathon.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think I’ll have anything like that,” she chuckles. “Maybe I’ll just fizzle out.”</p> \n<p><em>Jo Pavey was speaking before her appearance on The Clare Balding Show.
