British championships on Sunday afternoon showed they should be in the best shape when this year’s Tour starts. Kennaugh defended his title in fine style but it was Cavendish who fought him pedal stroke for pedal stroke on the final climb up Michaelgate to take the silver medal.</p> \n<p>Kennaugh looks set to erase the memory of last year, when Sky dropped him inexplicably from their Tour lineup – to his utter frustration – but Cavendish’s display of stamina, speed, tactical nous and sheer bloody-mindedness also spoke volumes. Up against three members of Team Sky in the finale – the bronze medallist Ian Stannard and the Welshman Luke Rowe as well as Kennaugh – he rose to the occasion, chasing bravely behind Stannard and Kennaugh for many miles before going clear with Kennaugh on the final lap.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/27/tour-de-france-2015-yates-twins-orica\">Tour de France 2015: Yates twins ready for coming of age with Orica</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I’ve trained hard this year, the team’s given me a good programme to prepare for the Tour, and I’m up for it,” said Cavendish of Etixx-Quick Step and who has been training in the Isle of Man, including racing in a local time trial and handicap race. “This was a good hit out. I’m happy with how I felt, so I need a week of recovery now and I’ll be flying for the first days of the Tour de France. I just cracked the last time up Michaelgate, I’d been riding all day on my own. But I’m super happy with that.”</p> \n<p>If there was a downside for the sprinter it was in the close attentions of the crowd, who packed the narrow one-in-four cobbled climb into Lincoln’s historic centre. Early on, a camera hit Cavendish’s right shoulder – the one he damaged in last year’s spectacular crash on stage one of the Tour – and late on he struck his left, more heavily. He may have it looked at before he travels to Utrecht for the start of the Tour on Saturday.</p> \n<p>Sky set the pace from the off and the upshot was a viciously hard 125 miles; an initial group of 22 formed just two miles into the first 28-mile loop north of the city, two laps of which were followed by a shorter circuit with eight ascents of Michaelgate. Critically, neither of the Yates twins, Adam and Simon, were among the leaders, with the stronger of the pair, Simon, forced into a frustrating chase for 20th.</p> \n<p>Kennaugh and Cavendish forced the decisive split on only the second climb of Michaelgate, with Stannard and Luke Rowe linking up with the Yorkshiremen Adam Blythe and Scott Thwaites. A lap later Stannard pushed the pace up again, and only Kennaugh could hold him. With over 50 miles to race that looked to be the winning move but Cavendish thought otherwise, escaping with Rowe and pegging the two leaders back gradually until the four came together on the penultimate lap with some 12 miles remaining. Earlier in the day, Lizzie Armitstead put in a dominant display to take the third road-race title of her career and show she is over the finish-line crash that put her out of the Women’s Tour with heavy bruising to her left leg.</p> \n<p>The Yorkshirewoman controlled the moves effectively in the early phase of the race before putting in a single incisive attack as the leaders took the bell.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/27/tour-de-france-2015-alberto-contador-double-winners\">Tour de France 2015: Alberto Contador goes for a rare double</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The defending champion, Laura Trott, made an initial attempt to hold her wheel but to no avail and Armitstead pulled rapidly away with only a single lap to cover before sealing victory. By the finish she had opened the gap to just under 2min over the first wave of chasers, with the 19-year-old Alice Barnes – one of the GB mountain-biking squad selected to support Armitstead at last year’s world championships – taking silver from Trott and Molly Weaver.</p> \n<p>“I tested the legs a few times and I knew if I really wanted to that I could drop [the opposition]. I didn’t want to take anyone with fresh legs to the finish,” Armitstead said. “I knew I’d be able to put about 30sec into them on the climb. It was important to show well after the crash, and to be honest I didn’t feel too good at the start. The other riders had five days of racing at the Women’s Tour, and it’s never easy coming into a race just like that.”</p> \n<p>The gap between Armitstead and the rest of the British peloton was clear to see. “She is miles above the rest of us, in a league of her own,” Trott said. Armitstead will now head for the Giro Rosa – the women’s Tour of Italy – which starts on Friday in Ljubljana, Slovenia, after which she will kick back and fix her mind on finding form for her major target, the world road race championship in Richmond, Virginia, at the end of September.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/28/1435513596279/Peter-Kennaugh-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Peter Kennaugh had the best preparation for the Tour de France by winning the British Championships.

The loss to the Bulgarian on that otherwise pleasant afternoon was not pretty and, adding a patina of pain to the experience, there was Murray’s outburst during play, that sounded to most ears like “five minutes before the fucking match”, which indicated unspecified turmoil either unfolding or recently concluded behind the scenes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/28/novak-djokovic-cheat-wimbledon-boris-becker\">Novak Djokovic denies being coached during matches by Boris Becker</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is still unclear what it all meant. Murray insists he cannot remember. But the best guess is that he was confronted with some advice or piece of information just before going on to Centre Court that unsettled his then fragile psyche.</p> \n<p>He had been tense and unsure of himself for months, ever since Ivan Lendl had ended their two-year arrangement in March 2014 and here he was trying to defend his title and it was, he reckoned, all falling apart.</p> \n<p>Then his life took another lurch, this time for the better, as it turned out. Vallverdu, his assistant coach, and Green, his fitness trainer, were still tenuously in place but soon would be jettisoned, on good terms. In the same week Murray announced he was to marry Kim Sears. His back began to feel loose again after the career-saving surgery towards the end of 2013.</p> \n<p>The changes in Murray’s private life and very public career thereafter would be considerable and he would emerge from the experience at the start of 2015 not only more content than he had been for a long while but a dangerous player again, self-assured at last after the rolling upheavals that had threatened to disrupt the rehabilitation of his game seriously.</p> \n<p>So he has returned to the scene of both his greatest triumphs and disappointments a different beast over the past week or so. There is calm in his eyes.</p> \n<p>Kukushkin should not delay Murray long if he carries his recent form from the clay of Europe and the grass of Queen’s into his favourite tournament.</p> \n<p>Wimbledon has been his home for 10 years now and there is hardly a day when he does not look back on the drama and excitement of it all, sometimes while sitting alone, high up in the seats of Centre Court.</p> \n<p>What did he remember of his very first match at Wimbledon, against the eccentric Swiss George Bastl whose claim to fame will forever be beating the seven-times champion Pete Sampras in the second round in 2002? Murray beat him 6-4, 6-2, 6-2. “I don’t remember loads about the match,” Murray says.</p> \n<p>“I remember I played on No2 Court. I was the first match on and the crowd wasn’t full at the beginning. It was quite quiet and it gradually built up as I got to the end. I remember feeling very comfortable during the match. I felt quite confident during it.</p> \n<p>“It was kinda everything that went with it was extremely new to me. I had never experienced big press conferences, people following me home. After the second match I went out to play mixed doubles and I couldn’t get to the court. That was really weird for me because just a few weeks before I was playing in front of five people. That is the kind of thing that sticks out for me when I think back then.</p> \n<p>“I loved the matches on the court. There was no pressure, zero. No expectation. But off the court it was actually more hectic than it is now.</p> \n<p>“Sometimes I have the odd cameraman or photographer or whatever following me around but then it was worse.” Did the pressure ease by the time he got to play David Nalbandian on Centre Court?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/28/rafael-nadal-blasts-spanish-tennis-federation\">Rafael Nadal rounds on ‘media show’ surrounding Spanish tennis federation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Not for me. I didn’t really read the press at that age. I had no expectations myself and I think it doesn’t really matter what anyone else writes if you, in your heart, aren’t putting any pressure or expectations on yourself. So I just went out there and played and enjoyed it.”</p> \n<p>The other change for Murray at this tournament is the presence of his new assistant coach, Jonas Bjorkman, and it seems to be a positive one. The Swede has been by his side for nine matches and nine wins during Mauresmo’s temporary absence this summer. Now they are all back together for the big one.</p> \n<p>Bjorkman, a former world No4 who reached the semi-finals here in 2006, revealed he was commentating for Swedish television when Murray won the title two years ago. He said: “It would obviously be great to have another final. I would be very happy if Andy can get to that position.</p> \n<p>“Once again he is playing great tennis – and he has since the year started. His physical shape is really good. We are going to keep working hard on a few things and the team around will help him to be really strong and fresh.”</p> \n<p>There is undeniably a sense that Murray is growing into his best tennis. Unlike too many times in the past, there is a certainty about him. He looks and sounds relaxed. How different it all was only 12 months ago.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435511335369/Andy-Murray-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray practises under the watchful eyes of Jonas Bjorkman and Amélie Mauresmo before his opening match at Wimbledon against Mikhail Kukushkin on Tuesday.

I don’t think that’s how you can call it.</p> \n<p>“I mean, there are special ways of, I would say, communication, as he mentioned: the way you look at each other, the way you ‘feel’ your box, and the box ‘feels’ what you’re going through on the court. I think that’s something that just gives you that reassurance, gives you that confidence.</p> \n<p>“It’s not necessary that he tells me where to serve or to which side of the opponent’s court I have to play, because that doesn’t happen. But it’s more of a, you know, encouragement, and more of a support and reassurance, as I said, that’s basically present in those moments.”</p> \n<p>Pressed further on whether or not this constituted “a signal”, Djokovic smiled nervously, and replied: “Well, I think with all the cameras pointed out to him and to the box, I think you would already notice if he would just kind of go kick serve, slice, to do the backhand or forehand.</p> \n<p>“But again, we can’t pretend like that’s not happening in tennis. Of course, there’s situations when it happens, and not just with the top players, with everybody. This is a very competitive sport. You’re alone on the court. Of course, there’s certain rules.</p> \n<p>“But also there are times when the team of the player communicates with the player when he gets to go and take the towel in the corner, which is closer to the box, or, you know, different ways.</p> \n<p>“I think it’s all fine as long as it’s not regular. I think it just depends. Also that’s up to the chair umpire or supervisor to decide if somebody’s breaking the rules or not. As long as it’s something that you can tolerate, let’s say, within the ways of communication, I think it’s fine.”</p> \n<p>As measured as that sounds, it suggests at the very least a cavalier regard for the game’s protocols. If the umpire caught Becker and Djokovic – or any coach and player – violating this or another code of conduct, they would issue a warning, followed by a point penalty for a second offence, then a game penalty for a further transgression.</p> \n<p>It is a rule that you rarely see enforced, however, and whether or not coaching should or should not be allowed is an issue that divides the men’s and women’s Tours.</p> \n<p>In WTA events outside the majors, coaches can come on to the court once per set, or when an opponent is receiving a medical time-out, but cannot communicate during play.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/28/rafael-nadal-blasts-spanish-tennis-federation\">Rafael Nadal rounds on ‘media show’ surrounding Spanish tennis federation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Rules, regulations, nods and winks aside, Djokovic was further embarrassed during his champion’s press conference when he strayed into another row ignited by Becker: questioning whether or not the world No1 and Roger Federer “really don’t like each other” – as the forever outspoken Becker suggests in his new book.</p> \n<p>When asked about how moved he seemed during a long, standing ovation from the crowd at Roland Garros immediately after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/french-open-2015-stanislas-wawrinka-novak-djokovic-win\">he’d lost to Stan Wawrinka</a> in the French Open final earlier this month, Djokovic said: “I felt something I never felt before in any grand slam final with any of my rivals … this connection with Stan.</p> \n<p>“The way we greeted each other at the net, then after when he came to my bench, I appreciate it very much.

On a day when Farah pledged to speak under oath to the United States Anti-Doping Agency, Kara Goucher – who trained alongside Farah in 2011 and 2012 – refused to criticise him directly but urged anyone thinking of training with Salazar to “think long and hard because you’re going to be labelled something for the rest of your life”.</p> \n<p>Goucher, one of the whistleblowers in the BBC Panorama programme, also said she was confident Usada would find enough evidence for “the truth to come out” but admitted it would probably not happen overnight.</p> \n<p>“I know that these things take time,” she added. “I saw Lance Armstrong on Oprah, and afterwards [the Usada CEO] Travis Tygart was on. I told my husband Adam: ‘You get me that guy and I’ll talk to him.’ Seven days later I was in his office. I believe that Usada is doing everything in its power. Think of how long it took for Lance. I believe the truth will come out. When? I don’t know.”</p> \n<p>Goucher’s claims came a day after it was revealed Usada’s team of detectives, who brought down Armstrong in 2012, has put its investigations into Salazar and Farah’s training partner Galen Rupp on a more formal footing by interviewing the Oregon Project athlete Treniere Moser. On Sunday night Salazar promised to co-operate with Usada if it decides to question him, saying: “Absolutely, I’ve got nothing to hide.” However, when asked whether he would do so under oath, he said: “I don’t understand exactly what that means. I’d need to speak to my lawyer.” When told it would mean if he lied then he would be in trouble, Salazar repeated: “I would have to speak to my lawyer about that.”</p> \n<p>Usada is also expected to speak to other members of the Oregon Project and its investigation may even involve senior figures at UK Athletics, which employs Salazar as a consultant. There is no suggestion Farah has committed any wrongdoing and he has made it clear to friends he would be happy to speak to any relevant authority, at any time, in any circumstances.</p> \n<p>Goucher, the 2007 world 10,000m bronze medallist from the US, said “multiple sources” had come forward since the Panorama documentary aired at the start of June. In the programme Goucher alleged Salazar had coached Rupp to try to get a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) for an intravenous drip before the 2011 world championships and had offered her a thyroid drug to get her to lose weight. In his 11,750-word response to the BBC’s claims last week Salazar called both claims false and published detailed email documentation that appeared to show he was happy with Goucher’s weight.</p> \n<p>Yet Goucher stands by her story and says there is more to come. “I have, constantly, all day long, people passing me information, wanting me to bring it forward,” she said.</p> \n<p>“I really want to encourage all the people who have reached out to me to reach out to Usada. I pass everything along that you give me but the case is much stronger if it comes from you.</p> \n<p>“I will most definitely give all my evidence in the coming days. They took my quotes out of context and when you put partial emails or emails from a 10-email-long chain and just put one in, you don’t get both sides. I understand that, if you read it through, it looks like I’m a liar. I don’t like being labelled a liar, just like anybody else.”</p> \n<p>Goucher insisted she would continue to fight for a clean sport despite Salazar’s ferocious counterattack on her character. “I’m being dragged through the mud and it will probably continue but I’m still here, I’m going to keep racing and I stand by my statements and I always will. I want my son to be able to believe in the sport and the system.” Goucher, who first spoke to Usada in February 2013, also confirmed that she would be happy to go under oath. “I would welcome that opportunity for myself, for every former Oregon Project member, for every doctor that’s been involved,” she said.</p> \n<p>Rupp, who finished third in the final of the 5,000m on Sunday, said he had sent Usada “tons of documents and had nothing to hide”. He added: “Usada knows everything. I’ll do everything I need to do to co-operate with them.”</p> \n<p>Rupp’s team-mate Matthew Centrowitz, who won the 1500m at the US trials on Saturday, insisted he had never seen any evidence of wrongdoing at the Nike Oregon Project. ‚&Auml;&uacute;If I ever saw one thing that I felt was wrong or whatever I would be the first to leave,‚&Auml;&ugrave; he added.</p> \n<p>The most impressive time of the final day of the trials came from the controversial sprinter Justin Gatlin, who became the fifth fastest man in history over 200m when he ran 19.57sec.</p> \n<p>The most impressive performance, however, came from Alysia Monta&ntilde;o, who won the 800m only 10 months after giving birth to a daughter. Monta&ntilde;o ran in last year’s championships when she was pregnant.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435522052184/Kara-Goucher-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kara Goucher urged anyone thinking of training with Alberto Salazar to 'think long and hard because you’re going to be labelled something for the rest of your life'.

He is a languid strokemaker whose style may not be suited to the sporting wickets upon which so many counties are choosing to play their County Championship matches. But on this benign surface he could display his wares with much virtuosity. There is minimal movement of feet or head when Bell-Drummond bats.</p> \n<p>Wrists are flicked and the ball disappears with surprising power for a man of such slight frame. He does not swagger. Instead he hits a boundary, whereupon he generally stands stock still and stares at his feet.</p> \n<p>He began his innings with a flurry of boundaries against Harris. Whenever the ball was over-pitched, which was quite frequently, Bell-Drummond tapped it for four – no great effort was required on the glassy outfield. He was also partial to the glided dab to the vacant third-man region.</p> \n<p>He took a particular liking to Fawad Ahmed’s wrist-spin, which meant he circumnavigated the nervous 90s. If he was not late-cutting for four he was driving the ball for six over mid-on.</p> \n<p>Bell-Drummond took 18 runs from Fawad’s sixth over. From the seventh he sped from 86 to 102 in the space of three balls and the nerves seemed to be residing with the bowler rather than the batsman. In the end Harris disposed of him lbw, whereupon Bell-Drummond sheepishly acknowledged a standing ovation.</p> \n<p>None of the Kent batsmen could match him although Ben Harmison, in his first outing of the summer, battled grittily until succumbing to Smith via a shot he might like to forget. The rest came and saw but most definitely did not conquer although Mitchell Claydon, against his own countrymen, hit with rustic good humour at the end.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457298832__\n</div> \n<p>All of the Australia bowlers took wickets though Fawad was probably the grumpiest given the mauling he received from Bell-Drummond and the fact that Smith’s occasional leg-breaks proved to be more successful. Mind you, the luck was with Smith. His first scalp, Adam Ball, succumbed to a hip-high full-toss which was mishit to Peter Siddle on the boundary.</p> \n<p>Bell-Drummond was engagingly chuffed with his performance, especially since it began with him facing the prospect of a pair. “It was brilliant,” he said “probably the best day of my career. I can’t quite believe it’s happened against the best attack in the world that I watched on TV when I was growing up.”</p> \n<p>He explained the thinking behind the assault on Fawad with a certain unassailable logic. “With those pace bowlers you are never sure how long you are going to last.” He also reported how Michael Clarke had made a point of congratulating him on his innings as he left the field. The “friendly” tour continues – for about another week.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435514677976/Daniel-Bell-Drummond-Kent-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kent's Daniel Bell-Drummond hit 127 from 112 balls against the Australians, with 102 of his runs on the final day coming from boundaries.
