The label is now serious; Jordan Spieth has become only the sixth player in golfing history to claim the Masters and US Open back-to-back. The last man to achieve such a feat? Tiger Woods, once the most golden of them all. Spieth hasn’t so much dealt with expectations as vaulted over them. </p> \n<p>Further glances at history endorse the scale of Spieth’s achievement on a sun-kissed afternoon in the Pacific Northwest. At just 21, he is the youngest player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 to place multiple major success beside his name. </p> \n<p>Suddenly, Spieth is halfway towards a career grand slam. “You can’t win them all if you don’t win the first two,” he said during his victory address. “So we are going to go St Andrews looking for the Claret Jug. I believe we can get it done.” Arrogance? Not a bit of it. The confidence is perfectly justified. </p> \n<p>Chambers Bay was a controversial major venue but it produced a stunning champion; a young man who is showing little regard whatsoever for ceremony when continually swatting aside all before him. Spieth’s unwillingness to simply compete, his ability to prevail in completely different scenarios, set him apart from those with considerably more experience. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/21/us-open-2015-final-round-live\">US Open 2015: final round –as it happened | Scott Murray</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As the Texan celebrated his latest triumph, it was impossible not to feel sympathy for Dustin Johnson. The 30-year-old continues to find new ways to pass up major championship opportunities; from bizarre rules breaches to complete blow-ups to, on this occasion, three-putting the 72nd hole. </p> \n<p>In what proved a quite incredible US Open denouement, Johnson had a 12ft eagle putt to win the championship. As that effort slid 4ft past, there was a sad sense of inevitability. Already in the locker room at five under par, Spieth was soon to be crowned the champion. He didn’t even need a Monday 18-hole play-off to seal his title.</p> \n<p>There was a time when Michael Greller caddied for amateurs at Chambers Bay. His aim back then was to somehow make it to a US Open. Not only has Greller done that, he has carried the bag of a champion. It isn’t only Spieth who is rapidly turning dreams into reality. </p> \n<p>On a quite epic day, Spieth believed his chance may have gone. Leading by three with two to play, he double-bogeyed the par three 17<sup>th</sup> after a horrible tee shot. This opened the door for Johnson, who birdied the penultimate hole and played a glorious five-iron into the last from 247 yards. Disaster was to strike thereafter, as it has so many times in Johnson’s enigmatic career. This stumble will wound him more than any other. </p> \n<p>“On the last green, I was thinking, ‘This is why I’m here. This is why I play the game of golf.’ It just didn’t work out,” said an understandably shellshocked Johnson. </p> \n<p>Different players had flirted with glory. Branden Grace was tied with Spieth before carving his tee shot on 16 out of bounds. Louis Oosthuizen played the Sunday back nine in just 29 shots for a four under total. Oosthuizen, denied a playoff by one, will look back ruefully on an opening round of 77. There was little shock attached to the fact that Jason Day, who had earlier suffered from the effects of vertigo, watched his challenge peter out. Day signed for a 74 and tied for ninth place. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/rory-mcilroy-charge-us-open-2015\">Rory McIlroy charges up US Open leaderboard but leaves it too late</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Day’s compatriot, Adam Scott, showed the benefits of having Steve Williams back on caddie duties. Scott signed off with a 64 for a share of fourth with Grace and the 21-year-old Australian Cameron Smith. </p> \n<p>As this nail-biting conclusion was being played out, Ian Poulter took to social media to offer a lengthy criticism of Chambers Bay. The Englishman had promised to keep his counsel over the venue until the conclusion of his fourth round and kept to that vow.</p> \n<p>Poulter admitted he “didn’t play well enough to be remotely close” but added: “It is disgraceful that the USGA hasn’t apologised about the greens they simply have said ‘we are thrilled the course condition this week.’ </p> \n<p>“It wasn’t a bad golf course, in fact it played well and was playable. What wasn’t playable were the green surfaces. If this was a regular PGA Tour event lots of players would have withdrawn and gone home on Wednesday but players won’t do that for a major. They were simply the worst most disgraceful surfaces I have ever seen on any tour in all the years I have played.</p> \n<p>“The US Open deserves better than that.”</p> \n<p>Whether merited or not, the tournament threw up an unforgettable closing chapter. If Rory McIlroy is the finest golfer in the world, there can be no doubt over the man to capture hearts and minds thus far in 2015. Scarily, this is still only the beginning of Spieth’s career. </p> \n<p><br /> </p> \n<p><br /> </p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434942293745/ed03bc58-5176-49c9-99d3-31458fe7806a-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Kyle Terada/USA Today Sports","altText":"Jordan Spieth","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Kyle Terada/USA Today Sports"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-22T03:01:24Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T03:57:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":41,"contributors":[{"name":"Ewan Murray","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/26/1401131130466/Ewan-Murray-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ewanmurray"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["US Open Golf 2015","Jordan Spieth","US Open","Golf","PGA Tour","Sport","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/us-open-golf-2015","webTitle":"US Open Golf 2015"},{"id":"sport/jordan-spieth","webTitle":"Jordan Spieth"},{"id":"sport/usopengolf","webTitle":"US Open"},{"id":"sport/golf","webTitle":"Golf"},{"id":"sport/pga-tour","webTitle":"PGA Tour"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ewan Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ewanmurray"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/21/us-open-2015-jordan-spieth-wins-in-thrilling-finish-to-add-to-masters-crown","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a278","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/21/us-open-2015-jordan-spieth-wins-in-thrilling-finish-to-add-to-masters-crown","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/21/us-open-2015-jordan-spieth-wins-in-thrilling-finish-to-add-to-masters-crown"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434942293745/ed03bc58-5176-49c9-99d3-31458fe7806a-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jordan Spieth kisses the US Open trophy after a remarkable finish to the tournament.

He’ll become the first player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 to have won more than one major before turning 22. And he’ll be only the sixth man in history - after Craig Wood, Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods - to win the Masters and US Open in the same year. He’d be halfway to golf’s elusive holy grail: the modern Grand Slam. Yes, there’s going to be some noise.</p> \n<p><strong>It says something for the sheer brilliance of this year’s championship, then, that a Spieth win might not even be the most amazing story on offer.</strong> The narrative surrounding Jason Day is arguably even more compelling. At the still-tender age of 27, he’s finished second twice at the US Open already, and fourth in another. A perennial bridesmaid at the majors, he’s also got a second and third place at the Masters under his belt, plus two top-ten finishes at the PGA. His ascension to major winner would be some story anyway. But having suffered that distressing vertigo attack on Friday, bravely finishing his round with his legs barely supporting him, then embarking on a storming back nine of 31 yesterday despite still being a bit shaky on his feet, a Day victory would be a story for the ages. Right up there with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2013/jun/07/joy-of-six-us-open-golf\">Ken Venturi’s death-defying battle against heatstroke at Congressional in 1964</a>. Setting aside how the golf’s going to pan out, God speed Jason Day. Safe home.</p> \n<p><strong>Then there’s Dustin Johnson. </strong>He’s come so close in the majors, only to blow up spectacularly every time he finds himself in the final group. An 82 on the final day at Pebble Beach in the 2010 US Open. Grounding his club in sand and missing a play-off at the PGA later that year. Winging a shot out of bounds from the centre of the fairway at Sandwich while chasing Darren Clarke at the 2011 Open. It’s three blockbusting failures from three.

He’ll become the first player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 to have won more than one major before turning 22. And he’ll be only the sixth man in history - after Craig Wood, Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods - to win the Masters and US Open in the same year. He’d be halfway to golf’s elusive holy grail: the modern Grand Slam. Yes, there’s going to be some noise.</p> \n<p><strong>It says something for the sheer brilliance of this year’s championship, then, that a Spieth win might not even be the most amazing story on offer.</strong> The narrative surrounding Jason Day is arguably even more compelling. At the still-tender age of 27, he’s finished second twice at the US Open already, and fourth in another. A perennial bridesmaid at the majors, he’s also got a second and third place at the Masters under his belt, plus two top-ten finishes at the PGA. His ascension to major winner would be some story anyway. But having suffered that distressing vertigo attack on Friday, bravely finishing his round with his legs barely supporting him, then embarking on a storming back nine of 31 yesterday despite still being a bit shaky on his feet, a Day victory would be a story for the ages. Right up there with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2013/jun/07/joy-of-six-us-open-golf\">Ken Venturi’s death-defying battle against heatstroke at Congressional in 1964</a>. Setting aside how the golf’s going to pan out, God speed Jason Day. Safe home.</p> \n<p><strong>Then there’s Dustin Johnson. </strong>He’s come so close in the majors, only to blow up spectacularly every time he finds himself in the final group. An 82 on the final day at Pebble Beach in the 2010 US Open. Grounding his club in sand and missing a play-off at the PGA later that year. Winging a shot out of bounds from the centre of the fairway at Sandwich while chasing Darren Clarke at the 2011 Open. It’s three blockbusting failures from three. But he won this year’s WGC Cadillac Championship at the notorious Doral Blue Monster with a nerveless 66. Can he finally parlay a great 54-hole position into victory? Nerves could still betray him, but who’d begrudge the big man?</p> \n<p><strong>Or what if Louis Oosthuizen manages to bounce back from that opening-day 77 to complete the unlikeliest turnaround in major championship history? </strong>A pair of 66s since, and he’s the most in-form player in the entire field right now. He’d continue a famous South African tradition at the US Open, too, Gary Player having broken the USA/UK hegemony in 1965, Ernie Els and Retief Goosen winning multiple titles since. His compatriot, the unsung Branden Grace, who has been peppering the flags this week, will fancy joining that elite list too.</p> \n<p><strong>Could Shane Lowry become the latest in a long line of recent European - actually, let’s narrow this down, Irish - major winners? </strong>Will JB Holmes - a modest record in the majors, but hot on the PGA Tour this year, winning the Shell Houston Open, shooting 62 at Doral - take the step up? Or could the 21-year-old Australian Cameron Smith - Spieth isn’t the only player with a chance of becoming the youngest champ of the modern era - win on debut? He’d be the first player since Francis Ouimet in 1913 to achieve that, and he’d also become the first major debutant to win a title since Ben Curtis took the Open in 2003.</p> \n<p><strong>So many spectacular stories waiting to be told. </strong>And we’ve only just scratched the surface. We’re guaranteed a championship to remember. To think some people are moaning about the set-up around Chambers Bay! Pah. This is going to be some ride. Buckle in, folks.

He exuded calm and self-belief in winning his fourth Queen’s title on Sunday – and, given his natural diffidence, that encourages the growing perception that he will be standing opposite the defending champion, Novak Djokovic, on the final Sunday at the All England Club.</p> \n<p>Whether or not the Scot can beat the Serb there again to win a second title to go with the trophy <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/07/andy-murray-wimbledon-2013-novak-djokovic\" title=\"\">he lifted two years ago</a> will be the subject of debate over the next few weeks – I think he can – but Murray believes so, and that matters more than the opinion of any expert. There is no discernible doubt in his eyes, just quiet determination born of the consistency he has shown in the intervening period.</p> \n<p>On clay, too, he has been exceptional, unbeaten in 15 matches <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/06/novak-djokovic-beats-andy-murray-french-open-semi\" title=\"\">before Djokovic stopped him in the semi-final at Roland Garros</a> this month. In that red run, Murray won his first two clay-court titles, contributing to Rafael Nadal’s woes in Madrid, and he has effortlessly taken his form on to his favourite surface over the past week.</p> \n<p>Djokovic is the only player to beat Murray on any court in 30 completed tour matches <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/feb/26/andy-murray-loses-borna-coric-dubai\" title=\"\">since Borna Coric in Dubai</a> in February (discounting David Goffin’s retirement walkover in Rome, and Murray’s two Davis Cup wins) – although the Serb has also prevailed in the two slams, the Australian and French Open, as well as the semi-final at Indian Wells and the final in Miami. So those setbacks against his nearest contemporary will have left their mark – one eased by marriage. Murray has lost only once since his wedding to Kim in April.</p> \n<p>It is Djokovic whom Murray has always wanted to beat most – and he could hardly have greater incentive given the chasm of 6,300 points between the world No1 and the world No3. The 500 points Murray has garnered here – along with &pound;273,000 – will have restored much of his confidence.</p> \n<p>All of that is to do with his mind (and his bank account). His body and his tennis are pertinent too, and they are in fantastic shape. His natural caution, meanwhile, will direct him towards events in Halle on Sunday, where Roger Federer, 2,005 points ahead of him in the rankings and 15 majors to the good, beat Andreas Seppi 7-6, 6-4 to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/21/roger-federer-wins-halle-open-eighth-time\" title=\"\">win another title on the German grass</a>. Can the Swiss, without a slam in three years, sustain his form over seven best-of-five matches at Wimbledon? Another conundrum.</p> \n<p>But it was not just that Murray joined John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick as a four-times winner of the Queen’s title, but the sustained brilliance of his performance in subduing two excellent opponents in one day, Viktor Troicki in the morning and Kevin Anderson in the afternoon, that inspired the view among many good judges that he can win Wimbledon again. This was a two-part masterclass against players of vastly contrasting styles, separated by a little over two hours of rest, and completed in 124 minutes.</p> \n<p>After resisting the robust challenge of Troicki in an hour to complete a 6-3, 7-6 victory in a semi-final held over from Saturday evening, the Scot was back at 2.25pm to deal with the monster serving of Anderson, who came to the final having put an astounding 96 aces past his four opponents.</p> \n<p>Even Anderson’s fastest serve of the day – 138 miles an hour in the seventh game of the second set – did not put Murray out of his measured stride across grass as rich and slick as some of the watching patrons. After a little more than an hour, Murray served for the match. He sealed it with a superb away-swinging serve to the deuce corner and could barely contain his smile as Queen’s rose to greet him in a warm, extended chorus of applause. Tim Henman could hardly have made them happier.</p> \n<p>The sheer variety of Murray’s shot-making under pressure brought unease to Anderson’s hitherto buoyant tennis. Murray lobbed him, dinked and chipped with great judgment, and went cross-court hard and flat off both wings. He served well, too, and took the sting out of his opponent’s booming missiles, block-defending when he could get a racket on the ball then working his way into the point, even if Anderson still managed to put 10 aces past him.</p> \n<p>The South African, who lost to Murray at Wimbledon last year, said: “He’s a terrific player and has had such great success on all surfaces.”</p> \n<p>When Murray and Troicki resumed their semi-final at 11am, the home favourite tidied up the first set from break-point in the seventh game, and had to hurdle a courtside box chasing down a drop shot in the second point of the first game in the second set, ending up about 10 feet from his opponent. It was one of a few obstacles on his way to victory, as Troicki offered stiff resistance all the way to the end.</p> \n<p>If there was anything wrong with the Serb’s left shoulder after a heavy fall on Saturday night, his right one was in perfect working order as he consistently pounded down serves at around 130 miles an hour and invested his groundstrokes with serious muscle.</p> \n<p>Murray has often said he is not a morning person but he was wide awake for Troicki. In the tie-break, he led 4-2 at the changeover, handed two points back on his serve and was grateful for Troicki’s final shot of the match after an extended rally, a smash from the baseline into the bottom of the net.</p> \n<p>Both players got a standing ovation – and deserved it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/21/andy-murray-v-kevin-anderson-queens-club-final-live\">Andy Murray v Kevin Anderson: Queen's Club final – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434899700862/e793aa9f-e112-4ab0-b1ed-a3e626d7a5df-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Andy Murray saw off Kevin Anderson in the Queen’s final just a couple of hours after he had finished off Viktor Troicki in the semi-final","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-21T15:03:15Z","lastModified":"2015-06-21T23:01:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":270,"contributors":[{"name":"Kevin Mitchell","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741641/KevinMitchell.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/kevinmitchell"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Andy Murray","Tennis","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/andymurray","webTitle":"Andy Murray"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Kevin Mitchell","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/kevinmitchell"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/21/andy-murray-kevin-anderson-queens-title","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a22f","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/21/andy-murray-kevin-anderson-queens-title","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/21/andy-murray-kevin-anderson-queens-title"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434899700862/e793aa9f-e112-4ab0-b1ed-a3e626d7a5df-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray saw off Kevin Anderson in the Queen’s final just a couple of hours after he had finished off Viktor Troicki in the semi-final.

But in terms of wins it is only 4-3 to him, with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/mar/29/sebastian-vettel-wins-malaysia-f1-lewis-hamilton-second\" title=\"\">Sebastian Vettel taking the other race in Malaysia</a>.</p> \n<p>What Hamilton may find more perturbing is that there were extenuating circumstances for his previous two setbacks this year. In Spain, Rosberg started from pole and Hamilton from the dirty side of the track – he also suffered a messy pit stop and ultimately had three stops to the German’s two.</p> \n<p>In Monaco, Hamilton dominated the entire weekend and, even though he was more culpable in his defeat than was immediately apparent, the decision to pull him in for an unnecessary tyre change was a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/25/mercedes-blunder-lewis-hamilton-monaco-niki-lauda\" title=\"\">major misjudgment by his team</a>.</p> \n<p>In Austria, Rosberg was simply superior, beating Hamilton as he did last year; the British driver will have to get his head around the challenges of the track built by the Red Bull team owner, Dietrich Mateschitz.</p> \n<p>This was Rosberg’s 11th victory and he has never been more animated in triumph. There is every possibility that the title race will go to the final round in Abu Dhabi, just as it did last year. The only pity is that it is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/12/lewis-hamilton-chinese-grand-prix-nico-rosberg-mercedes\" title=\"\">a purely internecine war</a>.</p> \n<p>Rosberg jumped Hamilton on the inside going into the first corner and then defended his advantage with ferocious determination. He said afterwards: “I had a good start and then good pace in the race – that is what I’m most happy about. I think I have found what I needed to find last year in terms of in the races and that’s what is really working out for me this year.”</p> \n<p>A rather subdued Hamilton said: “I had a problem with the revs. I took my foot off the gas and the throttle was still on. It was not the best way to start the race but it is something we will work on to improve on my side of the garage.” Or Rosberg may just have caught him napping.</p> \n<p>Before the pair came in for their solitary pit stop there was a five-lap period when Rosberg increased his lead from two seconds to four. Hamilton managed to reduce his disadvantage to 2.2sec but then, when the drivers pitted, Rosberg emerged the stronger once again. His stop was marginally the quicker (2.7 against 3.1) and the German built up his lead over the subsequent laps. When it emerged that Hamilton had crossed the white line at the pit exit, incurring a five-second penalty, Rosberg had in effect doubled his lead, from about five seconds to 10. But Rosberg would have won anyway. His only worry after that was some tyre vibrations in the closing stages.</p> \n<p>The Mercedes motorsport chief, Toto Wolff, believes Rosberg exhibited the mental toughness in victory that will keep the championship race alive to the end. Asked how Rosberg manages to keep in touch with Hamilton, Wolff said: “I’ve been asked this before: ‘Is this the tipping point? Is he now going to be No2 [driver]?’ I kept repeating that he’s mentally very strong, and we’ve seen that today.</p> \n<p>“Both of them are under pressure because they’re pushing each other so much. Nico was faultless. We saw from today it’s going to go down to the wire. The races we have seen have been characterised by tiny mistakes by both of them, or the team, and today we have seen great race pace and faultless execution by Nico. It was a great performance.”</p> \n<p>Felipe Massa (Williams) and Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari) were next, followed by Valtteri Bottas (Williams) and Nico H&uuml;lkenberg (Force India).</p> \n<p>The race got off to a dramatic start when there was a heavy collision between Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen – drivers usually extremely adept at keeping out of trouble. It is no small irony that earlier in the weekend Raikkonen had said that F1 should become “a little more dangerous”.</p> \n<p>The Finn lost his rear end and Alonso, with nowhere to go, clattered into the back of him, putting both out of the race. They were also lucky to escape injury. It was an even more wretched weekend than usual for McLaren, with both of their cars out of the race by lap nine. Jenson Button, who like Alonso had been handed a 25-place grid penalty, was told to retire, and said: “When you have a 10sec stop-go penalty retiring on lap nine is never a bad thing. I chose to have the penalties this weekend rather than Silverstone. Hopefully we will have a clean weekend there.”</p> \n<p>McLaren said: “A brief and very disappointing Austrian GP for the team. Time to get our heads down for testing and Silverstone.” But to add to their long list of troubles this season the damage to Alonso’s car – which had the upgrades ahead of Button’s for the race – is likely to compromise the final in-season testing session this week.</p> \n<h2>Final positions after race (71 laps) </h2> \n<p><strong>1 Nico Rosberg</strong> (Ger) Mercedes 1hr 30min 16.930sec, <strong>2 Lewis Hamilton </strong>(GB) Mercedes 1:30:25.730, <strong>3 Felipe Massa </strong>(Br) Williams 1:30:34.503, <strong>4 Sebastian Vettel </strong>(Ger) Ferrari 1:30:35.111, <strong>5 Valtteri Bottas </strong>(Fin) Williams 1:31:10.534, <strong>6 Nico H&uuml;lkenberg </strong>(Ger) Force India 1:31:21.005, <strong>7 Pastor Maldonado </strong>(Ven) Lotus at 1 Lap, <strong>8 Max Verstappen</strong> (Neth) Toro Rosso at 1 Lap, <strong>9 Sergio P&eacute;rez</strong> (Mex) Force India at 1 Lap, <strong>10 Daniel Ricciardo </strong>(Aus) Red Bull at 1 Lap, <strong>11 Felipe Nasr </strong>(Br) Sauber at 1 Lap, <strong>12 Daniil Kvyat </strong>(Rus) Red Bull at 1 Lap, <strong>13 Marcus Ericsson </strong>(Swe) Sauber at 2 Laps, <strong>14 Roberto Merhi </strong>(Sp) Manor at 3 Laps</p> \n<p>Not Classified: <strong>15 Romain Grosjean </strong>(Fr) Lotus 37 Laps completed, <strong>16 Carlos Sainz </strong>(Sp) Toro Rosso 36 Laps completed, <strong>17 Jenson Button </strong>(GB) McLaren 8 Laps completed, <strong>18 Will Stevens </strong>(GB) Manor Marussia 1 Lap completed, <strong>19 Kimi Raikkonen </strong>(Fin) Ferrari 0 Laps completed, <strong>20 Fernando Alonso </strong>(Sp) McLaren 0 Laps completed</p> \n<h2>Drivers’ championship standings</h2> \n<p><strong>1 Lewis Hamilton</strong> (GB) Mercedes 169pts, <strong>2 Nico Rosberg</strong> (Ger) Mercedes 159, <strong>3 Sebastian Vettel </strong>(Ger) Ferrari 120, <strong>4 Kimi Raikkonen</strong> (Fin) Ferrari 72, <strong>5 Valtteri Bottas </strong>(Fin) Williams 67, <strong>6 Felipe Massa </strong>(Br)Williams 62, <strong>7 Daniel Ricciardo </strong>(Aus) Red Bull 36, <strong>8 Daniil Kvyat</strong> (Rus) Red Bull 19, <strong>9 Nico H&uuml;lkenberg </strong>(Ger) Force India 18, <strong>10 Romain Grosjean</strong> (Fr) Lotus 17, <strong>11 Felipe Nasr </strong>(Br) Sauber 16, <strong>12 Sergio P&eacute;rez (Mex) </strong>Force India 13, <strong>13 Pastor Maldonado </strong>(Ven) Lotus 12, <strong>14 Max Verstappen </strong>(Neth) Toro Rosso 10, <strong>15 Carlos Sainz </strong>(Sp) Toro Rosso 9, <strong>16 Marcus Ericsson </strong>(Swe) Sauber 5, <strong>17 Jenson Button </strong>(GB) McLaren 4, <strong>18 Fernando Alonso </strong>(Sp) McLaren 0, <strong>19 Roberto Merhi (Sp) </strong>Manor Marussia 0, <strong>20 Will Stevens </strong>(GB) Manor Marussia 0, <strong>21 Kevin Magnussen </strong>(Den) McLaren 0</p> \n<h2>Manufacturers’ championship standings</h2> \n<p><strong>1 Mercedes</strong> 328pts,<strong> 2 Ferrari</strong> 192, <strong>3 Williams</strong> 129, <strong>4 Red Bull</strong> 55, <strong>5 Force India</strong> 31, <strong>6 Lotus</strong> 29, <strong>7 Sauber</strong> 21, <strong>8 Toro Rosso</strong> 19, <strong>9 McLaren </strong>4, <strong>10 Manor</strong> 0</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434893550070/F1-Grand-Prix-of-Austria-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nico Rosberg, No6, beats Lewis Hamilton into the first corner of the F1 Austrian Grand Prix, with Sebastian Vettel in third.

And yet, somehow, the world No1 summoned the spirit of 1973 on Sunday at Chambers Bay.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/21/us-open-2015-final-round-live\">US Open 2015: final round – live! | Scott Murray</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On that historic occasion Johnny Miller produced a 63 to upstage the quartet who had earlier been in pole position for the major. Here McIlroy embarked on a turbo-charged run which saw him reach the turn in 32 before holing birdies at the 10th – where he played one of the shots of the tournament from a fairway bunker to within 3ft of the hole – 12th and 13th. The third of those arrived via a 72ft putt from over the back of the putting surface.</p> \n<p>Roars reverberated around the venue. McIlroy had confirmed an ability to produce these cataclysmic surges which no other player in this sport can replicate. From the 14th green Marc Warren, in the group in front of McIlroy and John Senden, stood back just to watch the four-time major winner’s drive. Even fellow professionals knew what was taking place.</p> \n<p>Perhaps McIlroy was not even the one smiling most widely. The USGA and its executive director, Mike Davis, finally had a counter-argument against the wave of criticism this event has withstood. A finale featuring McIlroy in such imperious form, after all, is hardly the domain of a two-bit event. Some of the sniping towards Chambers Bay has been perfectly valid. The 115th US Open, though, reached its conclusion in nail-biting circumstances and with the game’s most prominent figures as the leading players.</p> \n<p>The Northern Irishman’s wings were clipped with a bogey on the par-three 15th. The putting woe which had undermined his attempt to run away with this competition, never mind win it, returned. He failed to recover on the short 16th, missed a tiny putt for par on the penultimate hole and ultimately signed for 66 and an even-par 72-hole total.</p> \n<p>This represented a magnificent, if belated, effort. The sense that the Open Championship, at the Old Course he so adores, cannot come quickly enough for McIlroy is unavoidable.</p> \n<p>Earlier Chris Kirk had offered the most fierce critique of the USGA. The American, who opened his fourth round with a 10, was in no better mood by the time he took to the locker room. Kirk claimed the USGA should be “ashamed of what they did” to this tournament.</p> \n<p>Billy Horschel stopped only narrowly short of implanting his putter into a green by way of exhibiting his frustration. The FedEx Cup holder shot 67 on Sunday but was still scathing in his assessment of four days in the Pacific north-west.</p> \n<p>“I think a lot of players, and I’m one of them, have lost some respect for the USGA and this championship this year for the greens,” said Horschel.</p> \n<p>“It sounds like the players are whining and complaining. Well, you’re playing for millions of dollars, you’re playing for the US Open championship. We’re not looking for perfect greens. We’re not looking for Memorial’s greens or even last week at TPC Southwind in Memphis, at the FedEx St Jude Classic. But we’re looking for something that’s very consistent. Every green is very consistent. And this week they’re not.”</p> \n<p>Sergio Garc&iacute;a signed off with a 68 for three over in total. Justin Rose’s 71 was for plus five. Phil Mickelson had gone 71 holes without a double bogey before taking a fresh air swipe in rough at the last, causing precisely that. He kept his post-round comments to 49 words after a 73.</p> \n<p>Lee Westwood was more expansive. The Englishman closed on nine over after an even-par 70. “It’s the kind of course I would like to come and play with my mates, with a cart and a few beers,” he said. “There are certain aspects to it that I don’t think are right for a US Open but I am thinking more from a fan’s point of view. It’s been a strange atmosphere out there because they can’t seem to get close to the action on some holes. I watched Phil Mickelson tee off on the 1st today and they are not going to see him again until his second shot on the 2nd hole.</p> \n<p>“From a fan’s point of view it would have been an even harder walk than the players. It’s actually quite dangerous for them. I would be interested to see how active the First Aid tents have been this week. It’s treacherous out there.</p> \n<p>“The greens being in poor condition is obviously disappointing. It’s the US Open, you want it in pristine condition but sometimes these things are out of your control.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434929835492/US-Open-Championship-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rory McIlroy hits his tee shot on the 11th hole during the fourth round of the US Open at Chambers Bay.

But, when reminded he went on to win Wimbledon after winning here in 2013, he said there was no direct connection.</p> \n<p>“That means nothing, really. There are no guarantees that winning here gives you a Wimbledon title. I need to go out there and earn it. I need to train well the next five, six days.</p> \n<p>“It’s great preparation, a great start to my preparation on the grass. It gives me that little bit of confidence going in there. But it’s a long way to go before Wimbledon even starts and then all sorts of things can happen during slams.”</p> \n<p>Murray paid tribute to his coach of one year, Am&eacute;lie Mauresmo, augmented lately by the input of Jonas Bjorkman, for the adjustments to his game that have allowed him to play his best tennis in two years, on grass and clay.</p> \n<p>She arrives in London on Monday evening, having left Bjorkman to oversee Murray’s training at Queen’s, and will hand on to him again after Wimbledon, as she is expecting her first child in August.</p> \n<p>“Obviously I’m not going to stay undefeated with him forever,” Murray said of his winning sequence of nine matches and two tournaments. “But I also have to give a lot of credit to Am&eacute;lie. The things I have worked on with her, like using my variety, I have spoken about a lot. Hopefully a culmination of the two of them will give me more success. I have spoken to Am&eacute;lie a couple of times on the phone and we message every day. It’s been a good start.”</p> \n<p>He added: “I won’t train tomorrow, and will probably be at Wimbledon on Tuesday. I’m doing something for Tim Henman’s foundation at Roehampton on Tuesday.
