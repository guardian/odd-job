One is Virat Kohli of India and a second, New Zealand’s unflappable run machine Kane Williamson, has already been seen here this summer.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/alastair-cook-natural-game-england-australia\">Full marks for intent but Alastair Cook must play his natural game | Ali Martin</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The other two are playing in the first Test in Cardiff. Of these Steve Smith will get his chance perhaps on the second day to show his remarkable progress from perceived clown to the top-ranked batsman in the world. For now, though, the rise and rise of Joe Root, the epitome of youthful exuberance, continues. Root, not yet 25 years old, is having the time of his life, in that state, unencumbered by theory and over-analysis, where batting becomes so easy that it must be hard for him to comprehend how difficult it can be for others.</p> \n<p>Dropped by Brad Haddin behind the wicket from the second ball he faced from Mitchell Starc, he made a sublime century, his second against Australia and the seventh of his Test career, that pulled England away from a tricky situation at 43 for three, and he was not to be dismissed until Starc returned for his sixth spell and with his first ball, angled across, had him well caught low down at first slip by Shane Watson.</p> \n<p>By then, though, he had made 134, hitting 17 fours in the process, most of them sweetly through extra cover. There was assistance. Gary Ballance, whose idiosyncratic technique will have been scrutinised by Australia and no doubt left them wondering how precisely he has managed to average in the mid-50s, weathered the early storm that saw the loss of Adam Lyth, in the second over of the day, and then Alastair Cook and Ian Bell immediately after the first drinks break.</p> \n<p>Ballance was to make 61 in three and three quarter hours during which he scarcely made a mistake until he was lbw to a full ball from the persevering Josh Hazlewood. But by then he and Root had added 153 for the fourth wicket, effectively wiping out the earlier setback.</p> \n<p>Later Ben Stokes arrived to play with freedom once again, making 52, with seven fours and two sixes, one a top-edged hook over fine-leg and the other straight from Lyons, before he was bowled by a beauty from Starc that pitched around middle and took off stump. “Sssh” Starc mimed, finger to lips, as Stokes grumped his way off: sound advice.</p> \n<p>These really are remarkable times for Root. From the start of play he had sat on the dressing room balcony, grinning away at the lark of it all. He watched as Lyth edged Hazlewood’s third ball low to David Warner in the gully, who took a sharp catch well – a good delivery that swung into the left-hander, prompting him to look legside, but then held off the pitch. Soon after, Cook, looking to be positive against Nathan Lyon’s offspin but unable to get away any of the 13 previous deliveries from him, looked for his favourite cut and edged behind.</p> \n<p>One run later and Bell all but had his feet knocked from beneath him by Starc’s yorker and was lbw, thus continuing a sorry run of Test match scores – 11, 1, 0, 0, 1, 29, 12, 1 and now 1 again – since he made 143 against West Indies in the first Test in Antigua back in April.</p> \n<p>If it was a ticklish first hour for England, who won the toss and had no hesitation in batting despite some overcast conditions and the occasional squally shower, then those who had taken their seats early expecting to see some fire and brimstone from the Australian pace attack would have been disappointed. Local knowledge had suggested that county pitches had been slow this season and this, devoid of grass, looks to be no exception.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/wales-ashes-first-test-ecb-glamorgan-england-australia\">Wales puts on a woolly welcome as ECB tries to feed the Glamorgan fire | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Haddin stood a long way back for Starc’s opening over, only to find two deliveries bouncing before they reached him. If the ball nibbled around a little and swung too, potentially taking the pitch out of the equation, then it would still have signalled a tough day for the bowlers, who could see the law of diminishing returns: the harder they flogged the ball into the pitch, the slower it came off it.</p> \n<p>It may suit skiddy bowlers more. Under the circumstances the Australians stuck to their task handsomely, the reward of three wickets apiece to Hazlewood and particularly Starc more than well-earned. The scoring rate throughout the day was admirable –in excess of four runs per over – but turgid, emasculating surfaces such as this do Test cricket few favours.</p> \n<p>By the close England had reached 343 for seven, a total with which they should be content but not more than that. The wicket of Jos Buttler, for 27, shortly before the close, as he hit Hazlewood tamely to mid-on, meant that Australia may well be the more satisfied of the two teams.</p> \n<p>The manner in which Starc and Hazlewood were able to adjust their length to the conditions, bowling fuller than they might habitually be used to, and risking being driven in the process, was exemplary and the ball was given the opportunity to swing as a result. Jimmy Anderson, in particular, will see encouragement in this but it promises to be just as hard for the England bowlers as their Australian counterparts.</p> \n<p>As it is, it will be down to Moeen Ali, who has batted calmly for his 26, and Stuart Broad to try to get England up to 400 and beyond. Broad, with great commonsense, and no little courage, turned down a long single in the final over in order to ensure Moeen survived and it will not have gone unnoticed: he can be sure of a working-over first thing, almost certainly from Mitchell Johnson.</p> \n<p>Slow pitch it might be but it is quick enough to make life uncomfortable, as Johnson, wicketless in the day, might well remind him. “And just wait ’til I get you on a quick ’un.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436382610372/Joe-Root-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Joe Root raises his bat to acknowledge the adoring support after his innings of 134 on day one of the Ashes in Cardiff.

If it is a competition between two relative equals, then the relationship between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova is not a rivalry, the American’s 17-2 head-to-head record far too lopsided to be considered close. If, however, it’s a contest between two players who compete better than anyone else in the game and for whom giving an inch is not in their DNA, then theirs is as much a rivalry as any other. Throw in the spice of a strained personal relationship and Thursday’ssemi-final promises to be another enthralling spectacle.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/wimbledon-2015-order-of-play-thursday-9-july\">Wimbledon 2015: Order of play for Thursday 9 July</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“They’ve been the top two players consistently, the last 10 years and I think they call it a rivalry because they’re polar opposites,” the former Wimbledon champion Chris Evert told The Guardian. “I think rivalries are about two opposites, about where they came from in their lives, how they look, how they play, their temperaments, their style of play, they’re so different in every way, shape and form. But at the same time, it’s been one-sided. Maria’s also known for getting out of holes and for mental toughness. I think people keep hoping there’s going to be a rivalry.”</p> \n<p>In pure numbers terms, there is only likely to be one winner. When <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2004/jul/04/wimbledon2004.wimbledon4\" title=\"\">Sharapova stunned Williams to win Wimbledon as a 17-year-old in 2004</a> and followed it with victory in the season-ending WTA Championships, she led their head-to-head record 2-1. Since then, Williams has won all 16 of their contests, five of them in grand slams – including three finals. She has also won both their meetings on grass, the most recent of them a 6-0, 6-1 drubbing in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2012/aug/04/serena-williams-beats-maria-sharapova\" title=\"\">Olympics final at Wimbledon in 2012</a>. In January, Williams won her then 18th grand slam title with a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jan/31/serena-williams-v-maria-sharapova-australian-open-womens-final-live\" title=\"\">6-3, 7-6 victory at the Australian Open</a> and in the 12 clashes since they last met here five years ago, Sharapova has won just one set.</p> \n<p>What gives their matches an added edge, of course, is that they don’t get on. It’s not that they hate each other – this isn’t <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/27/john-mcenroe-fighting-spirit-tennis\" title=\"\">McEnroe and Connors</a> at the low-point of their relationship – it’s just that neither has time for the other. They are both outstanding competitors who have been champions their entire adult lives, so there is no obligation for them to be bosom buddies. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jun/22/maria-sharapova-serena-williams-wimbledon\" title=\"\">But their famous spat here in 2013</a> added spice to things and will forever be mentioned any time they play a big match.</p> \n<p>The row came on the eve of Wimbledon two years ago after some comments made by Williams in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, comments the author assumed referred to Sharapova and her boyfriend, Grigor Dimitrov, the Bulgarian player who was rumoured to have briefly dated Serena. The comments may even not have been about Sharapova but the Russian hit back, taking aim at Williams’ alleged relationship with her <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/serena-williams-french-open-champions-2015-patrick-mouratoglou\" title=\"\">coach Patrick Mouratoglou</a>. It was an ugly, if revealing incident. Williams later said she had apologised to Sharapova but one thing is for certain, every time she sees her across the net, she raises her game.</p> \n<p>Evert, working as a pundit for ESPN, said the personal side matters. “They don’t want to lose to each other, more than anybody,” she said. “They’re competitive, in the business field, in endorsements, in popularity, in PR, so definitely I think the personal part carries over. Serena gets really psyched up naturally for Maria. If she plays like she has the last two matches, she’s going to win. It’s all about the first serve and the court coverage. Serena’s a level ahead of Maria and that’s where the difference is.”</p> \n<p>Going into Williams’ fourth-round match against her sister, Mouratoglou said Wimbledon was now about “four grand slam finals”; Venus, Azarenka, Sharapova and Petra Kvitova. That was before the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/petra-kvitovas-wimbledon-defence-ended-by-inspired-jelena-jankovic\" title=\"\">Czech crashed out in round three</a> but the fact remains that Williams knows she has to play her best from here on if she’s to complete a second “Serena Slam” of four grand slams in a row and remain on track for the calendar year grand slam.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/wimbledon-2015-centre-court-crowd-azarenka-irritated\">Wimbledon 2015: Centre Court crowd leaves more than Azarenka irritated | Owen Gibson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Sharapova said “there will be no secrets when they meet” but this is where Williams usually steps up. “I love playing Maria,” Williams said. “I think she brings out the best in me. I think I bring out the best in her. I thought we had a wonderful final in Australia. It was very entertaining, she played really well.”</p> \n<p>Williams and Sharapova (in reverse order) are the two biggest earners in women’s tennis and the latter’s five grand slams make her the third-most successful active player, behind the American and her sister, Venus. The two players respect each other hugely for what they have achieved on and off the court and no one fights harder through adversity during matches than they do. Thursday’sclash will be another mental battle but Williams knows that if she is not on her game, Sharapova is good enough to beat her.

No doubt, home sentiment has coloured early investment but those markets are probably not far wrong.</p> \n<p>On their respective showings on Wednesday, Federer might be the fresher and more relaxed, coming off a relatively untroubled win over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/roger-federer-victory-wimbledon-semi-finals-gilles-simon\" title=\"\">Gilles Simon</a> that detained him an hour and 35 minutes, to add to the six hours 16 minutes it took him to get through his first four matches without dropping a set.</p> \n<p>Murray, looked more stressed beating the versatile and dangerous young Canadian Vasek Pospisil 6-4, 7-5, 6-4 in two hours 12 minutes, to go with the eight hours and 50 minutes of his journey to the quarters. But neither of them has been seriously in danger at any time over the first nine days.</p> \n<p>Murray, in his 150th victory in a grand slam match, moved into the semi-finals for the sixth time in 10 visits – excellence of the highest order – but he will come away from his victory (which was interrupted twice for rain and finished under the roof even though there was not a drop of rain to be seen for miles) eager to restore his energy levels over the concluding stages of his favourite tournament.</p> \n<p>The soreness in Murray’s right shoulder that struck during his edgy win over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/andy-murray-andreas-seppi-victory-wimbledon\" title=\"\">Andreas Seppi</a> last week and flared when he beat <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/andy-murray-wimbledon-2015-ivo-karlovic\" title=\"\">Ivo Karlovic on Monday</a> might have been the root cause of some under-powered hitting from hand and off the ground, although there is no cause yet for major concern.</p> \n<p>If Murray was striving for full force, Pospisil had his own physical burden, coming into his first grand slam quarter-final after three five-setters, including a tough win over the Londoner James Ward, not to mention his three hours and 39 minutes doubles defeat with Jack Sock against Andy’s brother, Jamie, and the Australian John Peers.</p> \n<p>If Pospisil did not come to Centre Court a sitting Canadian duck, he was certainly a tired moose.</p> \n<p>Just before the ground staff scurried on to court at 1.25pm to draw the covers over the turf after 13 minutes’ tennis, Murray (whose mood is always in sync with the elements) double-faulted in probably the most bizarre fashion of his interesting career, landing the ball in the middle of the wrong box. Nevertheless, he hit a 114mph boomer down the middle to hold for 3-1, regrouped and took the set.</p> \n<p>When they resumed at 2.03pm, the skies had brightened, as had Pospisil’s spirits. He played his best tennis in this period before the second break for rain.</p> \n<p>At 2.57pm, the umbrellas went up and the ground staff again rushed to the covers. They returned under the roof, windless and away from the now warm and pleasant sunshine bathing the rest of Wimbledon.</p> \n<p>The club’s thinking was that more rain was forecast, so this was the time to go inside. Unfortunately for them, it did not rain for the rest of the match.</p> \n<p>Pospisil struggled to hold his level under a fresh burst of pressure in longer rallies – and he was warned for slow serving as he gathered his composure in the 10th game of the second set.</p> \n<p>Murray won a deft net battle for break point, taking his chance with an astonishingly difficult backhand crosscourt winner that left the Canadian sprawled on the grass.</p> \n<p>“The first set, he played a great game to break,” Pospisil said. “Also, maybe my energy was a little bit low – first time in the quarter-finals of a grand slam. After the first rain delay, that first set and a half, I was pretty comfortable. I felt like I was dictating play. But I missed a couple balls when I shouldn’t have.”</p> \n<p>He also did well to keep his composure during two time violations that arrived at the worst moment for him. Afterwards he vented his frustration. “A lot of times these umpires, they seem to just want to be seen. I don’t know why they do it at a time like that. How many times do you see the top guys go more than [30 seconds] and they don’t get any violation, especially when it’s important moments? But I go out there and I get a time violation. I was right about to serve the ball. If he would have waited one second longer, I would have served.</p> \n<p>“I don’t agree with that time when he did it. Maybe the second one, yes, but not at five-all, 30-all. That was ridiculous, in my opinion. But I don’t think it affected me mentally very much.”</p> \n<p>The argument was resolved in the proper way in the third set, with Pospisil, his legs slowing, still fighting hard and Murray chipping away at his resolve. The Canadian saved three break points in the first three games, hung in for 2-2 and also 4-4.</p> \n<p>In the ninth game he was penalised on his serve for a second perceived delay on delivery, a decision that the partisan home crowd did not greet warmly. Murray got a fifth break point, Pospisil returned between his legs and was applauded but Murray broke with a clinical backhand and served for the match.</p> \n<p>Pospisil left it until the death but finally got a break point then saved match point, before Murray served through deuce twice to finish the job with a final whipped forehand.</p> \n<p>It was the sort of hard-earned win that will either harden Murray up for what will be an altogether different examination of his endurance and skills on Friday or eat into his self-belief. The former would seem more likely.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/8/1436370856795/andy-murray-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray gives his all during victory over Vasek Pospisil.

On both occasions Root has been grateful to the Australia keeper for not putting his hands together more successfully earlier in his innings.</p> \n<p>At Lord’s two years ago Haddin and Michael Clarke glared at one another when Root on four edged a ball from Shane Watson between them. Root finished with 180, a second-innings knock which set up an emphatic England victory. This innings, which was more important still since it began with England wobbling ominously on 43 for three, was also dependent on Haddin missing a difficult chance – from Root’s second ball.</p> \n<p>Root had barely survived the previous delivery from Mitchell Starc. The lanky left-armer had just sent Ian Bell packing with a full-length inswinger. Root’s first ball jagged into the pads off the pitch, which is even trickier to combat. All the Australians opened their lungs; the umpire Marais Erasmus was unmoved; a review was considered but Root, the mischievous Root who has occasionally displayed the capacity to wind up Australians, was smiling. He knew the ball, one of Starc’s very best, had conveniently taken his inside edge before thudding into pads which were located bang in front of the stumps. The next one had Haddin sprawling to his right. Root was no longer smiling, nor was the wicketkeeper, nor Starc.</p> \n<p>The duel between Starc and Root was compelling. In that spell an hour into the game Starc was the most dangerous bowler on the pitch, swinging the ball late at pace. Stunned by his first two deliveries, Root reacted as England had promised – with aggression.</p> \n<p>In Starc’s next over Root took 11 runs from two silky drives and a back-foot punch and he was on his way. Root did not look overawed. This would probably have been the case if he had never come across Starc before. They shared a dressing room for Yorkshire twice in the County Championship in 2012. That usually helps to demystify an opponent.</p> \n<p>If you had met any Australian before this tour and asked about Starc he or she would have taken a sharp intake of breath and raised eyebrows before reminding you Starc had just taken the new ball from Mitchell Johnson because of his pace … and swing … and steepling bounce. He bowled so superbly in the World Cup and in the Caribbean that Johnson just had to forfeit that new ball. Even Johnson agreed with the decision. Starc has earned his reputation, no doubt. But if you have shared a dressing room with him in Leeds, or, perhaps more relevantly, during a wet game in Colwyn Bay against Glamorgan, the mystique evaporates. The dressing rooms at Colwyn Bay are what estate agents would describe as “cosy and compact” and it rained there for most of the match in early June 2012, although Starc still managed to take two wickets. To take the positives out of what must have been a grim few days – it must have been a good place to get to know your latest overseas player, warts and all.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Gary Ballance also benefited from that experience. He could never approach Root’s fluency on Wednesday but his mind was clear and in his own idiosyncratic way when facing Starc he was playing the ball not the bowler in that crucial stand with Root.</p> \n<p>The demystification process can be important. Mike Atherton has explained he could not take the abuse he routinely experienced early in his Test career from Merv Hughes entirely seriously partly because he had often sat in a dressing room with him after play. Atherton had chatted to him, laughed at him and witnessed his post-match aches and pains. There is always this discovery to be made: that the giants of the game are human; they may even be vulnerable. In this era that revelation is harder to discover given that players of opposite sides do not mingle as much.</p> \n<p>Root attacked Starc with the carefree panache that he might have displayed against him in the nets at Headingley three years ago – except that Root might not have realised that he could bat with such fluency back then. He launched into drives, confident that he could adjust to the swinging ball.</p> \n<p>In all he took 44 runs from Starc at a rate close to a run a ball, Tykes past and present relishing the contest. In the end Starc got him. This time the push-drive found the edge and Root was caught at slip. The bowler hardly celebrated even though Root is the most coveted of all the England wickets. Back in dressing rooms, rather more palatial than those in Colwyn Bay, Starc knew that his old colleague had delivered the critical innings of the day.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Cricket/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436385470247/Englands-Joe-Root-plays-a-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Joe Root plays a pull shot for four, one of 17 boundaries in his 134 against Australia.

But Gasquet, who has flattered to deceive so many times, won the fourth and, though broken when serving for the match at 5-3 in the decider, he broke in the 20th game to advance to the semi-finals. His reward is a match with the world No1 and defending champion, Novak Djokovic.</p> \n<p>“It was very tough when I served at 5-3 and I got frustrated after that, but I tried to fight, fight and the last game was incredible,” Gasquet said. “It’s a great match for me. It would have been really difficult for me to lose after being up 5-3. It’s wonderful for me.”</p> \n<p>This was the battle of the backhands, the pair owning the two best one-handers in the business, and it did not disappoint, with some brilliant shots, even if the No4 seed took time to find his feet.</p> \n<p>Gasquet began brightly but from the moment he double-faulted to lose the second set it seemed unlikely he would make it through. Mental strength, at the very biggest moments, and an occasionally shaky serve, have been the biggest deficiencies in the Frenchman’s game but after Wawrinka won the third set he fought back superbly to take the fourth. Then in the fifth he bounced back after being broken at 5-3 and saved a break point in the 19th game before breaking in the next for victory.</p> \n<p>Some of the play from both verged on the outrageous, even more so in a match played in a brisk wind on No1 Court where it can swirl more than in the relatively confined surroundings of Centre Court.</p> \n<p>In the first set Wawrinka was guilty of hanging back too much and Gasquet, a semi-finalist in 2007, was able to dictate, breaking for 4-3 and then serving out to move ahead. In the second, despite a worrying moment when he flexed his right shoulder, Wawrinka began to take command and when Gasquet needed to be strong – serving at 4-5 – he failed. His first double-fault of the match handed the Swiss a set point and though it was saved, his second double-fault gave Wawrinka the set.</p> \n<p>In the third Wawrinka began to cut loose, stepping into the court and ripping winners almost at will, with one break doing the job. But in the fourth Gasquet continued to go for his shots, always looking to make something happen. Wawrinka’s serve got him out of trouble a few times but his first double-fault gifted Gasquet the break and the set.</p> \n<p>By this stage, Gasquet was reapplying the overgrip to his racket handle at every change of ends, his nerves there for everyone to see. His mental solidity has never been a strength but at 5-3, 30-15, he looked on course for victory only for two backhand errors to cost him dear.</p> \n<p>The Frenchman showed great resolve, though, saving a break point at 9-9 with a big first serve. That was Wawrinka’s last opportunity, it proved, as Gasquet forced three match points in the next game and took the third of them to seal victory when Wawrinka sent a backhand long.</p> \n<p>Djokovic eased into the last four and then anticipated a tough test against Gasquet, praising the Frenchman’s fitness for his strong form. “It’s a great effort from Richard to win against Stan, who is in a terrific form, and five sets,” said the world No1. “The biggest difference with Richard now, maybe comparing to the last couple of years, is his fitness. He has improved a lot. I heard he worked hard to get himself really fit and ready to go the distance, and it’s paying off.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436388059358/Richard-Gasquet-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Richard Gasquet celebrates after beating Stan Wawrinka after five gruelling sets in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon.

The 20-year-old will spend four to five days in Canberra with his family, including his ailing grandfather, before heading to Darwin for Australia’s Davis Cup quarter-final against Kazakhstan from 17 to 19 July.</p> \n<p>Despite the storm that surrounded his heavily criticised fourth-round loss to Frenchman Richard Gasquet, the 20-year-old says he’s not “too fussed” about finding a coach to replace the sacked Todd Larkham.</p> \n<p>“I think I’m doing pretty well without one,” he told the Seven Network after touching down at Sydney Airport on Wednesday night. “I’ve got a great team around me, obviously a strength and conditioner, my dad came. I feel good riding solo for a little bit and we’ll just see what happens.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/nick-kyrgios-wimbledon-behaviour-shocked-criticism\">Nick Kyrgios ‘shocked’ by criticism over his behaviour at Wimbledon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kyrgios seemed unfazed about the drama that dogged his Wimbledon exit and indicated he doesn’t have any regrets. “Not at all, I thought it was a pretty emotional couple of weeks, obviously physically as well,” he said. “I’m feeling it a little bit, I mean I thought it was a pretty successful couple of weeks as well. It was tough reading those things every day, but you think it’s part of it now.”</p> \n<p>He also played down fears he’s considering quitting tennis despite admitting he doesn’t love the sport. “Andre Agassi didn’t love the sport,” he said. “I think you know, I still like it to some degree. I still like going out there and enjoying it, the crowd and competing. I don’t think I’ll put down the racquet anytime soon.”</p> \n<p>Kyrgios’ laid-back attitude towards finding a new coach hasn’t stopped others making suggestions. Australian Davis Cup captain Wally Masur said he should make a play for Roger Rasheed following the tough task master’s split with Bulgarian star Grigor Dimitrov.</p> \n<p>Kyrgios sacked Larkham on the eve of Wimbledon after parting ways with Simon Rea after last year’s championships. Rasheed is a well-respected mentor who also worked with Lleyton Hewitt, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gael Monfils before spending 20 months with Dimitrov, a Wimbledon semi-finalist last year.</p> \n<p>Masur admitted he was biased towards Australian coaches and, ideally, a Tony Roche or Darren Cahill would be among his top preferences. But with Roche – who has guided grand slam champions Ivan Lendl, Pat Rafter and Hewitt in the past and is also assisting Bernard Tomic – only able to spend around 15 weeks on the road these days, he’s probably not the best fit for Kyrgios.</p> \n<p>Cahill helped Hewitt become the youngest men’s world No1 and then Agassi to become the oldest, but is already committed to commentary and junior coaching and development.</p> \n<p>“I’m a bit of a fan of Roger Rasheed. I really think Roger is good. He’s got an interesting personality,” Masur said. “I think he takes players along for the ride. He works them pretty hard; he’s pretty uncompromising.”</p> \n<p>Rafter, Australia’s director of player performance, agrees Kyrgios needs a strong disciplinarian, but most importantly someone the two-time grand slam quarter-finalist can trust. “The only one who can coach him is a person he wants to listen to,” he said.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a19a1b1ab3a2817c8fbf0b11f98cc1aceede2bf2/0_150_3216_1931/3216.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1931,"width":3216,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA","altText":"Kyrgios reached the fourth round at the All England Lawn Tennis Club, making plenty of headlines along the way.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T01:07:55Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T01:07:56Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":25,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Nick Kyrgios","Tennis","Australia sport","Sport","Davis Cup","Wimbledon","Wimbledon 2015"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/nick-kyrgios","webTitle":"Nick Kyrgios"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/daviscup","webTitle":"Davis Cup"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/09/coachless-nick-kyrgios-happy-without-coach","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agx9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/09/coachless-nick-kyrgios-happy-without-coach","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/09/coachless-nick-kyrgios-happy-without-coach"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a19a1b1ab3a2817c8fbf0b11f98cc1aceede2bf2/0_150_3216_1931/3216.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1931,"width":3216,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kyrgios reached the fourth round at the All England Lawn Tennis Club, making plenty of headlines along the way.
