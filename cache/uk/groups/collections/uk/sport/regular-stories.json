Would things have been different? Would it have turned out different? Maybe it might of, I don’t know.”</p> \n<p>That slip, capitalised on by Demba Ba, put Chelsea on their way to a 2-0 victory, which in turn halted Liverpool’s title charge before they spectacularly unravelled against Crystal Palace, enabling Manchester City to clinch the title. Gerrard’s slip was all the more dramatic because he had been so integral in a rampant Liverpool side that had won 11 consecutive matches – including a 3-2 win over Manchester City two weeks before – and were unbeaten in 16 prior to the arrival of Jos&eacute; Mourinho’s side.</p> \n<p>“Going into the Chelsea game I think because we were in a good run and good form and no fault to Brendan at all, but we sort of went in with the same tactics,” added Gerrard, speaking to Rio Ferdinand as part of ‘Rio Meets Steven Gerrard’ which will air on BT Sport 1 at 10pm on Wednesday. “We heard Chelsea were possibly making a few changes and we actually have the confidence we can blow them away but I think sort of underestimated the power of Mourinho. He came and he spoilt the game. He ruined it. He had them very hard to beat. He had all the units. He spoilt the game.”</p> \n<p>Gerrard is due to make his debut for LA Galaxy in mid-July, having announced his intention to leave Liverpool in early January but the 35-year-old’s decision to move was accelerated when Rodgers – who had already publicly spoken of the need to manage the number of matches his captain was playing – left him out of the starting lineup for the 1-0 Champions League defeat away to Real Madrid in November, opting to rest a number of senior players at the Bernab&eacute;u.</p> \n<p>“This was round about the time when I was doing a lot of thinking about what’s next for me because I’d had a couple of initial chats with Brendan saying to me, ‘I’m going to start managing your games and I have to look after you and I want you to be fresh and I don’t want you to be playing three games in a week because you may be tired’ and stuff like that,” said Gerrard. “But this situation was a bit unique because it was Real Madrid and I wanted to play. I sat on that bench devastated because I wanted to play so, it is one of those situations. It sort of pushed me into making a decision to move on and try something different.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/may/25/steven-gerrard-exits-disappointing-liverpool-for-disappointing-la-galaxy\">Steven Gerrard exits disappointing Liverpool ... for disappointing LA Galaxy</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Gerrard’s Liverpool career came to an ignominious end – a 6-1 defeat at the hands of Stoke City in May to finish a season in which the Reds failed to cope in the absence of Luis Su&aacute;rez, ending the campaign in sixth. Gerrard however, rates Daniel Sturridge, who made just 19 appearances in an injury-plagued season, just as highly as the Uruguayan.</p> \n<p>“I think to myself now. Who do you go and get to replace Luiz Su&aacute;rez if you’re Liverpool,” he said. “You’re going to have endless amounts of cash. And then does that player want to come with no Champions League? Sturridge is an unbelievable player. He’s got just as much ability as Torres and Su&aacute;rez but we can’t get him consistently on the pitch.”</p> \n<p><em>“Watch ‘Rio Meets Steven Gerrard’ on BT Sport 1 from 10pm Wednesday 24th June.

That is what I personally think.”</p> \n<p>The No7 shirt worn by Kevin Keegan, Kenny Dalglish, Peter Beardsley and Luis Su&aacute;rez and the No9 shirt that Ian St John, Ian Rush and Robbie Fowler have donned are traditionally the Liverpool numbers most associated with the weight of history. Gerrard’s career means the No8 has added significance and his departure to LA Galaxy means his number, in addition to the No7 vacated by Su&aacute;rez last summer, is now available.</p> \n<p>Ings, though, who wore the No10 with Burnley, has no interest in taking either just yet. “I would make sure I am established before taking any of those numbers,” he said. “It is such a huge club. That was the thinking behind it. I wouldn’t want to go to Liverpool and chuck a shirt on my back like that … it is pressure you don’t need. The expectation at clubs like that is huge. Obviously I am going to work my socks off to earn that number one day. For now I will take a high number and work hard.”</p> \n<p>The transfer fee taking him from Turf Moor to Anfield has yet to be finalised, with Liverpool expecting to pay between &pound;5m-6m and Burnley holding out for something closer to &pound;10m. An independent tribunal will decide on the price if the clubs cannot come to an arrangement.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/21/sweden-england-european-under-21-championship-match-report\">Sweden 0-1 England | European Under-21 Championship Group B match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The disagreement means the move will be slightly more protracted than it could have been. For Ings, though, the potential for a change of scene has been long in the pipeline, beginning with his decision not to sign a new contract at Burnley last summer.</p> \n<p>“I knew about my contract situation at the start of the season,” he said. “I had a big decision to make whether to sign a new contract or not. I sat down with my family and agent and we came up with I was going to hold out.</p> \n<p>“I had quite a strong season, but obviously we went down and I was gutted. But I thought I did enough to get myself a good move and the next step, and another challenge. It is a challenge I am really looking forward to and I can’t wait to get going.”</p> \n<p>Ings has twice impressed as a substitute for England in the Under-21 Championship and could have done enough to force himself into Gareth Southgate’s plans for their make-or-break final group game against Italy on Wednesday. Southgate’s side play with a lone striker in the shape of Harry Kane and thus far Tom Carroll and Will Hughes have been preferred in the starting XI in the role just behind the Tottenham striker.</p> \n<p>Ings would perhaps offer a more attacking option at No10 but he is happy to wait for his chance. “That is the competition you want for any side, club or country,” he said.</p> \n<p>“You need that competition to push each other along to perform better. We did that against Sweden. Everyone came on and made an impact. That is what the manager needs. You can’t have players come on and not make the impact because the game will slowly slip away from you. It is important you are ready.”</p> \n<p>Southgate’s three substitutes against Sweden did indeed help turn the tide, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Jesse Lingard also impressing. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/21/sweden-england-european-under-21-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">The latter’s 85th-minute winner</a> means England go into their final game in the same Andruv Stadium in Olomouc knowing a win will to take them through to the semi-finals for the first time since 2009.

I don’t want anyone to get contaminated accidentally.’ My thought was: if you are taking testosterone for yourself there are so many ways you can do it. You can do it in a tablet form. You can do it injection form. You can do it in an implant. So why risk something that could possibly contaminate the athlete? That is nuts. But then we would say, it’s his way. That’s Alberto.</p> \n<p>“It was one of those things that was so common that we didn’t really take notice of it. We would just think he’s got his damned Androgel again.”</p> \n<p>The Guardian received no response when it put Kupczak’s claim to Salazar via email. However it is known he is preparing a detailed rebuttal to a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/03/mo-farah-training-camp-documentary-alleged-drug-use-alberto-salazar-\" title=\"\">Panorama documentary</a> that claimed he gave Rupp testosterone when the athlete was 16 and committed several other doping violations. Rupp and Salazar deny the allegations and there is no suggestion Farah has committed any wrongdoing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/mo-farah-pr-team-eases-pressure-alberto-salazar-galen-rupp\">Mo Farah’s PR team eases the pressure but plenty of questions for others</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/mo-farah-alberto-salazar-doping-allegations-false-statements\" title=\"\">a statement to the Guardian</a> earlier this month, Salazar said: “I have said all along that I believe in a clean sport, hard work and I deny all allegations of doping. Given the time and effort the BBC and ProPublica committed to making these false allegations I hope that media and fans will afford me a short time to show the accusers are knowingly making false statements.”</p> \n<p>Kupczak, who also worked at the Oregon Project for a few months in 2006, also told the Guardian of a culture “where inhalers were so prevalent, it didn’t even faze me if people had one”. Yet in Kupczak’s view that culture became increasing secretive after he returned in 2008 and had become worse by 2011, by which time Farah had joined the camp.</p> \n<p>“When I first met Alberto in 2006 he was great,” he said. “He was fun. He was open. He would help anyone. He was a good man. He gets some wild ideas – he would want to fly to altitude to do a workout and it would happen, or he would order some laser for $20,000 that is worthless. He would do crazy things like that. As a therapist it was fun. I was like, what crazy stuff will we come up with next? But when I went back in 2008 he had changed. And he continued changing by the week. Things got really secretive.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/14/john-rohatinsky-backs-drug-allegations-alberto-salazar\">John Rohatinsky backs drug allegations made against Alberto Salazar</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kupczak, the latest former employee of Nike’s Oregon Project to come forward with claims against Salazar – the tally now stands at nearly 20 – also said he spoke to Usada three years ago. “I wanted to alert them before the Olympics because I thought they could watch more closely or do something about it. I probably contacted them in June 2012, and I spoke to them later in that month.”</p> \n<p>Kupczak believes that, in the next few days, Salazar will try to discredit Goucher, the 2007 10,000m world championship bronze medallist, and Steve Magness, an assistant at the Nike Oregon Project, who made some of the more serious accusations against him in the Panorama documentary. Kupczak said he can vouch for his former colleagues’ testimony and character.</p> \n<p>“I absolutely believe Kara,” he said. “I trust completely that she is honest. And Steve has complete integrity. He’s such a science guy that he wants to do it the proper way. Doping, in his mind, would take away from his science and his research.”</p> \n<p>Kupczak expects that, when Salazar issues his reply to the BBC, there will confusion in the athletics world with people unsure who is telling the truth. He believes the best way to cut through the impasse would be for Usada – or another official body – to start interviewing every member of the Nike Oregon Project under oath.</p> \n<p>“I would love to see that,” Kupczak said. “That is always when it comes out because you can’t lie because if you do you’ll have perjury charges. I would love to see all this come under oath, let’s do it. They always catch you. They always do.</p> \n<p>“If it was anyone else but Alberto they would say: ‘Enough is enough, we have heard this from enough people.’ It’s similar to the Lance Armstrong case, where they didn’t have any positive tests but they had enough witnesses that they said you’re done.”</p> \n<p>Kupczak said the bond between Salazar and Rupp was so close the coach would sometimes take over the massage duties from him when they were at training camps. “Sometimes we’d be somewhere and Galen likes his massages in the evening, so I would start to work on him and Alberto would say: ‘Al, you take the night off, I’ll give Galen a massage.’</p> \n<p>“At first I was a little taken aback. I was thinking am I doing a good job? But then I realised they have a peculiar arrangement, it’s beyond son and father, like some people say, so I’d just laugh it off and think I’ve got the night off, good.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435068872584/Alberto-Salazar-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Salazar takes timings during the Prefontaine Classic track and field meet in Eugene, Ore.

It’s been wonderful early-summer fun. England’s high-throttle new era rolled on into their last match before the Ashes with a 56-run one-off Twenty20 defeat of Brendon McCullum’s cavaliers on a crisp, run-filled, valedictory evening at Old Trafford. For England this was once again a Joe Root Day as the team’s best player in all three formats was by turns innovative, orthodox and even a little slapstick in compiling 68 off 46 balls. Around him a supporting cast of all-purpose dashers chipped in to compile a healthy looking 191 that proved to be comfortably out of reach.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/23/england-new-zealand-twenty20-live\">England v New Zealand: Twenty20 – live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By the end an aggressive display in the field led by some tight, straight fast bowling by Mark Wood and Ben Stokes was enough to suggest a carry-over of the white-ball optimism of recent weeks. As Eoin Morgan said afterwards: “The guys are playing with smiles on their faces, everyone’s enjoying each other’s company, everyone’s playing fearless cricket.” Over to you then, Alastair.</p> \n<p>With the first Ashes Test just three weeks away there had been a tendency to dismiss this match as a quirk of scheduling, a piece of lint on the lapel of an otherwise perfectly spruce Test and one-day summer. But in its own way this was more significant than any of the 50-over stuff that preceded it. England now have just three confirmed Twenty20 internationals before next year’s World Twenty20 in India. The poster for the evening may have carried the strapline ‚“Live music, live action, live cricket” (in that order), but this was still an occasion from which England will have been keen to learn as much as possible.</p> \n<p>Morgan won the toss as the shadows lengthened and chose to bat first on another excellent batting pitch. England’s team was the same XI that had chased down a shortened target in Durham, with Sam Billings, David Willey and Mark Wood making their international Twenty20 debuts and confirming the new synergy between the two white-ball teams.</p> \n<p>New Zealand picked two spinners, and with familiar Brendon McCullum-ish ballsiness gave the debutant Mitchell Santner the ball for a tight first over. Jason Roy got England going, yahooing Mitchell McClenaghan’s second ball into the crowd at straight midwicket with that familiar skip down the wicket, before being run out rather softly for an adrenal 23 off 13 balls.</p> \n<p>Tim Southee was on-driven for six by Root, then ramp-cut – an extraordinary piece of mid-shot adjustment – for a jaw-dropping four to third man as the opening powerplay brought 60 runs. Alex Hales skied Santner to cover to depart for 27 off 22 and Jonny Bairstow saw his off stump pegged back in the same over. But with Root in knockabout mood, placing the ball dreamily and in between reeling out the swats and the scoops, England got to 100 in the 11th over and Root to a lovely, effortless fifty off 36 balls with a whiplash pull off Nathan McCullum. That over went for 23, including an easy flicked six into the shadow of The Point by Billings, who was out shortly afterwards for a crazed but very useful 21 off 10 balls.</p> \n<p>Stokes and Adil Rashid biffed and dinked profitably at the end to leave England with an imposing total that looked better straight away as Willey swung one back to take out Martin Guptill’s leg stump with the third ball of the reply.</p> \n<p>New Zealand were never likely to die wondering, just as nobody hits the ball quite like Brendon McCullum, who for all his strength and fast hands has a beautiful economy of movement about his attacking strokes. Here Steven Finn, Willey and Wood were all hit for six in the opening overs before Wood sent McCullum on his way, producing a fast full ball from wide of the crease that cannoned into the stumps off a thick bottom-edge.</p> \n<p>A a horrible first over from Rashid went for 17 and New Zealand were ahead at the end of the powerplay on 72 for two, with Kane Williamson playing as he has all summer, all frictionless right-handed severity. England needed wickets badly. They got the unexpected bonus of a slightly frazzled New Zealand collapse – described as “amateur hour” by McCullum – as Ross Taylor lofted Rashid to Willey at long off, Colin Munro was bowled slogging at Stokes and Luke Ronchi played a horrible attempted ramp straight up in the air.</p> \n<p>Williamson continued to play beautifully, easing to a controlled, elegant fifty off just 31 balls. But some timely tight bowling by Finn and Wood left New Zealand needing 61 off 31 with seven wickets down, the last of them a sensational one-handed pick-up and direct hit by Willey to run out Williamson. Southee holed out next ball to give Wood his third wicket. And that was pretty much that. Cue the flames, the fireworks and – up next – the Ashes.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435092761514/Joe-Root-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Joe Root continued his impressive ODI form in the one-off T20 international to help England to a 56-run win at Old Trafford.

By the time Alastair Cook’s 14-man party touches down for their long weekend of fielding drills, team talks and golf, Australia will be two days into their first tour game against Kent at Canterbury and, with just a fortnight to go before the first Test in Cardiff on 8 July, there is no doubt which approach Lyon thinks is the superior.</p> \n<p>“To be honest I don’t really care what England are doing,” said the 27-year-old, who became Australia’s most prolific off-break bowler during the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/14/west-indies-australia-second-test-series-victory\" title=\"\">2-0 Test series win over West Indies</a> earlier this month when he passed Hugh Trumble’s 111-year-old record of 141 victims.</p> \n<p>“I know they are going on tour to Spain – they can enjoy their time on a holiday while we are preparing to take the Ashes home. We’re not sunbathing, that’s for sure.”</p> \n<p>Asked about the influence of Bayliss, he added, half-jokingly: “Trevor will bring in a different insight into Australian cricket – now we can text him and try and get injury news and stuff. England have fallen for that. But Trevor is a great guy, a great coach and he will bring a more relaxed environment to the England side, which can potentially be dangerous.”</p> \n<p>Even being described as “the weak link” in the touring attack by the former spinner Graeme Swann last week – a tranche of punditry that was more a talking up of their bulging fast bowling stocks, than a dig at his old opposite number – was not enough to dampen Lyon’s spirits. His confidence has also been lifted by the former England captain Michael Vaughan tipping him to be the leading wicket-taker in the series by virtue of turning the ball away from all but four of Cook’s expected side.</p> \n<p>“It’s amazing – one guy is writing me off, the other is giving me a compliment. Swann is trying to get under Australia’s skin but I’ve played 41 Tests now and I’ve always been referred to as the weakest link, so it doesn’t phase me,” he said. “And they are very nice words from Michael Vaughan but there is a lot of cricket to be played yet. If I end up being lead wicket taker I will be quite happy – as long as we take that trophy home. I’m excited about the Ashes series and all the left-handers.”</p> \n<p>While Lyon is inked in for the series opener in Wales, Australia have a greater selection headache in the fast bowling department with five pacemen of significant pedigree vying for three places. Ryan Harris, who has taken 57 wickets in 12 Ashes Tests, has rejoined Michael Clarke’s squad after missing their recent tour of the Caribbean on paternity leave and could oust one of Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Johnson or Josh Hazlewood. Peter Siddle sits at the back of the queue but is a veteran of four series against England.</p> \n<p>Asked if this was the strongest stable of quick bowlers he had been a part of, the 30-year-old Siddle replied: “I think it has to be. I didn’t play in the West Indies and Ryano didn’t play – we have plenty of options and everyone is different. For the team it is a tremendous thing to have that competitiveness – it makes us strong. We have plenty of options and everyone is different. It will be hard work to get those spots but all the boys are up for the challenge.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435077624822/Nathan-Lyon-and-teammate--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Australian cricketers Nathan Lyon, left, and teammate Peter Siddle enjoy some tea and scones in London as they begin the Ashes countdown.

No alcohol bans or curfews have yet been introduced but Stuart Lancaster said he will take a dim view of any further incidents involving his players.</p> \n<p>Already the head coach has omitted Manu Tuilagi and Dylan Hartley from his squad for disciplinary reasons and is still <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/23/danny-cipriani-england-world-cup-place-drink-drive\" title=\"\">awaiting a police update</a> following Danny Cipriani’s arrest on suspicion of drink-driving after an accident earlier this month. It is understood Cipriani underwent two breath tests that proved inconclusive and police are awaiting the result of a blood sample.</p> \n<p>With the World Cup less than three months away Lancaster could do without any more distractions, regardless of whether Cipriani is charged with any offence. “I think the players know their responsibilities and the consequence of poor behaviour and poor decisions,” he said. “I will be very disappointed if we have to deal with any more of these things but we haven’t talked about any specific ban in any shape or form.”</p> \n<p>The management are keeping an open mind about Cipriani’s case, with the police indicating it may be early August before they decide whether to charge the Sale Sharks fly-half. “I will feel let down if there’s a case to answer but at the end of the day he was involved in an accident from which he hasn’t been charged,” Lancaster said. “Players do have accidents in cars. There is nothing more to say until I know if there is anything he has done wrong in the eyes of the law. He is [confident] but it’s not his decision, is it?”</p> \n<p>However, the fact Lancaster was among the first people Cipriani called after the incident suggested the player was less than totally relaxed about the situation. “He was very concerned,” Lancaster said. “He had just had a great game for the Barbarians and was on his way to get packed to go to the airport [to fly to the United States] and this incident occurred. He was concerned as his first port of call was to ring me. We’ll wait and see whether the police will charge or not and I’ll deal with it as and when it’s appropriate.”</p> \n<p>Lancaster also shed some more light on <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/david-strettle-withdrawing-world-cup-squad\" title=\"\">David Strettle’s abrupt withdrawal</a> from the wider training squad, admitting he would have preferred the wing to have made his decision rather earlier than he did. Strettle’s imminent relocation to Clermont Auvergne from Saracens has caused him to rethink his priorities and he has advised Lancaster he wishes to concentrate on his move to France.</p> \n<p>It is highly likely Lancaster’s comment about favouring players available to him in the longer term in the event of any 50-50 selection decisions also helped make up Strettle’s mind. Either way, Lancaster was clearly not best pleased when the call came. “Obviously I was disappointed. I said to him: ‘Have you thought this through?’ But he had made his decision to withdraw, so as a consequence I was left in no other position than to accept that and look at the next guy.”</p> \n<p>That “next guy” will be Semesa Rokoduguni but the Bath wing is not due back from his native Fiji until later this week and will not join up with his team-mates at their Bagshot training camp before Monday.</p> \n<p>Three other players will also be playing no immediate part, with Alex Goode nursing a hip injury sustained in last month’s Premiership final and the Northampton pair Luther Burrell and Stephen Myler sidelined with toe and knee problems respectively.</p> \n<p>With Mike Brown having played so little rugby following the concussion issues that ruled him out of the latter stages of the domestic season, it is likely <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/26/chris-pennell-worcester-championship-play-off-bristol\" title=\"\">Worcester’s Chris Pennell</a> will be invited to join the camp next week as injury cover should Goode’s return to fitness be further delayed.</p> \n<p>Ben Foden, Tom Croft and Joe Simpson are already set to miss out on England’s two-week training camp in Colorado next month as they continue their recovery from long-term injury. Gloucester’s Ben Morgan is set to travel to Denver having worked hard on his rehabilitation since breaking a leg in January.</p> \n<p>For all concerned, as Lancaster keeps emphasising, it will be no holiday camp over the coming weeks. “Whether they’re at their club or working with England, pre-season is never an enjoyable place.

Or that it is about to happen. Or will happen when Firmino has been probed and prodded with something cold and metallic and has completed his medical. So now we pause for you to get incredibly worked up about the fee (around &pound;29m, if you believe the nose-tappers in the know) for a player you hadn’t heard of until three weeks ago unless you’re one of those dorks who watches football outside of Super Duper Mega Sky Bantz With Jamie’s Jamie And Thierry Sunday. Cool.</p> \n<p>Here’s more of what could be called a thing happening. After <strong>Milan</strong> had their pants pulled right down to their ankles <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/22/internazionale-sign-geoffrey-kondogbia-monaco\">by neighbours Inter over Geoffrey Kondogbia</a>, it looks like they’ve been gazumped again, this time by <strong>Atl&eacute;tico Madrid</strong> for the striker <strong>Jackson Mart&iacute;nez</strong>, with the Colombian set to move from Porto, according to his agent who apologised with the philosophical musing that you “can’t be in two places at once.” Of course this is being spun as a <strong>snub</strong> for Arsenal, despite little suggestion that they were ever really terribly interested in Mart&iacute;nez, or indeed a striker of any stripe. </p> \n<p>Anyway, back to ephemera, and according to whispers in Spain, Manchester United have another suitor for their wayward winger <strong>&Aacute;ngel Di Mar&iacute;a</strong>, purchased last year at great expense but now seemingly on his way out of England in a sack. And that sack has a little tag on it, the sending address reading ‘FC Barcelona, Camp Nou, Camp Nou Mews, 1 Barcelona Street, Barcelona, \n <strike>\n   Spain \n </strike> Cataluyna.’ No postcode though, so it might not get there for a bit. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile, emissaries from Chelsea and Stoke have been meeting over a bowl of chips at the Daventry Harvester (we’re guessing – it’s roughly equidistant between London and Stoke, and they do a fine bowl of chips) <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/chelsea-victor-moses-stoke-asmir-begovic\">to discuss the transfer of <strong>Asmir Begovic</strong></a>, and a solemn air has descended over proceedings. For the party from the Potteries have just made their demands, pausing and adopting a serious tone before saying something like: “Now, if these talks are to continue, we must make clear what we want. As well as the &pound;8m, we have to insist that you include … [dramatic, portentous pause] <strong>Victor Moses</strong> in the deal as well.” To which the Chelsea officials presumably tried not to crack a grin, nodded sagely, looked at each other like <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2012/feb/28/seth-johnson-england\">Seth Johnson and his agent when faced with Peter Ridsdale</a>*, sucked in their teeth, briefly made noises about those being tough terms before finally admitting: “We’re sure we can work something out.” Should that price be just too steep for Chelsea, Stoke are keen on <strong>Yevhen Konoplyanka </strong>to fill one of their wing slots.</p> \n<p>Steve McClaren has barely had time to locate the umbrella rack at Newcastle before cracking out the cheque-book, and according to the ever-infallible word on the street, he’s going to scribble out a big fat one, to the tune of &pound;14m, for QPR’s <strong>Charlie Austin</strong>. Whether Austin himself will want to swap one tin repository for another is another question entirely. Elsewhere in the north east, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/sunderland-offer-psv-georginio-wijnaldum\">Sunderland are going to spend &pound;11m on </a><strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/sunderland-offer-psv-georginio-wijnaldum\">Georginio Wijnaldum</a>, </strong>a thought most depressing for any PSV or indeed Dutch fans out there; you can take it when Manchester United prove too much of a draw for Memphis Depay, but when Sunderland are sashaying away with your best players … eesh. The Mackems, however, haven’t had such luck with a &pound;5m bid for <strong>Stewart Downing</strong>, rejected by West Ham, who themselves will <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/marseille-dimitri-payet-west-ham-contract\">guff &pound;12m on Marseille’s </a><strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/marseille-dimitri-payet-west-ham-contract\">Dimitri Payet</a> </strong>and have told <strong>Andy Carroll</strong> that he ain’t goin’ nowhere, potentially in the form of a mournful country song.</p> \n<p>It’s decision day for<strong> Mo Salah</strong>, who will tell Chelsea of his intentions towards them at some point in the next 24 hours, so stand by your beds for that one, while former Blue <strong>Demba Ba</strong> will turn his nose up at the prospect of mega coin with Shanghai Shenhua in favour of a move to <strong>West Brom</strong>, which is the sort of club/player combo that makes so much sense you have to quickly nip to Wikipedia to double-check it hasn’t already happened.</p> \n<p>Finally, to end on a big, crashing bang, it says here that <strong>Watford</strong> want <strong>Paulinho</strong> from Spurs. BANG!</p> \n<p>*Yes, we know that’s apocryphal.

Konta won emphatically, 6-2, 6-4, to set up a third-round match against Garbi&ntilde;e Muguruza and the margin of victory would have been even greater if she had not suffered a slight but ultimately inconsequential wobble during the second set.</p> \n<p>The Australian-born British No3 even overshadowed Heather Watson, who later went through the full gamut of emotions in her dramatic battle with Elina Svitolina. Watson, overwhelmed by the support from the home crowd, wept tears of joy after edging past the world No17 3-6, 7-5, 6-4 in two hours and 20 minutes of weird and wonderful tennis. “I haven’t really had the best time in the clay-court season and have been finding a few things tough,” Watson said.</p> \n<p>She managed to watch Konta earlier. “I was really, really impressed,” Watson said. “I have always known Jo can play brilliant. I think it’s now finally coming. I’m just really proud of her.”</p> \n<p>To put Konta’s achievement into context, it was not just the finest triumph of her career, but the biggest win by a British female player on home soil since Sam Smith beat Conchita Mart&iacute;nez in the third round of Wimbledon in 1998. Mart&iacute;nez was the world No7 at the time.</p> \n<p>Although Konta has another tough assignment against Muguruza after the world No20 beat Polona Hercog 5-7, 6-3, 6-0, she is on a roll. She reached the quarter-final of the Aegon Open in Nottingham, beating two players in the top 100 along the way, and had already caused a stir in the first round at Eastbourne by quelling the world No34, Zarina Diyas, but few people expected her to be capable of containing Makarova. The Russian has a serious pedigree. Makarova is a former champion here and the fourth seed was a quarter-finalist at Wimbledon last year and has been a semi-finalist at two of the past three grand slams. Konta, by contrast, has only made it past the first round of a major once, at the US Open in 2012.</p> \n<p>Makarova was rarely comfortable. Her first serve spluttered and her left-handed forehand often buckled in the face of relentless returning from Konta, who played well above her ranking of 146th in the world. She never looked back after breaking in the opening game of the match, defending expertly, crunching bullets past Makarova off both wings and winning 78% of her first serves overall. She carved out 12 break points and converted five.</p> \n<p>When Konta broke again to lead 5-2, the feeling grew that an upset was on the cards and she had no trouble holding serve to take the first set with surprising ease. The fight was in danger of disappearing from Makarova when Konta punished a limp second serve to break in the opening game of the second set, only for the mood to shift when the Russian claimed three consecutive games.</p> \n<p>Konta’s ability to deal with adversity shone brightly. She broke to lead 4-3, then dropped her serve, but she was undeterred. She forged ahead again thanks to a piercing backhand and a forehand winner sealed a victory that she will not forget in a hurry.</p> \n<p>Watson had a rockier ride against Svitolina. It was looking grim when she trailed the Ukrainian by a set and a break and she also had to grit her teeth and save several break points at the end of the second set. She clung on, reeled her opponent in and was in control when she led 4-2 in the decider, only to gift Svitolina a break with a double fault.</p> \n<p>Yet Svitolina was struggling with a blister and Watson would not be denied. Her prize is a match against her conqueror at the French Open, the American Sloane Stephens, who beat the fifth seed, Carla Su&aacute;rez Navarro 6-1, 7-5.</p> \n<p>Like Konta and Watson, Bouchard had a spring in her step after the world No12 reached the third round with a 7-6, 6-3 win over Alison Riske. Bouchard, a beaten finalist at Wimbledon last year, has been in a rut lately but now faces Bencic after the 18-year-old’s impressive destruction of Keys, who was playing her first match on grass after a bout of flu last week. Keys lost 6-2, 6-2 and the 20-year-old American headed straight to Wimbledon after relinquishing her grip on the title.</p> \n<p>The top players were in peril. Lucie Safarova, the No3 seed, lost 7-6, 6-4 to Dominika Cibulkova and Angelique Kerber, the No6 seed, withdrew from her match because of a virus, but the unpredictability did not affect Caroline Wozniacki. The No2 seed beat Jarmila Gajdosova 7-6, 6-2 and with the Wimbledon champion and top seed, Petra Kvitova, withdrawing because of illness on Monday, the draw has opened up nicely for Wozniacki.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/23/1435061940955/jo-kontaa-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jo Konta takes the attack to Ekaterina Makarova at Eastbourne.
