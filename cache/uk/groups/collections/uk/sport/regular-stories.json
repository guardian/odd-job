But this preamble comes to you at something close to what might once have been called “chucking out time” here in London, so a good evening it must be.</p> \n<p>And what an evening we have in store! It’s Argentina v Colombia for a place in the Copa America semi-finals, and it couldn’t be set up more tantalisingly.</p> \n<p>To recap, <strong>Argentina</strong> got this far by winning group B with the proverbial Minimum Of Fuss. They began by drawing against Paraguay, but then a lot of people do that; then a Sergio Aguero header saw off their nearest and dearest neighbours, Uruguay; next, Gonzalo Higuain’s early goal was enough to beat Caribbean special guests Jamaica. Has it been convincing? Not really, and we’re yet to see very much of Lionel Messi (although in one of the first things ever to have happened on a football pitch<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/21/lionel-messi-selfie-deshorn-brown-copa-america\"> he’s been in on some hot selfie action</a>), but it’s been comfortable enough and you sense that Gerardo Martino’s side is – much as under Alejandro Sabella at the World Cup last year – equipped with the matchwinners to go a long way even if it doesn’t really sparkle.</p> \n<p>And what of the <strong>Colombians</strong>? All counter-attacking verve and James Rodriguez and gung-ho intent and a bit more James Rodriguez last summer, they haven’t found their rhythm yet. They have, though, beaten Brazil 1-0 – which was the decisive result for them as, losing 1-0 to Venezuela and drawing 0-0 with Peru, they completely failed to shine otherwise. They went through as the second-best of the three third-placed teams, and can probably count themselves a bit lucky.</p> \n<p>The big question tonight will be <strong>“Does Rademel Falcao play?”</strong> Many would, reluctantly, rather that he didn’t. The Colombia captain has completely failed to get into gear so far, in common with his domestic season, and seems to have been cramping their speedy, rapier-sharp style somewhat – perhaps restricting James from feeding through some of his deft little through balls, too. Could – should – we see Carlos Bacca up top?</p> \n<p>Join me for this one (kick-off: 00.30 UK time. Venue: Vina del Mar) anyway, as it should be a belter, and don’t be a stranger either. <strong>If you’ve got a hot take on the evening’s action from the vantage point of your local kebab van, the world needs to know</strong>.</p>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-558da18ce4b0c9bda8d8a73a","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-26T22:33:32Z","body":"<p>Nick Ames will be with you shortly for all the buildup.</p>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-558dd567e4b024248ae9a1c5","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-26T22:43:07Z","body":"<p><strong>There are some articles you must read while waiting for this one. </strong>First, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/26/golden-goal-faustino-asprilla-colombia-argentina-1993\">here is a real treat</a> from my colleague, and the Guardian’s resident Colombian, Euclides Montes.

It is easy, perhaps, to make such an appeal before a game against Brazil. Colombia won that, but after the draw with Peru, the frustration was back and reflected in a bleak sense of realism. “We played badly again,” he said. “When you lose you have to be self-critical and we have to know that if nothing happens we have to take responsibility.”</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-558dd61ce4b0c9bda8d8a7a2","title":"Hearing that Radamel Falcao has indeed been dropped","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-26T22:46:14Z","body":"<p>I’ll get the teams in full to you as soon as possible...</p>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-558dd681e4b0c9bda8d8a7a4","title":"Tonight's teams","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-26T22:49:47Z","body":"<p><strong>Argentina:</strong> Romero; Zabaleta, Garay, Otamendi, Rojo; Pastore, Mascherano, Biglia; Messi, Ag&uuml;ero, Di Mar&iacute;a.</p> \n<p><strong>Colombia:</strong> Ospina; Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, Zapata, Murillo, Arias; Cuadrado, Mej&iacute;a, Ibarbo, James; Jackson, Guti&eacute;rrez.</p> \n<p>There you have it.

It’s Argentina v Colombia for a place in the Copa America semi-finals, and it couldn’t be set up more tantalisingly.</p> \n<p>To recap, <strong>Argentina</strong> got this far by winning group B with the proverbial Minimum Of Fuss. They began by drawing against Paraguay, but then a lot of people do that; then a Sergio Aguero header saw off their nearest and dearest neighbours, Uruguay; next, Gonzalo Higuain’s early goal was enough to beat Caribbean special guests Jamaica. Has it been convincing? Not really, and we’re yet to see very much of Lionel Messi (although in one of the first things ever to have happened on a football pitch<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/21/lionel-messi-selfie-deshorn-brown-copa-america\"> he’s been in on some hot selfie action</a>), but it’s been comfortable enough and you sense that Gerardo Martino’s side is – much as under Alejandro Sabella at the World Cup last year – equipped with the matchwinners to go a long way even if it doesn’t really sparkle.</p> \n<p>And what of the <strong>Colombians</strong>? All counter-attacking verve and James Rodriguez and gung-ho intent and a bit more James Rodriguez last summer, they haven’t found their rhythm yet. They have, though, beaten Brazil 1-0 – which was the decisive result for them as, losing 1-0 to Venezuela and drawing 0-0 with Peru, they completely failed to shine otherwise. They went through as the second-best of the three third-placed teams, and can probably count themselves a bit lucky.</p> \n<p>The big question tonight will be <strong>“Does Rademel Falcao play?”</strong> Many would, reluctantly, rather that he didn’t. The Colombia captain has completely failed to get into gear so far, in common with his domestic season, and seems to have been cramping their speedy, rapier-sharp style somewhat – perhaps restricting James from feeding through some of his deft little through balls, too.

I don’t think any of the players hate each other but some still get on better with some than others. There’s a lot of respect between all of them. Whether they go out to dinner together is a different story …”</p> \n<p>There is a widely shared view in the game that a booking for two at San Remo for Messrs Federer and Djokovic is highly unlikely. It is also accepted that Murray has no problems with Federer or Rafa Nadal but there is a suspicion that he is at least serially irritated by some of Djokovic’s gamesmanship, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/feb/01/andy-murray-novak-djokovic-australian-open-final\">most notoriously in the final of the Australian Open this year</a>, and briefly <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/06/novak-djokovic-beats-andy-murray-french-open-semi\">in this month’s semi‑final at Roland Garros</a> – although the Scot was at pains the second time to downplay a rift.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/26/rafael-nadal-wimbledon-2015-injuries-beautiful\">As Nadal has said</a>, there is little profit in it for a player to have a running feud with someone who is a regular rival, as it creates unnecessary tension away from the court.</p> \n<p>Still, the 2015 Wimbledon championship already has another dimension, a spark yet to be ignited, between the best player in the world and the one who was just that for so long and is now the game’s the game’s 33-year-old <em>grand seigneur</em>.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the row, imagined or not, has achieved what Becker intended when he asked in his book: “So, should these two role models be more openly aggressive? Is it good for tennis that they maintain this dignified respect that covers up for any antipathy?”</p> \n<p>As Djokovic’s coach, one would imagine Becker is speaking from at least an informed platform. It was, nonetheless, a real eyebrow lifter that rippled through the locker room all the way up to Federer, father of four and darling of millions, who thought Becker impertinent to make such a suggestion.</p> \n<p>As the draw dictates, it is a “row” that could be settled on court only in the final, as they are charging at each other from different sides of the draw.</p> \n<p>Murray, meanwhile, has much to distract him: an opening round match against Mikhail Kukushkin, the 58th-ranked Kazakh he has beaten twice, the last time for the loss of three games in two-and-a-bit sets before a retirement in the third round of the 2012 Australian Open.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/26/rafael-nadal-wimbledon-2015-injuries-beautiful\">Rafael Nadal in warrior mentality for Wimbledon: ‘I am very motivated’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The world No3, seeded third behind Djokovic and Federer, will never have arrived at Wimbledon in better shape, physically and mentally. It is a wonder, when he looks back, that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/07/andy-murray-wimbledon-2013-novak-djokovic\">he won the title in 2013</a> with a back held together by painkillers and bloody-mindedness. He grimaced through his triumph then; he allows himself the occasional smile now.</p> \n<p>“It was hard for a few reasons [after Ivan Lendl left his team in March last year]. Changing coaches is tough, but coming back from surgery I found hard as well.</p> \n<p>“My back still hurt after the surgery. I thought at the time: ‘You have the surgery and when you start again you might struggle for a little while but then you’re body would feel OK.’ For me, it wasn’t the case. My back still hurt and I was worried about that as well. When I won Wimbledon, it was great and that does make you happy.</p> \n<p>“But a lot of the time I was playing I was in pain. So I wasn’t enjoying practising. I wasn’t hating tennis, and I don’t know if resentful is the right word but, when I stepped on the court, it was causing me pain – and I wasn’t actually enjoying that.</p> \n<p>“Now, I love practising, love going in the gym, love training hard. For a while when I was having problems with my back, I wasn’t enjoying it.</p> \n<p>“Also, I was just getting a better perspective on things: that tennis isn’t the only thing. You don’t have to win every single week – because, if you go in with that mindset, you’re never happy. If you expect to win every week then, when you do win, well, that’s what you expected. Whereas if you just lower the expectations a little bit, it makes you enjoy the game a bit more.”</p> \n<p>A more philosophical Murray also looks a more dangerous one. He is in blinding form, carrying his new-found confidence on clay over to the grass in spectacular fashion at Queen’s last week, when he beat such a variety of styles on one day <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/21/andy-murray-viktor-troicki-queens\">in Viktor Stoicki </a>and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/21/andy-murray-kevin-anderson-queens-title\">then Kevin Anderson </a>to win his fourth Aegon Championship title that he was giving a masterclass across all the disciplines.</p> \n<p>Now, though, he steps up to the bigger stage. And there it is invariably a discussion between the Big Four, however slightly diminished that brand is. Is it changing irrevocably? “I wouldn’t say it’s quite the same as it was,” Murray says. “At different stages, people wanted to write [us off] ... apart from Novak – he hasn’t really had any injuries or dips in form.</p> \n<p>“Roger for a while [did], like the year he lost to Stakhovsky at Wimbledon, and when the US Open was over for him as well. Rafa, just now, a lot of people are saying he isn’t the same and he is not going to come back. I had the same thing last year as well.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/26/serena-williams-wimbledon-grand-slam\">Will Wimbledon be step or stumble on Serena Williams’ historic march? | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“There are more guys who can win now, for sure. It’s definitely a lot more open than what it was. But I don’t think that any one of the guys you mention are close to being done at the top level. But guys catch up.”</p> \n<p>In that context, was there any professional warmth directed towards Stan Wawrinka, one of the game’s nice guys, when he upset Djokovic to win the French Open? “I don’t know,” Murray says. “I hadn’t really thought about it that way. Maybe psychologically for the Tour it was important. I remember in Rome earlier in the year, they had a players’ draw outside the locker room and, before the tournament had even started, someone had just written Djokovic’s name in the winner’s space.</p> \n<p>“Stan winning in the final was a huge upset but also showed in those matches that Novak can be beaten. Granted, Stan played an incredible match, but it can be done.”</p> \n<p>There can be little doubt that Becker has ensured that one player as much as any of the young pretenders will be straining at the edge of his age‑refined talent to do it again if he gets the opportunity and take an eighth Wimbledon title.</p> \n<p><em>Performance training brand Under Armour supports Andy Murray.

However, Murray, who at 28 is in the best pre-tournament form of his career, must start well on Tuesday against Mikhail Kukushkin, 55 places below him in the rankings and who has won just one set in six matches against him. They at least share an affinity with women coaches, Murray guided by Am&eacute;lie Mauresmo, and the Kazak by his wife, Anastasia Kukushkina.</p> \n<p>Murray said of Kukushkin: “He’s a good player. He’s had some big tournaments in the past. He played Rafa pretty close here last year. He can play well on the grass, predominantly from the baseline. He’s a good ball-striker. If you give him time to dictate the points, he’s a tough guy to beat.”</p> \n<p>The draw fell with reasonable kindness for the Scot on Friday, more so, perhaps, than for Djokovic: the defending champion and favourite has his path to the final potentially blocked by the man who beat him in the French Open final this month, Stan Wawrinka.</p> \n<p>Murray’s schedule could pan out like this: Kukushkin, the Dutchman Robin Haase, the in-form Italian Andreas Seppi or the boxing-mad Croatian teenager Borna Coric (who beat him Dubai this year), followed in the fourth round by perhaps Gilles M&uuml;ller – if the Luxembourg veteran can work his way through the first week after a first-round match against the injured Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.</p> \n<p>Nadal, twice champion, is seeded 10th but has put behind him his quarter-final defeat by Djokovic at Roland Garros and could do better than the doom merchants predict. The 29-year-old should account for the Brazilian clay-courter Thomaz Bellucci then Taiwan’s Yen-Hsun Lu before a third-round match against either Viktor Troicki, who injured his left shoulder in the Queen’s semi-final against Murray, or Great Britain’s latest acquisition, Aljaz Bedene, who has the tour-toughened Czech Radek Stepanek in the first round.</p> \n<p>For Federer, Wimbledon seems an endless odyssey, full of glorious possibilities, and this year is no different for the 33-year-old Swiss, who comes off another tournament win in Halle and has legitimate ambitions of making the final two years in a row.</p> \n<p>He has drawn first-up the 23-year-old Bosnian Damir Dzumhur, whom he beat comfortably in the fourth round in the French Open. Thereafter, there could be the Americans Sam Querrey and Jack Sock before the cultured Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut, then the sixth seed, Tomas Berdych, in the quarters. It is a challenging but not daunting assignment.</p> \n<p>The clear favourite, however, remains Djokovic – even after his spirit-sapping loss to Wawrinka in Paris. If the excellent German Philipp Kohlschreiber does not catch him cold in the first round, the Serb could face three Australians in a row – Lleyton Hewitt in his Wimbledon farewell, Bernard Tomic and Thanasi Kokkinakis – before the quarters. The seedings suggest he will meet Kei Nishikori there but the US Open finalist had to quit with a leg injury in Halle and may not get past John Isner in the fourth round.</p> \n<p>And waiting for Djokovic in the semi-finals … could it be Wawrinka again?</p> \n<p>The Swiss lost four tie-breaks in a row, in singles and doubles, to go out early at Queen’s but his confidence is sky-high. His most threatening antagonists in a campaign to get past the quarters here for the first time are probably going to be young Dominic Thiem, David Goffin and Grigor Dimitrov – all exciting shot-makers and thus vulnerable to the fourth seed’s muscular back-court tennis.</p> \n<p>Among the other British men, James Ward has drawn David Ferrer first up, in-form wildcard Kyle Edmund, struck down by a stomach muscle injury in Paris, plays Aleksandr Dolgopolov, The Australian-born Brydan Klein will do well to take a set off Seppi, seeded 25, and the remaining wildcard, Liam Broady, will have a fight on his hands against the combative Australian Marinko Matosevic.</p> \n<p>In the women’s draw, Johanna Konta has the thrill and the fear of playing Maria Sharapova in the first round on Monday – a challenge any good player would embrace. Konta, a diffident under-performer in the past ranked 146 in the world, arrives on a wave of decent hope, taking world No12 Karolina Pliskova to three sets in Birmingham before lighting up her south coast neighbourhood with the best win of her career, against the world No8, Ekaterina Makarova.</p> \n<p>The other British women have less glamorous but similarly difficult assignments in the early rounds. British No1 Heather Watson, still searching for her best form, will have to be on song to beat Caroline Garcia, the wildcard Naomi Broady could do well against the Colombian Mariana Duque-Mari&ntilde;o, but the 14th seed, Andrea Petkovic, awaits her in the second round.</p> \n<p>And Laura Robson, returning to tennis after 17 months out with a wrist then a recent hamstring injury, has a wildcard that pitches her against Evgeniya Rodina, the Russian who gave Watson a two-hour, three-set fight in Miami this year. Beyond that, there will be Jelena Jankovic and almost certainly the world No2, Petra Kvitova – so this could be a short return for the former British world No1.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457280601__\n</div>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435307551599/Andy-Murray-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray pictured in action at Wimbledon in July 2014.

If anything, the Spaniard, who has tumbled to 10th in the world shortly after his 29th birthday and is lightly regarded among many observers as a genuine threat to unseat Novak Djokovic here, appears to have left the battle smoke of Paris behind him with more equanimity than anyone could have imagined.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/26/rafael-nadal-wimbledon-2010-2014\">Rafael Nadal’s Wimbledon journey: from 2010 champion to three early exits</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Still, it has been a minor nightmare of a summer for Nadal, pre-eminent on clay yet losing five times on the European dirt, with Djokovic rubbing it in at Roland Garros in the quarter-finals. Does going through this sort of a slump renew his hunger or feed his anxiety, I wondered? “I have the best motivation: to be back where I was. And I’m gonna work for it.”</p> \n<p>He will, of course. Nadal’s career, even at its peak, has been about struggle, intensity, sweat – as opposed to the player alongside whom he has driven towards greatness, Roger Federer. The Swiss, in stark contrast, arrives here lightly and smiling at 33, with all the twins in tow, to make another quiet raid on his favourite tournament.</p> \n<p>During a break in the US Open a few years ago, American television showed slow-motion clips of just the feet of Nadal and Federer as they moved side to side along the baseline. Nadal, almost defying the slo-mo, was the quick-stepping boxer, all tightly sprung energy; the Swiss was a ballet dancer, the very picture of floating, effortless menace. Nadal seems to have to fight like that boxer every day; Federer is forced from his choreographed elegance only in extremis.</p> \n<p>As William Skidelsky observes in his eccentric, engaging love letter to Nadal’s Swiss opposite, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/293296/s/federer-and-me/\" title=\"\">Federer and Me: a Story of Obsession</a>: “The Spaniard is sometimes compared to a capybara, the buck-toothed South American rodent but, while it’s true that there’s a striking visual resemblance, strategically he’s more of a boa constrictor: instead of swiftly dispatching his victims, he subjects them to a drawn-out asphyxiation.”</p> \n<p>Apart from the cruel metaphor, it is a notion with which Nadal would not violently disagree.</p> \n<p>“Everybody is different, yes,” he says. “I’m not sure about the word ‘talent’, because everything is a talent. He has a different talent to me.</p> \n<p>“It is obvious that he hits the ball easier than me, he serves better than me and he is able to do the things easier than what I do. So his talent is much better there.</p> \n<p>“But I have talent too – to be there. I have the talent to put one more ball inside. I have the talent to play with a good level a lot of hours in a row. That is what I did during my whole career. And I have the talent to not miss much, and to come back from very tough positions, to be in a defensive position and pass very quickly to an aggressive position. His style is completely different to mine. Probably that makes the rivalry special.”</p> \n<p>The only point at which they could engage for a 34th time would be in the semi-finals. It is unlikely, and a blow for nostalgics. If they do meet, it will be business not sentiment that informs their work. They are, as Andy Murray has said of his relationship with Djokovic, “professional friends”. And Nadal had not heard of Federer’s sceptical response last week to Boris Becker’s claim in his latest book that the leading players pretend too much to like each other, a feeling the German regarded as implausible.</p> \n<p>“I had not read that. My point of view is that what happens outside the court isn’t going to have a big impact on what’s going to happen on court.</p> \n<p>“But it is difficult to be very good friends, because at the end of the day, the best friends are the ones who know you since you were a kid. They are my real friends. At the same time, it is good to respect everyone, to have a good relationship, even if you are not best friends.</p> \n<p>“For me it is important to have a good relationship with the people you are going to be with every week on the Tour. It’s a bad feeling if you go in the locker room, look around you and you don’t have a good relationship with them. A lot of people, they see maybe another point of view: more drastic, more dramatic, that everybody is a rival. For me, tennis is very important but not the most important thing in life.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/tennis-zip/giv-21277Ieyk7vRIIlIS\" data-alt=\"Guardian graphics\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/tennis-zip/giv-21277Ieyk7vRIIlIS\">Guardian graphics</a> \n</figure> \n<p>On his return to Wimbledon, taking in the glorious greenness of it all, the mere playing of tennis, a sport he loves and is so good at, surely must seem like the best job in the world. Yet with glory and fame has come angst and suffering, the baggage of defeat and serial injury. With 14 majors in the bag and enough money to last several lifetimes, is it still worth it?</p> \n<p>“You compete every day. A lot of players on Tour have injuries, so that makes the sport tough … but at the same time beautiful.” This is warrior language. Nadal, perhaps in a Catholic way, embraces pain as the price for his gifts. Federer, meanwhile, has not had pain as a constant travelling companion. He has had the freedom to be an artist.</p> \n<p>“There are tougher things in life,” Nadal says of his calling, “and everybody on the ATP Tour knows we are very lucky people.”</p> \n<p>When a Madrid specialist told the Spanish teenager in 2004 that he had a deformed tarsal scaphoid bone on the bridge of his left foot and that he might never play again, he was shattered to the point of breakdown, according to his autobiography: “I’d lie for hours on the end on the sofa staring into space, or sit in the bathroom or on the stairs, weeping. I didn’t laugh, I&nbsp;didn’t smile, I didn’t want to talk. I&nbsp;lost all appetite for life.”</p> \n<p>That image of despair is hard to equate with the atomic energy he still brings to the court. He has done so over the years, however, with a built-up shoe that checked the original foot problem, transferring it to his knees, wrists and elbows and building a dark forest of vulnerable places in his muscled body, like the ones Federer finds when placing his spots on serve against him, shifting the point of doubt and hurt.</p> \n<p>“I had the past couple of years some dark periods of time [six months away from playing with a wrist injury, then an appendectomy]. People talk a lot about injuries in my career but from 2005 to 2011, the injuries that I had didn’t stop me for enough time to go out from the top positions of the rankings, so I feel good about that. Some players get more injuries than others. That’s part of our life. Some players are not lucky with that, lucky with other things. I had some bad moments, a lot of very good moments. If you put everything in balance, much more positive than bad. I&nbsp;am fine now.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99318da99b800ffeafe2f391943f23b3a681d91f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435330075086/982fb95f-36bb-4471-8e96-3df76ef95b2e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Wimbledon 2008: Rafael Nadal with the Wimbledon men's singles trophy after defeating Roger Federer in an epic match\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wimbledon 2008: Rafael Nadal with the Wimbledon men’s singles trophy after defeating Roger Federer in an epic match.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For someone with a lucrative watch sponsorship, Nadal and time don’t always click. (This is our fourth attempt to talk in three months. Defeat in Monte Carlo nixed the first one. Then there was Paris, ditto but worse. And Queen’s&nbsp;…) But he is fiercely devoted to his training schedule and arrives on the players’ terrace glowing from another encouraging workout on the practice courts, accommodating but focused.</p> \n<p>He had arrived in London from Mallorca midweek and headed straight for the shops to stock up for the fortnight in his rented house. Anyone who spotted a former two-times champion at the All England Club roaming the shelves for cornflakes in Wimbledon that day might have thought they had walked in on a photoshoot, but Nadal likes to stay rooted. It has kept him humble, which is not easy if you’ve earned $73m in prize money over 14 years, alongside endorsements and other deals that placed him 22nd on the Forbes Magazine list of the world’s best paid athletes in the year ending this&nbsp;month.</p> \n<p>One detailed breakdown of his career earnings puts his net worth at about $125m.</p> \n<p>Addressing that privilege, Nadal has had a foundation for eight years, inspired by his mother, Ana Mar&iacute;a.</p> \n<p>“When I was a kid, my mam was always great helping people. I saw when I was young she was always to send money to different places for the kids. Talking with her, we decided to create a&nbsp;foundation.”</p> \n<p>They began in Anantapur in India, among the <em>dalits</em>, or untouchables, and spread later to Barcelona, Zaragoza and Andaluc&iacute;a. “We aren’t going to change much but if all the people who have a lucky, privileged life can help a little bit then that is a lot of help. My foundation tries to help kids at risk of exclusion from society.”</p> \n<p>Now he is taking the project home to Mallorca. “I feel very lucky all the things that I have, all the things that happen to me. So it’s just a small way to give back something. It’s a big project for me, with 25 tennis courts and places for the kids to live, with a school too, and a big gym, small football stadium, different sports, some indoor courts. It’s something that’s going to be part of my future, a lot of work. But I have the motivation. I love sport in general … And I love tennis.”</p> \n<p>Did he never get tired of tennis? He did say at the O<sub>2</sub> finals in 2011 – not one of his easiest campaigns – that he had “lost the passion” for it …</p> \n<p>“That was a good but at the same time a very tough season. I lost a lot of finals. I lost the final in Indian Wells, I lost the final in Miami, I lost the final in Madrid, I lost the final in Rome, I won Roland Garros, but I lost the final here, I lost the final of the US Open. So, yes, you’re right. At the end of the season, you lose a little bit intensity, you lose a&nbsp;little bit of passion for the game. But, mentally, I got it back. I played Davis Cup in Spain. We won the final – and I&nbsp;started 2012 very well.”</p> \n<p>So, was winning the spur to carrying on? “What drives me every day is the work. It is important to achieve goals, even if they are not big goals. You have to achieve the small objectives too. Winning? … In sport the victory is … ”</p> \n<p>Everything? “Ha! No, not everything. But it’s very, very important. People only remember the victories. Our sport is not a sport of losses. You can lose hundreds of times, but the people only gonna remember the victories.”</p> \n<p>But in some ways those who don’t win all the time do not have that pressure, no? He pauses. The right eyebrow goes north in sync with his closed mouth, as if dragged upward in wonder.</p> \n<p>“It is obvious that the pressure for the top players to win almost every single match is completely different for the players a little bit lower ranked. But, at the end of the day, everybody wants to win. Every match is very competitive.”</p> \n<p>Yet losing to Nick Kyrgios here in the fourth round last year must have left at least a small psychic bruise.

It is important to adapt your tennis, your mental condition, to those different moments.”</p> \n<p>What is it like, then, going out to play these other great players, week after week: there he is again, that pesky Djokovic? Is there not a history that builds up?</p> \n<p>“Yes, but at the same time … every moment in the year is different, every moment in your career is different. Every match depends on how [each player] arrives at that match.”</p> \n<p>How did he cope with losing in Paris, then?</p> \n<p>“It was less tough than in 2009 [when his parents separated and his tennis lurched this way and that]. I know that can happen – and it happened. I competed for one hour and 30 [minutes], and that is not enough to win against Novak. This season there have been more ups and downs, but the last couple of months I am playing better. And I intend to continue like this.</p> \n<p>“It is not easy: six months, nearly, without playing tennis last year, injury. I lost a few matches this year that I shouldn’t have. When that happens a few times, it affects your confidence. When you come back from injury, it is important to win those matches that you can win or lose, to bring your confidence again and to feel that you are strong again.”</p> \n<p>He runs through all his losses, in details with scores, and sighs as he says, “So there were a lot of matches that I should win: one week ago [against Alexandr Dolgopolov in the first round at Queen’s] 4-3 and serving with break in the first … If you are able to win these matches, the year changes and you have the chances to be in a better position in the ranking. You accept that, and when you change that, you are there again.”</p> \n<p>So, can Wimbledon, the place of some of his finest hours and lowest moments, inspire him to halt the slide?</p> \n<p>“On grass, every match is dangerous, every player is dangerous. If you play well, if you find the real rhythm, you can have a lot of fun. It is a feeling I have had a few years here in my career. It is very special. Obviously it is more difficult not being seeded top four. I am seed 10 because I didn’t play well enough and because I was out injured for six months last year. I am where I deserve to be now, and I hoped to be in a higher position back here. I am going to work for that, but what gonna happen gonna happen. I need to do it my way.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435329697237/Rafael-Nadal-at-Queens-Cl-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rafael Nadal at Queen's Club in London.

He was one victory away from completing the career grand slam and, if everything went according to plan against Stan Wawrinka in the final, the world No1 would also be a step closer to becoming the first man to sweep all four majors in a calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969. Everything did not go according to plan.</p> \n<p>Djokovic’s tears <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/french-open-2015-stanislas-wawrinka-novak-djokovic-win\" title=\"\">after losing to Wawrinka </a>do not automatically mean that alarm bells should be blaring inside Serena Williams’s head as she attempts to complete the third leg of what many experts expect to be the first calendar slam in women’s tennis since a 19‑year‑old Steffi Graf ruled the sport in 1988 (the German also won gold at the Seoul Olympics to claim the golden slam). Yet they were a reminder that nothing is set in stone in this game, even when something looks like destiny.</p> \n<p>Williams is in an enviable but fragile position. The glory on offer over the next three months could spark her game; yet the thought of failure – relatively speaking – could choke her.</p> \n<p>She is the overwhelming favourite at Wimbledon and, if she succeeds at SW19 again, the world No1 will need only to win the US Open for the fourth consecutive year to equal Graf’s record of 22 grand slam titles in the open era and complete the calendar slam.</p> \n<p>Williams has already completed the “Serena slam”, holding all four majors simultaneously after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2003/jan/26/tennis.australianopen2003\" title=\"\">winning the Australian Open in 2003</a>, but this is unlikely to be straightforward. Early defeats <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jun/28/serena-williams-wimbledon-exit-alize-cornet\" title=\"\">by Aliz&eacute; Cornet</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/01/serena-williams-sabine-lisicki-wimbledon\" title=\"\">Sabine Lisicki</a> at Wimbledon in the past two years are red flags, as was the tangle she got herself into in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/06/serena-williams-safarova-french-open-20th-grand-slam-title\" title=\"\">her win over Lucie Safarova in the French Open final</a>. After letting a 6-3, 4-1, 40-15 lead slip to allow Safarova into what transpired to be a one-sided deciding set, Williams admitted she was affected by the pressure of winning her 20th major.</p> \n<p>Observers have suggested the US Open will be a formality if Williams wins Wimbledon, given she has won the past three titles in New York. But Graf was almost crushed by the weight of history at Flushing Meadows. “I remember above all the extreme fatigue I felt in New York,” Graf told L’Equipe recently. “I was feeling the expectation around me that wasn’t mine and that was becoming suffocating. It was terrible.”</p> \n<p>Jo Durie, the former British No1 who ended her career with a 4-3 winning record over Graf, argues that the greatest impediment to Williams could be, well, Serena Williams. There is a feeling that she is so much stronger than her rivals that she sometimes loses concentration and some of her finals in recent years have been closer than anticipated.</p> \n<p>“Maybe sometimes she’s almost trying too hard to do it and gets herself into a bit of frenzy almost on court,” Durie says. “Some of the time it’s not how her opponents play but how she’s battling herself. You still have to play well against her. Cornet beat her going for it, Lisicki did. You have to go at Serena and you have to keep it going because she will come back at you with a vengeance. Mixed up in that is the battle against herself, which you can see very plainly sometimes. She’s almost crying with frustration that she’s not playing as well as she thinks she ought to.”</p> \n<p>The differences in the surfaces these days make the calendar slam harder to pull off. The quick switch from the clay of Roland Garros to the grass of Wimbledon has been the downfall of many. Durie points out that three of the slam tournaments were once on grass.</p> \n<p>Those who remember Graf reckon that she was a touch more consistent than Williams. There have been times when the American has not been totally enamoured with the game but it should not be forgotten that four days after winning Wimbledon in 2010 she <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2010/sep/03/serena-williams-silence-tendon-injury\" title=\"\">stepped on a piece of glass in a Munich restaurant </a>and suffered a haematoma and a pulmonary embolism that nearly ended not only her career but her life. To recover from that encapsulates her greatness.</p> \n<p>Graf was special too. “Nobody could touch Steffi,” Durie says. “We had this bit of fun between us that, if you could last an hour against Steffi, you sort of got a cheer as you went back in the locker room. I remember playing her when she was that good and managing to get past the hour mark. She was just so far above everybody else.”</p> \n<p>Martina Hingis, who almost emulated Graf in 1997, rates Williams as the toughest opponent of her career. “She was the player I least liked to play against,” Hingis says. “It was hard to read her serve and she came up with the best when she was down, with danger.”</p> \n<p>Yet the argument against ranking Williams as the greatest of all time is that her rivals have not pushed her hard enough. There is inconsistency within the top 10. Williams has the measure of Maria Sharapova, the other great champion of this era, while Victoria Azarenka, the former world No1, has slipped down the rankings after struggling with injuries since winning her second Australian Open title in 2013.</p> \n<p>“I think the depth is wider today but the top 10 was more stable in our time,” Hingis says. “When you look at the top 10, you could really see the difference between the top 10 or five players more than you see today. It’s been changing and they haven’t been as imposing.”</p> \n<p>In 1997 Hingis won three majors but lost the French Open final to Iva Majoli. “I was unbeaten, you think you’re a little bit unbeatable,” Hingis says.</p> \n<p>As Djokovic discovered in Paris, the unbeaten run can end quickly.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435336661908/Serena-Williams-at-Wimble-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Serena Williams, seen here during her fourth-round elimination by Sabine Lisicki in 2013, has suffered surprise early defeats in her last two visits to WImbledon.

Although it’s been a difficult time, I asked Alberto to respond to the allegations made against him and he has now done so in full.</p> \n<p>“As someone I’ve worked with for many years, I feel I have to believe in Alberto and the evidence he has provided. Based on that evidence, I will continue to work with him and hope now that I can focus on what I do best – training hard to win medals for my country.”</p> \n<p>Salazar, meanwhile, has been in Eugene in Oregon where he watched Farah’s training partner Galen Rupp – who the BBC has accused of taking testosterone when he was a 16-year-old – win the 10,000m at the US trials for the seventh consecutive year.</p> \n<p>Speaking in public for the first time since the Panorama documentary, Salazar said he was “feeling good” despite the allegations swimming around him and confirmed that Barry Fudge, the head of endurance for British Athletics, was carrying out his instructions while Farah trains in Font–Romeu in France. “I speak to Barry every day,” Salazar added.</p> \n<p>However he ruled out legal action against the BBC and ProPublica, adding: “I’m not a vindictive person.” Instead he insisted he wanted to return his focus to his athletes. “It’s good to get back to racing,” he added. “The last couple of months have been tough. When you’re accused of horrible stuff, and you know you’re innocent, that’s a lot of stress. After getting my statement out, I feel much better.”</p> \n<p>There is no suggestion that Farah has done anything wrong since joining up with Salazar in 2011. But he has inevitably been drawn into the whirlpool of allegations surrounding his coach and training partner Rupp.</p> \n<p>Last week Farah insisted he had never taken performance-enhancing drugs and said his two missed tests before London 2012 were the only ones of his career. It is understood by the Guardian that Farah told anti-doping chiefs he was asleep when he failed to hear the doorbell during his second missed test in 2011.</p> \n<p>In a careful worded statement, UK Athletics said it “noted and respected” Farah’s decision.

A sweaty cat’s cradle of arms and Dictaphones strained to get closer, but only those nearest heard the pledge that will be broadcast repeatedly if the smoke swirling around Rupp and his coach Alberto Salazar erupts into fire. “I believe in clean sport and I believe the truth will prevail.”</p> \n<p>Moments earlier, Rupp – a silver medallist at London 2012 and a training partner of Mo Farah – had found his feet to win his seventh consecutive US 10,000m championships. Finding his voice took longer. But nervously, hesitantly, he rediscovered it.</p> \n<p>“The people here are so great,” he said, when asked about the standing ovation he received after crossing the line. “The support has been tremendous. I was obviously pleased to get another championship and to do it here in Eugene, it’s always special.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/26/mo-farah-continue-working-with-alberto-salazar\">Mo Farah: ‘I want to make it clear – I will continue working with Alberto Salazar’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This was Rupp’s first race since a BBC Panorama documentary accused him of stretching and snapping anti-doping rules. But back at Hayward Field, where he ran in college for Oregon, he was greeted as more of a homecoming hero than someone fighting to remove a stain against his name.</p> \n<p>Not everyone was cheering. One coach, who did not want to be named, feared the allegations were “the tip of the iceberg” and said USA Track and Field had not done enough to investigate. Not that he was surprised. “Look around you at the billboards,” he said. “And ask yourself who sponsors this championship and Alberto?”</p> \n<p>Along the back straight there was a ready answer: a Nike.com/running sign was stapled to a USA Track and Field one.</p> \n<p>Earlier, while other athletes warmed up in the practice field or had their muscles shaken into life on one of 28 massage tables, Rupp limbered up in private. Only when the final call for registrations crackled through on the public address system did he trot over to Salazar for final instructions. He then crossed himself twice before hugging the man he sees as a second father.</p> \n<p>As Rupp went to the start, Salazar spoke for the first time since being accused of giving Rupp testosterone as a 16-year-old. He insisted he was “feeling good” despite the allegations swimming around him and ruled out legal action against the BBC and the US news website ProPublica, adding: “I’m not a vindictive person.” Despite Salazar’s upbeat words, his face told a different story. It looked tired and withdrawn. Apparently his blood pressure has been through the roof, which is not good for someone whose determination to be the greatest distance athlete of his age – and arguably he was in the early 80s – has left him with health problems. Remember, too, that he was clinically dead for 14 minutes after suffering a heart attack in 2007.</p> \n<p>But Salazar lives and breathes every race that Rupp enters and watching his friend from the corporate hospitality area proved a sprightly pick-me-up. There were shouts of lap splits and encouragement, including a happy cry of “Let’s go, Galen!” as his athlete powered clear to victory in the final kilometre.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"21dab603a8389fca1a081eece6318bc3ec33d27e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435348001477/75d43b4b-d6c9-46c2-ad75-469ab354f1a2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alberto Salazar\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alberto Salazar looks on at Eugene before the start of the men’s 10,00m.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don Ryan/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was an impressive performance, especially in conditions more like a steam room. But while Rupp was being photographed hugging his baby twins, the second-placed athlete, Ben True, was explaining why he had a very different ethos from his Nike Oregon Project rival.</p> \n<p>“Allegations are allegations and rumours are rumours but I am very much against doping,” he said. “Use of therapeutic use exemptions, legal or not, are against the spirit of the sport. I don’t even take ibuprofen. I don’t drink recovery drinks. I have Gatorade maybe twice a year. I take acidophilus now and again and vitamin D in the winter. But I don’t even eat energy bars.”</p> \n<p>Elsewhere on the first of four days at these US Trials, Dee Dee Trotter – the 400m bronze medallist at London 2012 and founder of Test Me I’m Clean, which promotes drug-free sport – called for a renewed push to stop people cheating or playing the system.</p> \n<p>“I think drugs in the sport are devastating,” she said. “It’s a tragedy for the hardworking athletes like myself, I consider it to be similar to crime. When you cheat you’re taking something from the person behind you.”</p> \n<p>When asked if sport was winning the fight, her answer brought to mind an unending tango between right and wrong, testers and cheats. “I think drugs in the sport are continuing,” she said. “You think we’re getting better then we take two steps forward and two steps back.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, in the mixed zone interview area, Rupp had moved from the press scrum to the TV cameras and was repeating a familiar mantra. “I believe in clean sport and I believe the truth will prevail.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/26/1435347907288/Galen-Rupp-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Galen Rupp crosses the finish line to win the 10,000m at the USA Outdoor Track & Field Championships.

But then he, too, appears taken by the general wave of optimism that has engulfed the sport this summer.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/26/alastair-cook-england-ashes-australia-test\">Alastair Cook, England’s last great red-ball duke, prepares for Ashes stage | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It could have been so different. At 30 for four on the first day of the Lord’s Test against New Zealand in May, the prevailing sense – despite the tourists winning the toss and putting on an exhibition of high-quality swing bowling – was one of dread. Exultations of “here we go again” flowed down the timelines on social media, still scarred by a year and a half of turmoil that began with an Ashes whitewash in Australia, morphed into a summer dominated by Kevin Pietersen headlines and hit rock-bottom with a hopeless World Cup campaign.</p> \n<p>But two of England’s young thrusters responded that day, with Joe Root and Ben Stokes putting on a counterattacking stand of 161 that drove England into a position of strength from which the Test match was ultimately won. Disappointment followed in a series-levelling 199-run defeat in Leeds but the one-dayers – so often the unloved fag end of a tour – proved revolutionary, with Eoin Morgan’s side continuing the unshackling in a 3-2 win that was capped off by victory in the one-off Twenty20 at Old Trafford.</p> \n<p>Cook, who no longer features in England’s white-ball cricket but appears to have rediscovered his form with the bat in whites, followed those later events from afar and believes that initial response from his newly installed vice-captain and gun all-rounder in the first Test at Lord’s was the catalyst. “That was the real defining point so far of the summer, those two guys going out and playing like that,” he said.</p> \n<p>“We spoke at the beginning of the summer about showing off your talent. I think that message has gone through into the one-dayers as well. The support we’re getting from people is a different kind of support from what I have ever experienced throughout my eight or nine years. That general optimism and excitement about English cricket hasn’t happened in the last 15 months.”</p> \n<p>Cook is quick to point out that, with no disrespect towards New Zealand intended, Australia and the pressure-cooker environment of Ashes cricket presents a tougher challenge when it comes to continuing the intent shown thus far. Asked if such an approach was possible against Michael Clarke’s side, he replied: “I think so. The challenge of that is sticking true to that under the pressure of a bigger series. I think we can. All we’re asking is for people to play their natural way.</p> \n<p>“We talked at the start of the summer about showcasing our talent and playing the way you want to play and having that belief and confidence backed by the support staff and other players. If you want to score at six an over, you go and do that. We will back you 100%. People like Mo Ali, Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes, Joe Root, they are looking to take attack to the opposition and that’s when they play their best. We want to see people do that.”</p> \n<p>Aggression has been one of the buzz words of the season. Against New Zealand it meant two sides going hammer and tongs at each other without ever spilling into animosity. David Boon, the match referee for the Test series, and Javagal Srinath, who took over during the one-dayers, could not have been less troubled and yet Australia’s arrival – judging by their boorish behaviour in the World Cup final – may see whoever takes their place for the Ashes somewhat busier. Cook, however, expects his side to meet their end of the bargain and will raise the matter during the four-day training camp in Spain that starts this weekend.</p> \n<p>“The way we play cricket – sledging and stuff – we have to do it authentic to us as a side but we have all taken a big lesson over what happened over the last five weeks,” he said. “No matter how much cricket you have played you are always learning. The way that both sides conducted themselves in that [New Zealand] series was a refreshing approach and everyone enjoyed that. We can only control what we control. It is part of what we will talk about at the camp.”</p> \n<p>Cook, during his 30-minute sitdown with the written media, admitted he has in mind his team for the first Test but offered hope to Yorkshire’s title-winning leg-spinner, Adil Rashid, who was left out of the trip to Spain, admitting the 27-year-old’s form since being an unused tourist in the Caribbean earlier this year has been impressive. Mark Footitt, the Derbyshire left-armer, does make the trip, with his new captain hoping the rest periods that international cricket can afford him – as opposed to the county treadmill – could see his pace increase.</p> \n<p>Overall the Test captain agrees that Australia, the world’s second-ranked side at present, start the series as favourites and is happy with his side’s underdog status. “What is driving us is what has happened over the last six weeks,” he added. “[It is] restoring the pride of English cricket, making cricket feel popular again, enjoying what it has done to people and making stars of people.”</p> \n<p>When one considers that to-do list and the vibe when England were 30 for four on day one at Lord’s, it is little wonder that Cook now sees this summer as a chance to top the lot.</p> \n<p><em>Hardys of Australia sponsor England Cricket.

The 33-year-old’s arrival represents something of a coup for the Arsenal manager and not only because of the goalkeeper’s experience and enduring quality. Jos&eacute; Mourinho had been fiercely opposed to selling Cech at all, let alone to a Premier League rival.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/26/leicester-shinji-okazaki-mainz\">Leicester City secure signing of Shinji Okazaki from Mainz</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Arsenal have monitored Schneiderlin, who has performed at a consistent level for Southampton in the Premier League and established himself in the France squad. Wenger was delighted at the emergence last season of the defensive midfielder Francis Coquelin, but he suggested in May that he <a href=\"[http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/19/arsene-wenger-arsenal-francis-coquelin\">remained in the market for another player in the position</a>. Schneiderlin fits the bill.</p> \n<p>Arsenal, though, are worried that any bid they might make for Schneiderlin would be trumped by United, who would also be able to offer him higher wages. United have looked at Bayern Munich’s Bastian Schweinsteiger and they are currently in the driving seat for Schneiderlin, who is determined to move to a club who are in the Champions League.</p> \n<p>He wanted to join Tottenham Hotspur last summer only for Southampton to block the move, much to his irritation. Few people at Southampton expect him to stay this time, and a bid of around &pound;25m would be difficult to turn down.</p> \n<p>Mauricio Pochettino, who worked with Schneiderlin at Southampton before becoming manager at White Hart Lane in May last year, remains a big admirer but Spurs claim that they have not moved for the 25-year-old this summer.</p> \n<p>Cech is poised to become only the sixth player to switch directly from Chelsea to Arsenal – following Bill Dickson (1953), George Graham (1966), William Gallas (2006), Lassana Diarra (2007) and Yossi Benayoun (loan, 2011). The Czech lost his starting place at Stamford Bridge last season to Thibaut Courtois and he was clear that he could not countenance another campaign as the Belgian’s understudy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/26/qpr-matt-phillips-crystal-palace-sunderland-west-bromwich\">QPR’s Matt Phillips in talks with Crystal Palace, Sunderland and West Brom</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He owes his move to Arsenal to Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner, who has allowed him to join the club of his choosing, even a rival – a rare and special privilege. Abramovich has allowed sentiment to colour his decision. He has built a close relationship with Cech and he is respectful of the service that the player has given to Chelsea. Over 11 years at the club, Cech has won every major honour, including four league titles and the Champions League in 2012.</p> \n<p>Cech’s arrival at Arsenal, which means that he will not have to uproot his family from London, could see David Ospina squeezed out. The Colombia international only joined Arsenal from Nice last summer for &pound;3m.

It was Lloyd’s second goal but first in the run of play in this tournament, where she and her teammates have been relatively quiet on the goalscoring front.</p> \n<p>In the first half, the Americans looked their best in five games in Canada. Looking less reliant on putting balls in the air toward the box, USA kept the ball on the ground, used short passes to connect up the field and held on to possession.</p> \n<p>Coach Jill Ellis said it wasn’t a new tactical strategy, but “this team steps up in big moments.” Certainly, that is no truer than with Lloyd, who famously scored game-winning goals in both the 2012 and 2008 Olympic finals for the USA to win gold medals.</p> \n<p>With Lloyd’s goal the difference, she credited a team that played with more freedom than they had yet in this Women’s World Cup.</p> \n<p>“When we defend like we did, pressing high, I think it just instinctually gives people the confidence to attack,” Lloyd said. “Jill and the coaching staff said, ‘Want want players to take players one-on-one, get to the end line and get forwards involved.’ Everyone just played freely out there.”</p> \n<p>The Americans went into the half scoreless, despite out-shooting China 11 to four, with three of their chances on frame, and nearly all of the shots looking close and dangerous.</p> \n<p>But six minutes after the break, the Americans found their breakthrough. Julie Johnston served one into the box and Lloyd rose up over the shoulders of forward Zhao Rong in the box to get a perfectly placed head on it, beating goalkeeper Wang Fei.</p> \n<p>“These are the moments that I live for,” Lloyd said after Friday’s quarter-final. “It’s just one of those things where you prepare for it mentally and physically. I knew that I wasn’t myself in the beginning games, but now I had the freedom to attack and do what I do best.”</p> \n<p>Ellis was forced to make some major adjustments to her usual line-up, with Lauren Holiday and Megan Rapinoe suspended due to yellow card accumulation. Ellis put Morgan Brian in Holiday’s spot and pulled a surprise, starting left back Kelley O’Hara as the right winger.</p> \n<p>Lloyd, who had played more of a box-to-box type of midfielder in previous games, was given license to push forward and attack while Brian sat in a defensive midfielder role.</p> \n<p>“I defended more than I’ve ever defended, but I was happy to play that role,” Brian said, adding that she was directed to play holding midfielder so Lloyd could attack. “That’s what our team needed.”</p> \n<p>As the Americans went into the locker room, the frustration was palpable, especially after having a golden opportunity to take the lead in just the second minute. Amy Rodriguez, who struggled in the final third in her first start of this tournament, went one-on-one with China’s goalkeeper and tried to chip it over Wang, but sent it badly wide.</p> \n<p>Most of the Americans’ best chances came in the first half as China crept into the game in the second half and eked out more possession.</p> \n<p>O’Hara had a powerful long-range shot sail just above the crossbar in the sixth minute. In the 21st minute, a Tobin Heath cross found O’Hara, whose diving header went just wide. Johnston also had a header go wide in the 31st minute.</p> \n<p>O’Hara got knocked in the face in the scrum of a corner kick and was subbed out with a bloody nose in the second half. After the match, she said she hoped it wasn’t broken and didn’t think so.</p> \n<p>Goalkeeper Hope Solo did make a two saves in the second half, but they were routine ones that didn’t test her much. The Americans, for their part, had four shots on goal and ended the night outshooting China 17-to-6.</p> \n<p>For China, despite the loss, it was their best finish in a World Cup since they fell to the Americans in the 1999 final.

As he sat answering questions about misbehaving players it was hard not to be transported back to New Zealand in 2011, the only difference being that Johnson is not in charge of the national team any more.</p> \n<p>These days the former England captain is involved as an ambassador for the World Cup sponsors MasterCard, rather than being tasked with keeping the country’s rugby team on the straight and narrow. While it is no longer his job to deal with errant players, he firmly believes Stuart Lancaster’s squad need to display more self-discipline should they wish to emulate <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2013/oct/28/vault-rugby-world-cup-2003-england-victory\" title=\"\">the glory days of 2003</a> and lift the Webb Ellis Cup.</p> \n<p>If anyone can empathise with how Lancaster is currently feeling having <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/15/manu-tuilagi-rugby-world-cup-assautling-police-officer-england\" title=\"\">jettisoned Manu Tuilagi</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/29/england-dylan-hartley-world-cup-squad\" title=\"\">Dylan Hartley</a> from his squad for disciplinary reasons it is his predecessor, who was sideswiped by numerous off-field issues in 2011 and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/nov/23/england-world-cup-fiasco-leaked-report\" title=\"\">a subsequently-leaked tournament review</a>.</p> \n<p>Johnson confirmed he recently discussed the issue of player conduct with the Rugby Football Union’s chief executive, Ian Ritchie, and offered the view that improved behaviour is vital if England are to prosper. “I think it’s pretty obvious. You’ve just got to keep yourself out of trouble as a squad,” he said. “That’s not just for World Cups, that’s in general. It’s not good for you as an individual, it’s not good for the game. I think a lot of the time players think: ‘It won’t happen to me.’</p> \n<p>Everyone’s been in a situation where something could have gone somewhere and maybe they were lucky it didn’t. But there’s probably less room for manoeuvre for them now because of the way the world is. You’ve just not got to put yourself in that position as a player. Everyone has a camera, rightly or wrongly. If you’ve not learned your lesson by now, when will you?”</p> \n<p>As Johnson points out, however, it is already too late for Tuilagi, dropped from the squad after being convicted of assault. Four years ago the Leicester centre was fined after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/oct/09/police-manu-tuilagi-ferry-martin-johnson\" title=\"\">jumping off a ferry into Auckland harbour</a> and Johnson believes he will long regret his latest indiscretion. “He’s lost an opportunity to play at a World Cup. If you’re very lucky you only get three,” he said. “Who knows what the future will bring for him but it’s done now. If he didn’t know [about behaving responsibly in public] beforehand, he knows now.”</p> \n<p>It is also Johnson’s opinion that playing at home potentially complicates England’s assignment this autumn, despite the high levels of partisan support. He says he found things a lot simpler in Australia in 2003 because “it’s you against everyone else” and warns against England getting swept away by the emotion surrounding their games.</p> \n<p>“In 1999 [when Wales hosted the tournament] we made the mistake of building it up too big in our heads. The game becomes unplayable. You’ve got to be able to say: ‘Yes, it’s a World Cup and millions are watching but there’s a rugby game that needs winning.’</p> \n<p>“You’re in a healthier place if you’re thinking about what needs to be done rather than: ‘Oh My God, it’s a World Cup.’ I used to get annoyed when I was playing – I don’t know if you ever picked that up – because people wanted to talk about World Cups years in advance. Players have to be able separate themselves from all the commercial and media pressures.”</p> \n<p>Few know more than Johnson about the essential ingredients of World Cup success and the old warrior king – sounding far more content with life than he frequently did during his spell in charge and expressing no “burning” desire to return to elite coaching – reckons an element of simmering dressing-room grievance is no bad thing. “Sometimes if you can’t find that, you have to manufacture it,” he said. “It’s good to have a bit of anger in your camp at some point. The World Cup is not seven weeks of laughing and joking, there are hard times.”</p> \n<p>This time around England’s fate will rest in someone else’s hands, although Johnson’s image will feature on some of the match tickets along with other victorious captains John Eales, Francois Pienaar and Richie McCaw, as well as Jonny Wilkinson. Around 2.1m tickets – nearly 85% – have now been sold.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435339601309/Englands-Martin-Johnson-i-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Martin Johnson, then England's captain, celebrates their victory over Australia in the 2003 World Cup final in Sydney.
