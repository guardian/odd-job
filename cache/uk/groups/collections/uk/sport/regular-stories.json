There was seldom any shelter for bowlers and this time it was the English batsmen who enjoyed themselves the most. England had never chased more than 295 successfully in this country – against Pakistan in 2010 – but here they sped to their target of 350 with barely a tremor and with seven wickets and six overs to spare.</p> \n<p>Eoin Morgan, the victorious captain, was delighted. “We are surprising ourselves at the moment,” he said. “It won’t be like this every game and to beat this New Zealand side we will have to be at our best.” The series is level at 2-2 and will be decided in the last game, at Chester-le-Street on Saturday.</p> \n<p>Morgan cannot quite explain the transformation since the World Cup. “We were terrible then. Andrew Strauss has allowed me an opportunity to take on the role [as captain] and I’m very happy about that.” One of the problems then was that Morgan could barely score a run. Now he is batting better than ever. Another factor is that England have been playing on great batting surfaces. Apart from Luke Ronchi, every batsman who made it to the middle at Trent Bridge revelled in the experience. Apart from Mark Wood and Steven Finn, every bowler felt only exasperation.</p> \n<p>The critical innings were delivered by Englishmen unrecognisable from the World Cup. Alex Hales smashed 67 from 38 balls at the top of the order. At one point he hit 45 runs from 12 balls despite there being a rain break between those two overs. With Jason Roy a willing ally, 100 runs were added for the first wicket in 10.4 overs. Hales flicked off his hip and the ball kept sailing deep into packed stands.</p> \n<p>But even Hales would be overshadowed as Morgan cracked 113 from 82 balls, which meant England’s pursuit was incredibly stress-free. Morgan cannot set the tone any better than this. He has always been a streaky player but now the force is with him again. Those wristy drives are sending the ball a very long way. Here there were five more sixes; in total he has hit 16 in the series.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Joe Root remains in princely form. He was able to stick to relative orthodoxy, but the timing and placement of his drives was close to perfection and he seems to have developed a cut shot with an element of top spin just to ensure that the ball speeds away from diving fieldsmen. He cruised to his sixth ODI century and a potentially arduous chase became a romp.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the Kiwis were too conservative with the bat, though this is a charge that does not sit comfortably with Kane Williamson. He demonstrated once more that deft, refined strokeplay can get the scoreboard buzzing just as frantically as blacksmith biffs. His 90 occupied only 70 balls but there was hardly a brutal stroke among the 13 boundaries he struck.</p> \n<p>He had a sound base from which to work. Brendon McCullum and Martin Guptill added 88 in 13 overs after New Zealand had won the toss. McCullum threatened without delivering mayhem, which has been the pattern throughout the series. He produced just one trademark sizzling drive off Finn which went for six over mid-off. But then the extra bounce generated by Wood found him edging to the keeper.</p> \n<p>Guptill harvested most of his runs through mid-wicket before becoming victim to a brilliant catch by Finn. He mis-hit a slower ball from Ben Stokes high into the sky. Finn at mid-on was required to sprint hard to his right. No doubt the ball was bobbing up and down as if in a pinball machine as he tried to locate it, as the wind kept pushing it further and further out of reach. With superb athleticism Finn kept his balance and composure and caught the ball, a breathtaking piece of fielding seldom emulated by England, who remain fallible in the field. Four chances went begging, most of them tricky. But this was one of those rare days when the drops did not decide the outcome.</p> \n<p>Often Ross Taylor was the beneficiary of those slips and, alongside Williamson, another 100-run partnership was recorded.</p> \n<p>As usual, Taylor was the less fluent partner but that is likely to be the lot of anyone who bats with Williamson at the moment. As at Southampton, he tormented Adil Rashid with gentle ruthlessness on his way past 3,000 runs in ODI cricket.</p> \n<p>It was not until the powerplay that England imposed any pressure. Taylor was lbw to a slower ball from Finn, who proceeded to bowl with menace and control against the new batsman, Grant Elliott. Wood, with a very different method, was equally impressive during this period. Currently this pair are the most likely to join the senior citizens, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, in the first Test squad for the Ashes.</p> \n<p>However, New Zealand were able to recover momentum in the end, belting 66 in their final five overs. This acceleration was assisted by Morgan’s decision to give Rashid the 48th over, which went for 28 runs, all smashed by Mitchell Santner.</p> \n<p>This was not funky captaincy; it was foolhardy. But by the end of a raucous Trent Bridge evening Morgan could do no wrong. His players will be the ones skipping up to Chester-le-Street for the decider with the greater spring in their steps.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434574079008/England-v-New-Zealand---4-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Eoin Morgan celebrates with Joe Root after the England captain reached his century in the victory over New Zealand at Trent Bridge.

Saeed Ajmal, for a time before the crackdown the premier spinner in the world, was bowling the final over before a second new ball became available to Worcestershire, and three times Warwickshire’s beefy, dangerous lower-order leftie Keith Barker belted him unceremoniously to the ropes. “Rubbish,” they grumbled. “Take him off, what have we signed him again for?” These are harsh critics with short memories that if they cared to delve would tell them that last season, before he returned to Pakistan for a Test series, he took 63 wickets for the county in nine matches, and played no small part in their eventual promotion.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/16/wg-grace-cricket-book-the-spin\">The Spin | WG Grace: a cricketer of contradictions who lived for his duel with the ball</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But that was then and this is now. Ajmal played in that series in Sri Lanka last August but it was to be his final first-class match until this return to New Road. Following that Test, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/sep/09/icc-suspends-saeed-ajmal-bowling-action\" title=\"\">he was suspended from cricket</a> pending scrutiny of an action that had always appeared, as Fabian might have said to Aguecheek, on the windy side of the&nbsp;law.</p> \n<p>The biometric tests showed a degree of flex that was way beyond ambiguous and into the realms of darts and Alexandra Palace. To his credit, he has worked hard at a total remodel of his action but it is not even close to the same and, deprived in particular of his doosra, neither is his effectiveness. Pakistan resisted the temptation to recall him for the World Cup and when he did make an international comeback, in two ODIs against Bangladesh in April, he was slaughtered by Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim. Despite everything it was, to be honest, just a little sad to watch.</p> \n<p>His action is fine now as far as legality goes, a ramrod straight arm from start to finish, but no longer is there any spark to it. For the most part, he bowls flat and gets a little spin without it being anything extravagant. Any variations he gets appear to be restricted to occasional changes of pace, and an equally occasional alteration to the height of his bowling arm to what is termed round arm. He looked efficient enough, but innocuous as well on a dry pitch that was showing a few signs of wear even after two days. The Worcestershire supporters were right to be suspicious.</p> \n<p>Frustration rather than suspicion would have been the overriding feeling of the national selector, James Whitaker, who was watching this unfolding. He had come to Worcester to watch Ian Bell, who shrugged off his indifferent Test match form and obliged with a composed, skilled century; and Moeen Ali, whose batting has fallen away a little although not significantly, but whose bowling, as England’s first-choice spinner, has been under scrutiny.</p> \n<p>Last summer, his first in international cricket, he took 22 wickets at 28 runs apiece and, at the Rose Bowl, bowled England to victory with six for 67 against an India team containing some of the finest players of spin in the world. Since then, it has not been so good. A lengthy period of ODI cricket does not allow any spinner to settle into a rhythm and his injury sustained at the back end of the World Cup prevented him from joining the start of England’s Caribbean tour.</p> \n<p>When he did arrive, the trust was such that he was rushed straight into the second Test in Grenada, subsequently to have a disappointing match there and in Barbados, followed by an indifferent series at home against New Zealand. Since his return, he has taken 11 wickets at 41 apiece.</p> \n<p>Now, with the profile that Adil Rashid has acquired during the current ODI series against New Zealand, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/02/england-drop-jimmy-anderson-stuart-broad-ian-bell-odi-squad-new-zealand-cricket\" title=\"\">from which Moeen has been rested</a>, he is seen, in some quarters anyway, to be under pressure for his place.</p> \n<p>Here, though, is the problem for him. Implicit in him being rested from white‑ball cricket is the idea that he would instead get good overs in the bank and so regain the rhythm of bowling that has deserted him. A spin bowler needs to be able to get into a spell, book himself in at one end as it were, without feeling under pressure to make things happen immediately.</p> \n<p>Watching Moeen in the Caribbean, it was clear that he was trying to force his game. But instead of being able to bowl himself back into form – essential with the approach of the Ashes, for which he should still be the first-choice spinner – he was accorded a single token over at the end of the first day against Warwickshire and a further five overs in tandem with Ajmal as Bell was approaching his hundred: six overs for 18 runs in total. There was no conclusion to be drawn by Whitaker from this: he bowled OK.</p> \n<p>Worcestershire have two more fixtures: against Middlesex at Uxbridge starting next Sunday; and on 29 June against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, where their teenage off-spinner Matthew Carter has just taken seven wickets in the first innings of his first‑class debut. The latter match will almost certainly coincide, or at least directly follow, an England camp with the new coach, Trevor Bayliss. With the old Ajmal, one might understand Worcestershire’s dilemma. This, though, is helping neither themselves, England nor Moeen himself. Maybe some dialogue is necessary.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434460410811/Moeen-Ali-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Moeen Ali has been rested by England but has not been getting overs at Warwickshire.

Colombia’s Carlos Bacca was also given a red card and will miss his side’s final group game against Peru. </p> \n<p>“It’s never a good thing when at the end of a match we’re talking about the referee,” Dunga said. “I think if you look at what happened, including at the end, you have to conclude it has something to do with the referee. </p> \n<p>“There was a similar problem at a Corinthians match when the same referee was in charge,” Dunga said, referring to a recent Libertadores Cup tie when Osses sent off two Corinthians players in a match against Paraguayan side Guarani. “It’s more than just coincidence.” <br /></p> \n<p>Asked how he would prepare for the Venezuela clash without Neymar, Dunga said: “We’ll think about that tomorrow. We’ve played matches before without Neymar. We’ll just to play in a way that makes up for his absence.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Neymar's flashpoint.

His normally excellent first touch often let him down and he grew frustrated with the constant attention he received from his Colombian markers. Dunga said the Colombians had provoked his side and that Brazil did not employ such tactics. </p> \n<p>His counterpart, Jose P&eacute;kerman, refused to criticise Osses, recalling only that last year’s World Cup clash between the two sides was also characterised by some controversial refereeing decisions. Neymar was stretchered off in that match with a fractured vertebrae and Colombia had what they regarded as a legitimate goal disallowed in a 2-1 defeat that ended their World Cup. </p> \n<p>Colombia’s goal was scored in the first-half by Jeison Murillo, giving his side only their second victory in 10 Copa America encounters against the five-times world champions.</p> \n<p>Colombia were the better side throughout with defender Murillo seizing on a loose ball to get the all-important goal nine minutes before half-time after a Juan Cuadrado free kick had bobbled around in the box. Brazil’s Roberto Firmino should have equalised 13 minutes into the second half but he skied a golden chance over the bar with the goal gaping.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434611923484/272f3d45-2274-4fae-9975-f8da79a45989-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Carlos Succo/EPA","altText":"Chilean referee Enrique Osses shows a red card to Neymar as the Brazil striker is escorted off following a brawl at the end of their Copa America defeat to Colombia.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Carlos Succo/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T02:43:40Z","lastModified":"2015-06-18T07:29:05Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":70,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Copa América","Colombia","Brazil","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/copa-america","webTitle":"Copa América"},{"id":"football/colombia","webTitle":"Colombia"},{"id":"football/brazil","webTitle":"Brazil"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#005689","matchStatusPre":"#676767","matchStatusDuring":"#4bc6df","matchStatusAbandoned":"#da1d1d","matchStatusPost":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"football"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/colombia-fight-to-crucial-1-0-win-over-brazil-in-copa-america","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49qjq","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/17/colombia-fight-to-crucial-1-0-win-over-brazil-in-copa-america","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/17/colombia-fight-to-crucial-1-0-win-over-brazil-in-copa-america"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434611923484/272f3d45-2274-4fae-9975-f8da79a45989-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chilean referee Enrique Osses shows a red card to Neymar as the Brazil striker is escorted off following a brawl at the end of their Copa America defeat to Colombia.

After a shaky start to Canada 2015 the Lionesses ended up second in Group F, finishing behind France on goal difference.</p> \n<p>Not even a stoppage-time lapse in concentration which permitted Lady Andrade to defy the excellent Karen Bardsley with an audacious lob could wipe the smile off Sampson’s face. “We’re in a good place and we’ve got a strong winning mentality,” said England’s coach, whose arguably risky strategy of once again rotating his side paid off. “We’re going to face a really good, high quality Norwegian team who have drawn with Germany, the best team in the tournament. But this side’s ready.”</p> \n<p>Colombia possess a quite devastating change of pace and it did not take long to manifest itself. Jordan Nobbs is no slouch but the England midfielder appeared to be moving in slow motion as Andrade surged past her before cutting back for Carolina Arias. Fortunately for Nobbs, the shot swerved way over the bar.</p> \n<p>Even better, Sampson has Carney on his side. The creator he calls “The Wizard” popped up in precisely the right place at the right time to direct the ball between the legs of Sandra Sepulveda from close range after Colombia’s goalkeeper could only parry Alex Greenwood’s free-kick.</p> \n<p>Sepulveda is an excellent keeper, and was outstanding against France, but she should have held on to Greenwood’s delivery. In mitigation, she had only just got to her feet after receiving protracted treatment following an accidental but painful clash of knees with Toni Duggan.</p> \n<p>It was exactly the psychological boost an initially edgy England required as they strove to string more than a couple of passes together at a time. Perhaps the rather surreal atmosphere inside a cavernous stadium that, with the roof closed, resembled a giant spaceship had simply unnerved them.</p> \n<p>Although that roof at least served to create a sort of echo chamber, amplifying crowd noise. An arena built for the 1976 Olympics featured acres of empty seats as Canadians, once again, displayed their indifference towards women’s football. The official attendance was given as 13,862 but felt lower.</p> \n<p>Despite some success in breaking up the Lionesses’s attempts at settling into a rhythmic passing groove, Colombia were becoming frustrated by their own failure to test Bardsley’s reflexes and turned a little too niggly for Sampson’s liking. He had barely stopped complaining about Yoreli Rinc&oacute;n and Catalina Usme pushing Greenwood and Jade Moore over respectively, when England were awarded a penalty for Arias’s blatant handball. Up stepped Williams, who enjoyed an excellent game, to double England’s advantage with a right-footed kick which Sepulveda came tantalisingly close to reaching. It compensated for the moment a little earlier when Fran Kirby could not quite make the necessary connection with Carney’s fabulously chipped cross and headed tamely wide.</p> \n<p>There was nothing remotely tepid about the wonderfully brave save Bardsley made on the brink of half-time. Colombia had finally succeeded in opening up England’s defence and Angela Clavijo looked set to volley a bouncing ball into the back of the net when the keeper dashed off her line to smother the danger.</p> \n<p>Les Cafeteras began the second half in similarly determined mode and the elusive Rinc&oacute;n sent a shot dipping fractionally over the bar from distance. Sampson was sufficiently concerned to withdraw Kirby, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/womens-world-cup-2015-england-fran-kirby-mini-messi\" title=\"\">aka his “Mini Messi”</a>, and send on Jo Potter to tighten things up.</p> \n<p>A previously pacy England’s attempts to slow down the game were meeting with limited success but Arias – already booked for the handball prefacing the penalty – was lucky not to be sent off for a second bookable offence in the wake of a wince-inducing challenge on Steph Houghton.</p> \n<p>With the referee turning a blind eye to that one, a suddenly menacing Colombia continued to play with the sort of adrenaline that had seen them astound everyone by beating France last Saturday. It did not help Sampson’s cause that he had to take off Carney after 56 minutes. Much of England’s threat departed with an integral individual who, due to a chequered injury history, struggles to last 90 minutes. “Caz is a wizard with a ball at her feet,” he said. “She sees things others don’t.”</p> \n<p>England’s coach once again had Bardsley to thank for acrobatically repelling Diana Ospina’s cross-shot but must have cursed when Lianne Sanderson miscued an extremely inviting chance conjured by Nobbs’s low centre.</p> \n<p>Attempting to change the balance of play, Sampson replaced Duggan with his star striker, Jodie Taylor. The Portland Thorns forward would normally be expected to start but underwent knee surgery only seven weeks ago. Taylor quickly emphasised that she has lost none of her speed by accelerating towards the onrushing Sepulveda for a 50/50 ball, prompting a challenge which saw Colombia’s keeper booked and arguably fortunate not to see red.</p> \n<p>There was still time for Andrade to reduce the deficit as the tournament’s surprise team limbered up for an unexpected round of 16 adventure as one of the best third-place finishers. This was Sampson’s night, though. “We’re building a real sense of momentum,” he said. “We’re confident and we’ve got a lot of different weapons. Now it’s a case of choosing the right ones.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434578305175/England-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England celebrate after Fara Williams' penalty had put them 2-0 up against Colombia in the Women's World Cup.

Critical. Crucial. Important. Very important. Very, very important. Very, very, very important. Just important as your president. Serious. Significant. Decisive. Front page. Big league. Far reaching. Mattering much. Apply any of these and you get the relevance of this evening’s game for England against Colombia. It’s the World Cup for goodness sake, of course it’s all those, and much, much more. That realisation might have you resting uneasy in your chair. It might have you walking up and down and up and down and up and down, wearing out the faux-Persian Ikea rug that is so desperately hard to vacuum. It might even have you you fumbling for your pockets and yet another cigarette, while the other hand uses that snot-stained, old rag to wipe away the gathering sweat. But maybe you should take a leaf from Mark Sampson’s book. He’s as cool as the people who hand around Le Mary Celeste.</p> \n<p><strong>“It’s not a must-win game</strong>. We’re in a place where we can afford to drop some points and still go through, but of course we want to win the game.” He’s right. Kinda. It is not a must-win-or-the-world-will-end game but it is a win-this-last-group-match-and-life-is-a-heck-of-a-lot-easier game. Let’s explain why. Colombia, thanks to their draw with Mexico and their impressive win over France, are perched atop of the group with four points. England and France come next, both on three points, with only goal difference separating the two (in England’s favour). The aforementioned Mexicans are Johnny Last on one point. Come the final whistles tonight, the top two teams go through, no sweat. However, should you finish third, you need to be one of four best teams in that spot from the six World Cup groups to go through. </p> \n<p><strong>England probably don’t want to take that risk and probably don’t want to take the risk of coming second either as second means a tricky affair with the 1995 winners, Norway</strong>. (First will get you a game against the runners-up of a weak enough Group E.) Said affair would also mean England having to leave Montreal – the location of tonight’s game – and make the trip to Ottawa. It’s not a bazillion miles away, of course, but given how crucial rest is in a tournament like this, it’s a trip they could do without. (Incidentally, finishing third and progressing might mean a trip out west, which is a lovely part of the world, but probably one the English players would rather do on their summer holidays when they can enjoy the walk around Stanley Park to English Bay or escape to the pyramids at the Muttart Conservatory). So to ensure they ain’t tripping like that, England should approach this game with Colombia as a must-win one.</p> \n<p><strong>That task won’t be easy</strong>. As the Colombians showed against France, their current world ranking of 28 is deceptive, even if France should’ve had one penalty for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eurosport_UK/status/609791699007729664\">the most blatant handballs</a> you are likely to see this side Thierry Henry and another when Sandra Sepulveda handled outside the area. Colombia were lucky to get away with those but there was no luck involved with the discipline, solidity and focus they exhibited throughout that match. They are also a more than robust side, as England are only all too aware of. Sampson simply said his side were “ready” for that but Fran Kirby expanded up on it. “If Colombia try and kick me up,” she said, “that means I’m winning so I’ll give them a cheeky smile and carry on. That will probably annoy them even more but I think I’ll be alright.”</p> \n<p><strong>Speaking of Kirby, what an inspiration she is</strong>. Four years ago, seriously depressed following the death of her mother, she quit the game altogether. Two years later, she returns to Reading and scores 33 flipping goals in her first season back. One year later she scores on her England debut against Sweden. One year after that, she jacks in the amateur status, becomes professional, makes the World Cup squad (she is the second youngest member and the only player plying their trade in the second level of the Women’s Super League) and scores in her ever World Cup match. “It’s new and exciting for a little girl like me to be getting so much attention,” she said after the win over Mexico. “If I’m getting this kind of interest, it must mean that I’m making the people behind me happy, which is a feeling I love.” Skilled, articulate and hard-working. England could have a new national hero here. </p> \n<p><strong>Of course, there will a lot more happy people should England win today</strong>. Can they do it? Of course. Will they do it? Well stay tuned to find out. Team news and 90 minutes of World Cup action is almost upon us.

Here is what she had to say:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Whatever happens beneath the closed roof of Montreal’s cavernous Olympic Stadium on Wednesday night no one can accuse Mark Sampson of being ill-prepared.</p> \n <p>England’s coach knows that a win against Colombia in their final Group F game could potentially offer his side an easier passage through the knockout stages of Canada 2015.</p> \n <p>A point could assure progression to the last 16 but the 32-year-old has still spent hours poring over shaky camera phone footage of <em>Las Cafeteras</em> provided by David Gough, the squad’s chief opposition analyst.</p> \n <p>“Women’s football is still at the stage where it’s incredibly difficult to get hold of proper footage of teams like Colombia,” says Sampson. “Our head of analysis has gone out there six times to watch them live but all he had was a camera phone so it made it very difficult. I don’t think I’d know how to film a match on a phone but Dave’s done a great job trekking round the world and getting a few more stamps in his passport.”</p> \n <p>Sampson and his coaches have been able to join the dots in Gough’s dossier after the luxury of viewing complete television recordings of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/colombia-mexico-womens-world-cup-match-report\">Colombia’s 1-1 draw with Mexico</a> and shock 2-0 win over the group favourites France. Along the way Felipe Taborda’s team scored their first ever World Cup goals and win.</p> \n <p>“Watching the first two games, what we’ve been fed back from Goughy is becoming very clear,” says England’s coach. “We’re in a better place than if we’d had to play them first.”</p> \n <p>Not that an England win is exactly simple. “This is a dangerous Colombian team,” says Sampson. “Emotionally they’re now in a fantastic place. They’ve beaten the favourites and they’ve got a huge confidence boost. You can feel their energy. They’ve got tremendous national pride and they’re well placed to qualify. They’re resolute, very strong physically and they’re going to be really tough opponents.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/16/england-colombia-womens-world-cup-future\">Continued here</a>.<br /></p> \n<p>* Fun fact about Dawson.

Critical. Crucial. Important. Very important. Very, very important. Very, very, very important. Just important as your president. Serious. Significant. Decisive. Front page. Big league. Far reaching. Mattering much. Apply any of these and you get the relevance of this evening’s game for England against Colombia. It’s the World Cup for goodness sake, of course it’s all those, and much, much more. That realisation might have you resting uneasy in your chair. It might have you walking up and down and up and down and up and down, wearing out the faux-Persian Ikea rug that is so desperately hard to vacuum. It might even have you you fumbling for your pockets and yet another cigarette, while the other hand uses that snot-stained, old rag to wipe away the gathering sweat. But maybe you should take a leaf from Mark Sampson’s book. He’s as cool as the people who hand around Le Mary Celeste.</p> \n<p><strong>“It’s not a must-win game</strong>. We’re in a place where we can afford to drop some points and still go through, but of course we want to win the game.” He’s right. Kinda. It is not a must-win-or-the-world-will-end game but it is a win-this-last-group-match-and-life-is-a-heck-of-a-lot-easier game. Let’s explain why. Colombia, thanks to their draw with Mexico and their impressive win over France, are perched atop of the group with four points. England and France come next, both on three points, with only goal difference separating the two (in England’s favour). The aforementioned Mexicans are Johnny Last on one point. Come the final whistles tonight, the top two teams go through, no sweat. However, should you finish third, you need to be one of four best teams in that spot from the six World Cup groups to go through. </p> \n<p><strong>England probably don’t want to take that risk and probably don’t want to take the risk of coming second either as second means a tricky affair with the 1995 winners, Norway</strong>. (First will get you a game against the runners-up of a weak enough Group E.) Said affair would also mean England having to leave Montreal – the location of tonight’s game – and make the trip to Ottawa. It’s not a bazillion miles away, of course, but given how crucial rest is in a tournament like this, it’s a trip they could do without. (Incidentally, finishing third and progressing might mean a trip out west, which is a lovely part of the world, but probably one the English players would rather do on their summer holidays when they can enjoy the walk around Stanley Park to English Bay or escape to the pyramids at the Muttart Conservatory). So to ensure they ain’t tripping like that, England should approach this game with Colombia as a must-win one.</p> \n<p><strong>That task won’t be easy</strong>. As the Colombians showed against France, their current world ranking of 28 is deceptive, even if France should’ve had one penalty for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eurosport_UK/status/609791699007729664\">the most blatant handballs</a> you are likely to see this side Thierry Henry and another when Sandra Sepulveda handled outside the area. Colombia were lucky to get away with those but there was no luck involved with the discipline, solidity and focus they exhibited throughout that match. They are also a more than robust side, as England are only all too aware of. Sampson simply said his side were “ready” for that but Fran Kirby expanded up on it. “If Colombia try and kick me up,” she said, “that means I’m winning so I’ll give them a cheeky smile and carry on. That will probably annoy them even more but I think I’ll be alright.”</p> \n<p><strong>Speaking of Kirby, what an inspiration she is</strong>. Four years ago, seriously depressed following the death of her mother, she quit the game altogether. Two years later, she returns to Reading and scores 33 flipping goals in her first season back. One year later she scores on her England debut against Sweden. One year after that, she jacks in the amateur status, becomes professional, makes the World Cup squad (she is the second youngest member and the only player plying their trade in the second level of the Women’s Super League) and scores in her ever World Cup match. “It’s new and exciting for a little girl like me to be getting so much attention,” she said after the win over Mexico. “If I’m getting this kind of interest, it must mean that I’m making the people behind me happy, which is a feeling I love.” Skilled, articulate and hard-working. England could have a new national hero here. </p> \n<p><strong>Of course, there will a lot more happy people should England win today</strong>. Can they do it? Of course. Will they do it? Well stay tuned to find out. Team news and 90 minutes of World Cup action is almost upon us. Let’s go!</p> \n<p><strong>Kick-off: </strong>9pm<br /></p>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-5581c6a8e4b06ca1215f27a4","title":"Dramatis personæ","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-17T19:16:02Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T19:19:13Z","body":"<p><strong>England:</strong> Bardsley, Scott, Williams, Houghton (C), Nobbs, Carney*, Moore, Greenwood, Stoney, Duggan, Kirby. <strong>Subs: </strong>Chamberlain, Telford, Rafferty, Bassett, Scott, Aluko, Bronze, Chapman*, Potter, Taylor, Sanderson, White.</p> \n<p><strong>Colombia:</strong> Sepulveda*, Gaitan* (C), Ospina*, Montoya*, Velasquez*, Rincon, Usme, Clavijo, N.

Yet a proven ability to prevail in a US Open, against the typically fierce set-up as implemented by the USGA, is unquestionably in Rose’s favour. He will happily acknowledge as much.</p> \n<p>“I think the mentality is going to be the same in terms of having to grind out pars, having to be patient, having to handle the adversity that’s going to happen out there in 72 holes of golf,” Rose explained. “So those are the types of things that I’m looking at trying to be good at this week. And as long as I play well that should manifest itself in a pretty good chance to win.</p> \n<p>“Then it’s all about coming down the stretch on Sunday. It’s never easy but if you’ve done it before, at least you have some positives on which to draw.</p> \n<p>“I’m not surprised that I haven’t won a major since then. There are many great players that have never won a major that deserve to win a major. They’re hard to win and sometimes this game, it can elude you pretty easily. Certainly I’m very grateful for the one I have, and I believe there are going to be more opportunities to win more. You’ve got to be patient with it.</p> \n<p>“I feel like the performance I put in at Augusta this year would have won many of those championships and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/13/jordan-spieth-masters-augusta-justin-rose-phil-mickelson\" title=\"\">I got beat by a better player</a> [Jordan Spieth] on the week. But you’ve got to play your own game and create your own chances. I’ve played pretty well in the majors since. I think I saw a stat today that in the last 10 majors I’m fourth in scoring, and the last four majors I’m fourth in under-par. I’m doing all the right things, it’s just a matter of everything lining up again in one week.”</p> \n<p>Rose’s Masters reference is pertinent. He will have the player he couldn’t keep pace with there, Spieth, for company over rounds one and two here. Jason Day completes what is one of the 115th US Open’s marquee groupings.</p> \n<p>“I enjoy playing with Jordan,” Rose added. “I think in some ways I’ve got to learn his game pretty well. We were paired in Houston, the final rounds of Augusta, two rounds at the Memorial, all pretty fresh in my memory.</p> \n<p>“I’ve played a lot with Jordan in the last six weeks or so, so it definitely makes for a comfortable pairing. Obviously Jason Day is in there, too, he’s a great guy and someone that I know very well. So two great young players. It’s going to be a fun three-ball to be a part of.”</p> \n<p>Rose believes physical performance could be key at this punishing venue. He has tailored his lead-up work accordingly. “I think there’s a big fitness element this week,” he said. “There are a lot of us who have been here and are probably preparing harder for this championship than many others. Because of that there’s an even bigger physical demand.</p> \n<p>“One of my keys this week was to practise hard Friday, Saturday, Sunday, but conserve energy Monday and Tuesday. At the end of the day, you want to be 100% prepared Thursday morning but you need to have your best stuff on the weekend. So it’s sort of a double-edged sword. You can put so much time and energy into preparation that you kind of burn yourself out a little bit.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/17/1434575547146/U.S.-Open---Preview-Day-3-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Justin Rose hits a tee shot during his practice round with Rory McIlroy in preparation for the start of the 115th US Open.

It is also appropriate that the first glimpses of a stunning venue arrive from well on high. Victory at this, the 115th US Open Championship, will represent golf’s equivalent of conquering Everest. If the Puget Sound inlet serves as the serene, picture-postcard backdrop, a golfing Rubik’s Cube stretching to 250 acres is the fiendish, pertinent detail.</p> \n<p>Talent alone will not suffice here. The first US Open in the Pacific Northwest will gladly chew up and spit out some of the world’s finest golfers, on the basis of mental and physical torture. The player who most readily shrugs off the inevitable, unfair breaks which could well turn the second major of 2015 into a horror show will be last man standing.</p> \n<p>Trepidation matches expectation. The greens resemble a wicket on day three of a Test match, which is a leveller in so many ways. Logic would suggest those players who have games based heavily on holing putts, Jordan Spieth for one, are at something of a disadvantage. If sport, that is, was ever played out on paper.</p> \n<p>The USGA’s routine desire to make fools of rather than challenge golf’s leading lights has sparked its annual ripples of fear. On this occasion, it is almost as if Mike Davis and friends have even controlled the weather.</p> \n<p>With conditions not dissimilar to the scorched, fiery Royal Liverpool Open Championship of 2006, you need not even be inches off target to discover a punishment stretching to 70 yards. Such scenarios frustrate competitors to the point of outburst, physical and verbal. The only course of action, surely, would be for the USGA to heavily water Chambers Bay before play begins at 7am local time on Thursday, thereby retaining an element of sensibility at least for the tournament’s opening stages.</p> \n<p>The alternative will not be pretty and an unfortunate narrative for what should be an historic sporting juncture in this wonderful, mountainous corner of the United States. When Robert Trent Jones Jnr, the designer of Chambers Bay, asked Tiger Woods a media-conference question on Tuesday it was easy to infer the seeking of endorsement, linked to the fear of what may be forthcoming. If this tournament regresses into the realms of farce, battered and bruised golfers will not be slow in pointing out as much.</p> \n<p>Recent history favours jaunty European invaders. Graeme McDowell, Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose and Martin Kaymer have won the US Open since 2010, displaying a terrific lack of respect towards the host nation in the process. The battle-hardened spirit of Rose, McDowell and Ian Poulter is worthy of consideration this time round. Kaymer is known to enjoy the setting but the last player to successfully defend the US Open title was Curtis Strange in 1989.</p> \n<p>And what of McIlroy, this sport’s leading light, a player who will see his career defined by major championships? If body language is anything to go by, the 26-year-old will revive some of the spirit of Kiawah Island. There, in 2012, he swaggered to victory at the US PGA Championship. It was a triumph which could be detected from the moment McIlroy took to the podium for his pre-tournament conference.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday morning in Washington state, McIlroy’s demeanour was precisely the same. Later in the day, even his peers looked on with driving range wonder as the Northern Irishman landed drives just short of a 350-yard marker. McIlroy has a gear change not prominent even at this level; privately, he will surely be motivated both by a desire to prove he has more imagination around greens than he has been given credit for and that he can prevail on fast-running surfaces. McIlroy, smartly, played nine holes late on Tuesday afternoon; he aims to be competing in that time period on Saturday and Sunday.</p> \n<p>Rickie Fowler will inevitably form part of the discussion. The Californian’s play-off win at the Players Championship should have broken down a psychological barrier. Prior to that, Fowler’s prominence and consistency had not been backed up by victories. For that reason alone, he lagged well behind McIlroy.</p> \n<p>The whisper at Chambers Bay on Tuesday evening was that Fowler had just produced a practice round of 65. It seems inconceivable that he will not sample a major victory at a links venue given his love for the environment. Other statistics are in Fowler’s favour: he has made the most birdies in the past five majors, has the best scoring average in majors since 2013 and has the longest current run of top-20 major finishes, with six. At Sawgrass, he accelerated when it mattered.</p> \n<p>Fowler’s compatriot Phil Mickelson is seeking to finally complete his career grand slam of major titles at the age of 45. Unpredictability is his watchword but his lifting of the Claret Jug at a bouncy Muirfield in 2013 is a notable reference point. That, and the fact Mickelson adores a battle. “I know that I love what I do,” he explained. “I love playing golf. I love competing and playing against the best players.</p> \n<p>“I still have a huge obstacle, a huge challenge that I am trying to overcome and that’s to win a US Open and complete the grand slam. I’m enjoying that challenge, I’m having fun with it. It’s not a burden. It’s like an exciting opportunity.” Another American, Dustin Johnson, is being mentioned in dispatches.</p> \n<p>Many things simply don’t tend to happen on this platform. No man has won the US Open at his first attempt since 1913. An amateur has not been victorious since 1933. Mickelson will not like being reminded that the late Payne Stewart, back in 1999, was the last player to win when over the age of 40.</p> \n<p>In 2015 there will be sniping, whining, moaning and wheezing. Yet every major has to have its worthy champion. When Sunday’s triumphant golfer negotiates the exiting incline and glimpses back over a 200ft drop, the extent of what came before will instantly hit home.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/17/1434567073079/rory-mcilroy-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rory McIlroy, the world No1 from Northern Ireland, practises his bunker play in preparation for the 115th US Open at Chambers Bay.

The club have made a &pound;5m offer for the 18-year-old but Fulham want considerably more and City will have to go back with a higher offer to make the deal happen.</p> \n<p>A compromise is likely to be reached in both cases but City’s information from Liverpool is that the asking price is around the &pound;50m mark and that would mean making Sterling their most expensive acquisition since Sheikh Mansour bought the club in 2008. The previous high was set in 2009 when Carlos Tevez joined in a deal that was initially described as being worth &pound;25.5m, only for it to emerge it had actually cost the club about &pound;47m.</p> \n<p>That was in an era when City largely went by a money-no-object rule but they have modified their approach over recent seasons and made it clear on several occasions that they will not pay what they consider to be vastly inflated prices just because selling clubs know of the wealth that exists among the sheikh and his colleagues at the Abu Dhabi United Group. That stance is now being severely tested.</p> \n<p>Liverpool’s public position is that they do not want to sell Sterling, who has two years remaining on his contract, but the situation has deteriorated since he turned down a new &pound;100,000-a-week deal in January and diplomatic relations were called off with his agent, Aidy Ward, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/21/raheem-sterling-liverpool-agent-contract-900000\" title=\"\">after an outspoken attack on the club</a> when he said his client would not even sign for “&pound;900,000 a week”.</p> \n<p>Ward has made it clear he will lead an aggressive attempt to force a transfer and Liverpool have been so dismayed by his approach that they cancelled a meeting that had been arranged in May with the idea of reopening contract talks.</p> \n<p>Liverpool’s sixth-placed finish last season means they cannot offer their player Champions League football next season, whereas City can provide a place in Europe’s leading club competition, an improved chance of silverware and also a considerably higher salary. There is no doubt Sterling would like the move to go ahead and, in City’s favour, they are aware that Liverpool are trying to raise money for their own transfer targets. Christian Benteke is at the top of the list, with a buyout clause in his contract at Aston Villa set at &pound;32.5m. Liverpool have also made an unsuccessful opening bid of &pound;10m for Southampton’s Nathaniel Clyne.</p> \n<p>City are deliberately targeting English players to help them comply with the homegrown rules. Sterling is regarded as a better option than Samir Nasri while Roberts has been identified as a potential star of the future. The teenager has turned down a new contract at Craven Cottage and if a deal can be arranged it is likely he will be loaned out next season. Fabian Delph of Aston Villa is another possible target, although not a priority.</p> \n<p>As it stands, there are only three players in City’s senior squad who qualify as homegrown – Joe Hart, Ga&euml;l Clichy and Richard Wright, who has not played a first-team game since he was with Ipswich in 2011.

The Yorkshire star lay prone on the road for some 40 minutes receiving attention from medical staff after the incident and was taken away on a stretcher with her head in a neck brace, but left Norfolk and Norwich hospital several hours later after check-ups.</p> \n<p>Later on Wednesday evening Armitstead posted a message on Twitter which read: “I remember winning with the help of my team mates and then not much else, but I am ok, nothing broken just very sore, thank you for kind messages and to the NHS staff who took care of me so well. I won’t start tomorrow in the hope of recovering properly for the Nationals.” The British road championship takes place in Lincoln on 28 June.</p> \n<p>Armitstead had proved the fastest of four women leading the mass sprint, crossing the finish line almost half a bike length ahead of her closest rival, Germany’s Lisa Brennauer. Going through the line she shrieked with delight and raised her arms in triumph; video footage indicated that she then lost control of her bike – suddenly dropping her hands back on to the bars – before veering to the left, towards the tightly packed row of photographers who were standing in their usual positions behind a chalked line on the side of the road 50 to 75 metres after the finish.</p> \n<p>The Commonwealth Games road champion and London Olympic silver medallist then appeared to collide with the row of photographers, with the main impact involving the race director, Michael Bennett, whose role is to marshal the photographers and other media at the finish line and hence was standing at the left end of the row. Armitstead rolled at least twice and landed heavily on the left side of the road a few metres later.</p> \n<p>The aftershock as the rest of the 85-strong leading peloton tried to avoid her caused a further pile-up on the right hand side of the road, involving at least half a dozen fellow competitors. But it was Armitstead who was most seriously injured. She was administered oxygen and pain relief by paramedics before being carried off to await the arrival of an air ambulance to take her to hospital.</p> \n<p>After the stage, a statement from the race organiser, Sweetspot, said: “After crossing the line with her arms in the air, stage winner Lizzie Armitstead appeared to lose control and veer left, clipping photographers positioned beyond the finish line. Lizzie was immediately attended to by race medical staff at the finish line, who dealt with the incident before she was taken to hospital.” The yellow jersey and stage winner’s prize that should have been awarded to Armitstead were instead received by her Boels-Dolmans team-mates on the podium.</p> \n<p>It was a bitter end for Armitstead, who fought a valiant uphill battle with the dominant world No1, Marianne Vos, through most of last year’s inaugural edition of the race before being forced out due to illness. This year, with Vos a nonstarter due to persistent injury – although the Dutchwoman is present at the race working for television – the Boels-Dolman leader had started as the overwhelming favourite amid a run of good form, culminating in victory at the recent World Cup in Philadelphia.</p> \n<p>Stage two’s 138km across Essex from Braintree to Clacton looks set to be a battle between the sprinters for time bonus seconds at the finish and intermediate sprints. The early advantage went to Brennauer, who now leads by a second from Marta Tagliaferro of Italy and two from last year’s first stage winner, Emma Johansson, and Coryn Rivera. Wales’s Olympic track gold medallist Elinor Barker is sixth overall, three seconds back.</p> \n<p>Barker had scooped up some handy time bonuses after figuring in the day’s main escape of six riders which also included her fellow Great Britain team pursuiter Katie Archibald, along with Tagliaferro of Italy, Heather Fischer of the USA and Katie Hall and Coryn Rivera of the United Healthcare team. The sextet received an unexpected boost when a level crossing gate came down between them and the chasing peloton, but the inevitable reaction came to set up a finish sprint that for a brief moment looked to have left Armitstead in command.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434568832739/Lizzy-Armitstead-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lizzy Armitstead receives treatment after crashing at the end of the opening stage of the Women's Tour but her injuries are said not to be serious.
