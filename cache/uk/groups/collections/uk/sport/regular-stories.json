No matter that Mark Sampson’s side were required to come from behind after an edgy, erratic start. More audacious tactics from the Lionesses’ young coach ultimately earned a quarter-final place.</p> \n<p>The next chapter will unfold in Vancouver on Saturday night – or the early hours of Sunday in the UK – against the host nation. By way of further spice Canada are managed by John Herdman, a Newcastle United supporter from Consett in County Durham.</p> \n<p>“The team have made history. The team deserve all the credit in the world. They knew this was a big game for them, they wanted to put their names in English football history and the squad have stepped up and delivered for the country,” said Sampson. “We’ve seen in the tournament if you concede the first goal it’s incredibly difficult to win the game. This group of 23 players have shown brilliant resilience, fantastic character and excellent game discipline to come back and win that match. We’ll take huge confidence from this victory.</p> \n<p>“It’s a squad effort, the guys on the bench were absolutely outstanding today. The impact they made again. You saw the subs and their support today. The objective was to get to Vancouver, we’re there now and we want this journey to continue.”</p> \n<p>Norwegian reporters were applying factor 50 sun block in the press box at kick off where the temperature was 27 degrees centigrade. Pleasant as it was to sit in such wonderful warmth it cannot have been so nice down on the pitch where the artificial turf boosted the ground level mercury to well over 40 degrees.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/ng-interactive/2015/jun/05/womens-world-cup-canada-2015\">Women's World Cup 2015 - interactive wallchart</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Judging by his love of tactical surprise Sampson should make a fine chess player. Here he arranged England in a flexible 4-1-4-1 with Fara Williams sitting deep, Toni Duggan the attacking spearhead and Karen Carney and Fran Kirby occupying the wide roles. Controversially there was, once again, no starting place for Jill Scott in central midfield. Indeed England’s coach has not named her in a first XI since declaring Scott to be the “midfielder of Canada 2015”.</p> \n<p>Supremely confident – although not arrogant – Norway claim they are probably the tournament’s fittest team but Isabell Herlovsen swiftly emphasised she is quick as well as athletic after pouncing on a rare Carney error. That left her accelerating towards Karen Bardsley but, reacting well to the danger, Bardsley raced off her line, cleverly narrowing the angle. Suddenly under acute pressure Herlovsen miscued and the chance was lost.</p> \n<p>When Kristine Minde eluded Claire Rafferty at the far post she was well placed to meet Solveig Gulbrandsen’s long diagonal ball. Fortunately for the Lionesses the angle was awkward and Minde could not squeeze her shot into the bottom corner.</p> \n<p>Twenty-five minutes had passed before the first water break – by which time Ingrid Hjelmseth, Norway’s goalkeeper, had frequently seemed temporarily blinded by the strong sun in her eyes. Bronze had no such excuse when her ill-judged backpass was intercepted by the menacing Ada Hegerberg who creditably stayed on her feet under pressure before shooting straight at the impressive Bardsley. England could count themselves fortunate Hegerberg – who had earlier headed a presentable chance wide – did not attempt to win a penalty.</p> \n<p>It was proving a deceptively poor England performance, although Sampson’s decision to move Katie Chapman a little deeper alongside Williams did improve things. With Lene Mykjaland having rather less room for manoeuvre than before, the Lionesses at least mustered the odd attacking move. Even so the closest they came to scoring in the first half was from a 35-yard Williams free-kick which drifted over the bar and a similarly off-target Carney shot following a corner.</p> \n<p>With hindsight Sampson, whose early game plan screamed containment, was exhibiting the patience of a skilled poker specialist but it still seemed puzzling that Scott’s classy passing and technical assurance remained on the bench.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/womens-world-cup-england-coach-mark-sampson-praises-players\">Proud Mark Sampson heaps praise on England after comeback World Cup win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Across in Norway’s dug-out Even Pellerud must have been reasonably satisfied. Norway’s coach – who led his country to World Cup glory in 1995 – will celebrate his 62nd birthday next month, making him virtually 30 years Sampson’s senior. Yet while it seemed a case of the master putting the apprentice in his place Laura Bassett and Steph Houghton, England’s central defenders, were largely preventing Pellerud’s front three from wreaking too much havoc. Or rather they were until Bardsley did well to turn Gulbrandsen’s shot round a post. When the corner was whipped in to the near post by Mykjaland, Gulbrandsen dodged Rafferty before heading Norway into a far from underserved lead.</p> \n<p>As the corner was taken Scott finally came on to replace Kirby, who had been struggling badly throughout. Norway’s goalkeeper had not had a shot to save but, against all odds, she was soon beaten. The equaliser followed another corner, won this time by Scott. Houghton timed her run to meet Williams’s delivery to perfection and her ensuing header restored parity. The moment had arrived for Sampson to liberate Jodie Taylor from the bench. The Portland Thorns striker is his most incisive forward but she underwent knee surgery only eight weeks ago and the coach could not risk sending her on in Duggan’s stead any earlier.</p> \n<p>Elise Thorsnes very nearly put Norway back into the lead only seconds after stepping off the bench but her angled shot swerved fractionally over the bar. When Bardsley was forced to save from Hegerberg England appeared up against it again but Taylor’s pace and Scott’s passing had offered them a certain momentum that was amplified as Bronze hit that eye-catching winner. Appropriately the two substitutes created the goal, Scott and Taylor combining to cue up Bronze, advanced from right-back, for a fabulous drive from the edge of the area which Hjelmseth touched but could not hold.</p> \n<p>By now Norway’s proud boast of superior fitness rang hollow. Instead Pellerud’s players looked to be running on empty and were relieved to see their keeper save well to deny Chapman. Once again Sampson, supported by Bardsley’s heroics, had confounded the doubters.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435015496209/Lucy-Bronze-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England celebrate Lucy Bronze's long-range goal against Norway which secured a first ever victory in a World Cup knockout match.

Although Abby Wambach missed the penalty, the Colombians never recovered from going down a player and the loss of University of Miami keeper Perez cost them dear with her replacement at fault for the opening goal from Morgan in the 53rd minute.</p> \n<p>It was clear from the outset that the United States thought their best hope was in hitting balls from deep and wide into the penalty area towards Wambach. It was an approach that was not without logic against an uncomfortable Colombian defence but it was, nonetheless, a rather one-dimensional tactic that hardly played to the strengths of technical players such as Morgan.</p> \n<p>The 35-year-old Wambach, playing in her last World Cup, has lost the pace and power that once characterised her game, but she was still a nuisance to an inexperienced Colombian defence and she forced Perez into a superb reflex save with a snap shot in the 14th minute. Julie Johnston blasted over from close range, as the US enjoyed some early pressure and Morgan saw a header, which bounced up off the artificial turf, well tipped over.</p> \n<p>But in between those spells of American pressure, the Colombians, made up of mostly amateur and semi-professionals, played some clever passing football that was pleasing on the eye, if not particularly threatening to the US defence.</p> \n<p>Lady Andrade, who had been at the centre of the pre-match talk as she suggested the Americans were belittling her team, taunted the American defence at times with her clever footwork. But the main cost of the half had come through yellow cards to the two American players who came into the game one booking away from a suspension – Megan Rapinoe and Lauren Holiday – who will both miss the quarter-final. </p> \n<p>Goalless at the break, the feeling was that the US, while hardly justifying their ranking of second in the world, would probably find a way through and the opportunity came just two minutes after the restart.</p> \n<p>Morgan broke free, racing on to a ball over the top from Rapinoe, and burst goalward with Perez rushing off her line and tripping her on the edge of the area. The french referee, Stephanie Frappart, ruled the foul was inside the box and also sent off Perez for stopping a clear scoring opportunity. But Wambach made a mess of the penalty, floating it well wide of the post, and leaving Colombia still on level terms – albeit down to 10 players.</p> \n<p>Three minutes later though the US got in front with Morgan firing in a shot to the near post and Colombian substitute keeper Stefany Castano was unable to push it wide. Castano should have done better – both with her positioning and her reaction – and Perez would surely have done better but the Americans were now in charge of the game.</p> \n<p>It was hard to see how the Colombians, lacking potency in attack, were going to get back on level terms and the game was put beyond them in the 66th minute when Meghan Klingenberg played a delightful pass with the outside of her foot into the area to the on-running Rapinoe who was brought down by Angela Clavijo.</p> \n<p>This time, Carli Lloyd took over penalty duties and made no mistake from the spot, confidently sending Castano the wrong way and wrapping up the contest.</p> \n<p>It wasn’t a performance that would have pleased those looking to see the United States play the kind of progressive football that has been demonstrated in this tournament by the impressive French but for Ellis it was all about the result.</p> \n<p>“This is the World Cup, I am really satisfied with advancing,” said Ellis when asked if she was pleased with the way the game unfolded. “Most of the goals in World Cup tournaments, the majority of them come on set-pieces, we have been brilliant.

After completing his fourth round the FedEx Cup holder said he had “lost respect” for the USGA, which runs the second major of the year.</p> \n<p>His tantrum went viral online. “I am sorry for my actions on the 6th green,” Horschel said. “I did not hit the green with my putter but it is still not acceptable behaviour to do that. It is not the behaviour I wish to show to millions of viewers and fans. And it’s not the role model I wish to be to so many golfers in the world today. It was unacceptable and I promise to do better. Once again, I apologise.”</p> \n<p>Interestingly Horschel showed no remorse whatsoever over his stinging criticisms of the course. Mike Davis, the USGA’s executive director, will feel vindicated by a championship that threw up a dramatic finale and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/jordan-spieth-credits-caddie-us-open-victory\" title=\"\">Jordan Spieth, the star attraction of American golf, as the winner</a>. “Let’s look at how the course performed because at the end of it all that trumps everything,” Davis said.</p> \n<p>As Spieth celebrated, there was further woe for Dustin Johnson. The 31-year-old had a 12ft eagle chance on the last hole to win his first major but instead three-putted. Johnson was a notable absentee from the awards ceremony but did face the media.</p> \n<p>It was merely the latest major opportunity to be passed up by Johnson. He may deny it but psychological scarring seems inevitable. “At the end of the day golf is golf. I’ve got my family and that’s most important to me,” he said. “My trophy is holding up my little son. I couldn’t be more proud of myself and my family. No matter what, I’m going to keep my head high and I’m going to be happy.”</p> \n<p>On his first putt at the last, which slid 4ft past the hole, Johnson cited possible surface influence. “I might have pulled it a little bit but still to me it looked like it bounced left,” he said.</p> \n<p>“I’m disappointed that I three-putted the last hole. Other than that I had a damn good week. I’m happy with the way I played. I’m happy with everything in my game right now. I had a chance to win again a major on a Sunday.</p> \n<p>“Starting the week all you want is a chance to have a chance to win on the back nine on Sunday. I did that. I put myself in the position. I hit the shots I needed to hit. I just didn’t get in the hole quick enough. I had a lot of putts on the back nine from six feet and in that I missed. All of them I thought I hit good putts on.

If you ever have the chance to follow a world-class golfer around one of the planet’s great courses, take it. The way they go after fairways, attack greens, drop shots beside pins and then spin them back to within putting distance is a sight to behold. Watching a golfer make a mockery of a course’s supposed “par” score is one of the great experiences in sport.</p> \n<p>That being said, there’s also something deliciously satisfying about seeing a group of professionals clambering their way around a course and being as baffled by it as the rest of us. If you enjoy your golf with a healthy dose of schadenfreude, you will have enjoyed the US Open this weekend. </p> \n<p>Henrik Stenson likened playing the Chambers Bay course to “putting on broccoli”. Gary Player spoke with horror about the player who missed the green by a yard and end up “50 yards down in the valley”. Welcome to our world Gary; the harder we practise, the unluckier we get. For most of us, golf will always be a mournful ballad entitled “50 yards down in the valley”.</p> \n<p><strong>Gary Player:</strong><br /></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“The worst golf course I might’ve ever seen in the 63 years as a professional golfer. The USGA, who I admire and have chosen great golf courses in this great United States of America — they’re preaching speed of play. Enjoyment. User-friendly. This golf course here, if you’re a 10-handicap, you couldn’t break 100 if you had the best day of your life. They’ve got pros putting from 20 feet and hitting the ball 20 foot to the right, a man misses the green by a yard and he’s 50 yards down in the valley. I mean I don’t understand it. It’s 7,900 yards long. The world is in dire straits with water. Can you imagine the costs to maintain this? And it’s a public course, but they’ll probably charge the public $200 to play it. I’d like to challenge anyone with a 16 handicap to do better than 40 over par. It’s basically unplayable.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Sergio Garc&iacute;a:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“Why do they do this to the course? This is a great championship with great history. The US Open deserves so much better than this. It hurts to see what they have done to the course. These greens, come on, let’s be honest, you can’t say they are good. It’s just not right.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Billy Horschel:<br /></strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“I’ve been waiting for this moment all week. I think a lot of players, and I’m one of them, have lost some respect for the USGA and this championship this year for the greens. When you have a majority of the players commenting publicly, and some of them aren’t because they don’t want to get the pushback from it, then there’s an issue. I heard someone say that the TV is making the greens look worse than they are. That’s a complete lie.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Ernie Els:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“We have to go out there in front of millions of people and putt on these things. The USGA, they have got to take a bit of responsibility.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Justin Rose:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“I had a five-foot putt on the first and didn’t have the first idea what it was going to do. It felt like outdoor bingo at that point.” </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Ian Poulter:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“What wasn’t playable were the green surfaces. If this was a regular PGA tour event lots of players would have withdrawn and gone home on Wednesday, but players won’t do that for a major. They were simply the worst most disgraceful surface I have ever seen on any tour in all the years I have played. The US Open deserves better than that.’’</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Henrik Stenson:</strong></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“It is borderline laughable at some of the greens and some of the pin positions. When we’re actually almost better off plugged in a bunker than being on the top of a ridge, like on the fourth. And it’s pretty much like putting on broccoli, as well.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Dustin Johnson, who led for most of the weekend but <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/22/jordan-spieth-us-open-2015-rivalry-rory-mcilroy\">lost out to Jordan Speith at the last hole</a>, was complimentary about the course. “From the first time I played it I liked it,” he said. “It’s a lot of fun and you need to use your imagination.” What do you think?

How classy it is there, all the traditional things about it, the grass, the white outfits. In my head I even think of the wooden rackets.”</p> \n<p>Bouchard has not been smiling much over the past few months. The Canadian will go into Wimbledon in a slump that at first was annoying but soon became worrying. Twelve months ago the 21-year-old seemed the heir apparent and the darling of the photographers as she reached her first grand slam final. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/05/petra-kvitova-crushes-eugenie-bouchard-second-wimbledon-title\" title=\"\">Although she was well beaten by an inspired Petra Kvitova in the final</a>, she finished the year ranked No 7 and as she began 2015, she seemed set for even bigger things.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/10/whats-wrong-with-eugenie-bouchard\">What's wrong with Eugenie Bouchard?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/10/whats-wrong-with-eugenie-bouchard\" title=\"\">But somewhere along the line things have gone wrong</a>. Going into her match with the American, Alison Riske, in Eastbourne on Tuesday, Bouchard has lost her opening match in seven events this year and, almost more worryingly, she has been getting into winning positions only to let them slide, losing five of those matches in three sets. Last year she showed herself to be a fighter, scrapping through numerous matches; this year she has been folding under the pressure.</p> \n<p>Struggling in the so-called “sophomore year” is nothing new. Many champions have battled to cope with the increased expectations after a big season. The former world No1 Chris Evert pointed out recently that outside her stellar grand slam efforts – two semi-finals and a final – Bouchard also had nine first-round defeats in 2014 so this year’s travails are not wildly out of the blue. However, the manner of the defeats is disturbing and even the usually mentally strong Bouchard is beginning to wonder what is happening to her.</p> \n<p>“At the beginning I was really impatient,” she says. “I expected this year to be like last year and even better. But as it’s gone on, I’ve realised, maybe it is a slump, I’m in a little downward curve and it’s actually normal because first of all everyone told me it’s going to happen and then everyone’s telling me it’s happening right now, so maybe it actually is.</p> \n<p>“Then I realised I should just accept it. It’s not going great right now. Although I feel better in the gym, I feel better on the practice court, the results are still not there but I know that, if I do the proper things, the results will come eventually, whether it’s this week or next week, at the US Open Series or even next year.</p> \n<p>“So the way I’ve learned to accept it and deal with it is just to say, you know what, I could lose a couple more matches and I’ll still survive. It’s just a tennis match. I feel like people freak out so early. They’re quick to jump on me when I do well; they’re quick to jump on me when I lose. I am just trying not to worry about it.”</p> \n<p>When winning is your job, that is not easy. And typically, when the chips are down, the daggers sharpen. Sports Pro Magazine recently made Bouchard No1 in their list of the “most marketable athletes”, a list based on future earnings potential as much as anything. With William Morris Endeavour having acquired IMG in December 2013, Bouchard, now an IMG player, is in the same stable as both Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams, with whom she shares an agent. Sharapova and Williams are the two highest female earners in the sport, according to Forbes Magazine and, while Bouchard is not yet in their league, she already boasts high-profile deals including Nike, Babolat and Coca-Cola, with whom she signed a three-year deal last summer.</p> \n<p>Bouchard was snapped up by IMG Models in December 2014 and this year has conducted a number of high-profile photo-shoots for various magazines. Inevitably some suggested she should “spend more time on the court” and there was little attempt to hide the sexism.</p> \n<p>“I have heard lots of comments like that,” says Bouchard, who adds that modelling is hard work. “I didn’t realise I had to be playing tennis 24 hours a day. If I’m not doing a shoot, then maybe I’ll just be at the mall – does that mean I’m not allowed to go to the mall any more? Am I not allowed to go to a movie or not watch another sport? There are always going to be people who disagree with what you do but that means at least you stood up for something and did something in your life.”</p> \n<p>On the surface Bouchard is made of strong stuff and seems not to care too much what people think about her. She stands by her statement from last year that she has no time or inclination to make friends on Tour; this is her livelihood. In a Fed Cup tie in April – the second time she had done this – she refused to shake hands with her opponent at the draw ceremony, leaving Alexandra Dulgheru hanging, to much embarrassment all round. It backfired spectacularly as Bouchard promptly lost both her singles matches as Canada lost the tie.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>“In terms of this handshake I almost think maybe I should have [done it] because it created such a thing, that to me was so small,” she says, with more than a hint of exasperation in her voice. “Everyone always says, be yourself, be yourself, but then they tell you what to do, so they contradict themselves. I’m going to do what I believe in and, if I am here at a tournament, I believe I’m here to work and not to socialise, so that’s what I do. I’ve been told to be myself, so I think that’s what I try to do.”</p> \n<p>Having enjoyed the best year of her career, Bouchard surprised almost everyone in the sport by announcing she had parted ways from Nick Saviano, the coach credited with a lot of her success. Her new coach is Sam Sumyk, the man who helped Victoria Azarenka to the world No1 spot, but in terms of results the pair have not exactly hit the ground running.</p> \n<p>If there is one thing that might inspire a return to form, though, it is a return to Wimbledon, where she won the junior title in 2012 and where last year she played with the aggression and the confidence that has been so lacking this year to date, standing tight to the baseline and always looking to dictate. “I have obviously looked back on those couple of weeks and have such nice feelings thinking about it,” she says. “I have thought: ‘What was I doing during that tournament that made me play so well?’ I was in my bubble. I’ve thought about what I was focusing on and maybe going back to that experience to try to play better. I’m just trying to focus on what I’m doing now and hopefully the great memories I can create this year.”</p> \n<p>Despite the doom and gloom of the first half of 2015, Bouchard remains just outside the top 10 at No 12 and her goals have not dimmed. “My first goal is just to win a grand slam and, if I could choose, it would be Wimbledon,” she says. “Having that title and that success is something that I’ve dreamed of since I was younger. If you do that and have a good year as well, then maybe there’s a good chance you’ll be No1.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434997721474/Aegon-Classic-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Eugenie Bouchard has endured a difficult start to the 2015 season, losing in her opening round of competitions on six occasions.

Murray was 21 and he was not pleased with the Swede taking two sets off him, railing loudly at the referee over a perceived grievance, then rediscovering his cool to close out the match in a blur of powerful forehands. It was the summer of the wrist injury that sent him into a spiral of gloom and this win lifted his spirits substantially.</p> \n<p>On the eve of Wimbledon Bjorkman thinks Murray has excellent prospects of repeating his win over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/07/andy-murray-wimbledon-win-djokovic\" title=\"\">Novak Djokovic in the 2013 final</a>, although he invests his thoughts with professional caution.</p> \n<p>“I am very happy to come in and be part of his team with Am&eacute;lie and Treacs [his conditioner Matt Little],” he said. “Everyone has done a phenomenal job. Obviously I saw him player to player. I always had a great relationship with him – he is a great guy.</p> \n<p>“I see a lot of similarities between us. He is a perfectionist. He can hit 15 great shots, miss the 16th and be frustrated about that. I was exactly the same. It was something I had to work on as well. I was probably the one who criticised myself the hardest in my team.</p> \n<p>“When I was losing, if I played bad, I was a bad person. If I played good, I was a good person. I was very harsh on myself. I learned during my career to be more relaxed.”</p> \n<p>The effect of that influence was palpable on Sunday. “He didn’t miss much,” Bjorkman continued. “He’s doing well. It’s tough not to be frustrated week in and week out. It’s something everyone feels and we all show it differently. He’s done a good job with [meeting his own expectations] and hopefully we can continue with that in the coming weeks.”</p> \n<p>Bjorkman has known Mauresmo for a long time too. “From the first day I came in, it’s been a lot of fun, all the guys doing a great job, easy-going. For me and Am&eacute;lie it was easy as well, once I was approached and had the first phone call from Andy. Then I spoke to Amelie quite a lot.</p> \n<p>“She was one of the few girls that I knew out there because there weren’t so many combined events and one of her best friends was Fabrice Santoro, who was also one of my closer friends. That’s why I felt very confident and comfortable coming into this situation to be part of a team and I think she is feeling the same.</p> \n<p>“It’s easy because Am&eacute;lie is such a cool girl. I think we both have a good feeling of being part of a team. Each week is a combination because everyone cannot travel all the time; we are a pretty big team.</p> \n<p>“When we were [together] in Barcelona it was easy, me and her chit-chatting. In Madrid we had a couple of days together. We are on the phone every day going through tactics. When I was in Munich she was coming in with feedback because you can see something on TV which you can’t see maybe sitting low at courtside. It was the same when I was not with them – I could come in maybe with some comments.</p> \n<p>“It’s been working great. I think we will find it very easy to do the best for Andy.</p> \n<p>“Am&eacute;lie is in week 31 now. After Wimbledon she has to go back and rest and get prepared for – I mean no offence to Andy – probably the biggest event she’s been part of, to deliver a baby, which is very exciting. Then it will be a lot of travelling but a lot of fun.”</p> \n<p>Bjorkman is not a stereotypical, quiet Swede. He always let his emotions flow – on the court and now in Murray’s team. “Every time I won a point, I had ‘the fist’. I was always pretty emotional. Maybe the other [Swedish] guys were a little more calm. For me it’s natural. I try to be calm but it’s definitely different to be sitting outside. It’s a lot more nerve-racking.”</p> \n<p>On a practical level Bjorkman is amazed by Murray’s fitness. “He is in incredible shape. I don’t think there are too many out there who are stronger than him. With the confidence he gained making the [2014 ATP World Tour Finals], which was his big goal at the end of last year, playing almost every week in the end, it made him get off to a good start this year.</p> \n<p>“The combination of that confidence and being really strong – and not only strong to play five sets but moving quickly almost more than he has done – that has always been his strength but he is looking really good with that.</p> \n<p>“I really was impressed with the way he practised in Barcelona. He is very professional in everything he does. I didn’t know that about him before.”</p> \n<p>On court Bjorkman is impressed with Murray’s maturing mix of subtlety and aggression – the very qualities he brought to the final set against him in New York eight years ago.</p> \n<p>“The returning has been excellent. He has been finding his way of positioning on the return, especially off the second serves. I think he has a perfect position now. He has benefited from that on clay and even more now on the grass because he can continue to put pressure on his opponents by coming in, not too far in, but find a good balance.</p> \n<p>“We are also trying then to get him comfortable and confident in moving in when he has the guy under pressure. When you have him out stretching for a slice, maybe to sneak in and have an easy volley instead of starting over. Even though he is great with that – to start over and win it again – I think he can save some energy on that.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434981150598/Aegon-Championships---Day-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray poses with the Queen's trophy and (left-right) fitness coach Matt Little, coach Jonas Bjorkman and physio Shane Annun in the dressing room after his victory over Kevin Anderson.

Since the Amateur Boxing Association of England reformed in 2013 and became England Boxing, it has had to comply with the worldwide regulations.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/paul-smith-defeat-andre-ward-las-vegas\">Paul Smith’s time is nearly up after defeat to Andre Ward in Las Vegas | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It means English coaches – who are often involved at both levels of boxing – have had to make either professional or amateur fighters their priority. Many have been forced to concentrate on the professionals and are therefore no longer permitted to work with amateurs during competitions, resulting in a breakdown of confidence for some youngsters.</p> \n<p>Steve O’Rourke, who coaches at Wodensborough amateur boxing club in Wednesbury, West Midlands, said: “Grassroots boxing is going to suffer. Without good amateur coaches you don’t get an Amir Khan or a Carl Froch. GB and England Boxing are given diamonds to polish, it’s the normal club coaches who work hundreds of hours a year, all voluntary and free of charge. I just think we’ve been sold down the river.</p> \n<p>“Your local kids who take drugs, who get in trouble and come from poverty-stricken areas where it’s the norm to do unsociable things … people are going to close their gyms and those are the kids who will suffer.”</p> \n<p>Stefy Bull, who manages and promotes 10 professionals including Gavin and Jamie McDonnell, believes the 50 carded amateurs at his gym in Mexborough, South Yorkshire, have suffered as a result.</p> \n<p>“These kids are being kept off the street, we’re keeping them busy and active,” he said. “But first and foremost I am a professional promoter and manager. It’s my livelihood. I love the grassroots but I’ve now got no involvement in amateur boxing. I can’t go in the corner with these kids. It’s terrible, you’re trying to build relationships with these youngsters, give them confidence. It’s crazy. Apparently you can coach an amateur boxer but can’t go in their corner. You can’t get your head around it. What kind of rule is that?</p> \n<p>“If you’ve got a great relationship with a young kid, who is listening to you in the gym, has trust in you and all of a sudden after weeks together they are in a fight, they look for you and you aren’t there; how does that youngster feel when the one person they trust isn’t there when they need them? Boxing is intimidating enough, even with support.”</p> \n<p>Bull’s view is one echoed by a number of coaches across England. Dan Kelly works at Birkenhead Venture gym on Merseyside in one of the country’s most deprived areas. He said: “There have been seven or eight amateurs in recent months that have gone into tournaments without me in the corner and they have told me they’ve been devastated.</p> \n<p>“ I feel guilty. Some of them, the younger ones, don’t understand the politics of it all. Our gym is in one of the worst areas in Europe. We won a community award not so long ago for the kids we took off the streets. But we feel it’s being taken away from us by Aiba.”</p> \n<p>Tom Chaney, the head coach at Hall Green Boxing Club in Birmingham, said: “You can still coach the kids, but you can’t drive them to a venue, you can’t get them weighed in. I have had good kids leave my gym because I can’t take them in. That’s not just me, it’s around the country. It has put amateur boxing backwards. I was nearly crying in the car, they have taken everything away.”</p> \n<p>England Boxing formed a new board in late 2013 following a sustained period of in-fighting among administrators, which caused the organisation to lose a significant chunk of funding from Sport England. Having reformed, it is obliged to implement international rules as decreed by Aiba or it risks fighters being barred from international competitions and even the Olympics.</p> \n<p>However, Rob McCracken has been the GB boxing performance director since 2009 and was the head of Britain’s team at London 2012. Throughout he has remained in the corner of Froch, the four-times super-middleweight world champion. Coaches cannot understand why it is permitted for an amateur official to be in a professional’s corner but not the other way around.</p> \n<p>Giorgio Brugnoli, an England Boxing director and secretary of Aiba’s technical rules commission, says Aiba want fighters to have a career through its own competitions. It has recently launched its own professional tournament called Aiba Pro Boxing, in addition to Aiba Open Boxing bouts and the World Series of Boxing that has run for five years.</p> \n<p>Brugnoli believes Aiba’s intentions are good but that the culture of professional boxing in England, run by the British Boxing Board of Control, means the regulations will always cause problems for coaches across the country.</p> \n<p>“Aiba want a kid who starts in AOB to continue right the way through and have a career in boxing through Aiba,” said Brugnoli. “But it’s not possible with the British Board of Boxing Control. In England budding potential professionals would go through the BBBC. In Asia, Africa and a lot of countries there is no professional boxing. We live in a different boxing culture to those who box in Nigeria, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan for example. I do empathise with the coaches, I think they have a very strong argument. Why should a coach who has had a kid since the age of nine, 10, 11, 12 be told you can’t go in the corner with them when they box just because they’re professional. It’s wrong. I’m hopeful the situation can change.”</p> \n<p>Daniel Geey, a sports lawyer at Fieldfisher, said: “Many individuals participating in amateur and professional boxing have been severely affected by the regulations the Aiba have put in place. No real rationale or justification has been given by Aiba as to why this artificial distinction is warranted or indeed necessary.

He was just about punch perfect. He moved well and his timing and judgment of distance were as good as ever. But he was under little pressure for all but a few moments.</p> \n<p>So complete was Ward’s domination of Smith, it was difficult to tell if he could have done as convincing a job against a better opponent – or could yet do so down the line. Would he have looked so good (for a second time) against Carl Froch at super-middleweight, for instance – or Sergey Kovalev at light-heavy? Could middleweight Gennady Golovkin move up and give him a good fight at catchweight?</p> \n<p>All of those are legitimate questions, but we are none the wiser because not only did Smith come in more than 4lb over the limit, he was never going to stretch Ward once he went into survival mode – which was in round one and went all the way through to the bloody end.</p> \n<p>As Nick Halling said on Sky, Smith can expect some media flak for not only failing to make weight but for failing to mount a meaningful challenge in the biggest fight of his career.</p> \n<p>Smith’s brother, Callum, understandably perhaps, doesn’t see it quite like that.</p> \n<p>Callum fights Christopher Rebrasse – who lost to George Groves – at the Echo Arena in Liverpool on Friday for the WBC silver super-middleweight title. He was clearly disappointed with his brother’s defeat when we spoke on Sunday, but made a case for him.</p> \n<p>“We always knew it was going to be a tough ask for Paul, special fighter that Ward is,” he said. “He’s head and shoulders above everyone in the super-middleweight division. I think he’s proved that with people he’s beaten over the years. But Paul went over there and gave a good account of himself. He did well, didn’t take a lot of punishment early on. But, as the fight went on, Ward started to get into his rhythm. But Paul took the fight when a lot of people would not have done. He always gives 100%.</p> \n<p>“The plan was for Paul not to take a lot and then, when he got his chances, to let his shots go, but credit to Ward. It was a bit like [Manny] <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/may/02/floyd-mayweather-v-manny-pacquiao-mgm-las-vegas-live\">Pacquiao and [Floyd] Mayweather</a>. People were screaming for Pacquaio to throw more shots, but it’s hard to do when Floyd’s not there. Ward was never there to be countered. His feet were good. He was always out of range when Paul was planning an attack. Ward is a very special fighter.”</p> \n<p>After Smith landed a solitary hook-jab in the fourth, his trainer, Joe Gallagher, told him, “You’re getting in good positions, Paul, but you’re not pulling the trigger. You’ve got nothing to lose. Let them go.”</p> \n<p>While Smith tried in the fifth, there was so much coming back from different angles he could not settle. It was as if Ward was reading his mind, filling in the gaps as he pleased.</p> \n<p>“He’s getting bored, Paul,” Gallagher kidded him after five rounds. “Time the right hand.”</p> \n<p>He finally did, rocking him in the seventh, his best round – which he still lost – but retaliation was swift and painful in the eighth. Gallagher threw in the towel in the ninth. Smith, bleeding and bruised, appreciated the gesture.</p> \n<p>The oldest of the four fighting Smiths, Smigga has probably edged closer to retirement after 41 contests, two of them failed world title challenges against Arthur Abraham, and this non-title headliner against an opponent entitled to be compared, at his best and fighting regularly, with Floyd Mayweather as the sport’s finest, pound-for-pound.</p> \n<p>Beforehand Smith told Sky: “I loaded up with fluids, wrong set of scales in the hotel bathroom. Didn’t get to the officials until Friday morning. Genuine, honest mistake. I made 168 in September, it’s not as if I have problems with my weight.”</p> \n<p>It would have made no difference either way. Smith is a straight-up guy but, in the fight of his career, he was out of his depth. It will not be a night he looks back on with a single fond memory.</p> \n<p>Callum, meanwhile, is moving smoothly through his own career. “I can’t really look past Rebrasse. It’s a tough fight. But a win there gets me the WBC silver title, and that opens a few doors. I’m getting closer and closer to a world title. This fight is a good step up for me. I’m only young. I’m not in any rush.”</p> \n<p>And that, perhaps, was Paul’s problem. At 32, he was just running out of time.</p> \n<h2>The real problem </h2> \n<p>If Adrien Broner was as good as he thinks he is, he’d be Floyd Mayweather.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately for the man who calls himself The Problem, he’s Adrien Broner, and, although he scored a late knockdown, all he shared with Shawn Porter on Saturday night was a boxing ring for 12 rounds.</p> \n<p>There’s their odd spelling of a first name, too – but the problems on the night were nearly all Adrien’s. He doesn’t look to have fully recovered from those knockdowns against Marcos Maidana and, although skilled, boxes self-consciously, the pose as important to him as the execution.</p> \n<p>For 11 rounds he boxed as if Porter was Mike Tyson. When he did threw a proper shot – in the 12th round – the man from Cincinnati put the man from Cleveland on the seat of his pants. And Ohio was the winner in the end.</p> \n<p>Porter recovered, finished strongly and deserved the wide points verdict.</p> \n<p>Whatever some revisionists said, he did not beat Kell Brook, and he would not do so in a rematch – at whatever weight. He boiled down to a catchweight of 144lbs for this one and still looked markedly bigger than Broner.</p> \n<p>“I”m OK,” said Adrien. “My kid’s OK. I’m financially OK. It’s OK.”</p> \n<p>But he knows it ain’t OK. That attitude is nearly as bad as his previous belief that he is Floyd’s natural heir.</p> \n<p>Brook, by the way, looks to have been relaxing heartily since defending his title against Frankie Gavin, filling out his sharply tailored suit behind the Sky Sports desk with button-straining efficiency – to the point where he appeared bigger than middleweight Matthew Macklin.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/21/1434921160564/Paul-Smith-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Paul Smith defends himself against Andre Ward in California on Saturday night in a fight Smith lost.

I don’t have to come back for financial reasons or the lights or the glamour. The only reason I would come back is because I miss the competition of fighting the very best.</p> \n<p>“I feel amazing.

I am young, I am healthy and I feel great. 42 is the new 32.”</p> \n<p>After losing to Mayweather on a split decision in May 2007, De La Hoya revealed last week that a rematch clause with his unbeaten compatriot had already expired. But with Mayweather yet to announce his next opponent following his victory over Pacquiao, De La Hoya indicated that he would only be interested in returning to fight his old adversary or reigning WBA and IBO middleweight champion Gennady Golovkin.</p> \n<p>“I just feel good and when I walk the streets, everyone tells me, ‘You have to fight Floyd again, you have to fight GGG. You can do it, you can do it’,” he said.</p> \n<p>“I just feel great physically. I’ve been taking care of myself. I’ve been doing the Bernard Hopkins lifestyle. You can turn the clock back to a certain time.</p> \n<p>“I want to fight one of them because they are the best and I always fought the best. That’s what boxing is all about - fighting the best.”</p> \n<p>De La Hoya, who has a history of drug and alcohol abuse, has had two spells in rehab since retiring. But he insisted that he dreams of emulating Sugar Ray Leonard, who returned to the sport after nearly three years out to beat reigning middleweight champion Marvin Hagler in 1987.</p> \n<p>“Right now I feel the best I have felt in my life physically, emotionally, mentally because I haven’t touched alcohol for I don’t know how long. I’m training. I feel great. But it has to be worth my while,” said De La Hoya.</p> \n<p>“Would I do it? I don’t know but I wake up every morning thinking that I can. I think about Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvin Hagler. If [Leonard] could do it, why can’t I? We both come from similar situations. We are both hungry for the competition, we’re both ambitious. So you never know.

Earlier this year, the organisation published figures that showed the average amount of PE offered in schools – no longer measured by the government – had dropped well below the recommended two hours minimum per week.</p> \n<p>Baroness Sue Campbell, the chair of the Youth Sport Trust who previously oversaw the creation of the UK Sport formula that delivered an unprecedented upsurge in gold medals at elite level, said then it painted a “bleak and worrying” picture.</p> \n<p>The new report, The Class of 2035, seeks to outline a range of possible scenarios for the future of school sport over the next two decades – from an optimistic prognosis where technology and innovation help reverse current trends to one in which children are “effectively isolated from their environment and cut off from the demands of their bodies”.</p> \n<p>Eighteen months before the London Olympics the then education secretary Michael Gove scrapped &pound;162m in annual ring-fenced funding for the regional School Sports Partnerships network that linked primary and secondary schools and organised inter-school competition.</p> \n<p>Following a huge outcry, he was forced into a partial U-turn. Following the Games, that funding was eventually replaced with &pound;150m a year for primary schools, which has been guaranteed until 2020. Oliver said the PE and Sport Premium – which amounts to &pound;8,000 a year for each primary school plus an additional &pound;5 per each pupil – had helped improve physical literacy and lay “strong foundations” but added: “The challenge is to maintain these gains as children become more engaged with digital technology.”</p> \n<p>However, critics say that leaving individual primary headteachers to decide how to spend the extra money has led to a picture of patchwork provision, without the necessary links with local clubs and secondary schools that could help make the most of it. The new YST research shows that three-quarters of young people say they enjoy PE lessons in school, almost two-thirds say they feel better about themselves after doing sport and 40% would like to do more exercise. But nearly a quarter think playing a computer game with friends is a form of exercise and 35% speak to friends more on social media than in person. While some video games require movement, they remain in a minority.</p> \n<p>In common with the challenges in adult sports participation – where recent figures showed a worrying overall decline over the last six months – the report illustrates a sharp divide between those who are seen to be “sporty”, who are the main recipients of school and local authority resources, and the rest.</p> \n<p>A report from UKActive published last week showed that primary schools were currently failing to adequately track the fitness and activity levels of pupils and monitoring lagged well behind the data recorded for other key elements of the curriculum.</p> \n<p>Its research also highlighted figures from 2013 that showed half of seven-year-olds were not meeting the recommended 60 minutes of daily physical activity highlighted in the chief medical officer’s guidelines for children. “We know that even greater numbers fail to meet recommended guidelines as children enter their teens when drop-off rates in activity accelerate,” it said.

And we also need to ensure this time every London borough benefits. Dagenham, Harrow and Croydon residents need to feel the more homely Commonwealth Games is their Games, just as much as those boroughs where the big stadiums are sited,” he said, highlighting one of the criticisms of the otherwise successful London Olympics.</p> \n<p>“I would want to see groups of London boroughs working with the local business community to bid to host particular sports to help ensure the Games’ events are properly shared across the capital. And from early on in the bid team’s thinking, a clear, long-term, grassroots sports development plan needs to be in place.”</p> \n<p>He told the Guardian that London was the home of the Commonwealth and that as the capital had not held the Games since 1934 it was time to bring it back.

The 33-year-old was displaced by the Belgian last term and made only seven league appearances, in which he conceded two goals with all those games won, as Jos&eacute; Mourinho’s side claimed the fourth title of the player’s 11-season career at the club.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/22/john-terry-petr-cech-arsenal\">John Terry says Petr Cech would be worth 12 to 15 points to Arsenal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Chelsea praised Cech’s professionalism last season but feared frustration at life spent largely on the sidelines would prompt him to request a move and talks were held last week after his return from international duty. They would have been more comfortable selling Cech abroad, particularly as Paris Saint-Germain had expressed interest but the player is reluctant to uproot his family back to France where he had played at Rennes. He made clear his priority was to remain in London, further encouraging Arsenal’s conviction he will be secured this summer.</p> \n<p>While personal terms have effectively been agreed between Cech and Arsenal, at improved terms of around &pound;100,000 a week, talks between the clubs continue over the fee. Chelsea are seeking up to &pound;15m for a player who has also claimed four FA Cups, three League Cups, a European Cup and a Europa League during his time at Stamford Bridge, while Arsenal hope to pay nearer &pound;10m.</p> \n<p>Cech’s first game for Arsenal is likely to be the Community Shield against his former club at Wembley on 2 August. He may be followed to the Emirates by his goalkeeping coach, Christophe Lollichon, who could replace Swansea City-bound Tony Roberts. Mourinho already has Silvino Louro, one of his assistant first-team coaches, on his staff, though Chelsea could still recruit from outside.</p> \n<p>The decision to allow Cech to leave is considered exceptional by the Chelsea hierarchy and was effectively sanctioned by Roman Abramovich despite Mourinho’s reluctance, expressed publicly towards the end of last season, to lose him to rivals and title challengers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/22/john-terry-petr-cech-arsenal\" title=\"\">John Terry echoed those sentiments on Monday</a>. “There is obviously talk of Arsenal signing Petr and, if they do get Pete, that will strengthen them for sure,” the Chelsea captain told TalkSport. “He will save them 12 to 15 points a season. I am sure if he does leave the club, which nobody wants to see even if we understand he wants to play football, he is going to be sorely missed. He will improve whatever side he goes to.”</p> \n<p>Arsenal finished 12 points behind Chelsea last season, when their goalkeeping duties were shared by Wojciech Szczesny and David Ospina. The latter may leave if Cech arrives and Fenerbahce are keen to take the Colombian to Istanbul. The champions, too, would have to enter the market to purchase a replacement and have expressed interest in Stoke’s Asmir Begovic and Rob Green at QPR.</p> \n<p>Cech lost his starting place at Chelsea at the beginning of last season after Courtois’ three-year spell on loan at Atl&eacute;tico Madrid was curtailed. Cech still went on to make 16 appearances, including in the Capital One Cup final and on the last afternoon of the season when the title was celebrated, but the club consider the Belgian first-choice for the foreseeable future. “Petr and Thibaut are up there with the best goalkeepers in the world,” Terry said. “Big Petr’s career has been at the very top.</p> \n<p>“To take Pete out of the team, you have to be a great talent. Thibaut has done that. Petr has been very good as well because when you are a professional it is difficult to accept. He has been an unbelievable professional.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/8/8/1407486372739/Petr-Cech-hestrane1-012.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images","altText":"Petr Cech hestrane1","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-22T18:57:29Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T23:55:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Dominic Fifield","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/22/1400768136849/Dominic-Fifield-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/dominicfifield"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Arsenal","Chelsea","Transfer window","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/arsenal","webTitle":"Arsenal"},{"id":"football/chelsea","webTitle":"Chelsea"},{"id":"football/transfer-window","webTitle":"Transfer window"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Dominic Fifield","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/dominicfifield"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#005689","matchStatusPre":"#676767","matchStatusDuring":"#4bc6df","matchStatusAbandoned":"#da1d1d","matchStatusPost":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"football"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/22/petr-cech-arsenal-chelsea","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a2z3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/22/petr-cech-arsenal-chelsea","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/22/petr-cech-arsenal-chelsea"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2014/8/8/1407486372739/Petr-Cech-hestrane1-012.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Petr Cech has all but completed a move to Arsenal.
