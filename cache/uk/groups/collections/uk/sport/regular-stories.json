After 31 years of consistent disappointment against Germany, Mark Sampson’s side beat them for the first time and will return home with the set of bronze medals awarded to the tournament’s third-placed side.</p> \n<p>Fara Williams had been excellent all afternoon and, appropriately, it was her extra-time penalty in Edmonton which secured this famous victory. Much more than a local squabble between the two losing semi-finalists, the match served as a barometer of England’s impressive progress since Silvia Neid’s side swatted them aside 3-0 in a friendly at Wembley last November.</p> \n<p>This was not the way a woman described as “the greatest coach in the history of the women’s game” by Sampson had intended to mark her final fixture in charge of Germany before stepping down, and Neid looked suitably miffed. She is unlikely to be the last manager to be outwitted by the 32-year-old Welshman.</p> \n<p>In finishing third, he has presided over the most successful English World Cup campaign by a team of either gender since 1966 and will surely feature on the country’s next honours list.</p> \n<p>“An incredible result,” said Sampson. “I’m incredibly proud to finally beat Germany, finish third and return home as the best team in Europe. This team will be remembered forever. We felt we could win the World Cup so losing to Japan was tough to take but we’ve gone on to achieve something special.”</p> \n<p>Another game meant another opportunity for a little more tactical experimentation on Sampson’s part. Sure enough, he showcased a back three.</p> \n<p>The idea was presumably to thwart Celia Sasic and company but England’s coach had taken a risk by asking Jo Potter, normally a midfielder, to operate alongside Steph Houghton and Laura Bassett in that defensive trinity.</p> \n<p>When, before kick-off, Bassett’s name was announced over the public address system, the Commonwealth Stadium erupted into a spontaneous cheer. Everyone knew all about the agony of her stoppage-time own goal in the semi-final against Japan here on Wednesday and most would have been delighted to see her defend with poise and assurance.</p> \n<p>With Germany starting strongly, though, Potter very nearly scored an own goal of her own when she appeared set to turn a cross beyond Karen Bardsley’s grasp. Happily, Steph Houghton was on hand to rescue the situation, England’s captain making a superb, last-gasp, highly acrobatic, clearance off the line.</p> \n<p>Sasic may be the tournament’s leading scorer but she should have done better than direct an inviting early chance straight into Bardsley’s grateful arms.</p> \n<p>It was time for the Lionesses to remind everyone that they do not know the meaning of giving up. True to character, they rallied with only a scuffed shot preventing Houghton from scoring and Germany’s Tabea Kemme surviving English claims that she should have conceded a handball penalty.</p> \n<p>By now Lucy Bronze was justifying her label as one of the stars of Canada 2015 by driving Sampson’s side on from right wing-back. As the half-time whistle blew Germany had contributed the more fluent passing but neither side had proved able to take advantage of mutually vulnerable defences and unleash that all-important incisive final ball.</p> \n<p>Neid, though, was becoming increasingly vexed by what she clearly perceived as some rough-house tactics from England, including some rather wince-inducing challenges.</p> \n<p>If a sparse crowd, shivering in suddenly chill conditions out of step with the warmth Edmonton had enjoyed in previous days, did not exactly help the atmosphere, the action remained intense.</p> \n<p>Bardsley performed wonders to turn Sara D&auml;britz’s volley around a post after her connection with Sasic’s cross threatened to shatter the impasse.</p> \n<p>Sampson adjusted the power balance by replacing Ellen White with Eniola Aluko. Yet as much as Aluko’s pace and directness ruffled Germany, when Kemme dribbled beyond three markers Bardsley looked mighty relieved to see her shot whizz fractionally wide.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/chile-argentina-copa-america-final-match-report\">Chile 0-0 Argentina (Chile win 4-1 on pens) | Copa Am&eacute;rica final match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>With England now less about containment than a growing willingness to press Germany higher up the pitch, things had become very open. Sampson thought his side deserved a penalty when Williams’s 30-yard shot was blocked but his pleas proved forlorn.</p> \n<p>Extra time beckoned. In its second period the breakthrough finally arrived when Kemme hauled down Lianne Sanderson. Despite considerable German protests, led by Nadine Angerer, Williams stepped up to take the penalty, and her low kick sent Angerer the wrong way.</p> \n<p>There were a couple of frights when Anja Mittag’s free-kick forced Bardsley into a fine save and again as Bianca Schmidt headed an Alexandra Popp cross wide, but England were on a mission. The Lionesses had an important audience watching on television back home and, refusing to disappoint their new public, they held on long enough to ensure history was made.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/usa-soccer-moms-womens-world-cup\">USA's soccer moms aim for one final effort before returning to family life</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/4/1436049501224/Fara-Williams-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Fara Williams steps up to convert the extra-time penalty that ended England's tournament on a high.

She played the first game, against France, on the left of midfield but then captured her preferred position from Alex Scott. Not content with merely defending superbly, the 23-year-old who spent her early childhood living on Holy Island, or Lindisfarne, off the north Northumberland coast, also scored a spectactular <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/womens-world-cup-norway-england-match-report\" title=\"\">long-range winner against Norway </a>in the round of 16 and registered a vital <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/28/england-send-hosts-canada-packing-in-tense-quarter-final\" title=\"\">quarter-final header against Canada</a>. No wonder they are talking about the dawn of “The Bronze Age” in English women’s football. Mark Sampson, England’s coach says she is the best right-back in the world.</p> \n<h2>2 Aya Miyama – Japan </h2> \n<p>When Miyama plays well, so, invariably, do Japan. The 5ft 2in central midfielder tends to be at the hub of their best passing moves and also serves as the team’s set-piece specialist and penalty taker. This is the 30-year-old captain’s fourth World Cup, with the highlight of her career arriving when she lifted the trophy four years ago in Germany. A self-confessed coffee addict, Miyama now appears for the Okayama Yunogo Belle club but spent extensive parts of her career in the United States, playing in Los Angeles and Atlanta. A lovely midfielder to watch, she <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams\" title=\"\">posed England plenty of problems in the semi-final</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams\">Women's World Cup 2015: England dream dies with heartbreaking own goal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>3 Kadeisha Buchanan – Canada</h2> \n<p>At only 19 Buchanan is a dynamic, remarkably assured central defender known not only for rarely losing aerial battles but an ability to play the ball smoothly out from the back. She represents a big reason why John Herdman, Canada’s English coach, believes the future is bright for women’s football in the host country. The youngest of seven sisters brought up by a single mother, Buchanan combines life as a university student with playing for the Virginia Mountaineers in the United States. This will surely be the first of several World Cups for a young woman who makes a habit of exceeding expectations. “Kadeisha is the Christine Sinclair of my defence,” says Herdman. Praise indeed.</p> \n<h2>4 Carli Lloyd – USA</h2> \n<p>Pia Sundhage, the former USA coach, claimed Lloyd was difficult to work with because of a constant craving for praise, but there has been no sign of mental fragility from the attacking midfielder or second striker at Canada 2015. A big-occasion player, Lloyd – who has scored 66 goals in 201 international appearances – can look peripheral before suddenly scoring vital, wonderfully incisive goals. Her winner against China and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/30/womens-world-cup-usa-into-final-after-carli-lloyd-tames-germany\" title=\"\">penalty against Germany</a> are two big reasons why Jill Ellis’s side find themselves in the final. At 32 and now with Houston Dash, Lloyd appears in her prime. “She’s having the tournament of her life,” says her team-mate Abby Wambach.</p> \n<h2>5 Lady Andrade – Colombia</h2> \n<p>Even her team-mates say the brash 23-year-old star of Colombia’s World Cup could do with living up to the first part of her name a little more, but there is no doubt this improvisational creator lit up the tournament. Her adhesive control, breathtaking change of pace and vision enabled Lady Andrade to bewitch fans and bewilder opponents in equal measure as her side progressed from the group stage of a World Cup for the first time. Along the way the attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward scored in her country’s shock 2-0 group stage win over France and also contributed a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/england-colombia-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">consolation goal in the defeat against England</a>.

Fair enough but Bassett, at 31, is unlikely to feature in another World Cup semi-final. That is the sad and cruel reality of sport – and how her heart must still be breaking 72 hours later.</p> \n<p><strong>Such a moment of misfortune </strong>could happen to any footballer and since the ball cannoned in off the bar to send Japan through to tomorrow’s final she must have questioned everything from ‘why me?’ to ‘why was I not a yard forward or back, left or right?’ But it’s done and nothing can be changed. Like any broken heart, the best way to mend it is by looking forward, not back. A win over Germany to finish third and as the best European side would be a decent start – even if the third place playoff is often the most dull match of any tournament.</p> \n<p><strong>Either way, Bassett will start tonight</strong> according to the head coach, Mark Sampson, and he said she is in a good place. Bassett, who (it cannot be repeated enough) has been one of England’s best players in Canada, still has not discussed it with her parents due to the overwhelming emotion. “I haven’t been able to speak to my mum and dad over FaceTime yet because they will just set me off crying,” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/england-women-world-cup-laura-bassett\">said the Notts County defender</a>. “I’ve messaged them and I know they are so proud but I keep thinking about that moment and I would do anything to change it.”</p> \n<p><strong>A win for England would also spoil</strong> a large German party, for this is Silvia Neid’s final game in charge. “We want to achieve something special on Saturday. We’re playing the queens of women’s football – but they’ve just been beaten and Germany don’t usually lose two in a row. They’ve got the greatest coach in the history of the female game and will want to win Silvia’s last match for her. We want to make history,” Sampson says, perhaps promising something more than the tepid affair the majority are probably expecting.</p> \n<p><strong>Oh and one more key detail: </strong>the Lionesses have never beaten Germany. Kick-off is 60 minutes from now on the day 25 years ago <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/mar/27/retro-mbm-england-v-west-germany-sort-of-live\">Germany defeated England at Italia 90</a> on penalties.

Fair enough but Bassett, at 31, is unlikely to feature in another World Cup semi-final. That is the sad and cruel reality of sport – and how her heart must still be breaking 72 hours later.</p> \n<p><strong>Such a moment of misfortune </strong>could happen to any footballer and since the ball cannoned in off the bar to send Japan through to tomorrow’s final she must have questioned everything from ‘why me?’ to ‘why was I not a yard forward or back, left or right?’ But it’s done and nothing can be changed. Like any broken heart, the best way to mend it is by looking forward, not back. A win over Germany to finish third and as the best European side would be a decent start – even if the third place playoff is often the most dull match of any tournament.</p> \n<p><strong>Either way, Bassett will start tonight</strong> according to the head coach, Mark Sampson, and he said she is in a good place. Bassett, who (it cannot be repeated enough) has been one of England’s best players in Canada, still has not discussed it with her parents due to the overwhelming emotion. “I haven’t been able to speak to my mum and dad over FaceTime yet because they will just set me off crying,” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/england-women-world-cup-laura-bassett\">said the Notts County defender</a>. “I’ve messaged them and I know they are so proud but I keep thinking about that moment and I would do anything to change it.”</p> \n<p><strong>A win for England would also spoil</strong> a large German party, for this is Silvia Neid’s final game in charge. “We want to achieve something special on Saturday. We’re playing the queens of women’s football – but they’ve just been beaten and Germany don’t usually lose two in a row. They’ve got the greatest coach in the history of the female game and will want to win Silvia’s last match for her. We want to make history,” Sampson says, perhaps promising something more than the tepid affair the majority are probably expecting.</p> \n<p><strong>Oh and one more key detail: </strong>the Lionesses have never beaten Germany. Kick-off is 60 minutes from now on the day 25 years ago <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/mar/27/retro-mbm-england-v-west-germany-sort-of-live\">Germany defeated England at Italia 90</a> on penalties.

They run tirelessly in practice, rolling across fields, always ready to offer hugs and high-fives. The youngest members of the US women’s soccer team are also the most popular members of the team, loved by all and endlessly doted upon at team meetings, dinners and social gatherings.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/womens-world-cup-fifa-tournament-mens\">Women's World Cup: bigger, better –&nbsp;but still treated as the poor relation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Until the World Cup.</p> \n<p>When World Cup comes, the US team’s most adored members are no longer welcome at the team hotels, they can’t eat at team meals and they are kept far, far away from those practice fields they like to roam.</p> \n<p>In a ritual most sports fans never witness, the youngest members of the US women’s soccer team are sent away in the frosty name of business. Their mothers must work now, and the children have to go away.</p> \n<p>“It’s tough, but it’s my job, you know, and I enjoy it and I love it and they understand,” US defender Christie Rampone told the Guardian on Friday, two days before USA meet Japan in the Women’s World Cup final.</p> \n<p>Soccer’s most cherished trophy comes at a price many women would never want to pay. The pursuit of a World Cup requires the three mothers on the US team to leave their children with husbands and parents, seeing them but for an hour each day before sequestering away in a secure hotel far from scraped knees and cries in the night.</p> \n<p>For Rampone, the separation is easier. Her daughters Rylie and Reece are nine and five, and old enough to understand the difference between a road trip on a soccer friendly and the most important games in their mother’s life.</p> \n<p>But for the other two US players with children – Amy Rodriguez and Shannon Boxx – the goodbyes have to be that much harder. Rodriguez’s son, Ryan, is just one and a half, while Boxx’s daughter, Zoe, is barely more than a year old.</p> \n<p>The other day, former US player Julie Foudy and former teammate Kate Markgraf – who is working with Foudy on ESPN’s World Cup coverage – were looking at a picture of Rampone saying goodbye to her daughters. Markgraf, who had two children during her playing career, knew instantly the emotion on Rampone’s face.</p> \n<p>“She said that was the hardest moment,” Foudy recalled. “You are training for the World Cup and you are away from your children, that’s hard. But you are pursing a dream and this is what you have to do.”</p> \n<p>Rodriguez and Boxx were not in the group of players the US provided at its pre-final press briefing, held after Friday’s team practice.</p> \n<p>Given that several players not at the press conference were seen on nearby sidewalks at that time it is likely this might have been their only opportunity to see their children. But Rampone, the team’s oldest player at 39, can explain all too well the heartbreak of leaving her children and the need to do so.</p> \n<p>“I see them every day,” she said. “They’re in a different hotel. We have friends and family time that we can go out and see them for an hour or two and then come back and take care of ourselves.</p> \n<p>“We work so hard and we don’t want to have any distractions. You put four years into it and you get here and it’s like this is what you work so hard for. It’s a conversation I have with the kids. They get it and they understand it.”</p> \n<p>To an outsider, the process must seem cold. Through practice camps, exhibition trips and workout sessions, the children are a cherished part of the team. US Soccer provides nannies and offers as much support as possible to its mothers.</p> \n<p>“All the kids on the team have 23 aunts who are ready to play with them, and when it’s time to change a diaper you give them back,” midfielder Heather O’Reilly said. Everyone is happy.</p> \n<p>Then when World Cup comes, the children must go.</p> \n<p>But this is a reality of women’s sports, and an increasingly common one as more female athletes realize they can have children, recover with expensive training and compete again just a few months after giving birth. Foudy remembers when teammates Joy Fawcett and Carla Overbeck had children back when all of them were still playing and members of the national team. The sudden appearance of toddlers made the team feel more like a family.</p> \n<p>“A big old family circus,” she said.</p> \n<p>Fawcett and Overbeck’s children became almost like her own children and everyone else’s children. They played and sang and did everything together – adults and kids alike. When Fawcett’s oldest daughter Katelyn Rose, turned 21 in May, Foudy said she and her former teammates texted and emailed all at once screaming: “Oh my gosh, where did the time go?”</p> \n<p>“Now she’s old enough to drink,” Foudy said with some wonder in her voice.</p> \n<p>The family is smaller now.

At the end, they smiled and hugged at the net, after Murray had clinched the win with his 10th ace, but the atmosphere was not so friendly for a long stretch of the match.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/gallery/2015/jul/04/wimbledon-2015-days-five-and-six-in-pictures\">Wimbledon 2015: days five and six – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It could have gone horribly wrong for the Scot when Seppi – who had beaten him only once in six attempts – went two sets down, and, leading 2-1 in the third, took a medical timeout for attention to his shin. He returned to the fray untroubled in his movement and won six games in a row over the next half-hour, breaking Murray twice to take the set.</p> \n<p>Asked afterwards if he knew how Seppi’s leg was, Murray said: “I don’t know what his problem was … I was having a few issues with my serve. Then when he took the injury timeout, I came out and I was stiffer.”</p> \n<p>Murray’s mood, buoyant in the first hour, changed dramatically. He received attention courtside on his right shoulder after being broken again at the start of the fourth. Was it retaliation for Seppi’s timely break? Nobody could be sure. Tennis has become a psychological as well as physical jungle and there are swamps at every turn.</p> \n<p>Not for the first time, Murray seemed perturbed when his opponent wobbled physically, then came back hard at him to stop his momentum. But, unlike his losses to Djokovic in the final in Melbourne and the semi-final at Roland Garros, he drew inspiration from the interruption. He fist-pumped and cajoled himself into action, moving with urgency and purpose between points in the fourth set, impatient to get back into the game.</p> \n<p>In the fourth set, Murray broke him almost at will, angry but focused, and served the match out in fading light to the delight of the packed arena.</p> \n<p>Seppi, an accomplished 31-year-old from northern Italy and his country’s best player, had taken just two sets off Murray in seven matches, nine years ago on the grass of Nottingham. His slam form this year has fluctuated: he beat Federer in the third round in Melbourne (his first win in a major over a top-tenner) but John Isner took him out in straight sets in the first round at Roland Garros. Ever so briefly, though, he looked as if he might spring a significant upset.</p> \n<p>Murray is into the second week of his home tournament for the ninth time in 10 visits. But it was a close-run thing.</p> \n<p>Whatever his views on timeouts – and he was diplomatic afterwards, while stating that his was the first one he had taken this year – the Scot was confident his shoulder was not going to cause too many problems. “It’s something I had the last two, three days. And, yeah, I mean, I only really feel it when I’m serving. But it’s not something that’s of major concern to me.”</p> \n<p>Looking down on Murray’s performance from the royal box on a warm and pleasant Saturday evening – alongside Gary Lineker and the England rugby union captain, Chris Robshaw – was Boris Becker, esteemed here as the youngest champion 30 years ago and now the mentor of the defending champion, Djokovic. He will have noted the ups and the downs.</p> \n<p>Murray’s next obstacle, in the fourth round on Monday, is bigger in every way: the 6ft 10in Ivo Karlovic, who earlier on Saturday became the first player in the recorded history of the game to hit 40-plus aces in three consecutive matches and, at 36, seems only to be getting better.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/roger-federer-sam-groth-wimbledon\">Roger Federer stutters but proves too good for Sam Groth at Wimbledon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Karlovic goes into the match with some hard miles on the clock, and surely the weariest right arm in the tournament. He took two hours and 50 minutes and three tie-breaks to beat the 13th seed, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 7-6 (7-3), 4-6, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (11-9) on No3 Court, adding 41 aces to the 53 he struck in beating Alexandr Dolgopolov and the 42 in the first round against the Swedish qualifier Elias Ymer.</p> \n<p>But his extraordinarily long legs covered 1,924 metres against the artful Frenchman and he will start to properly feel the strain if Murray keeps him on the end of his nagging ground strokes.</p> \n<p>The Croat took his tournament tally to 136 to stay well on top of the leaderboard for free points. Although he has not beaten Murray in five attempts and last played him here in 2012, he will be tough to beat.</p> \n<p>“It will be a very different match from today,” Murray said. “Ivo will be coming to the net a lot. Returns are going to have to be on.”</p> \n<p>Beyond Karlovic lies either Viktor Troicki, whom he tamed in the semi-finals at Queens, or Vasek Pospisil, the Canadian who took five sets to beat James Ward. If the form guide holds, Federer will be waiting for him in the semi-finals.</p> \n<p>For now, Murray has time to rest and gauge the battle ahead. In a way, Seppi did him a favour. He turned on a switch to his elemental beast – and it roared with astonishing ferocity at the conclusion of a performance that will serve the world No3 well in harder assignments to come.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436038480008/Andy-Murray-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray celebrates breaking Andreas Seppi's serve in the fourth set en route to a 6-2, 6-2, 1-6, 6-1 win in the third round at Wimbledon.

But these days, being a home fan at the championships requires a greater level of nuance.</p> \n<p>It was hard for the Centre Court crowd to know where they stood at 8pm on Saturday. Their hero, who had cruised so easily past Robin Haase in his previous match, was now proceeding equally smoothly against Andreas Seppi. There was no need for panic, or the mad encouragement they usually dish out to the home talent. A calm but earnest approval seemed the right tone to take.</p> \n<p>The hush of serious endeavour hung about the place. And when Murray got a challenge completely wrong in the second set, and the ball was shown on the big screen to be well within the line, they felt they could afford to laugh. He was 6-2 up, after all. For two sets, Centre Court was entirely devoid of the nerve-biting tension that has traditionally accompanied Murray’s Wimbledon appearances.</p> \n<p>A row of men in pink T-shirts spelling out “#MURY!” – the other “R” and “A” were presumably, still stuck in the queue – worked hard to start a Mexican wave, and were rewarded with the sight of the royal box joining in. Seppi took a medical time out. Then Murray lost the third set. In the royal box, Justin Rose looked concerned; Geoffrey Boycott looked as if he’d like to have words with someone. The crowd looked genuinely confused. Had they, like their hero, been guilty of complacency?</p> \n<p>Still, if there’s one thing the Wimbledon faithful thrive on, it’s jeopardy. An hour earlier, it had required James Ward to go a set down before the No1 Court crowd remembered its place and revved itself into the Englishman’s personal pep rally. Although, to be fair, the first set had been extremely dull. Murray has made great fun of his hitting partner’s love of Taylor Swift, and if you were picking one of her tracks to describe the opening of this match, it would have been Blank Space rather than Style.</p> \n<p>“C’mon James, just go for it,” yelled an avuncular voice, and Ward responded by winning the first three games of the second set in a row. The tennis was rarely scintillating – mostly, the pair bullied the ball back and forth from the baseline – but it made the odd unexpected thrill all the more enjoyable. There was a 20-stroke rally in which Ward launched a lob that threatened a passing Airbus; and a 30-stroke one that the crowd celebrated too early when he dispatched a forehand down the line. He took both points – each time, the crowd stood to applaud as if he’d just won the match itself.</p> \n<p>But there were plenty of mishits too, when Ward’s forehand went on the fritz. The crowd was obliged, by dint of its partisan nature, to respond sympathetically to these ugly shots, to “ooh” when they were hit thickly outside the lines, and to “aah” when they dribbled thinly into the net. The murmured sighs that escaped when a Ward return ballooned up in the air, with a rampant Vasek Pospisil primed to dispatch it, was the collective sound of parents watching their child trip over its shoelaces.</p> \n<p>Out on the hill the atmosphere remained relaxed rather than rapt, especially when Pospisil started taking control of the match. No one out there, among the scotch eggs and the cider, was living or dying with every point. It felt as if a Ward win was to be considered a bonus, rather than a desperate necessity. Poor Ward lost the fifth set 8-6. Mr Pospisil, why d’you have to be so mean?</p> \n<p>The hill gathered fresh interest when the screen switched to the Murray match. A few Scots pulled out the tartan caps they had been saving for the occasion. When things started going south, Murray double-faulted and kicked the ball away in anger. A Scottish voice yelled out in approval: “Get a bit sweary, Andy!”</p> \n<p>They knew what he needed. Back on Centre Court, it was as if someone had changed the battery – the place lit up with a new passion. Sudden bursts of noise now accompanied the close of every point and Murray responded with fire, his forehands whipping around the court with renewed speed. He opened his throat wide and roared, and the crowd roared back. He served an ace, and they roared again.</p> \n<p>The space itself seemed to warp and bend at the intensity. “I tried to use that positive energy on the court,” he said after his victory. “I finished the match how hopefully I can go on.” Murray was back to what he knew – and so was the crowd.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/4/1436044830285/Andy-Murray-fan-club-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"What Andy Murray's pink-clad fan club lacked in spelling prowess, they made up for in cheering him over the line.

Few stadiums in the world have such symbolic value as Santiago’s Estadio Nacional in being representative of their nation. Behind the goal at one end a block is left perpetually empty, the benches still as they were in 1973 when the stadium was used as a prison camp after the coup through which Augusto Pinochet seized power. It was here that November that Chile kicked off against no opposition in a notorious World Cup qualifying play-off after the USSR refused to take to the field in a stadium in which leftists had been murdered a matter of weeks earlier. Above it is the legend <em>Un pueblo sin memoria es un pueblo sin futuro</em> – a people without a memory is a people without a future.</p> \n<p>The atmosphere before kick-off was extraordinary, small dashes of albiceleste breaking a great sweep of red, each of the home fans waving the national flags they’d been given as they came in. And beyond the stands, visible through the haze of dust and pollution for the first time in the tournament, loomed the rocky bulk of the Andes, an appropriately grand backdrop to the biggest game in Chile’s history.</p> \n<p>Some, it seems, got carried away in their nationalist fervour, with Lionel Messi’s family having to be moved into a television cabin at half-time after being abused and having objects thrown at them in the stands. There were further reports that his elder brother, Rodrigo, was punched.</p> \n<p>Chile had looked anxious in the semi-final against Peru, as though snatching at the prize as it came within touching distance, but here they started with a fury. Any thought that Jorge Sampaoli might compromise on his pressing principles and opt for something more conservative rapidly disappeared and for a time Argentina were unsettled. Had Arturo Vidal made better contact with a volley as S&aacute;nchez’s half-blocked cross dropped to him, the hosts might have had an early lead, but his mis-hit effort was scrambled away by the goalkeeper Romero.</p> \n<p>The one change Sampaoli did make was to push the midfielder Marcelo D&iacute;az extremely deep, almost as a third centre-back, which freed Gary Medel to leave the back-line and pursue Messi at times when he dropped deep. Predictably, he was booked before half-time, having caught Messi in the midriff with a swinging boot. The plan worked; this was a triumph for the coach, who was born just 35 miles from Messi’s home in Rosario. Messi had his quietest game of the tournament – his 63 touches in normal time were his fewest of this Copa Am&eacute;rica.</p> \n<p>One of the reasons Argentina were so cowed was due to Chile’s aggression, which clearly outraged their coaching staff. This tournament has seen Chile chart a course from romance via the decision not to suspend Vidal over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/arturo-vidal-under-influence-alcohol-crashed-car-chile-copa-america\">his arrest on drink-driving charges</a> and Gonzalo Jara’s digital provocation of Edinson Cavani, to the pragmatic decision to try to kick Argentina off their stride. By half-time, all three central defenders had been booked and a game that had begun brightly had degenerated into something far scrappier.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/germany-england-womens-world-cup-third-place-match-report\">Germany 0-1 England (aet) | Women’s World Cup third-place play-off match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By the second half, this felt far more like the Argentina of the World Cup than the side which had eviscerated Paraguay so thrillingly in the semi-final. They were defensively more secure than they had been, but lacked the fluidity and fluency of movement that characterised them even in the quarter-final against Colombia. Messi, in particular, was diminished, a frustrated and often isolated figure on the right, shirt untucked, shoulders slouched.</p> \n<p>As Argentina became increasingly frustrated, Chile had their chances – a Vidal effort that was charged down, a S&aacute;nchez volley that flashed across the face of goal – but the last clear opportunity of normal time fell to Argentina. Messi, at last finding space, broke and laid in Ezequiel Lavezzi, but his low cross was too far in front of the other substitute, Higua&iacute;n, who could only screw the ball into the side netting.</p> \n<p>Had he scored that chance, and had he scored the chance <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/jul/13/germany-argentina-world-cup-final-2014-match-report\">in the Maracana in the World Cup final last year</a>, this generation might be have gone down as one of the greatest. As it was, though, it was Chile who celebrated, the national anthem proudly sung as flares saluted the victory.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436051278955/Alexis-S-nchez-celebrates-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alexis Sánchez celebrates after scoring the decisive penalty to beat Argentina and secure a first ever Copa América title for Chile.

The result was surprising, but no huge shock. The 55.446km per hour generated by the BMC rider over a 14km, road-kill flat city centre course certainly was.</p> \n<p>The speed Dennis posted surpassed Chris Boardman’s record, set in the 1994 prologue in Lille. The course Boardman negotiated was similarly unencumbered by anything more steep than a speed bump, but was only half as long.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/astana-lars-boom-tour-de-france-vincenzo-nibali\">Astana ignore moral code by giving Lars Boom Tour de France green light</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Having elected an early start, Dennis was the second of nine BMC riders to come under starter’s orders and endured what must have felt like an eternity under the gaze of cameras in what was time trialling’s equivalent of a witches’ ducking stool. While his perch was by no means as regal as the comical throne occupied by Bradley Wiggins during the corresponding event at the London Olympics, Dennis will have experienced a certain amount of absolutism and divinity as one by one, his main rivals – Fabian Cancellara, Tony Martin, Alex Dowsett, Tom Dumoulin – among the 160 riders to depart the starter’s hut in his wake failed dismally in their efforts to make him sweat.</p> \n<p>“It was my goal to do well,” said Dennis. “It was pretty smooth. It was very long on the way home. I kept thinking 16 minutes because that was my time at training. In the end I got one minute bonus. Let’s wait and see now. It looks like it’s going to be a long time on the hot seat.”</p> \n<p>This was not Dennis’s first record-breaking solo ride of the year. In February he set an hour record of 52.491km per hour in Switzerland that was subsequently beaten by Alex Dowsett and Bradley Wiggins, before turning his gimlet eye to victory in this stage having liked the cut of the course’s jib from his early reconnaissance missions. “I checked the course twice but with the traffic,” he said. “The second time I saw it, I noticed some corners were not as hard as I thought.”</p> \n<p>On a perfect day for time trialling, hot but not prohibitively so and with little breeze, Daniel Teklehaimanot was first down the ramp to get this Tour de France under way on a city-centre course that could scarcely have been more straight forward unless it had been completely straight and forward. Its multiple bends were sweeping rather than sharp and in the course of becoming the first black African rider to participate in the Tour de France, the Eritrean will need to make fuller use of his brakes, gears and bike handling skills in the days and weeks ahead.</p> \n<p>Winning in 14min 56sec, Dennis was the only rider from the 198 starters to break 15 minutes and will ruminate at length on the surprisingly facile nature of his win against a field of top class opposition including Martin and Cancellara, as well as the popular local heroes Dumoulin and Jos van Emden, who were the best of a surprisingly uncompetitive bunch left trailing in his wake.</p> \n<p>If a second is a long time in time trialling, five constitute an eternity and it is no surprise that Martin was disappointed to finish once again as a Tour de France time trial also-ran who is apparently never destined to pull on the leader’s jersey. “I wanted to win,” he said. “Any other result is a bad one. I feel that I couldn’t handle the heat, especially in the second half where I felt weaker. It was hot but that’s the Tour de France, it’s in July and this time trial wasn’t long enough for me.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/tour-de-france-2015-vincenzo-nibali-preview\">Tour de France heads into low country promising anything but flat calm</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While none of the four main favourites were expected to triumph in this race of truth, Vincenzo Nibali landed the first early jab, finishing 43 seconds behind Dennis and seven ahead of Chris Froome. Behind the Sky rider, Alberto Contador was another eight seconds back while the Colombian Nairo Quintana, the fourth member of this quartet of big hitters, was another 46 seconds off the pace. None of them will be particularly perturbed by what unfolded.</p> \n<p>Having won January’s Tour Down Under on his home turf, before setting the hour record that he looks certain to reclaim at some point in the not too distant future, winning the opening stage caps a remarkable year for the 25-year-old Dennis.

Judging by the enthusiasm the huge crowd at Silverstone greeted his pole position, the paying punters are none too dissatisfied either. With Mercedes so dominant, the title battle may be a fight between Hamilton and his team-mate Nico Rosberg – and the knowledgeable and passionate British F1 fans doubtless want it to go to the wire – but, well, just not here. At his home meeting it was clear who was favoured to claim the top spot and doubtless Hamilton will receive the same fervent support in Sunday’s race in front of a sellout crowd.</p> \n<p>“It’s a special day and an extra special feeling getting pole on my home turf in front of all the fantastic fans that have come out here to Silverstone,” Hamilton said. “They’ve been absolutely incredible, so a big thank you to everyone for the support.”</p> \n<p>The British driver’s early-season dominance over his team-mate had been eroded somewhat of late, with Rosberg winning three of the last four races including the last round in Austria. But in the single-lap test Hamilton still firmly has the hammer down.</p> \n<p>Saturday’s was his eighth pole from nine races this season, with Rosberg only outpacing him in Spain. It is no accident. He suffered last season in qualifying and has made a concerted effort since to learn from that bad experience and improve. The 46th pole of his career is a singular marker to those who write off the Briton as all raw talent rather than an intelligent and applied driver. Now he has one more career pole than Sebastian Vettel and is behind only Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna – rarified company indeed.</p> \n<p>Hamilton struggled with the balance of the car in the first two practice sessions and Rosberg was faster in both but he had the advantage in the final practice run on Saturday morning when his rival lost time because of a gearbox problem and the Briton was 0.545sec quicker. Hamilton had applied himself to the set-up issue overnight and appeared happier when it counted – it is a set-up he believes will be even more suited to race pace.</p> \n<p>Happier then, but he still had a fight. In Q3, Hamilton still looked a little ragged and was clearly fighting some understeer on his first hot lap but he wrestled through to set a time of 1min 32.248sec with Rosberg 0.122 back. Hamilton then aborted his second quick run and Rosberg, now also suffering understeer and an unidentified problem with his left-front, could not match him. The first lap was enough and the crowd were on their feet.</p> \n<p>“Although it’s my favourite part of the track, it’s been tough through the middle sector in particular with the wind,” Hamilton said. “But luckily it all came together in qualifying. That was such a buzz – having the car working underneath me and seeing all the flags waving out of the corner of my eye.”</p> \n<p>It is the serious business of the race that awaits and Hamilton, who pays considerable attention to detail, will be acutely aware that to take his third win here he will have to be on the top of his game. Rosberg beat him to the first corner in Austria from second on the grid and went on to win, so a good start and protecting his line into Abbey will be key.</p> \n<p>Equally he will know that just being on pole is no huge advantage once on the sweeping high-speed thrill-ride that Silverstone presents. Hamilton started from sixth on the grid here last year and went on to win, albeit in the class of the field Mercedes, and while that is a task beyond the fifth- and sixth-placed Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Vettel, another victory from second is well within Rosberg’s capabilities.</p> \n<p>Numbers may count for nothing once the lights go green but Rosberg may be comforted by the fact that since the current configuration of Silverstone was opened in 2010, no driver has won from pole and in the past decade only Fernando Alonso and Vettel have scored victories from the front of the front row.</p> \n<p>Williams, another favourite with the crowd here, continued to show improved form after two podiums in the past two races. Felipe Massa equalled his season-best qualifying with third place and he was backed by his team-mate Valtteri Bottas matching his best in fourth. They had focused on race pace in practice where they looked strong and although still 0.724 back from the Mercedes pair, having found single-lap pace as well, will expect to achieve their aim of finishing ahead of their constructors’ championship rivals Ferrari.</p> \n<p>However, for McLaren, still struggling to develop power and reliability into their Honda engine, making it out of Q1 proved impossible and nothing coming from the team suggests a vast improvement in the near future. Alonso and Jenson Button were 17th and 18th but the fact that they were 1.048 down on Raikkonen, who topped the sheets in the first session, will be seen as another small step forward, given they were five seconds off the qualifying pace at the start of the season.</p> \n<p>“We had an ERS problem this morning but we could run in qualifying which was a positive, I think we struck the maximum,” said Alonso. Button was less sanguine, noting that the team were struggling with the balance on the softer tyre and that 18th at his home grand prix was no reason to celebrate.</p> \n<p>Getting to the finish and putting more laps on their car will the aim for McLaren but at the sharper end tyre degradation may yet play a part. The high-speed corners here put a heavy lateral load on the rubber and hence the high and medium compounds are in play. With track temperatures around 38C on Saturday they are in the performance window for a one-stop race but variations on Sunday, hotter or cooler, could allow teams to take advantage to switching to a two-stopper.</p> \n<p>For Hamilton however, the win is all important, on an emotional level but doubtless as a calculating driver bent on securing his third world championship, equally as key in the practical purpose of putting as much distance between himself and Rosberg in the championship.</p> \n<p>He can start by leading into turn one and should he hold that lead by the end of the first lap another record will have fallen – Jackie Stewart’s run of leading in 17 consecutive races which he set in 1970. For Hamilton and the home crowd, however, what really matters is that he is still in front 51 laps later.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/4/1436016346195/Lewis-Hamilton-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lewis Hamilton races around Silverstone on his way to sealing pole position in front of his home fans.

The last race in Austria dropped from a 90,000 race-day attendance in 2014 to just 55,000 this year. Contrast that with Silverstone, which is enjoying record numbers, with Friday’s practice attracting 85,000 alone. A further 140,000 people have tickets for Sunday’s race, 20,000 up on last year and 350,000 are expected over the three days. Only Wimbledon attracts more spectators and that is counted over the full two weeks. It is a success story that can certainly be attributed to clever management but also to the unique place motor sport occupies in this country.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Patrick Allen, who took over as Silverstone’s managing director in January and immediately set about instituting a new business plan, targeting volume over high prices, said: “The key driver was that the price point was too high. We decided to put the customer and the core fans at the heart of this business and lose some of the Silverstone arrogance. We had an offer of a &pound;99 race ticket and &pound;120 ticket for the weekend and the response to that has been phenomenal. We raised the threshold at which you can bring your family, so bringing under-11s for free, where previously it was under two, that has allowed families to enjoy the event.” </strong></p> \n<p><strong>It was successful enough to ensure the circuit has made a profit and to be able to make this year’s offer price of &pound;120 as the starting price for next year’s race.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>None of which really fits in with Bernie Ecclestone’s desire to target the sport at high earners, which has not been part of Allen’s business model at all. “When you get it right and you understand what the fans really want and what they can afford then they support you,” he said. “If you are focused on a very high-end product, then your volume drops significantly.”</strong></p> \n<p><strong>There is, of course, the Lewis Hamilton factor – having a British two-times world champion has drawn the home fans back to the circuit. But there is more to it than that. The British Grand Prix has always enjoyed popular support. Back in 2004 when Michael Schumacher was winning his 10th race from 11 starts and on his way to a fifth consecutive championship, the grandstands were full, with 100,000 people in attendance.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>British fans, </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/jenson-button-british-grand-prix\" title=\"\"><strong>as Jenson Button acknowledged </strong></a><strong>on Friday, just love their motor racing, whoever is out in front. Paul Sutcliffe of the British Motorsports Marshals Club, whose members will be trackside at Silverstone on Sunday, believes it is down to having: “a great history of british drivers and manufacturers”. He added: “As a nation the UK is big in motor sport, people love it.</strong> <strong>We recently had 40,000 at Oulton Park for the British Touring Cars.”</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Another British world champion, Damon Hill, was president of the British Racing Drivers’ Club, which owns the circuit, and was in charge when it signed a 17-year deal to host the British Grand Prix in 2009. Hill has long championed the British fans. “They are stalwart,” he said. “And the race is a big part of the British sporting social calendar. Everybody comes here and looks forward to big attendances, knowledgeable crowds and supportive, intelligent and enthusiastic fans, who like the annual pilgrimage.”</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Few would disagree with him. Spend any time trackside at Silverstone and there is clearly partisanship but that is outweighed by an overwhelming desire just to see great racing. And that is the next biggest concern for Allen, who despite the circuit’s success is among those to criticise the current state of Formula One.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>“The key thing is to start looking at the product. I get given a product to sell. If the product isn’t right that makes it difficult,” he said. “It’s too predictable, it’s too technical. I am not a Luddite but we have lost some of the soul of motor racing to the technical gurus and I don’t think fans want to see a guy staring at a data screen. They want to see their heroes on track racing flat out from flag to flag. Not being told to lift and coast, not to settle for second place and just bring the car home.”</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Clearly there are elements of F1 that urgently need fixing, but the popularity of the British Grand Prix is most definitely not one of them. </strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/03/damon-hill-f1-drivers-voice\">Damon Hill: more powers for F1 drivers can restore sport’s human touch</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1435967722470/Silverstone-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Having a two-times British world champion in Lewis Hamilton certainly helps but Silverstone continues to attract huge crowds.

The two clubs are currently negotiating a fee for the 31-year-old, who has agreed personal terms with the club and is ready to sign a four-year deal.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/morgan-schneiderlin-manchester-united-southampton\">Manchester United to improve offer for Southampton’s Morgan Schneiderlin</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Holland international’s wife initially had reservations about a move to Turkey, but warmed to the idea after spending last week in Istanbul. The Guardian understands that the former Fenerbahce winger Dirk Kuyt has been key in convincing Van Persie to make the move. The former Liverpool player spent three seasons in Istanbul winning the Super Lig, the Turkish Cup and Turkish Super Cup during his time.</p> \n<p>Since being Louis van Gaal’s captain when the Dutchman coached Holland at last summer’s World Cup in Brazil, Van Persie’s stock has fallen dramatically at United. When Van Gaal took over the 20-times champions a few days after the tournament ended, Van Persie was considered the favourite to be named United’s new leader following Nemanja Vidic’s departure.</p> \n<p>However, Van Gaal chose Wayne Rooney to wear the armband instead with Darren Fletcher and Michael Carrick his vice-captains. This was an initial indication of how the manager viewed Van Persie and by the end of the season the striker had been dropped by Van Gaal.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/03/manchester-united-refuse-sell-david-de-gea-sergio-ramos\">Manchester United refuse to sell David de Gea unless they get Sergio Ramos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even Radamel Falcao, who suffered a dismal campaign while on-loan at United, kept Van Persie out of the side. For the pivotal visit to Chelsea on 18 April Falcao started against Jos&eacute; Mourinho’s team and Van Persie was an unused substitute. What may be his final appearance for the club came as a 61st-minute substitute for Falcao in the 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford on 17 May.</p> \n<p>For a player who fired United to their last championship, in the 2012-13 season, Sir Alex Ferguson’s final in charge, his exit, if confirmed, will prove muted. Since that season Van Persie has been injury plagued and his goal return has fallen away. Last season he managed only 10 in all competitions for United.</p> \n<p>Van Persie’s United team-mate Nani is also on his way to Fenerbahce and will have a medical with the club on Sunday. If Van Persie joins the winger in Istanbul he would become the club’s seventh signing of the summer.</p> \n<p>The Super Lig runners up have already completed the transfers of Lille centre-back Simon Kjaer, Atl&eacute;tico PR striker Fernandao and Bursaspor full-back Sener Ozbayrakli on four-year deals.</p> \n<p>Porto duo Abdoulaye Ba and Fabiano have both joined on loan and Nani is also expected to complete a four-year deal after his medical.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jul/03/premier-league-transfers-who-decides-club-buys\">Premier League transfers: who decides which players your club buys?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The changes mark a shift in the way the club is run.
