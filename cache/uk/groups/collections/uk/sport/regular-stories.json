Lloyd told him to stay home.</p> \n<p>He had to watch her score a hat-trick and lift the trophy on television instead.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/live/2015/jul/05/womens-world-cup-2015-final-usa-v-japan-live\">Women's World Cup 2015 final: USA beat Japan 5-2 – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“My fiance was coming, until I made sure he wasn’t. It’s just so demanding mentally – I feel more mentally zapped right now than physically,” Lloyd said after the match. “I want him here now to celebrate, but I just had to focus.”</p> \n<p>Sunday was a rematch of the 2011 Women’s World Cup final, and a redemption story for the Americans, but all of that melted away as Lloyd put on the kind of performance that requires someone to be completely in the zone. What had gone before between these two teams didn’t matter in the end: Lloyd wrote her own history.</p> \n<p>Buoyed by Lloyd running wild and free in the attack, USA stunned the Japanese. Lloyd scored three times in just 16 minutes to propel the Americans to a 5-2 win and their first World Cup in 16 years, their third overall.</p> \n<p>Lloyd’s final goal of the evening was her most audacious, and encapsulated the hold the Americans had on the match. She noticed goalkeeper Ayumi Kaihori way off her line, and launched the ball from just inside the Japanese half. Kaihori got her fingertips on it but it ricocheted off the post and in.</p> \n<p>“Carli Lloyd? Give me a break,” said a gushing captain Abby Wambach, who plans to retire before the next tournament. “I’ve seen it first-hand how hard she works. She won us this World Cup.”</p> \n<p>This wasn’t the first time Lloyd had punished Japan. In the 2012 Olympics, she scored both of USA’s goals to clinch the gold medal 2-1.</p> \n<p>“She always does this to us,” Japan coach Norio Sasaki said. “In London, she scored twice. Today, she scored three times. So, we’re embarrassed, but she’s an excellent player.”</p> \n<p>Lloyd’s first two goals at BC Place came from set pieces, but it wasn’t Japan’s lack of height that hurt them – it was poor defending from clever, low corners.</p> \n<p>On her first, just five minutes into the match, Lloyd shook her defender and ran toward the near post to meet a low, driven ball with the outside of her foot. Two minutes later, defender Julie Johnston backheeled from another corner, and Lloyd smashed it home.</p> \n<p>“I visualized playing in the World Cup final and visualized scoring four goals,” said Lloyd. “It sounds pretty funny, but that’s what it’s all about.”</p> \n<p>Brush fires nearby left BC Place with a smoky haze that smelled like a bonfire and looked like smog, but USA coach Jill Ellis said there was something else in the air.</p> \n<p>“There was this feeling – we just knew,” Ellis said. “I just [knew] that the players could deliver. I told them in the semi-final game that these players are born for big moments; this is what they relish. It doesn’t surprise me that as the games got harder, this team gets better.” Ellis also called Lloyd her “rock star”.<br /></p> \n<p>Lauren Holiday scored a beautiful 14th-minute volley off a loose ball that will be overshadowed by Lloyd’s dazzling performance. Tobin Heath added the US’s fifth and final goal of the match 10 minutes after the half.</p> \n<p>Down four goals early, the Japanese paused, huddled and looked to regroup. They showed a brief hint that they might be able to work their way back into the match, Yuki Ogimi capitalising on some bad defending to score in the 28th minute.</p> \n<p>“The US has studied and improved their set plays and we needed to account for that,” Sasaki said. “We needed to put more emphasis on attacks. We should’ve been more assertive and actively seek[ing] goals.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/usa-win-womens-world-cup-internet-reacts\">Women's World Cup 2015: USA beat Japan – the internet reacts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But they couldn’t test USA goalkeeper Hope Solo enough, officially recording four shots on goal, but a couple of those saves barely stretched Solo. Japan’s second came from a Johnston own goal.</p> \n<p>In an effort to reshuffle his deck, Sasaki used two of his substitutions before the 40th minute was up, bringing on veteran Homare Sawa, who finished her sixth and last World Cup in Japan’s loss.</p> \n<p>Four years ago Japan and USA played to a 2-2 draw, and the Japanese clinched the world title in a penalty shootout. The Americans had been undefeated in 25 prior meetings with Japan going into that final when the <em>Nadeshiko</em> shocked the world.</p> \n<p>The Americans exacted a form of revenge a year later, when they won the 2012 Olympics. But the Women’s World Cup tends to be viewed as the pinnacle by the American players, despite both tournaments featuring most of the same nations and players.</p> \n<p>The prevailing storyline heading into the match was one of redemption and making up for a heart-breaking loss to Japan four years ago. But the team insisted they weren’t thinking about that. All they wanted was to add a third star above their crest.</p> \n<p>“Not 1%,” Lloyd said when asked if she felt any sense of redemption. “It’s a World Cup final that we wanted to win, and it just happened to be against Japan.”</p> \n<p>Going into Sunday’s final, both USA and Japan were unbeaten in Canada with USA ranked No 2 in the world compared to Japan, ranked fourth. Japan had only given up three goals in the entire Women’s World Cup going into Sunday’s rout, where they conceded five. It’s a grim statistic they will never forget.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3482af881794f94acc640ef85a5da8cbbd90f338/0_384_4908_2948/4908.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2948,"width":4908,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ronald Martinez/Getty Images","altText":"USA lift the trophy after their 5-2 win over Japan.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ronald Martinez/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T03:32:36Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T04:15:07Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":577,"contributors":[{"name":"Caitlin Murray","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/caitlin-murray"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["USA women's football team","Women's World Cup 2015","US sports","Football","Sport","Women's football"],"tags":[{"id":"football/usa-womens-football-team","webTitle":"USA women's football team"},{"id":"football/women-s-world-cup-2015","webTitle":"Women's World Cup 2015"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"football/womensfootball","webTitle":"Women's football"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Caitlin Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/caitlin-murray"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/usa-womens-world-cup-champions-japan","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ad4d","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jul/05/usa-womens-world-cup-champions-japan","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/05/usa-womens-world-cup-champions-japan"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3482af881794f94acc640ef85a5da8cbbd90f338/0_384_4908_2948/4908.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2948,"width":4908,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"USA lift the trophy after their 5-2 win over Japan.

We knew she was that old cliche, a big game player. But we didn’t know she was <em>that</em> good. Take away her goals, and it was a pretty even game - and the second-half in particular was a more balanced affair. But then USA didn’t need to be particularly good in the second period - because they had Lloyd. </p> \n<p>USA were pedestrian in the group stages, they looked like a once great team slouching forward on past glories. Ellis looked out of ideas. But they transformed in the semi-final, thanks to clevee coaching a brilliant individual performances.

The need take Sunday’s World Cup final is almost a consumption for them as if a defeat would be a fate too horrible to imagine.</p> \n <p>Part of this probably comes from the sense of an end. A core group that has been together for three World Cups and two Olympics is aging now. Wambach won’t be the only American star of this recent run to be gone.

Arsenal v Liverpool in Borehamwood and Chelsea v Bristol Academy in Staines will seem a long way from playing in front of 31,000 in Edmonton for a place in the World Cup final. But a swift return to action has its benefits – and one will be that the momentum gained by what happened in Canada can feed upon an energised domestic audience.</p> \n<p>This has the chance to be a turning point for women’s football and it is important that the increased interest and goodwill are not allowed to fade. The manner of England’s performances – the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams\" title=\"\">agonising defeat against Japan</a> and the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/germany-england-womens-world-cup-third-place-match-report\" title=\"\">recovery to make history against Germany</a> – was heroic and will stick in the memory. The job now is to ensure that those hearts and minds are captured on a longer-lasting basis, and the hard work that has been going on for years needs to step up another level.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/england-mark-sampson-germany-womens-world-cup\">Mark Sampson hails ‘awesome’ England players after Germany play-off win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When you hear that 2.4 million people stayed up to watch the semi-final – a greater number than watched some live Premier League games last season – it hits home that there is a genuine <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jul/02/women-footballers-olympics-england-world-cup-fa\" title=\"\">appetite to watch the women’s team in major tournaments</a>. If we can engage just 3% or 4% of that television audience to go out and support our domestic teams, then, with the league restarting next week and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/09/wembley-host-womens-fa-cup-final-2015\" title=\"\">August’s FA Cup final being held at Wembley for the first time</a>, the increase in attendances would be huge.</p> \n<p>There is an opportunity to win thousands of new supporters and, crucially, there is also a chance for clubs to attract some serious sponsorship. That has to be the next step. Participation is always important and the FA has done superbly to create a situation where girls have more opportunities to play than ever before. That must continue but perhaps the biggest impact the World Cup could make is in potential sponsors realising that this is a sport they can work with.</p> \n<p>I know from experience the questions companies will ask: “What figures will we see? What audience are we going to get?” Hopefully this World Cup has shown that the interest is there but also that our players can be viably marketed to a new, family-based audience. These are wonderful role models: honest young women who would give anything to play for the Three Lionesses. Their motivation has been to push the game on and inspire youngsters who dream of playing for England. It would be a huge step if the ladies’ branches of clubs such as mine, Arsenal, can attract sponsorship in their own right and become more sustainable individually. The benefits for the league’s professionalism would be immeasurable.</p> \n<p>Improving the match-day experience must be a priority if we are to attract new fans and keep them – giving people that “wow” factor and getting them close to their heroes. Our average attendance at Arsenal is just over 800; that is 100 up on last year and we are aiming to exceed 1,000, the league’s average, this season. We have a great set-up at Borehamwood but it would push us on if we could play more games at the Emirates Stadium, where the feeling of occasion is something special. There is a general need to improve facilities and make it easier for people to attend games – not everyone is in the same position as Notts County, who share Meadow Lane with their men’s team and have won new supporters as a result.</p> \n<p>The media has a role to play, too. Coverage has improved hugely; a few slightly demeaning articles appeared early in this World Cup but overall it was a big step forward. Now it needs to continue – the men’s game restarts soon but consistent slots on the television, radio and in the newspapers would keep the narrative moving. People have learned a lot about the characters in the women’s team, so let’s develop them and keep telling the story.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/germany-england-womens-world-cup-third-place-match-report\">Germany 0-1 England (aet) | Women’s World Cup third-place play-off match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We have to be realistic: it is easy for people to return to their routines after the initial euphoria of a tournament. That was perhaps what happened after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2009/sep/10/england-germany-womens-euro-2009\" title=\"\">we reached the Euro 2009 final</a>, when our success did not make a huge difference in the long run. Our job is to make women’s football seem mainstream – and to ensure that, even if the older generations are not engaged, children who will be able to attend games in years to come are hooked.</p> \n<p>Four years ago, I was in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/england-women-world-cup-laura-bassett\" title=\"\">Laura Bassett’s position</a>.

It might not help Laura to hear it now but she and her team-mates have done women’s football in England an immeasurable amount of good – and we must make sure we create something permanent from it.</p> \n<p><em>Faye White is a former England and Arsenal Ladies captain who is the marketing officer for Arsenal Ladies</em></p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/7/5/1436103868067/England-celebrate-their-t-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England celebrate their third place play-off victory against Germany at the 2015 Women's World Cup.

One excellent race will not change everything but this was a little like seeing someone receive a blood transfusion; now we will find out how the patient responds.</p> \n<p>If only there were a few more drivers like Hamilton. It is a little too much to say that he rescued the sport with this performance but it felt a little like watching the famous oil well firefighter Red Adair in action. This was Hamilton’s fifth win in nine races this season but that does not properly reflect his utter domination of the campaign – his eight poles give you a better picture.</p> \n<p>His 38th victory, and his third at Silverstone, pushed him 17 points ahead of Nico Rosberg, who remains the world’s fastest stalker, the pursuit champion of Mercedes-Benz.</p> \n<p>Hamilton is not a believer in momentum. But he was more aware than anyone that Rosberg had won three of the previous four races. The German had also won here two years ago and led the race here last year, so he has a liking for the circuit.</p> \n<p>If he had won again here it would have dealt Hamilton a grievous blow, both in terms of the championship and his own fierce pride in front of his own supporters. But the Briton has a happy habit of delivering when he has to.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/gallery/2015/jul/05/lewis-hamilton-wins-2015-british-f1-gp-in-pictures\">Lewis Hamilton wins the 2015 British F1 GP at Silverstone – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>His team will also take uncommon satisfaction from a rather too common one-two result. For here they demonstrated not only the superiority of their car but also a grasp of strategy of which Alexander the Great would have felt immensely proud. But the crucial decision belonged to Hamilton himself, when he decided to come in for his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/05/f1-british-grand-prix-live-lewis-hamilton#block-55992eb1e4b00bdd27707d56\">second pit stop on the 43rd lap</a>, just as rain and Rosberg began to close in on him in a pincer movement. Hamilton’s history of making calls is such that you would not necessarily follow his moves on a casino table. But here he got it perfectly right.</p> \n<p>Silverstone too basked in the glory. A 140,000 capacity crowd lapped it up and though the weather was good there was late rain, like a sprinkled blessing, to make everything even more exciting than it already was.</p> \n<p>In the circumstances nothing could have been more satisfactory than a triumph for Hamilton. But a win for Williams – which would have been their first here since Jacques Villeneuve’s success here in 1997 – would also have gone well. And when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/05/williams-silverstone-british-grand-prix-f1-felipe-massa\">Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas were at the front </a>after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/05/f1-british-grand-prix-live-lewis-hamilton#block-5599255ae4b00bdd27707d3a\">20 of the 52 laps</a> it even seemed possible.</p> \n<p>Massa made an inspired start, surging ahead of Rosberg and the pole-sitter Hamilton as if fired from a gun. And when Hamilton tried to put pressure on the Brazilian and ran wide, he handed second place to Bottas, with Rosberg fourth. Silverstone is not the best track for overtaking and Hamilton and Rosberg were forced to bide their time and consider their options.</p> \n<p>It was then that Mercedes, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/24/nico-rosberg-monaco-f1-gp-win-mercedes-pit-lewis-hamilton\">whose calling had been so clumsy in Monaco</a> in May, played a vital hand, aggressively, bringing Hamilton in on the 19th lap. It was a very fast stop too, just 2.4 seconds.</p> \n<p>Then Massa and Rosberg came in, for slower stops, and the pair exited the pitbox alongside each other, but by then Hamilton had darted through. When Bottas pitted he rejoined between Massa and Rosberg and the pattern of the race had been formed.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the unusual experience of running one and two addled the minds on the Williams pitwall. At first they told their drivers not to race each other. Then, when Bottas told them he was the faster man, they gave them the go-ahead to do exactly that.</p> \n<p>Bottas had wanted to be let through. But the Williams chief technical officer, Pat Symonds, said: “No we are not going to say let him through, we will allow them to race, it is the Williams way. It gets the heart beating but it is the way we choose to do it. We told them not to race while we sorted out how we thought Mercedes reacted to the race position.”</p> \n<p>It is that sort of spirit that wins Williams fans. But if Bottas had been in front he would have come into the pits ahead of Massa and, very possibly, have created problems for Mercedes.</p> \n<p>But the rain made matters worse for Williams. They are not at their best in the damp and they duly struggled to make much of an impact when the rain arrived.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/05/f1-british-grand-prix-live-lewis-hamilton\">F1: Lewis Hamilton wins British Grand Prix –as it happened!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Judged on the weekend overall the least Williams deserved was third and fourth. But even that was denied them because of some quick thinking by Ferrari, who brought Vettel in for inters just before the rain came with about eight of the 52 laps remaining.</p> \n<p>Fernando Alonso was 10th, scoring his first point of the season. But he put his team-mate Jenson Button out of the race on the very first lap, the consequence of another clash between Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado.</p> \n<p>So Button is still looking for his first podium at Silverstone. There was also despair for Max Verstappen, who spun into the gravel after the early safety car came in. But there were not many expressions of disappointment here on Sunday.

But they had already started.</p> \n<p>Hamilton is an experienced celebrator, having won a Formula One race on 37 previous occasions, but there was a special energy in the Mercedes driver’s exuberance here. “The vibe, the energy is electrifying,” he said. “I am so elated you cannot imagine. It doesn’t seem real. I have to pinch myself.</p> \n<p>“An incredible day. I don’t ever tear up very often. I’m not particularly much of a cryer. But on the last lap, last couple of laps I think it was, I was getting watery eyes.</p> \n<p>“It was just emotion because I could see the crowd cheering in the corner of my eye. And I knew at that point there were only two laps to go and I had kept it together. When I felt the emotion coming in, I was thinking: ‘Stay focused, don’t drop it.’ It was so difficult out there. So tricky.”</p> \n<p>His decision to come in for his second stop on the 43rd lap for intermediate tyres appeared to please him more than anything. His grip on first place had been loosened by his team-mate Nico Rosberg over the previous two laps but the stop proved inspired as the rain started to fall more heavily and Rosberg was forced to change tyres and finished almost 11 seconds back in second place. Sebastian Vettel was third for Ferrari.</p> \n<p>“When you are leading the race you are the first to see the conditions,” said Hamilton, who extended his championship lead to 17 points. “I was struggling with understeer but I knew I had to come in when I saw the drops on my visor.</p> \n<p>“It’s a lottery. Sometimes you get it right and sometimes you get it wrong. When I had got the wets on, that is my ground, I enjoy that. I felt comfortable by the end.” It may have reminded him of his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2008/jul/07/lewishamilton.formulaone\" title=\"\">famous win in the wet in 2008</a>.</p> \n<p>He added: “I didn’t know how it was going to go. I thought when it started to rain the heavens were not going to make it easy for me. Nico was catching me and I chose to come in and change the tyres and thankfully it was the right choice. For the first time in my career I made the perfect choice tyre-wise.”</p> \n<p>Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team boss, who the previous day had <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/toto-wolff-f1-mercedes-bernie-ecclestone\" title=\"\">made an appeal through The Observer for people to stop knocking F1</a>, said: “Sometimes these things just happen at the right moment. There was such a great crowd, and then a race with all the ingredients necessary for excitement. We had the right rain at the right time, and probably the right winner.</p> \n<p>“We cock up together and we win together, and the exchanges on the radio about what was happening and the strategy were spot on today. When the rain hit us, it was so calm on the radio about the options, but then it was Lewis’s call. He made that pit call at the right time, using the right information.</p> \n<p>“In Monaco we had a problem in our system. Here we were concentrated, calm and focused on the priorities and that was part of getting it all right.”</p> \n<p>Referring to Hamilton, he added: “If you are a double world champion and win so many races, you are a complete racing driver. You can’t put him in a box and say he has only God-given talent. He has to have a view of the whole picture and that was clear here.</p> \n<p>“This was Lewis’s home grand prix, there were great crowds and it was a relief from the talking down of the sport we have had. We also had the fastest ever pit stop – 2.4 seconds.., including reaction time.”</p> \n<p>Rosberg said: “I was pushing hard to try and catch Lewis under difficult conditions but he made the better call and that is where I lost it. Fair play to him.”</p> \n<p>Eddie Jordan, the BBC TV analyst, summed it up when he said: “Lewis is on another level. The championship last year made him much stronger, gave him that steely fight in his eyes. He walks through the paddock with that little strut. He knows he is the best.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436121736416/Lewis-Hamilton-shares-a-m-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lewis Hamilton shares a moment with the assembled masses at Silverstone after admitting he struggled to control his emotions in the British Grand Prix.

It was the message that was plastered all over the Olympic Park in Stratford during that glorious period in July and August 2012.

But the seductive vision from Lord Coe and the then prime minister, Tony Blair, was that hosting the Games could provide a glorious one-off corrective that in addition to regeneration in London and economic benefits for Britain could transform the attitude to sport in Whitehall and beyond.</p> \n<p>No longer an afterthought, it would become baked into health, transport, Home Office and education policy. At a valedictory press conference in Westminster the day after the Games, the then culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, became visibly annoyed at a suggestion from reporters that his government would fail to do just that. But 10 years on from Singapore the chief executive of the London 2012 bid, Sir Keith Mills, is clear that it is the government’s commitment to a co-ordinated strategy that is still sorely lacking.</p> \n<p>“We urged that government should have a national strategy for sport and inactivity; that hasn’t happened,” says Mills, who has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/may/21/sir-keith-mills-olympic-legacy\" title=\"\">put &pound;10m into an organisation called Sported</a> that seeks to support grassroots sports clubs across the country. “It’s very frustrating because it’s not rocket science. The problem in government generally is that it’s not very joined up. Government has historically been quite good at plans but not very good at executing them.”</p> \n<p>Mills, who emphasises that other elements of the legacy have been a success, contrasts the cross-party consensus required to deliver the Games with the lack of joined-up thinking over the sports participation legacy. Blair told the IOC members on 6 July 2005: “Our vision is to see millions more young people in Britain and across the world participating in sport and improving their lives as a result of that participation. And London has the power to make that happen.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>By any measure, the figures for sports participation since the Games do not make pretty reading</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Coe talked movingly about his epiphany watching the 1968 Mexico Olympics and vowed that the London Games would “show a new generation why sport matters”.</p> \n<p>For all the ill-defined rhetoric around the ambitions for a legacy, a word that has become almost meaningless given the regularity with which it is now attached to major events, the Olympics minister who persuaded Blair to bid in the first place is clear what the two overriding aims were. “We had two reasons for doing the Olympics,” says Tessa Jowell, who is standing to be Labour’s candidate for London mayor. “To regenerate this part of east London and to transform a generation of young people through sport. It was that pure and simple.”</p> \n<p>By any measure, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/11/olympic-legacy-sport-participation-plummets\" title=\"\">the figures for sports participation</a> since the Games do not make pretty reading. Longstanding issues remain from a lack of coordination between schools, local authorities and sports clubs to a lack of recognition and remuneration for age-specific coaches and PE teachers. Exacerbated by a lack of a clear overarching plan across Whitehall departments, cuts and confusion in school sport and local authority cuts that have hit facilities budgets, adult participation numbers have fallen since the Games. More worrying, they suggest that increasingly we are becoming a two-tier sporting nation, with least progress being made among those in the lowest socioeconomic groups.</p> \n<p>Sport England, the quango that invests &pound;325m of exchequer and lottery funding in grassroots sport per year, last month published participation figures among adults that were <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/15/britain-olympic-legacy-london-2012\" title=\"\">damned as very disappointing</a> by the new sports minister, Tracey Crouch. Her Labour opposite number, Clive Efford, called them disastrous. The figures showed that the number of people playing sport at least once a week had declined by 222,000 in six months. Meanwhile, the percentage of those on the lowest incomes participating in sport has hit the lowest level since records began in&nbsp;2005-06.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/olympic-legacy-failure-school-sport-postcode-lottery-michael-gove\">Olympic legacy failure: access to school sport is now a postcode lottery</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In school sport, the decision by the then education secretary, Michael Gove, to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2012/aug/06/michael-gove-own-goal-school-sports\" title=\"\">cut &pound;162m in ringfenced funding for school sports partnerships</a> had far‑reaching consequences. The effects are still being played out, though the more optimistic hope that rearguard action to replace it with &pound;150m a year for primary schools has mitigated the worst of the impact. Either way, London 2012 was not the transformative moment in terms of the importance placed on school sport that many had hoped.</p> \n<p>Ten years on from the drama and delight of the “Singapore moment”, Crouch has promised to rip up the government’s sports strategy and start again with a blank sheet of paper and a new green paper.

She pointed the finger at the coalition for axing ringfenced funding for school sport in 2010 and continuing to fund policies that were not working.</p> \n<p>“It wasn’t the wrong thing to promise,” said Jowell, now on the shortlist to be Labour’s candidate for the 2016 London mayoral election. “We were on track. It was absolutely, wholly and solely their fault. It was going to be delivered. We were on course to deliver it as the figures make absolutely clear.</p> \n<p>“Whenever I think about it, it makes me furious that this opportunity was squandered. My sense of fury is on behalf of all those kids who were starting secondary school five years ago.”</p> \n<p>Jowell said she believed Michael Gove, education secretary from 2010-14, acted for ideological reasons <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2012/aug/06/michael-gove-own-goal-school-sports\">in cutting &pound;162m in ringfenced funding for school sport</a> and that the decision had led to catastrophic knock-on effects. “It was a small decision with huge consequences,” she said. “I hope this is a huge stain on their consciences. When we get to Tokyo [in 2020] I think it likely we’ll be back to half of our medallists being from independent schools. It doesn’t mean they’re not great athletes but we challenged that by unlocking talent that might not otherwise have developed.”</p> \n<p>Sport England figures show there are now more than 1.2m more people taking part in no sport at all and that the decline has been especially marked among those from lower socioeconomic groups. “There are fewer people now playing sport,” Jowell said. “It is on the conscience of those ministers.”</p> \n<p>But she also highlighted the successful regeneration of the Olympic Park as an example that the Games had delivered on those terms. “Here is the legacy – East Village, the best place in London to live – 3,000 homes there and more coming. But the fact is that the coalition government allowed our very tight, deliberately targeted definition of legacy to become diffuse. I always knew that was a risk,” said Jowell, who was part of the delegation that narrowly defeated Paris in Singapore in the final round to win the right to host the Games.</p> \n<p>“We had two reasons for doing the Olympics. To regenerate this part of east London and to transform a generation of young people through sport. It was that pure and simple. The mechanism was school sports partnerships and targets for physical activity and sports participation. It was very clear.

But the sports minister has been clear that too many sports bodies are currently not delivering in bringing new people from all backgrounds to their sport. This is why a new sports strategy is being worked on that will further build on the cross-government work on sport and physical activity that happens.”</p> \n<p>However, that &pound;1bn “public funding” for community sport melds money from the national lottery, of which sport is one of the direct, statutory beneficiaries, with funding Crouch’s government provides. Sport England says that its annual budget of &pound;325m is comprised of &pound;243m from the lottery – 75% – with a mere &pound;82m coming from the government.</p> \n<p>The LGA has calculated that from 2009-10 when the previous Labour government was investing in sport and leisure with &pound;1.4bn being spent by local authorities, the budget this year has been reduced to around &pound;1bn. That cut, &pound;400m nationally per year, before the further cuts expected to be imposed this week, is almost five times more than the total money the government provides to Sport England.</p> \n<p>The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy has analysed the sport and leisure budgets without libraries and other cultural services – which have also suffered huge, well‑publicised cuts – and calculates the budget purely for sport has fallen &pound;215m a year, from &pound;832m in 2009-10 to &pound;617m nationally this year, a cut of around 25%. A survey by the <a href=\"http://www.cloa.org.uk/\">Chief Cultural &amp; Leisure Officers Association</a> has estimated that since the cuts began to bite, 6,000 sport and leisure staff have gone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/olympic-facilities/giv-2127746F4rx8aX1iX/\" data-alt=\"sa\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/olympic-facilities/giv-2127746F4rx8aX1iX/\">sa</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Mark Allman, the CLOA chair, is head of sport and active lifestyles in Leeds, which has closed two swimming pools and reduced opening times at all its sports centres. He describes the three years since 2012 as “a missed opportunity to build a proper plan into the Olympics” but, like many within local authorities, points to the efforts being made to maintain facilities and programmes.</p> \n<p>Leeds has managed to build two new sports centres: the John Charles and Holt Park, the latter combined with health and social care facilities which many see as a model for the future. Allman says that bigger cities have had the capacity to consolidate their facilities – Manchester has closed five older leisure centres recently but built three new ones – while smaller district councils lack alternative options and are struggling nationwide to keep facilities open.</p> \n<p>Lisa Mulherin, Leeds city council’s executive member for health, wellbeing and adults, bemoans a &pound;6m cut in the sport and leisure budget compared with 2010-11, part of a &pound;178m, 40%, overall cut from the council’s 2010-11 total budget of &pound;446m.</p> \n<p>“Nobody wants to close facilities; if we had the funding we would never have closed those pools and we would be investing more in sport and activity,” Mulherin says. “This government is saying it wants to encourage sport, particularly in deprived communities – but it is doing the polar opposite.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/olympic-legacy-failure-school-sport-postcode-lottery-michael-gove\">Olympic legacy failure: access to school sport is now a postcode lottery</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Birmingham city council has transferred several sports centres to trusts, while seeing significant increases in participation at those it retained by making entry free, due to a partnership with local health authorities. Paulette Hamilton, cabinet member for health and social care, hailed that as a “real success” – the kind of “joined-up thinking” Crouch has said she will try to engender, yet points to “savage cuts” – &pound;462m from Birmingham’s budget since 2010-11 – which she blames for the overall national fall in participation. Her council has increased hiring fees for its football pitches by 91% since then, which Kenny Saunders, of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Save-Grass-Roots-Football/414473611976964\">Save Grass Roots Football campaign</a>, says is being replicated across the country and driving senior and junior clubs away.</p> \n<p>In government responses from three departments: culture, media and sport, health, and communities and local government, there was not a single acknowledgement that the massive cuts to sporting provision during this time of promised Olympic legacy are having any impact at all. The DCMS said: “We work closely with local government to ensure they continue to provide the best services that local people want to see.”</p> \n<p>The Department of Health, which many believe should take overall responsibility for community sport as part of a joined-up battle against modern sedentary lifestyles, says obesity now costs the NHS &pound;5bn annually. Yet initiatives pointed to by the DH comprised &pound;600m being spent by another department, education, on school sport and the health campaign Change4Life.

In an age where more than a third of children leave primary school overweight or obese, where <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/jun/23/school-sport-crossroads-london-2012-legacy\" title=\"\">one in four think a video game constitutes exercise</a> and where the amount of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/schoolsports/11343801/Alarming-fall-in-school-PE-lessons-casts-doubt-over-governments-commitment-to-tackling-obesity-crisis.html\" title=\"\">weekly PE delivered has diminished significantly</a>, it is pertinent to recall those pledges of legacy and an inspired generation back in 2005.</p> \n<p>PE and sport in state schools – which educate 93% of the nation’s children – have undergone radical changes since 2010. While new schemes such as the School Games and primary school funding through an annual &pound;150m premium have reaped benefits, the controversial <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2010/nov/28/school-sport-partnerships-abolition-gove\" title=\"\">abolition of School Sport Partnerships (SSPs)</a> in 2011 has provided an unwanted legacy where opportunities vary greatly and a postcode lottery where accountability is minimal.</p> \n<p>The decision by Michael Gove to scrap SSPs was met with widespread outrage and condemnation, the then education secretary ending &pound;162m of ringfenced funding which served 450 SSPs nationwide, usually comprising six to 10 secondary schools and their feeder primaries. Within each SSP there existed a partnership development manager who promoted and organised sport between different schools and clubs in the community, while each secondary was funded to retain a PE teacher for two days a week.</p> \n<p>“It was a terrible decision and there’s no question that the situation is on the slide and deteriorating,” says Chris Dunne, formerly the long-serving head at Langdon Park school in Tower Hamlets, east London, and currently chair of the newly formed London Headteachers Alliance. “I’ve got a good idea of what it’s like around London and it’s very, very patchy, although in Tower Hamlets we have continued to grow our provision. But it’s left to individual teachers now and many don’t have time. The main obsession is with the next Ofsted inspection.”</p> \n<p>In many ways the situation has been left to develop organically since the abolishment of SSPs, and a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10062338/Blow-to-Olympic-legacy-as-schools-are-forced-to-cut-sport.html\" title=\"\">survey by the Smith Institute</a> has found that a third of teachers reported a significant decrease in participation since 2011. In some areas, groups of schools and regional boards have pooled their resources, asking each school for a donation towards a fund used to pay staff who occupy similar roles to those previously operating under the SSPs. In others, not-for-profit organisations – such as the Tower Hamlets Youth Sport Foundation – have plugged the gap while in many a unified structure simply no longer exists.</p> \n<p>In 2013, with anger against the government still rife, the department of education announced that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2013/mar/16/school-sport-lame-legacy-olympics\" title=\"\">&pound;150m would be committed</a> annually to the 17,000 primary schools in England for PE and sport through Primary School Premiums. Each receives a little over &pound;9,000 per year, with the premiums set to remain in place until 2020.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/sport-participation/giv-21277dV07u6k1P3lp/\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/sport-participation/giv-21277dV07u6k1P3lp/\">Interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>On the south coast, a stone’s throw from the cliffs of Bournemouth, is an example of how the premium money can be put to good use. As part of the Youth Sport Trust’s national school sport week, children at St Katharine’s are all outside participating in exercise.</p> \n<p>The headteacher of five years, Nikki St John, has tried to make physical activity part of the daily routine, using the funding to train staff. Academic results have improved as a consequence. “We let our children climb trees, they have tarpaulins and make dens, they play in the mud with buckets and spades,” says St John. “We use the outdoor environment as much as we can. Walking and talking. We want the kids to know that being active and walking makes them feel good.”</p> \n<p>There is ample evidence that correlates the amount of exercise a child does to improved performance in the classroom. However, some headteachers – many concerned about inspections – do not view PE and sport as a priority, a serious issue given that primary premium funding is used at the discretion of headteachers.</p> \n<p>Many, such as St John, coordinate an effective programme but some do not. Others have good intentions yet do not have a suitable local network around them, often hiring private firms to deliver after-school sport. The quality of such services varies drastically.</p> \n<p>More concerning, though, is the lack of funding for secondary schools, who receive nothing from the government. The School Games, an initiative born from the Olympics which involves intra-school, regional and national competitions for all ages across a variety of sports, is regarded as a success. Organised by the YST, Sport England and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, there are more than 19,000 schools participating.</p> \n<p>Yet other than these games, the only guaranteed physical activity 11 to 16-year-olds receive in school is through PE. A YST study this year found that weekly PE time had significantly reduced in primary and secondary schools since the coalition took power in 2010. Baroness Sue Campbell, the organisation’s chair, who has long campaigned for improved youth sport, has described the issues in secondary schools as a potential “time bomb”.</p> \n<p>She said: “I praise what’s happened in primary. There’s a long way to go to create the sort of universal offer we all want but everybody is working collaboratively towards it. But the secondary issue is one we can’t ignore. In terms of lifelong participation, if we build the momentum up to the age of 11 and then it all disappears it’s really hard to re-engage again later.”</p> \n<p>It is a view shared by David Ellis, the headteacher at York high school, another establishment where sport is thriving. On numerous walls across the school are prints and images of Olympic heroes, from Haile Gebrselassie to Jonathan Edwards, but Ellis warns that a lack of leadership is having negative effects at secondary schools.</p> \n<p>“We need to look at a provision that is a wrap-around schools to make sure our young people engage,” says Ellis, who played a key role in maintaining some of the structures in place across York from the old SSP. “We need a network of professionals to ensure that when young people leave school at 16 they do some form of physical activity, because often they are doing none at all.</p> \n<p>“We also need a PE curriculum that is inclusive. We don’t expect 15-year-old girls to go out on a freezing cold field in January and play hockey. That doesn’t happen here and many other schools have moved on too. Kids can get their physical activity in PE by going to the gym or doing a dance session.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/olympic-legacy-failure-sporting-numbers-plummet\">Olympic legacy failure: sporting numbers plummet amid confusion and blame</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Many miles south, in the heart of Oxfordshire, a group of key stage 3 pupils have been up all night on rowing machines. At King Alfred’s Academy, a secondary school in Wantage, PE staff have overseen a “Row to Rio” initiative where children are trying to reach a mileage target that marks the distance to Rio de Janeiro, host of the next Olympics.</p> \n<p>Simon Spiers is the former headteacher and currently executive head of the Vale Academy Trust, where 51 of 52 schools pool sport funding in a setup he describes as superior to the previous SSP. In his office are boxing gloves used by Nicola Adams at London 2012, while Olympic values are imprinted on windows.</p> \n<p>“Oxfordshire is in a really good position,” says Spiers. “Probably in a better position than most places. But the secondary teachers are still worried whether they can retain their current offer for PE, especially for key stage 4 [pupils aged 14-16]. There’s a sense of panic out there actually within a lot of secondary schools about how they manage the time pressures.</p> \n<p>“I’m aware of a school where the year 11s just stopped all PE because they needed to do more English and maths. I think there’s a cliff edge at the start of key stage 4 and I think it’s a really tall cliff. Key stage 4 programmes could disappear.”</p> \n<p>Across the school campus the budding rowers are still pounding away, monitored by PE teacher Max Gayler and other staff. “We have created a culture where it’s OK to fail and have encouraged kids to come out of their comfort zone,” says Gayler, as a group of 13-year-olds pause for a breather.</p> \n<p>They look exhausted, but their smiles are as broad as those of medal-winning Olympians. “Our school really pushes us in sport,” they say. “Now we feel better and do better in the classroom.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436118679196/Michael-Gove-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Michael Gove's scrapping of School Sport Partnerships  in 2011 ended £162m of ringfenced funding that paid for secondary school PE teachers, among other things.

In the first instance an unwilling leader, his players soon knew him as Captain Grumpy – but they quickly learned that it was worth it. In 1987 he led them to World Cup victory, beating England in the final, and then, in the 1989 Ashes, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2013/may/23/20-great-ashes-moments-1989\">his team dispensed one of sport’s great surprise kickings</a>. Hitting six half-centuries in a 4-0 win, Border’s contribution to the cause earned him the Australian of the Year award, and things continued in similar vein, the urn retained by 3-0 in 1990-91 and 4-1 in 1993.

Naturally, he made England suffer – though he was made to suffer too, the focus of the controversial leg-theory bodyline attack deployed by England to win the 1932-33 Ashes. But, champion that he was, he wrought a terrible revenge, inspiring Australia to win four of the next five series – the other was drawn, so they retained the urn nonetheless – and on retirement his average in 19 Tests played in England stood at a preposterous 102.84.</p> \n<h2>C is for Cans</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdceeb770c0f05348fb6356025a09f503eeabace\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436110339438/a416ea12-3d9f-4c94-8913-884e8b8bdcf4-460x339.jpeg\" alt=\"Victoria Bitter.\" width=\"460\" height=\"339\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria Bitter.

So it was that in 1973, Doug Walters and Rod Marsh calculated that a 30-hour flight home from the Caribbean should see them enjoy 35 cans – in Australian, “tinnies”. Though their beer supply was exhausted before they were, the concept was clearly eternal, so by the time they visited England in 1977, in true baggy green style, idle relaxation had become macho competition. It was Walters who won, his mark of 44 standing until 1989, when David Boon, that most Australian Australian, finished, with moving poignancy, on 52 not out. Soon after, he hit the runs that gave his country its first Ashes series away win since 1975.</p> \n<h2>D is for Davis</h2> \n<p>In 1975 Australia headed into Headingley for the third Test of a four-Test series leading 1-0 and needing only a draw to retain the urn. But they scored only 135 in their first innings and were eventually set a target of 445 runs to win. At the end of day four they were 220 for three, the match delicately poised. But the following morning the groundsman discovered that oil had been poured on the pitch, a hole dug in one crease and graffiti scrawled on a wall nearby proclaiming: “George Davis is innocent.” After consultation with the captains the game was abandoned, ending England’s Ashes hopes. Davis, who was serving a 17-year sentence for armed robbery, was indeed declared innocent the following year, but in 1978 went back to prison – for armed robbery.</p> \n<h2>E is for Edgbaston</h2> \n<p>This unassuming ground tucked away just off the A38 as it scurries south-west from Birmingham has been the venue for two of the greatest Ashes Tests. The first was in 1981, hot on the heels of perhaps the greatest ever. Edgbaston 1981 may always be just the sequel to Headingley’s blockbuster but it was still a belter – Judgement Day to Headingley’s Terminator. England had set Australia 151 to win on a track that did not share the demons of the Leeds pitch a fortnight earlier and they were on track at 105 for five. But Ian Botham then took five wickets in 28 balls to reduce the tourists to 121 all out. England won by 29 runs but that was a landslide compared to the finish of the Edgbaston Test in 2005: Harmison, Kasprowicz, Jones, <em>that </em>Flintoff handshake and an England victory by two runs.</p> \n<h2>F is for Fleetwood-Smith</h2> \n<p>Left-arm spinner Chuck Fleetwood-Smith played in seven Ashes Tests for Australia, experiencing the heights of glory and the troughs of ignominy. The peak came in Adelaide in 1937 when he produced a notably brilliant delivery to take the crucial wicket of Wally Hammond and help Australia recover from 2-0 down to win the series 3-2. His captain, Don Bradman, said that “if ever the result of a Test match can be said to have been decided by a single ball, this was the occasion”. At the Oval the following year he snared Hammond once again, in the first innings. Less happily he also conceded 298 runs (still a record) as England scored 903 for seven declared (another record) and won by a laughably emphatic innings and 579 runs (another).</p> \n<h2>G is for Gabbatoir</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73e82e714d1fe830fecafc2ebd986d92a912a5cf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436110485044/8a66b8c9-3740-4092-8fd1-37329a7c175a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nasser Hussain and Steve Waugh at the toss at the Gabba in 2002.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nasser Hussain and Steve Waugh at the toss at the Gabba in 2002.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Shaw/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In Woolloongabba, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia is found the Brisbane Cricket Ground, known as the Gabba, as well as the Gabbatoir. According to tradition, it is where England are pulverised in the first Test of every Ashes series. In 20 matches, Australia have won 11, lost four, the last of those defeats coming in 1986. They have twice conceded draws since then but have won the remaining five contests by margins of 10 wickets, 184 runs, 384 runs, 277 runs and 381 runs. Arguably the most famous of these humiliations came in 2002, when a petrified <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG4qL7qMXHQ\">Nasser Hussain won the toss, opted to field</a> and watched Australia end day one on 364 for two, en route to a first innings total of 492 all out.</p> \n<h2>H is for Hands</h2> \n<p>Hands are generally, um, handy in cricket, and Greg Chappell owned a particularly fine pair, his 61 catches being an Ashes allcomers record which included seven in a single Test in Perth in 1974. Graham Gooch’s are also memorable, for in using them to stop the ball reaching his stumps at Old Trafford in 1993 he became the only man in Ashes history to be out handled the ball. On the final day of the first Test he was on 133 as England desperately tried to avoid defeat, when a Merv Hughes delivery came off Gooch’s body and was prevented from looping stumpwards by his gloved fist. Dickie Bird raised his finger, Australia won the match, and the tourists took the series 4-1.</p> \n<h2>I is for Invincibles</h2> \n<p>In 1948, Don Bradman led Australia’s touring party to England for his final Test series. Playing 112 days out of 144, he and his team cut a swath, winning 25 and drawing nine of their 34 fixtures, 31 of which were first-class; true Invincibles do not lose in any circumstance. But their legacy extends beyond that, thanks to two of cricket’s many famous numbers: Essex bowled them out in a day, but not before 721 runs had been scored – still a record – and in the final Test a demoralised England collapsed to 52 all out, helping cement a 4-0 series victory.</p> \n<h2>J is for Johnston</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e34d00698c19c20e5bff358e219fbdb27b05aa9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436110617799/4eec2ac4-05c6-489e-bf02-ad93869c3b86-279x420.jpeg\" alt=\"BBC commentator Brian Johnston.\" width=\"279\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BBC commentator Brian Johnston.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bob Thomas/Bob Thomas/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There was no shortage of England heroes in 1953: Alec Bedser took 14 wickets in the first Test; in the second Willie Watson arrived at the crease on day four with England in desperate trouble on 12 for three and left it with the score at 236 for five and all but safe; in the third Johnny Wardle collected remarkable second-innings figures (five overs bowled, seven runs conceded, four wickets taken). But despite their efforts the first four Tests were drawn, so a sixth day was hurriedly scheduled to guarantee a result in the fifth. It took only four, and the man whose contribution is best remembered was in the commentary box, where Brian Johnston greeted England’s winning runs with a famous scream of “It’s the Ashes! It’s the Ashes!”</p> \n<h2>K is for King</h2> \n<p>The first time a reigning monarch turned up at a Test, England were not even playing, George V catching some of Australia’s game against South Africa at Lord’s during a triangular tournament in 1912. George VI was more hands-on, being patron of Surrey, Lancashire and the MCC and a decent cricketer, and hosted the Australians at Balmoral in 1948.</p> \n<p>Even he is trumped by Queen Elizabeth II, who in 2013 met both teams at Lord’s and also happened to be visiting a bowls club when England won the first Test; on being told the news from Trent Bridge a patron spotted her doing “what looked like a little fist pump”.</p> \n<p>Ashley Giles, England’s King of Spain, is ruled out of the top-monarch running on a technicality.</p> \n<h2>L is for Lord’s</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"011f873dc50284178e99415a1a6f378e4296c8cc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436111245120/2e2418f6-521d-4c38-a937-e4f62fed72ac-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrew Flintoff celebrates the wicket of Brad Haddin at Lord's in 2009.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Flintoff celebrates the wicket of Brad Haddin at Lord’s in 2009.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Home of cricket, and also of Australian chirpiness. When England bowled out Australia for 53, including five ducks, on the first day of the first Test in 1896 to set up a six-wicket win, they had won four and lost one of the first six games between the teams in St John’s Wood. The next 113 years featured just one more England victory, alongside 13 draws and 13 defeats. Then came 2009, and surely Andrew Flintoff’s finest spell on his last Test appearance at the ground, his second-innings five-for accounting for the openers and, perhaps most importantly, the obstinate Brad Haddin as England secured their first Lord’s win over the Aussies for 75 years. Another victory in 2013 suggests Australia’s spell has been definitively broken.</p> \n<h2>M is for Massie</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/27/ashes-2015-england-australia\">Ashes 2015: How England and Australia shape up in each department</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Australia lost the first Test of the 1972 series, so presented Bob Massie with his baggy green. His swing, in tandem with Dennis Lillee’s pace, obliterated the England order in the second Test at Lord’s. Massie took eight for 84 in the first innings, then another eight for 53 in the second. He became the first bowler to claim more than 12 wickets on his Test debut, and his match figures of 16 for 137 were the third best of all time, behind Jim Laker’s 19 for 90 and Sydney Barnes’ 17 for 159. For the record, Lillee mopped up the other four wickets. Sadly, there was nowhere to go but down. England retained the Ashes that year, after which Massie quickly misplaced his outswinging mojo and played only five more Tests.</p> \n<h2>N is for Northamptonshire</h2> \n<p>The county from which England famously plucked David Steele in 1975. Australia had won the first Test, causing England to replace the captain Mike Denness with Tony Greig. The new skipper identified Steele, an uncapped 33-year-old with grey hair and spectacles, as the premier player of fast bowling in the country. As Steele walked to the crease in the second Test at Lord’s, with England 49 for four, he was greeted by Australia with derision. “Who the hell’s this? Groucho Marx?!” But Steele was no shyster. His half-century steadied England, who secured a draw. In the final two Tests, Steele scored 73, 92, 39 and 66. Not enough for a win to level the series, but Steele was later rewarded for his work with the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year award.</p> \n<h2>O is for Old Trafford</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fe60020d2c78da1d746b57d0eb960f3132e659e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436111199169/95e831cd-154f-425d-955d-42866be648fc-460x357.jpeg\" alt=\"Richie Benaud strikes and England's Ted Dexter is caught for 76 during the last day of the fourth Test at Old Trafford in 1961.\" width=\"460\" height=\"357\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richie Benaud strikes and England’s Ted Dexter is caught for 76 during the last day of the fourth Test at Old Trafford in 1961.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dennis Oulds/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The scene of Richie Benaud’s career-defining smash-and-grab in 1961. On the final day of the fourth Test, with the series level, England looked set for victory. Chasing 256, Ted Dexter and Raman Subba Row put on 110 for the second wicket to take England to 150 with time remaining for the final push. Enter Benaud, whose spin teased Dexter into making a rash cut, edging to the wicketkeeper Wally Grout. The new man Peter May tried to sweep against the spin and was bowled round his legs for a duck. Grout had to inform the thoroughly discombobulated May what had just happened. Cue a sorry collapse: May’s was the first of eight wickets to tumble for 51 runs. Australia, having faced defeat, were guaranteed to retain the Ashes.</p> \n<h2>P is for Pint </h2> \n<p>We’ve had Cans, so it’s only fair the tinny’s more sophisticated sibling, big brother Pint, has his say too. In 1956, few expected anything other than a draw at Old Trafford – there had not been a decisive result in Manchester, thanks to the rain, since 1905. Step forward Jim Laker.</p> \n<p>After tea on the second day, Australia were 62 for two. Within 35 minutes, they had lost their last eight wickets for 22 runs. Laker had taken seven of them, for eight runs, in 22 balls. He ended the innings with figures of nine for 37 – then skittled the Aussies all by himself as they followed on, 10 for 53. On his way home, he stopped off to celebrate his 19 for 90, never bettered to this day. A quick pint. Quietly. Modestly. On his own.</p> \n<h2>Q is for Quick </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40e8dc404ae3fbfe53d5a66f89a32e01edcf3388\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436110922457/d2dca33e-36d1-410c-aeb9-d3fe55e80137-460x342.jpeg\" alt=\"Australian cricketer Terry Jenner is struck on the head by a ball from John Snow during the Sydney Test in 1971.\" width=\"460\" height=\"342\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian cricketer Terry Jenner is struck on the head by a ball from John Snow during the Sydney Test in 1971.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Australia couldn’t handle John Snow, who bowled fast and pitched short. The super-aggressive Snow – the son of a vicar – rattled the Australians twice at Sydney in 1971. In the fourth Test, he posted career-best figures of seven for 40, dismissing Rod Marsh and Ian and Greg Chappell, forcing Garth McKenzie to retire hurt after taking a bouncer in the face, and packing off three men for ducks. Back at the SCG in the seventh and final Test, a short delivery sent Terry Jenner back to the pavilion. Snow was pelted with pies by the crowd, then taken forcefully by the throat by one lubricated fan, desirous of trenchant debate. England won both Tests, and the series 2-0. Snow’s 31 wickets – and attitude – had been the difference.</p> \n<h2>R is for Randall <br /></h2> \n<p>The 1977 Centenary Test ended as the very first Test between the sides did: with Australia beating England by 45 runs in Melbourne. The star of the show however was English. Derek Randall, despite at one point being cracked upside the head by a Dennis Lillee bouncer, smashed his way to a spectacular 174. Randall continued his good form when the Ashes came round later in the year. He scored two half centuries in the first two Tests, then in the third was run out by Geoff Boycott, on his home ground of Trent Bridge. Randall kept running, to the pavilion, close to tears. But there was a happy ending, as he hit the winning runs in the second innings, then took the catch that secured the Ashes at Headingley.</p> \n<h2>S is for Spofforth </h2> \n<p>The 6ft 3in Australian fast bowler Fred Spofforth would have had a place in the history books anyway: he was the first man to get to 50 Test wickets, and the first to take a Test hat-trick (against England, naturally). But one performance in particular assured him of everlasting fame. At the Oval in 1882, England required only 85 runs to beat the Aussies, and made their way to 66 for four. At which point Spofforth whistled down 11 unplayable overs, conceding just two runs and claiming four wickets. England, shattered, collapsed to 77 all out. It was their first defeat on home soil, Spofforth ending with match figures of 14 for 90. And so Reginald Shirley Brooks, society gadabout and wit, placed a mock obituary in the Sporting Times, mourning the death of English cricket. You know the rest.</p> \n<h2>T is for Thomson </h2> \n<p>Australia were not shy in coming straight back at England after being buried by the Snow storm of 1971. Announcing himself on England’s next visit down under, in 1974-75, was one Jeff Thomson, commonly regarded as the fastest bowler in the history of the Ashes (though Frank “Typhoon” Tyson might have disagreed). Thomson, a former competitive javelin thrower, set about terrorising England with a constant barrage of bouncers. After four-and-a-bit Tests, Thomson had taken 33 wickets and seemed certain to break Arthur Mailey’s Australian series record of 36. At which point he injured his shoulder playing tennis on the rest day during the fifth Test. Out for the series. But the serious damage – the stuff inflicted on England – was already done, the series already in the bag.</p> \n<h2>U is for Underwood </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4588585188a5417333ea1c1290e99bb888d19ef\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436110750523/26f76f3b-d9fa-4c41-a973-700f99a259fa-460x354.jpeg\" alt=\"Derek Underwood is surrounded by fans as he makes his way back to the pavilion.\" width=\"460\" height=\"354\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derek Underwood is surrounded by fans as he makes his way back to the pavilion.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Going into the final Test of the 1968 series, Australia had already retained the Ashes, winning at Old Trafford, the weather robbing England at Lord’s and Edgbaston. The series then seemed destined to end in more meteorological woe for England. The Aussies, battling on the final day of the final Test to force a draw, found themselves five down at lunch – but then a three-hour thunderstorm drenched the pitch. More play looked unlikely, but scores of fans desperately mopped up the excess water, and the match resumed. With 30 minutes left, Basil D’Oliveira bowled Barry Jarman, and suddenly the climate closed in on Australia: Derek Underwood took four quick wickets for six runs, capturing John Inverarity leg before to tie the series with six minutes to spare. Everyone went home happy. Sort of.</p> \n<h2>V is for Verity </h2> \n<p>Under normal circumstances, the top line of Australia’s 1934 series win would be the scoreboard-bothering antics of Don Bradman and Bill Ponsford in the final two Tests: they shared partnerships of 388 at Headingley and 451 at the Oval, Ponsford helping himself to scores of 181 and 266, Bradman 304 and 244. Yet arguably the most memorable contribution came from one of the losers. Australia hadn’t lost at Lord’s for 38 years, a home away from home. They weren’t expected to lose this one. But Hedley Verity, benefiting from spin-friendly sodden conditions, ran through the Aussies, taking 15 wickets for 104 runs, including Bradman for 36 and 13. Fourteen of Verity’s wickets came on the third day, still an Ashes record. England didn’t beat Australia at Lord’s again for another 75 years.</p> \n<h2>W is for Warne </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f915bfde5314fee60aec588b2c2c5cbf22ff504\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436110839086/fc73267f-e13f-4d30-a3b3-3e91a9ad270b-460x361.jpeg\" alt=\"Shane Warne comes in to bowl during the first Test at Old Trafford in 1993. \" width=\"460\" height=\"361\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shane Warne comes in to bowl during the first Test at Old Trafford in 1993.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Munden/Popperfoto/Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>June 4, 1993, First Test, Old Trafford. Mike Gatting, new at the crease, has just found the boundary with a square drive. He looks in the mood. England are going well, at 80 for one, Australia having posted an average first-innings total of 289. Allan Border throws the ball to an Ashes debutant, the wrist spinner Shane Warne. His first delivery drifts to the right, pitches 18 inches outside leg, then breaks at a right angle across Gatting’s body to clip the outside of off. Gatting – a renowned player of spin – stood stock still, in shocked disbelief, though in fairness the Aussie keeper Ian Healy had followed it down the leg side too. England crumbled to 210, losing the Test, then the series 4-1. It took England a dozen years to recover from that one epochal ball; Gatting never did.</p> \n<h2>X is for Castlemaine XXXX </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"600553e6fe8df1052072017ecd42a0d5687e1332\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436111100717/309ea654-5ac4-49ba-a679-603f5d97099e-460x309.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Taylor and Merv Hughes celebrate with a XXXX or two in 1993.\" width=\"460\" height=\"309\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Taylor and Merv Hughes celebrate with a XXXX or two in 1993.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/REX Shutterstock/Colorsport/REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/03/jason-gillespie-darren-lehmann-australia-ashes-edge\">Darren Lehmann’s nous gives Australia Ashes edge | Jason Gillespie</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A popular isotonic sports beverage shilled by the Australians during the 1989 series. The glamorous poster boy for the Castlemaine campaign – “Australians wouldn’t give a XXXX for anything else” – was Victorian dad Merv Hughes, his hairy face saturated with foam. Appropriately for this most loyal of brand ambassadors, Merv had a dirty XXXXing mouth on him. “You can’t XXXXing bat,” he told Robin Smith during the Lord’s Test, the England batsman having played and missed several times as Hughes applied the pressure.</p> \n<p>Smith hit back with one of the famous sledges.

Yabba spent his time there dishing out lyrical abuse. Having started acting up in the early 20th century, when matches were watched in hushed reverence, he quickly became something of a legend, delivering some splendid harangues, not least “Your length is lousy but you bowl a good width.” But his masterpiece came during the final Test of the infamous 1933 bodyline tour. As Douglas Jardine took guard he swiped a fly from his face. “Hey Jardine,” cried Yabba. “Be careful with our flies. They’re the only friends you’ve got!” One suspects Yabba would have faced down the Barmy Army all on his own.</p> \n<h2>Z is for Zillion-to-one </h2> \n<p>We could have gone for Tim Zoehrer, who put a stop to Phil Edmonds’ incessant yap with a pointed reference to his writer wife: “At least I have an identity. You’re just Frances Edmonds’ husband.” Or we could have mentioned the Zooter, Shane Warne’s mystery ball, possibly a fictional construct but a very real psychological gambit. But let’s settle on the improbable series of circumstances – a zillion-to-one shot, surely – that arguably won the Ashes for England in 2005. Brought on at Trent Bridge as a substitute fielder for the injured Simon Jones, Durham’s Gary Pratt took a shy at the stumps from cover, ran out an in-form Ricky Ponting, and tilted a match, and an entire series, that had been on a knife-edge in England’s favour.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Cricket/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436107364526/Its-four-inches-high-but--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"It's only about four inches high but the the Ashes urn is the most fiercely contested trophy in Test cricket.

His batting has shown signs of recovery this summer since he suffered a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/aug/09/england-series-lead-india-stuart-broad-broken-nose\" title=\"\">broken nose against India at Old Trafford</a> last year, a blow which he claimed gave him nightmares and which caused a lack of form that led to calls for him to move down to No11 despite him boasting a Test best score of 169.</p> \n<p>“[Broad’s] batting has changed in the last period of time – he has lost a bit of that confidence as well and there has been a bit of chat about that,” Starc said. “But he does not come in till later on. We have got to get through the top order first and foremost but we will not be making life easy for them at the back end either.”</p> \n<p>Despite this fighting talk, Starc is aware that his Test returns are yet to match those of his 50-over career, with just two five-wicket hauls in his 17 caps to date, both of which have come at home. Natural pace delivered from a 6ft 5in frame and his ability to swing the ball into the right-hander – and away from England’s seven left-handers – will make him a threat, however.</p> \n<p>After Ryan Harris, another star in the 2013-14 season, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/ryan-harris-australia-cricket-retirement-knee-injury-ashes\" title=\"\">was forced to retire over the weekend</a> because of a longstanding knee injury, Starc is likely to line up in Cardiff alongside Johnson and the relative rookie Josh Hazlewood – who claimed the man-of-the-series award in the Caribbean with 12 wickets.</p> \n<p>“I definitely enjoyed that series back home when Mitch and Rhino [Harris] were making them jump around, so hopefully I can do the same thing,” said Starc. “It is always good to see batsmen jumping around. But the batsmen will have good days too so it should be an entertaining series and a toughly-contested one.”</p> \n<p>For all this macho talk about aggressive bowling, Starc is not the type to be verbal on the field however, instead preferring to concentrate on the job in hand. “I am not the same all-out aggression like Mitch,” he said. “And I am not going to change the way I play cricket just for one series. I am not one to chirp the batsmen when I am trying to bowl, I am just trying to concentrate and do my own thing.”</p> \n<p>Asked how he felt about being tipped as the most dangerous bowler on show, Starc said: “It is flattering but I have a long way to go with the red and the white ball.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436102406636/Australias-Mitchell-Starc-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Australia's Mitchell Starc is looking forward to a summer of getting stuck into the England tail end in pursuit of the Ashes.

In stark contrast, for Mark Cavendish it was a day of frustration and irritation as the Etixx-Quick-Step rider finished out of the money but slap bang in the middle of a potentially explosive confrontation with his team-mates.</p> \n<p>The riders started in the desert-dry noon heat on the often bottleneck narrow streets of Utrecht and then headed in a gentle meander towards Rotterdam, followed by a leisurely spin towards Zeeland on the North Sea coast along roads so flat you can see into the future if you squint hard enough. This 166km stage should have been so straightforward – it was anything but.</p> \n<p>As predicted, it came down to the sprint in which Andr&eacute; Greipel pipped Peter Sagan by a tyre’s width and there were many eyebrows raised when both men out-sprinted Cavendish, whose form coming into this race has been imperious. Bizarrely the British sprinter was also beaten by Fabian Cancellara, whose third place was enough to earn the Swiss the yellow jersey just ahead of Cavendish’s team-mate Tony Martin. On Monday he will wear it for the 29th time in six different Tours over 11 years. Small wonder they call him Spartacus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/gallery/2015/jul/05/tour-de-france-2015-stages-one-and-two-in-pictures\">Tour de France 2015: stages one and two – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Cavendish, the clear favourite when a sprint finish was inevitable, was quick to blame his normally reliable lead-out man Mark Renshaw for jumping the gun and “leaving me hanging”, with the Briton paddling in tar as Greipel, Sagan and then Cancellara swept past him in the closing metres. “The day Cancellara beats me in a sprint I’ve gone too long,” said a clearly frustrated Cavendish. “I’ve gassed it. It’s disappointing, Tony’s disappointed. I have just watched it back on the video and the guys behind played it perfect. I reckon I could get a job as a lead-out man for them.”</p> \n<p>Having criticised his team-mates, Cavendish went on Twitter to confront armchair sprinters who had condemned him for sitting up when it became apparent he would not win the stage, although his team boss seemed unconvinced by his assertion that cycling is not “a computer game”. Insult was added to the sprinter’s injured pride when Etixx-Quick-Step’s chief, Patrick Lefevere, accused him of selfishness. “Cavendish stopped sprinting and this costs Tony the jersey,” he said. “I am not happy at all. Probably this was our last chance to take the yellow jersey.”</p> \n<p>Behind the fast men another drama was unfolding and, as was always likely to happen on a stage whose route took in the coast, crosswinds were to blame. Invariably liable to take their toll by smashing up the bunch and forcing the formation of echelons from which it is very easy for unwitting or unlucky riders to get dropped, they are the bane of cyclists but make for terrific racing. Winds duly blew in not long after a four-man breakaway had made an audacious bid for escape that ended a lot sooner than they might have hoped.</p> \n<p>It was apocalyptic weather that did for the quartet of opportunist escapees. With rain hammering down and the wind howling, the teams of the main GC contenders reeled them in and fought to keep their men at the front of a bunch where assorted laws of physics dictate that only so many riders could fit in order to avoid the potentially catastrophic consequences of being shelled out of the tradesman’s exit. The majority of the field suffered, among them Nibali and Quintana, along with the overnight race leader Rohan Dennis, as they lost time to a lead group in which Alberto Contador and Froome were safely swaddled in the protective blanket of assorted lieutenants.</p> \n<p>“I’m really thankful to my team-mates today,” said Froome. “They kept me in front all day, especially when it mattered when that split happened. I think everyone was hoping that storm was going to hold off until after the finish, but that wasn’t to be today and I’m just glad it worked out the way it did. I had the support from my team-mates when I really needed it in the final split. They did a great job keeping me up there. We’re two days down now and I couldn’t have hoped for much more.”</p> \n<p>Not half. Without so much as a speed-bump having been traversed, Froome, Contador and the BMC rider Tejay van Garderen can sleep soundly in their beds knowing they put a potentially game-changing 1min 28sec between them and two of the pre-race favourites with less than 200km of the route behind them. “We were unlucky,” said Nibali. “We chased a long time. What could we do? This is cycling. The bad days you have to accept.” Nibali was more unlucky than most, having to recover from a puncture, on top of all the other misfortune heaped upon his slender shoulders.</p> \n<p>With Monday’s finish on the small but beautifully punishing climb that is the chapel-lined Mur de Huy, Cavendish is extremely unlikely to repair team relations by taking his 26th stage win, although with the Tour touch-paper well and truly lit after just two stages we can expect plenty more peloton pyrotechnics as the riders head uphill.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b629943ed0bc74857c136153770903f4e7576fbc/301_30_4099_2460/4099.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2460,"width":4099,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter Dejong/AP","altText":"Germany’s André Greipel celebrates as he crosses the finish line to win the second stage of the Tour de France.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter Dejong/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-05T16:00:21Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T23:40:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":207,"contributors":[{"name":"Barry Glendenning","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/8/1399552686435/Barry-Glendenning-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/barryglendenning"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Tour de France","Cycling","Tour de France 2015","Sport","Chris Froome","Alberto Contador"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France"},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling"},{"id":"sport/tour-de-france-2015","webTitle":"Tour de France 2015"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/chris-froome","webTitle":"Chris Froome"},{"id":"sport/alberto-contador","webTitle":"Alberto Contador"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Barry Glendenning","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/barryglendenning"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/tour-de-france-andre-greipel-chris-froome-alberto-contador","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4acqp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/05/tour-de-france-andre-greipel-chris-froome-alberto-contador","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/05/tour-de-france-andre-greipel-chris-froome-alberto-contador"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-457412805","source":"guardian.co.uk","durationInSeconds":208,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/05/150705LeTourStage2_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/05/150705LeTourStage2.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/5/1436119468715/KP_343740_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Day Two Highlights from Le Tour","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Day Two Highlights from Le Tour","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Day Two Highlights from Le Tour"}}},"importance":3,"kicker":{"title":"Tour de France"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b629943ed0bc74857c136153770903f4e7576fbc/301_30_4099_2460/4099.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2460,"width":4099,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter Dejong/AP","altText":"Germany’s André Greipel celebrates as he crosses the finish line to win the second stage of the Tour de France.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter Dejong/AP"}}]},{"title":"The Rumour Mill / Liverpool to sign Benteke this week?","rawTitle":"Liverpool to sign Benteke this week?","item":{"type":"article","id":"football/2015/jul/06/football-transfer-rumours-liverpool-christian-benteke","title":"Football transfer rumours: Liverpool to sign Christian Benteke this week?","trailText":"Newcastle eyeing Georginio Wijnaldum, Charlie Austin and Diego Rolán?

But when we’re triggered into action there’s nothing to stop us pouring forth. A few shrill seconds of our alarm – Don’t Stop Movin by S Club 7 if you’re asking – triggers us and the consequences speak for themselves. There is only one other thing that responds as dynamically to being triggered, and that’s a transfer release clause. So expect all hell to break loose this week as <strong>Christian Benteke</strong>, with his &pound;32.5m release clause dynamically, explosively and apocalyptically triggered by <strong>Liverpool</strong>, leaves Aston Villa for a journey of mind and body under Brendan Rodgers, who will apparently make the Belgian his seventh summer signing.</p> \n<p>Things have not been quite as incendiary on the other side of this sunny island. For a man once dubbed “the ever-smiling Steve McClaren” by his former player Massimo Maccarone, <strong>Newcastle’s</strong> new manager hasn’t had too much to act the Cheshire cat about since pitching up at St James’ Park. There was the bottle of New World wine, price sticker half-heartedly scratched at, the paperweight on the desk, the swift pint at the end of his first day with two men from down the corridor called Mike and Graham. But those are mere trinkets on the welcome gift scale and it is just as well that Newcastle have got their act together now. Gift-wrapped and waiting for McClaren when he unlocks his office door some day soon – it could be any day, and that’s the fun of it – will be the PSV winger <strong>Georginio Wijnaldum</strong>, who has been left out of his club’s squad for a pre-season friendly and seems likely to be crossing the North Sea sooner rather than later. The catch? Surely there won’t be a catch? The clubs still need to agree a fee …</p> \n<p>Newcastle are at least looking busy, though.<strong> Charlie Austin</strong> is in their sights though with &pound;15m likely to buy a healthy goal return next season, the Magpies are sticking to their guns with a &pound;12m bid. Never mind, you might say – at least the Bordeaux striker <strong>Diego Rol&aacute;n</strong> is available. But not for the price Newcastle have weighed in at. This time, &pound;12m is too rich for their blood and the French club are unwilling to set their sights lower.</p> \n<p><strong>Robin van Persie </strong>likes a quiet life, as he proved with his completely sub-radar move from Arsenal to Manchester United three years ago. He is not a man for any fuss, which might explain <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/robin-van-persie-transfer-manchester-united-fenerbahce\" title=\"\">why his move to Fenerbahce</a> appears to have hit the skids. Van Persie’s agent, Kees Vos, has denied reports that the Manchester United striker is set for the delights of Istanbul, a development whose collateral would be that the Dutchman might never see <strong>Nani</strong> again and might miss out entirely on the kind of jubilant, firework-exploding airport reception that thousands of the Turkish club’s fans laid on for the ex-United winger when he arrived to complete his own move at the weekend. Van Persie will now follow the likes of <strong>Raheem Sterling</strong> in an unusual move called “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/liverpool-raheem-sterling-training-manchester-city-bids-pre-season-tour\" title=\"\">reporting to training for pre-season</a>”.</p> \n<p>Things seem a little more clear cut at <strong>West Ham</strong>, whose early business should include a permanent move for their former loanee, <strong>Alex Song</strong>. And he could be joined by ex-Hammer <strong>Glen Johnson</strong>, who is in talks about an emotional return on a free transfer.</p> \n<p>A tidy forward, lacking in consistent end product, linked with <strong>Arsenal</strong>? Surely we jest, but the Gunners’ link to Barcelona wide man <strong>Pedro</strong> appears to be a serious business, and he could be snapped up for a fee as low as &pound;15m. Perhaps he’ll be joined by <strong>Morgan Schneiderlin</strong>, whose confession to friends that he would rather join Arsenal than Manchester United might just trigger Ars&egrave;ne Wenger into handing over the required readies to <strong>Southampton</strong>.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436168220331/Christian-Benteke-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Will Aston Villa's Christian Benteke soon be known as Liverpool's Christian Benteke.

Micronesia conceded only 17 goals in the second half, compared with 21 in the first. This was possibly a result of his audacious tactical decision to replace the goalkeeper Walter Pengelbew with midfielder Dominic Gadad at half-time. It was one of several scarcely believable moments in a match that bolstered Micronesia’s candidacy for the title of worst international football team in history. </p> \n<p>The underdogs quickly stole the hearts of the 500-strong crowd in Papua New Guinea when they went 5-0 down within the first five minutes. They screamed “penalty!” whenever Micronesia’s players found themselves near the opposition box, and respectfully restricted their outright laughter to only the most extreme displays of incompetence.</p> \n<p>“They were so big,” said Gadad, a slight 20-year-old from a village on the island of Yap, of the other team’s players. But at least he was in a better mood than after the thrashing by Tahiti, whose players added insult to injury by performing a post-match haka on the pitch.</p> \n<p>“They beat us and then they made fun of us. It was embarrassing,” said Gadad. “It’s difficult for us. We only just started playing football.” </p> \n<p>He was not exaggerating. Most of Micronesia’s team had not played the game until 18 months ago. Gadad said the first time he had played in goal was three weeks ago.</p> \n<p>“Most of these guys are from small villages where they don’t play soccer, so they’ve come a long way,” said Foster, who is Australian. “They’re not used to a crowd in a big tournament like this against real quality players. The Tahiti match was a real shock to them, but they bounced back. I gave them a bit of a pep talk.”</p> \n<p>For Fiji’s players, ranked 195th out of 209 teams in the Fifa world rankings, this was a rare opportunity to feel like Lionel Messi. Despite watching five of his players score hat-tricks, however, their manager Juan Carlos – an entertaining ball of rage on the touchline – was not satisfied.</p> \n<p>“We missed an incredible amount of chances. Otherwise who knows what the score would have been? Every time we played one-touch football, we penetrated and there was a chance, but sometimes a player likes the taste of the ball and they start to dream and waste time,” he said.</p> \n<p>Much of the time Fiji did not need to fashion their own chances. Many were created by Micronesia’s goal kicks, often taken by the centre-forward and not one of which passed the halfway line.</p> \n<p>The eventual goal haul eclipses Australia’s record of 31-0 against American Samoa in 2001, but as this was officially an under-23 contest, Fiji’s place in the history books is uncertain. Not that Carlos took any pleasure in the margin of victory. He was concerned solely about goal difference.</p> \n<p>“We feel very bad about having to do that, but we had no choice because Tahiti scored 30 and we play Tahiti in our next match.”</p> \n<p>Up next for Micronesia are Vanuatu, who drew 1-1 with Fiji two days ago. For Foster it’s back to the training pitch for some fine-tuning. “They need to work on their first touch,” he said.</p> \n<p>Gadad’s aim was simple: “To score at least one goal.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/4/1423028071126/5ef0a6d9-128b-407f-9649-ea63acb0995f-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Action Press/REX/Action Press/REX","altText":"fiji flag","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Action Press/REX/Action Press/REX"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-05T13:04:48Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T23:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Football","Micronesia","Fiji","Asia Pacific","World news","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"world/micronesia","webTitle":"Micronesia"},{"id":"world/fiji","webTitle":"Fiji"},{"id":"world/asia-pacific","webTitle":"Asia Pacific"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/fiji-hammer-micronesia-38-0-in-record-international-win-at-pacific-games","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4acmb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jul/05/fiji-hammer-micronesia-38-0-in-record-international-win-at-pacific-games","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/05/fiji-hammer-micronesia-38-0-in-record-international-win-at-pacific-games"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-457411477","source":"Port Moresby 2015","durationInSeconds":28,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/05/150705Fiji_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/05/150705Fiji.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/5/1436101541913/KP_343667_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Fiji hammer Micronesia 38-0 at Pacific Games - video","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Fiji hammer Micronesia 38-0 at Pacific Games - video","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Fiji hammer Micronesia 38-0 at Pacific Games - video"}}},"importance":0,"kicker":{"title":"Pacific Games"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/2/4/1423028071126/5ef0a6d9-128b-407f-9649-ea63acb0995f-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Action Press/REX/Action Press/REX","altText":"fiji flag","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Action Press/REX/Action Press/REX"}}]}],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436168220331/Christian-Benteke-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Will Aston Villa's Christian Benteke soon be known as Liverpool's Christian Benteke.

Watson has never played better.</p> \n<h2>2) Azarenka is finding her form</h2> \n<p>There were signs that Victoria Azarenka was getting back to her best when<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/30/serena-williams-rallies-victoria-azarenka-french-open\"> she won the first set against Williams in the third round of the French Open</a>, eventually losing 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, and the former world No1 has been in impressive form at Wimbledon. Azarenka has slipped down the rankings because of injuries but do not underestimate her: the 25-year-old Belarusian has won the Australian Open twice and did not lose a set on her way to a fourth-round match against the promising Belinda Bencic.</p> \n<h2>3) Nadal’s defeats no longer shock</h2> \n<p>Shockwaves were said to have spread around SW19 when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/rafael-nadal-bounce-back-wimbledon-defeat-dustin-brown\">Dustin Brown beat Rafael Nadal</a> on Thursday. Yet it felt like people were really having to strain to raise their eyebrows, even though Brown is ranked outside the top 100 and Nadal is the owner of 14 grand slams, because the truth is that the Spanish great is a diminished force on grass. His awesome forehand broke down against Brown, his movement is uncertain and this was the fourth consecutive year in which Nadal has lost to the kind of player who he would have demolished five years ago.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/03/rafael-nadal-wimbledon-dustin-brown\">Rafael Nadal looks a spent force and the evidence runs beyond Wimbledon | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>4) But his victors never prosper</h2> \n<p>What happened next in Brown’s story was predictable, the high of chopping down Nadal followed by the low of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/dustin-brown-viktor-troicki-wimbledon-2015\">falling to the wily Serbian Victor Troicki in the third round</a>. It was not a surprise: every unfancied player who has beaten Nadal in the past four years at Wimbledon has crashed in the next round, so Brown was merely following in the footsteps of Lukas Rosol, Steve Darcis and Nick Kyrgios. Whereas Darcis pulled out with a shoulder injury two years ago, Brown, Rosol and Kyrgios found it impossible to keep the adrenalin pumping.</p> \n<h2>5) Dimitrov no closer</h2> \n<p>When Grigor Dimitrov went toe-to-toe with Djokovic in their semi-final last year, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/04/novak-djokovic-grigor-dimitrov-wimbledon-semi-final-live\">losing in four tight sets to the world No1</a>, it was assumed that the 24-year-old Bulgarian would go on to gain entry to the Big Four’s exclusive little club. Think again. Dimitrov’s results since then have been disappointing and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/03/wimbledon-2015-richard-gasquet-grigor-dimitrov\">he was well beaten in straight sets by Richard Gasquet on Friday</a>. Are comparisons with Roger Federer erroneous? Dimitrov’s critics say that he does not have Federer’s competitive spirit, variety or graceful footwork. Improvement is needed.</p> \n<h2>And five things to look forward to in week two …</h2> \n<h2>1) Wawrinka gearing up</h2> \n<p>Stan Wawrinka flew under the radar in the first week, his progress uncomplicated and lacking in anything resembling dramatic tension. Although <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/french-open-2015-stanislas-wawrinka-novak-djokovic-win\">the French Open champion</a> is yet to drop a set on a surface which has not been kind to him in the past, he has not been entirely convincing. Wawrinka can be vulnerable on the slick Wimbledon grass, which plays quicker than hard courts and clay. But as the world No4 finds his feet, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/07/novak-djokovic-stanislas-wawrinka-mens-french-open-final-live\">Djokovic will be hoping that someone takes out the man who broke his heart in Paris</a> before their potential meeting in the last four.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/caroline-wozniacki-camila-giorgi-wimbledon\">Caroline Wozniacki beats Camila Giorgi to match Wimbledon best</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>2) Wozniacki’s quest continues</h2> \n<p>Caroline Wozniacki has a tough one against the talented young Spaniard, Garbi&ntilde;e Muguruza, on Monday. Muguruza’s belief will be strong after her impressive win over Angelique Kerber. Yet this is an opportunity for Wozniacki, a former world No1 but the winner of zero grand slams. The defending champion, Petra Kvitova, is no longer waiting for her in the last four and if Wozniacki beats Muguruza, she will play either the 15th seed, Timea Bacsinszky, or the unseeded Romanian, Monica Niculescu, in the last eight.</p> \n<h2>3) Can Gasquet avenge last year?</h2> \n<p>Richard Gasquet had nine match points against Nick Kyrgios last year – and he lost. He was two sets up – and he lost. He will be looking for vengeance on Monday. Gasquet was excellent in his victory over Dimitrov, his one-handed backhand a sight to behold. But can the Frenchman do it again? He has never lived up to his early promise and the likelihood is that he will find the power of Kyrgios too much to handle. Kyrgios will be brimming with confidence after fighting back from a set down to beat Milos Raonic.</p> \n<h2>4) Two youngsters to watch</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/petra-kvitovas-wimbledon-defence-ended-by-inspired-jelena-jankovic\">Petra Kvitova’s Wimbledon defence ended by inspired Jelena Jankovic</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After winning her <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/27/agnieszka-radwanska-v-belinda-bencic-eastbourne-final-live\">first WTA title at Eastbourne, Belinda Bencic</a> arrived at Wimbledon with a spring in her step. The 18-year-old from Switzerland has Martina Hingis in her corner and her match against Azarenka will be fascinating; the winner faces Serena Williams in the last eight – assuming she beats her sister, Venus. Meanwhile the young American, Madison Keys, has banged down the most aces in the tournament so far. Having hit 42 in her first three matches, Keys is way ahead of the chasing pack.</p> \n<h2>5) Jankovic rolling back the years</h2> \n<p>Like Wozniacki, Jelena Jankovic is a former world No1 who has never won a grand slam and it is widely accepted that the 30-year-old Serbian’s best days are behind her. And then, on her least favourite surface, she <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/petra-kvitovas-wimbledon-defence-ended-by-inspired-jelena-jankovic\">came back from a set and a break down to beat Kvitova</a>, the two-time champion. What next? Can Jankovic continue her unlikely run? It will not be easy: her opponent in the fourth round, the clever Agnieszka Radwanska, reached the final in 2012 and is comfortable on grass.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/5/1436100317911/Heather-Watson-Wimbledon-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Heather Watson showed against Serena Williams that she can compete with the best Photograph:   Ye Pingfan/Xinhua Press/Corbis","credit":"/  Ye Pingfan/Xinhua Press/Corbis","altText":"Heather-Watson-Wimbledon","cleanCaption":"Heather Watson showed against Serena Williams that she can compete with the best Photograph:   Ye Pingfan/Xinhua Press/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-05T12:58:25Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T13:39:27Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":30,"contributors":[{"name":"Jacob Steinberg","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/3/4/1425468993908/Jacob-Steinberg-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jacob-steinberg"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Wimbledon 2015","Rafael Nadal","Novak Djokovic","Serena Williams","Wimbledon","Tennis","Sport","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/rafaelnadal","webTitle":"Rafael Nadal"},{"id":"sport/novak-djokovic","webTitle":"Novak Djokovic"},{"id":"sport/serena-williams","webTitle":"Serena Williams"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jacob Steinberg","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jacob-steinberg"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/05/wimbledon-2015-ten-talking-points","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aczn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jul/05/wimbledon-2015-ten-talking-points","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/05/wimbledon-2015-ten-talking-points"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/5/1436100317911/Heather-Watson-Wimbledon-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Heather Watson showed against Serena Williams that she can compete with the best Photograph:   Ye Pingfan/Xinhua Press/Corbis","credit":"/  Ye Pingfan/Xinhua Press/Corbis","altText":"Heather-Watson-Wimbledon","cleanCaption":"Heather Watson showed against Serena Williams that she can compete with the best Photograph:   Ye Pingfan/Xinhua Press/Corbis"}},"importance":1,"byline":{"title":"Jacob Steinberg"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/5/1436100317911/Heather-Watson-Wimbledon-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Heather Watson showed against Serena Williams that she can compete with the best Photograph:   Ye Pingfan/Xinhua Press/Corbis","credit":"/  Ye Pingfan/Xinhua Press/Corbis","altText":"Heather-Watson-Wimbledon","cleanCaption":"Heather Watson showed against Serena Williams that she can compete with the best Photograph:   Ye Pingfan/Xinhua Press/Corbis"}}]}],"lastModified":"2015-07-06T08:01:59Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/uk/sport/regular-stories","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/uk/sport/regular-stories"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"sport/regular-stories/front"}
