The German hit numerous drop shots, some unbelievable returns and generally kept the 10th seed off balance and out of kilter, clinching a 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/rafael-nadal-bounce-back-wimbledon-defeat-dustin-brown\">Rafael Nadal vows to bounce back from Wimbledon defeat to Dustin Brown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Remarkably, it was Nadal’s fourth straight Wimbledon loss to an opponent ranked outside the top 100 and, after losing his hold on the French Open title last month, he must now find a way to pick himself up on the North American hard courts later this summer.</p> \n<p>“I’m happy I got to play him on that court win or lose,” said Brown. “All the kids that play tennis dream about being able to play on that Centre Court. Playing against him there is special. Also being able to put that performance together, it was definitely very difficult and I’m very happy that I held it together for the whole match.”</p> \n<p>It was not quite the shock it would have been a few years ago – Nadal lost in the second round in 2012 and the first round a year later, and also lost to Brown on grass in Halle last year. But it was still a surprise for the man who has won 14 grand slams and picked up the title here in 2008 and 2010 to lose to a someone ranked 102, who had lost in the first round in each of his past five grand slam events. But the 30-year-old Brown has a playing style all of his own and for once he put it together on the biggest stage to record the best win of his career, slamming 58 winners in the process.</p> \n<p>Born in Germany but raised in Jamaica before switching his nationality back to that of his native land in 2010, the dreadlocked, athletic Brown has the kind of unorthodox game that can infuriate many a better player, causing them to lose rhythm.</p> \n<p>Nadal wore a forlorn expression on his face for much of the match, never able to relax as Brown came forward at every opportunity. Slicing forehands and hitting drop shots at will, he looked to be enjoying the whole experience, which cannot be said for Nadal.</p> \n<p>Still, the Spaniard had his chances. An early break gave him a 2-1 lead in the first but some poor serving gave Brown the break back for 3-3. Nadal’s serve looked vulnerable and when he offered Brown a set point at 5-6, he was almost knocked over by a blistering backhand return and the set was gone. As in the first, Nadal broke for 2-1 in the second set and this time he held on, breaking for a second time to level the match.</p> \n<p>It seemed unlikely that Brown would be able to maintain his standard of play but that is what Nadal thought when Lukas Rosol beat him in round two in 2012. As then, so Brown continued to attack and after a double fault from the Spaniard, another brilliant drop volley gave Brown a 4-3 lead, which he maintained to take the third set.</p> \n<p>Nadal’s mental resilience has never been in doubt – after all, he had won the title in Stuttgart on grass the week after losing his French Open crown, having lost to Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals. But against such a big server and free hitter as Brown, he knew that one mistake could be fatal. It came in the opening game of the fourth set when, having saved one break point with a good serve, he missed two bread-and-butter forehands to hand Brown the break.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/roger-federer-sam-querrey-wimbledon-2015\">Roger Federer shows sublime touch to beat Sam Querrey at Wimbledon 2015</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nadal’s last hope was that Brown’s nerve would fail him but, though he blew a chance for a double break, missing a break point in the fifth game, he continued to press. The only time Brown’s nerve failed him was when, at 5-3 and 15-40 on the Nadal serve he held two match points, but let a pass go that he could have made, only to see it land smack on the baseline.</p> \n<p>Nadal then saved the second match point and held serve to force Brown to serve it out. Suddenly the comeback seemed a possibility but Brown served brilliantly, sealing it with an ace for a remarkable victory.</p> \n<p>His reward is a clash with Viktor Troicki of Serbia, a four-set winner over Britain’s Aljaz Bedene. Nadal had been a possible last-eight opponent for Andy Murray but if Brown continues to play like this, then it is not beyond the realms of possibility he could make it there himself.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435862732799/Dustin-Brown-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dustin Brown celebrates after winning the third set against Rafael Nadal in their second-round match at Wimbledon.

You’ve never seen anything like it.”</h2> \n<p><em>Don Bradman to his team-mates, Trent Bridge, 1938</em></p> \n<p>The 29-year-old Donald Bradman was as giddy and restless as a newborn pup. Stanley Joseph McCabe, his Australian team-mate, was giving a demonstration of rare genius in the first Ashes Test at Trent Bridge, and Bradman urgently implored the rest of the team to take the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to watch his innings. It was almost too much for Bradman. “Towards the end I could scarcely watch the play,” he said. “My eyes were filled as I drank in the glory of his shots.”</p> \n<p>Australia were in significant trouble after slipping to 194 for six, still 464 runs behind, but McCabe was easing into the innings that would define him. He scored 232 out of 300 while at the wicket, including 72 in the final 28 minutes and 44 off three overs from the leg-spinner Doug Wright. Neville Cardus said he “batted with the ease of a man using a master key … McCabe demolished the English attack with aristocratic politeness, good taste and reserve. Claude Duval never took possession of a stagecoach with more charm of manner than this.” McCabe scored 127 runs in a single session, still an Ashes record.</p> \n<p>“I gripped his hand, wet with perspiration,” said Bradman. “He was trembling like a thoroughbred racehorse. I can recall saying to him after expressing my congratulations, ‘I would give a great deal to be able to play another innings like that.’ No skipper was ever more sincere in his adulation of another’s skill.” Bradman was still raving about it over a decade later. “I firmly believe it to be the greatest innings ever played,” he said in Farewell to Cricket. “Such cricket I shall never see again.”</p> \n<h2>2) ‘Ashes to Ashes, dust to dust, if Thomson don’t get ya, Lillee must.’</h2> \n<p><em>A Sydney Daily Telegraph cartoon caption during the 1974-75 Ashes</em></p> \n<p>Dennis Lillee didn’t have a face like thunder; he had a face like the apocalypse. Seconds earlier he had been on his backside on the Brisbane pitch, having lost both his wicket and his dignity when he fell over as he top-edged a Tony Greig bouncer. As Lillee started to stomp off, a picture of affronted pride, Greig reminded him where the facilities were and how appropriate a refreshing shower might be in the circumstances. Lillee looked at him and barked: “Just remember who started this.”</p> \n<p>For the next few minutes Lillee was like a stuck record. “Just remember who started this,” he hissed repeatedly at his captain Ian Chappell, who had no idea what Lillee was talking about. It became clearer when Lillee announced: “Just remember who started this: those bastards. But we’ll finish it.”</p> \n<p>Lillee has always been keen to point out that England started the bouncer war of 1974–75. “It’s like the song ‘We Didn’t Start The Fire’,“ he said, continuing a long line of Billy Joel references in Ashes cricket. “People often remember who did the damage not who started the fire.”</p> \n<p>In the first Test of the series at Brisbane, more than half the Australian team were out hooking in the home side’s first innings of 309, though it was Greig’s decision to bounce Lillee, a lower-order batsman, that really stirred the hornets’ nest. Lillee, who had clearly been intending to diligently bowl line and length until then, took the first ball of the England innings, and his run-up began from somewhere inside the sightscreen. “Mate, it was full-on war,” said Jeff Thomson, “and we gave it to them.”</p> \n<p>The original plan was for Lillee to share the new ball with Max Walker, so that the tearaway Thomson could bowl with the wind after Lillee. But Chappell, sensing something in the air, decided at the last second to let Thomson share the new ball.</p> \n<p>“For the next few overs,” said Chappell, “I looked on in awe.” When the wicketkeeper Rodney Marsh leapt to claim a Thomson bouncer, he started wringing his hand in pain before realising the implications for England. “Hell, that hurt,” he said to Chappell, “but I love it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTaVRuxje80\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTaVRuxje80?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>England were soon 57 for four and in trouble; the captain Mike Denness, upon being dismissed, took off his shirt and discovered that a bouncer had actually embedded his St Christopher medallion in his chest. Dennis Amiss had his thumb cracked by Thomson and John Edrich’s hand was broken by Lillee.</p> \n<p>As would happen in 2013–14, a group of experienced batsmen never recovered from the shock of being assaulted so savagely in the first innings of the series at Brisbane.</p> \n<p>“Thommo was by far the quickest bowler I’ve ever seen or opposed,” said his future team-mate Kim Hughes. “Thommo didn’t go to any academy, he just grabbed the ball and wanted to kill some prick … he was as far ahead of any other bowler for sheer speed as [Don] Bradman was for runs.”</p> \n<p>With his mustachioed fellow-assassin Lillee, Thommo simply brutalised England in 1974–75. ‘Lillee and Thomson remain a combination to conjure with, as sinister in England as Burke and Hare, or Bismarck and Tirpitz,’ wrote Gideon Haigh. They will always tell you they didn’t start the fire, but they sure as hell poured industrial quantities of petrol onto it.</p> \n<h2>3) “Let’s give it some humpty”</h2> \n<p><em>Ian Botham to Graham Dilley, Headingley, 1981</em></p> \n<p>It was only because England had lost the Headingley Test of 1981 that they were able to win it. They had given up, and with that came the blessed freedom of the damned. The miracle started not when Ian Botham came to the crease in the second innings, but when he was joined soon after by the startlingly blonde Kent fast bowler Graham Dilley. On a wicket full of booby traps, England trailed Australia by 92 with three wickets remaining, having been forced to follow on. They had already booked out of the team hotel and Ladbrokes had offered 500/1 on an England victory.</p> \n<p>With England already one down in the series, the noble thing might have been to knuckle down and lose with a bit of honour. That was also the boring option, and after the year he’d had, Botham was due a bit of fun. “You don’t fancy hanging around on this wicket for a day and a half, do you?” he said to Dilley, who concurred. “Right. Come on, let’s give it some humpty.”</p> \n<p>Before the humpty had come the great fall, with Botham resigning as England captain after the second Test at Lord’s. Mike Brearley came out of international retirement to become England’s emergency captain. He found out that he had been chosen via a reverse-charge phonecall, because the chairman of selectors Alec Bedser had run out of coins. Botham, without the psychological backpack weighing him down, started to enjoy his cricket again. His relationship with Brearley certainly helped. If Brearley had a degree in people, then he had a PhD in Botham. “He needs a father figure, and I need a younger brother,” said Brearley.</p> \n<p>Although Botham struck an unfettered 50, England were dismissed for 174 and forced to follow on. That evening, with the rest day to follow, Botham invited both sides to his house at Epworth, near Doncaster, for a barbecue. An epic night’s drinking – led by Botham, whose form in this sphere never fluctuated – ended with the players of both sides having a rugby scrum on the lawn in the small hours.</p> \n<p>When play resumed on the Monday, Australia looked set for a quick kill. England were 105 for five when Botham came to the wicket, and 135 for seven soon after. By then, Dennis Lillee and Rodney Marsh had famously bet against their own team, putting a small wager on England. “Being a small-time punter, I had been unable to resist the juicy 500/1,” said Lillee. “It was as simple as that. I have never had any qualms over the matter and I have never lost a moment’s sleep because of it.”</p> \n<p>He’ll have lost plenty of sleep over what happened once England started to give it some humpty. “I guess I never will come to terms with it,” said Lillee. Botham mixed agricultural mows with classical batsmanship. At times he played in the V – the V between third man and fine leg, as the ball flew off the edge of another lusty yahoo. “Bloody lucky innings,” sniffed Lillee. “I expected to get him out virtually every ball.”</p> \n<p>What started as a bit of fun for England imperceptibly morphed into something more serious as the day progressed, but by then Botham had no inclination or need to sober up his approach. He made a cathartic century, with vital support from Chris Old, and overall his 149 not out from 148 balls included 27 fours and one unforgettable six.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkkvgiZJkhM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkkvgiZJkhM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Botham dragged England back into the game off his own bat – or rather Graham Gooch’s. Botham had borrowed Gooch’s bat on the spur of the moment, fancying a heavier weapon than usual. “He hadn’t used it much in the match, and I thought there were a few runs left in it.” With his borrowed bat, he hit the ball like he wanted to kill it.</p> \n<p>In the final session on the fourth day England plundered 175 runs in 27 overs. At the close, the England wicketkeeper Bob Taylor went into the Australian dressing-room with some bats for them to sign, only to be told to ‘Fuck off with your fucking bats.’</p> \n<p>Even with Botham’s heroics, Australia needed only 130 to win and go 2–0 ahead with three to play. At 56 for one, they were cruising. Willis was preoccupied with no-balls – he had bowled 32 in the previous Test at Lord’s – and did not enjoy bowling up the hill. Brearley allowed him to switch ends so that he was going downhill with the wind at his back. “Let me worry about the no-balls,” he told Willis. “Just run up and bowl fast and straight.”</p> \n<p>Willis soon dismissed Trevor Chappell, caught behind fending off a throat ball. There was no celebration, just a quick turn and walk back to his mark. Even when he picked up Hughes and Graham Yallop for ducks in the same over soon after, there was not a hint of joy. Every sportsman dreams of being in the zone; Willis was, but this was a different kind of zone. “I looked into his eyes and it was like there was nobody there,” said Dilley.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-02e50ce8-8017-4bef-83d6-ce318edf3c55\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435889255591/d49c5615-6e50-4cf2-9797-42ae91097a43-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Graham Dilley is congratulated by Ian Botham\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graham Dilley is congratulated by Ian Botham after reaching his fifty during England’s second innings.

After lunch he continued to charge in – “I don’t go as far as that on my holidays,” said one former Test bowler of his run-up – and, before anybody knew what was happening, Australia were 75 for eight. Across the nation it had become an unofficial Bank Holiday. The Stock Exchange stopped, while the best vantage points outside Headingley were the ones by the windows of Radio Rentals stores, where groups of people watched the developing drama.</p> \n<p>Lillee and Ray Bright fought against the rising tide with a quick-witted partnership of 35 in four overs. Australia were 110 for eight, 20 from victory, when Lillee mis-hit Willis towards mid-on. Mike Gatting, not necessarily the man you would want in such circumstances, ran in and took a fine low catch. In the next over, from Botham, Old dropped two sharp chances at slip. It did not matter: Willis pegged back Alderman’s middle stump to complete the most famous victory in Ashes history. He finished with figures of eight for 43.</p> \n<p>Finally there was a celebration, as Willis thrust his hands in the air, but even then it was more a kind of dead-eyed relief than an expression of joy. He turned on his heels to run back to his mark, realised there was no more work to do and ran in a circle before haring for the pavilion.</p> \n<p>Later that day Brearley received a telegram from the comedian Spike Milligan. ‘Marvellous – have my ticket for the wedding,’ it read, in reference to the marriage of Charles and Diana a week later. The match was later voted Britain’s favourite sporting moment. England, 500/1 at one stage, had won by 18 runs. They had not just come back from the dead; they had come back from a cremation.</p> \n<h2>4) “In my day 58 beers between London and Sydney would have virtually classified you as a teetotaller.”</h2> \n<p><em>Ian Chappell on David Boon’s drinking, 1989</em></p> \n<p>There was an abnormal amount of travel sickness on the Qantas flight to London, and approximately 99.94 per cent of it was self-inflicted. As it descended towards Heathrow airport, the plane’s captain addressed his passengers in the usual style. “Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to London where it is six degrees outside,’ he said. ‘I want to wish the Australian team all the best. I know they’ll do very well because David Boon has just broken the record, 52 cans from Sydney to London.”</p> \n<p>Boon has always denied the story – “If people haven’t got something else to talk about they have led a fucking boring life,” he said in 2006 – but there are enough witnesses, one or two of them sober, to suggest that it happened. The teetotal Geoff Lawson, who kept score on the back of some sick bags, wished he had kept what would have been the ultimate in alternative Ashes memorabilia. Some were not worth keeping. “The very instant we pulled up at our allotted gate,” recalled Steve Waugh, “Tim Zoehrer lurched forward and filled up the sick bag to christen our tour.”</p> \n<p>Boon was aiming to beat the record of 45 cans, established by Rodney Marsh on the way to the World Cup in 1983. He didn’t just take the record; he obliterated it. And he obliterated himself. The middle-order batsman Dean Jones acted as pace-setter for much of the 24-hour flight. His father had told him to spend the journey picking the brain of somebody who had already played in England. The only thing Jones soaked up were about 25 cans on the way to the first stop-off in Singapore. At that point he was helped into an impromptu bed, “pissed as a fart”. With Jones out of action, a number of other players took turns to sit alongside Boon and sink a few to help him on his way. It was a very early example of squad rotation.</p> \n<p>When Australia landed, Merv Hughes gave a radio interview back home and jauntily informed everyone of what had occurred. “The big news is that Boonie’s cracked the first 50 of the tour!” This did not please the coach Bob Simpson, who had hoped that what happened on the plane would stay on the plane. “I got in more trouble than the protagonist,” Hughes said. “I was shitting myself that I’d be sent home.”</p> \n<p>Boon, who became known as the ‘Keg on Legs’, was fined $5,000 – a lot for an international cricketer in 1989 – and put on probation. Simpson was not the only Australian who was unimpressed. Ian Chappell had been informed that Boon had drunk 58 cans, rather than 52, yet even that was not enough. “What is the world going to think? That Australia has become a namby-pamby nation which doesn’t know how to drink? For God’s sake, in my day fifty-eight beers between Sydney and London would virtually have classified you as a teetotaller.”</p> \n<p>Throughout the 1989 tour of England, Australia were emphatic proof that there are no team-bonding agents as powerful as alcohol and victory. A number of the players get almost misty-eyed when they talk about 1989. “The spirit in the team,” said Ian Healy, “was as good as anything I’ve ever been involved in.”</p> \n<h2>5) “All the palaver caused me to burn my toast”</h2> \n<p><em>Duncan Fletcher on the Trent Bridge Test of 2005</em></p> \n<p>Ricky Ponting was chuntering to everyone and no one, his face a picture of affronted dismay. As he walked off the field, absent-mindedly removing his gloves while swearing in all directions, it was as much as he could do not to grit his teeth to breaking point. When he reached the pavilion steps, Ponting – still with his helmet on, as if he couldn’t quite bring himself to take off his work clothes and fully acknowledge his innings was over – snapped his head and started shouting abuse in a specific direction, and at a specific person on the England balcony. In a series full of symbolic moments, this was the biggest of all; the moment England knew Australia had cracked.</p> \n<p>After making Australia follow on for the first time in 17 years, England were having a tougher time getting them out a second time. Australia were 155 for two, 104 behind, and Ponting was looking ominously set on 48. Damien Martyn called Ponting for a tight single on the off side, and the substitute Gary Pratt – on for the injured Simon Jones – threw down the stumps with dead-eyed certainty. Ponting’s exasperation at getting out in such a manner at such a time was great enough, even before he realised he had been run out by a substitute.</p> \n<p>Australia had been irritated throughout the series by England’s habit of using substitute fielders, apparently to give their bowlers a rest after a long spell; it was a legitimate complaint – England clearly bent the rules – but in this case Jones was genuinely injured.</p> \n<p>Ponting did not know that, and all the frustration and pressure came out in five seconds of ranting at Fletcher on the balcony. Fletcher was sufficiently distracted by events that he burnt his toast in the dressing-room, though it was clear he loved every second of Ponting’s outburst. “If you want to take a run to the cover fielder and get out, whose fault is that?” he said at the close of play.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nofkoClevE\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9nofkoClevE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The tourists battled on to 387 – Simon Katich got an appalling lbw decision after resisting over four hours for 59 – which left England needing 129 to go ahead in the series. It turned into the kind of run-chase that ages people by ten years. Shane Warne raged majestically against the dying of the light, reducing England to 57 for four. Kevin Pietersen and Flintoff calmed things down with a partnership of 46 before Lee dismissed both, with Flintoff bowled by a stunning delivery.</p> \n<p>England, in control throughout the match, now faced the very real prospect of losing the match – which would have ended the drama at a stroke, because Australia would have gone 2–1 up and retained the urn.</p> \n<p>When Geraint Jones skied Warne to mid-off, England were 116 for seven, 13 short of victory. Hoggard loafed out to join Ashley Giles and said, “Come on, let’s me and you get it done.” Giles’ reply – “It’s reversing at 95mph” – did not quite maintain the mood of cheery certainty. But they did get it done, just about. The crowd greeted Hoggard’s cover-driven four off Lee like the announcement of world peace, and soon after Giles hit the winning runs. “Whether we win or lose, we relish creating a bit of an arse-nipper,” he said. The biggest of them all, the series decider, was yet to come.</p> \n<h2>6) “Get ready for a broken fucking arm”</h2> \n<p><em>Michael Clarke to James Anderson, Brisbane, 2013-14</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f9fb877e-ed9a-4629-8c5d-678aab8b7c60\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435889771565/37ece762-5780-4770-90ef-f61dc73e9552-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Michael Clarke and James Anderson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Clarke and James Anderson exchange words during the first Ashes Test between Australia and England on 24 November, 2013 in Brisbane.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mitchell Johnson waited at the end of his mark. And waited some more. James Anderson, the batsman in his sights, moved out of his crease to prepare himself for the imminent assault. As he did so, he began to exchange unpleasantries with George Bailey, Australia’s short leg. Michael Clarke, the Australian captain, walked towards the incident and was met halfway by Anderson, where they had a full and frank exchange of views. After a few seconds, Clarke began to walk backwards to his position and uttered the words that would shape an Ashes series.</p> \n<p>Clarke’s threat to Anderson, which was picked up by the stump mic, cost him 20% of his match fee. It was worth every penny. It changed the way he was perceived by many among the Australian public; more importantly, it told England that Australia would stop at almost nothing to regain the Ashes. They were about to go 1–0 up in the series, and Clarke sensed the opportunity to score some points for the four remaining Tests.</p> \n<p>The tenor of the contest had changed so much from the previous series that Clarke wanted to ram home the point that England were now on Australia’s manor, and were playing by their rules. It might have backfired; Anderson might have taken 10-for in the next Test, but Clarke’s instinct told him that England were vulnerable.</p> \n<p>Shane Warne later said that the stump mic was switched off – but still accessible for the commentators – seconds earlier when Anderson told Bailey that he wanted to punch him in the face. “Anderson brought it on himself,” said the Australian bowler Peter Siddle after the game, without going into specifics. “So fair’s fair.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtA6laeJBts\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RtA6laeJBts?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In a match that cemented the tone of the series, England had been taken apart by Mitchell Johnson. The phrase ‘shock bowler’ has become a clich&eacute; for those who bowl short, sharp spells, but Johnson fulfilled the role in the truest sense. An experienced, battle-hardened side were so shocked that they never recovered. Before he was a shock bowler, Johnson had been not a stock bowler but a laughing stock, certainly to the Barmy Army.</p> \n<p>The team which played that first Test were the second most experienced in England’s history. They had 649 caps and around 649GB of data based on those appearances and on study of the Australians. This was a grizzled, gnarled team, who thought they had seen everything and were prepared for anything. They had no idea. No computer could have prepared them for the way Johnson spooked them. He no longer bowled to the left and the right; he bowled at the stumps and the head. Modern batsmen, not just England’s, were lulled into a false sense of security by years of mollycoddling; when they were then exposed to extreme pace and aggression, they had about as much idea how to survive as rich kids dropped into the meanest streets of the Bronx.</p> \n<p>Johnson’s impact was similar to that of the West Indian quicks in the 1980s – but there were four of them. He had emphatically got his mojo back, and a combination of his surname and Movember moustache made MoJo an inevitable nickname. And though he never appeared with a low-buttoned shirt exposing enormous clumps of chest hair, his moustache was an inadvertent tribute to the hirsute brutes of 1974–75, the last time England were assaulted so extremely in Australia.</p> \n<p>The Guardian’s Andy Bull, in reference to Johnson’s impact, cited the old Mike Tyson line: ‘Everybody has a plan, until they get punched in the face.’ Bull’s Guardian colleague Mike Selvey referred to Johnson’s as ‘bare-knuckle bowling’. And yet in this game there was no merciful knockout or stoppage. England had to continue to take the blows for five whole Test matches.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> These are edited extracts from </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gentlemen-Sledgers-History-Ashes-Quotations/dp/1784080802\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Gentlemen and Sledgers: A History of the Ashes in 100 Quotations and Confrontations</em></strong></a><em>, published by Head of Zeus.</em></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435888900929/Ian-Botham-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Giving it some humpty: Ian Botham hooks Geoff Lawson on his way to 149 not out during the historic third Test at Headingley in 1981.

None of us knows what’s going to happen over this five-Test series. It would be wrong for me to speculate but I do know that Alastair is incredibly motivated for this series and he is in a better frame of mind going in to it than he has been for a quite a while”.</p> \n<p>Strauss, who knows more than anyone how life as England captain evolves, believes that his Test captain recognises that there is a new style of cricket that England need to continue playing to be successful and to keep the public on side. “I think everyone involved in English cricket got a real lift from the two series against New Zealand, in the way those games were played and the type of cricket England played. It made us all appreciate and understand the importance of engaging with the public.</p> \n<p>“Ultimately we are in the entertainment business and people have a choice whether they turn on cricket on television or go and watch a cricket match or do something different. We’ve got an obligation to make the product one that people want to watch.”</p> \n<p>The last time Strauss sat down in front of the media things looked very different. He was under fire about Kevin Pietersen, for the way the sacking of Peter Moores was handled and in the shadow of England’s disastrous World Cup campaign. Fast forward two months and things could not have really gone any better for him, his decision to back Eoin Morgan as one-day captain has already been vindicated by the attractive limited-overs matches against New Zealand. Strauss is too classy to be smug but in a very short space of time he seems to have achieved at least one of his goals; reconnecting with the English cricket watching public.</p> \n<p>Strauss was speaking at the Kia Oval to promote Cricket for Heroes, an all-star T20 match in which he will playing alongside many other cricketing stars.</p> \n<p>The match is being played to raise money for Help for Heroes and Strauss was keen to remind us, that despite all the pre-Ashes aggression, this is cricket not war.</p> \n<p>“In the context of what we’re talking about today, it makes you realise it’s not about life and death, it’s games of cricket between two very passionate sides who want to desperately win. But I don’t think we need to build it into something it’s not. I think the war rhetoric when it comes to the Ashes is unhelpful.”</p> \n<p>In that vein, Strauss thinks that Bayliss is absolutely perfect for the job. “He won’t take it too seriously but as an Aussie he will be determined to win. He’s a really solid individual who will react well to the pressures that come with the job.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/england-ben-stokes-australia-intimidation-cricket\">England’s Ben Stokes says he can handle any Australian intimidation</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/2/1435857775041/Alastair-Cook-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alastair Cook is going into the Ashes 'in a better frame of mind than he has been for quite a while', said Andrew Strauss.

Now at 24, despite having just five Test caps to his name, he could be Michael Clarke’s most potent weapon when hostilities get under way in Cardiff on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>“It’s a great compliment whenever I read my name anywhere near Glenn’s,” said Hazlewood, who bowled 13 economical but wicketless overs on his first outing of the tour, on day two of Australia’s second warm-up match at Chelmsford against Essex.</p> \n<p>“It’s not a burden at all. Glenn’s the best quick Australia has ever had so to be compared to him is pretty exciting,” he added. The connection does not stop there, with Hazlewood having worked under his idol at the MRF Pace Foundation in 2013, a bowling clinic for aspiring quicks in Chennai, India, that boasts Mitchell Johnson and Brett Lee among its overseas alumni. It seems the method by which McGrath was able to claim 157 wickets in 30 Ashes Tests has now been firmly passed on.</p> \n<p>“I’d like to work with him more but in the sessions we’ve had it was pretty simple,” he added. “Hit that spot that the batsman don’t want you to hit, swing it a bit each way and with the odd bouncer. Glenn didn’t have much more to say than that and it is a pretty simple game plan – it’s just about doing it over and over again.”</p> \n<p>Hazlewood is certainly the form fast bowler in the tourists’ attack, arriving in this country from the Caribbean where he picked up a man-of-the-series award for his 12 wickets in two Tests on pitches, as England’s seamers will testify, that do little to encourage their ilk these days. Now, with the prominent seam of the Dukes ball to work with, he is really interested.</p> \n<p>“I’ve heard from others it is suited to these conditions,” he said. “The last couple of weeks I’ve really enjoyed bowling on the English pitches in practice. The ball has swung around. The wickets are a bit slower and most the time I’m trying to hit a length that’s a touch fuller than Australia just to get the maximum swing and I’ve really enjoyed it so far.”</p> \n<p>Is he prepared, in the spirit of McGrath’s 19 dismissals of Mike Atherton, to single out the England captain, Alastair Cook, as the wicket he is targeting above all others this summer? “There’s a couple of key wickets,” he replied. “Joe Root is in outstanding form at the moment and Cook is always very important to get on top of early in each innings. Cook is obviously back in the runs recently. I’ll be talking to our senior bowlers for as much information as I can [about him]. I think full is the length to most of the English batsmen – they sit back and play it late – to try and see as much swing as they can.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435861175820/Cricket---Ashes-Tour-2015-018.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Josh Hazlewood, in action against Essex, is happy to be compared with Australia legend Glenn McGrath.

Here was England’s genuine all-rounder – a player reborn this summer and on the eve of what will be his second Ashes – realising, somewhat belatedly, he had become the latest to be sucked into the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/29/ashes-england-wont-come-close-steve-smith\" title=\"\">sledging-dominated dialogue</a> that has led up to next week’s first Test with Australia in Cardiff.</p> \n<p>Stokes, present as one of three England cricketers in front of the microphones on Thursday morning, had been asked about the fiery temperament that has become a hallmark of his international career to date and how, when the situation inevitably arises, the 24-year-old will deal with confrontation from a side notorious for being in the face of their opponents.</p> \n<p>The former England captain Michael Vaughan has already suggested Michael Clarke’s tourists will look to trigger the short fuse that saw him cross swords with Mitchell Johnson on debut in late 2013, break his hand <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/apr/17/ben-stokes-punching-lockers-england-passion\" title=\"\">punching a locker</a> in the Caribbean the following year and draw a sarcastic saluted send-off from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/poll/2015/apr/24/marlon-samuels-ben-stokes-salute-england-west-indies\" title=\"\">Marlon Samuels</a> in April.</p> \n<p>Does Stokes, whose ability to bowl 90mph and bludgeon the ball with the bat in hand makes him an asset that Australia cannot rival and who provided the stand-out innings to date this summer with his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/24/alastair-cook-ben-stokes-england-new-zealand\" title=\"\">85-ball century against New Zealand</a> at Lord’s, see the aggressive part of his cricketing DNA as a strength or an achilles heel?</p> \n<p>“It’s a strength,” he replied, with little hesitation. “It’s about being in a battle and if you are in a battle you don’t want to be a loser. If I get involved I don’t want to take a backward step and let them know they are on top of me and can say what they want and get away with it.</p> \n<p>“I’m definitely expecting there to be some feuds out on the pitch but I will not go out of my way looking to cause an argument. If anyone comes at you on the cricket pitch in the heat of the moment – when the adrenaline is going – I don’t think anyone in our squad is one to shy away from it.”</p> \n<p>Across the stage from Stokes, who was joined by two fellow first-Test squad members in Stuart Broad and Steven Finn as part of a press conference hosted by series sponsors Investec, sat the former Australian fast bowler Jeff Thomson, a man who in retirement has become almost as notorious for his soundbites in the buildup to modern series as the fear-inducing pace he displayed in the 1970s.</p> \n<p>Asked about the white heat of Ashes cricket, the 64-year-old gave a charming nod of appreciation in Stokes’s direction. “Sure, the Aussies will be yapping at them,” he said. “But the redhead over here – you can tell he likes it.”</p> \n<p>Stokes, more comfortable facing the likes of Johnson than in front of the microphone, is of course more than just an attitude in whites; he is a cricketer of rare all-round talent. That second-innings display of fireworks with the bat at Lord’s in May – his first Test century since December 2013 in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/dec/17/ashes-2013-14-ben-stokes-england\" title=\"\">Perth</a>, during the 5-0 Ashes whitewash – naturally garnered the greatest attention.</p> \n<p>But it was with the ball on the final day of that 124-run win that the Durham all-rounder exhibited that – dare we say it – Botham- or Flintoff-esque quality of seizing the moment, by removing Kane Williamson and Brendon McCullum in successive deliveries. Now blessed with greater responsibility following his return to No6, one would expect his batting and bowling averages – 34 and 43 respectively – eventually to flip around.</p> \n<p>England’s hopes of regaining the Ashes urn this summer, beyond their ability to block out the noise, will not solely rest on Stokes aping the feats of those aforementioned all-rounders. It will also depend on how the collective adapt to life under the new head coach <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/30/england-cricket-team-pictures-trevor-bayliss-training-camp-spain\" title=\"\">Trevor Bayliss</a> and continue this new-found attacking style under the captaincy of Alastair Cook. The early suggestion is that the player-led environment fostered under the caretaker coach Paul Farbrace against New Zealand will remain.</p> \n<p>Both Bayliss and Farbrace, who has now dropped down to the role of assistant following the Australian’s arrival last week, spent the four-day training camp in Spain over the weekend preaching self-reliance and the importance of enjoying the contest. The message, it appears, has been well received.</p> \n<p>“Every international cricketer takes responsibility for their own game – it’s you who gets the stick if you don’t do well, it’s you who gets dropped,” said Broad, heading into his fourth series against Australia. “We can take energy and enthusiasm from what’s happened early this summer and I think Trevor has realised how upbeat the guys are from our four days in Spain.</p> \n<p>“Of course, in the battle we will be competitive and ruthless when we get the chance but we will play with a smile on our face,” Broad added. “To be fair, we do our hobby for a living and you play your best cricket if you are having fun.”</p> \n<p>“Trevor just seems to want to put the responsibility on to us and get the best out of our ability,” said Stokes. “He pretty much said: ‘Cookie is in charge, he’s the captain. I’m more of a support staff to all you players.’ If a coach puts the responsibility to the shoulders of the players, that’s got to do us the world of good.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/01/trevor-bayliss-england-australia-coach\">Trevor Bayliss lives up to reputation with measured words not hyperbole</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/2/1435844111227/ben-stokes-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ben Stokes will not let the Australians upset him.

After coming through a tougher examination in the first round against Mikhail Kukushkin, he hit another level against Haase, beating him 6-1, 6-1, 6-4 in under an hour and a half.</p> \n<p>His opponent on Saturday is the Italian Andreas Seppi, who finished impressively to see off the precocious challenge of the rising Croatian star Borna Coric 4-6, 6-4, 6-7 (3), 6-1, 6-1.</p> \n<p>Murray, who is enormously supportive of other British players, was particularly pleased for Ward, who bears the perennial mien of the put-upon underdog, although he was quick to put his achievement in perspective.</p> \n<p>“Obviously the draw opened up,” Murray said. “He was to play [David] Ferrer in the first round – an extremely difficult draw. Then playing a lucky loser [Luca Vanni] in the first round, he’s taken advantage of the opportunity that he’s had at a very important time for him, as well, because he hadn’t won so many matches lately.</p> \n<p>“After here, he has quite a lot of points to defend. It was very important for him to capitalise on that. He’s won a couple of good matches. Today I saw the last couple of games. Vesely is a tough opponent. It was a good win for James today. He has an opportunity again in the third round.”</p> \n<p>Ward was plainly thrilled about his progress, although typically downbeat in his response to even the slightest praise. “It’s great,” he said. “Obviously my ranking goes up, into third round of Wimbledon … I can’t ask for anything more at the moment.”</p> \n<p>Asked whether winning back-to-back matches at Wimbledon was comparable to Arsenal, his team, winning two FA Cups in a row, he said, “Winning third round would probably be like Arsenal winning the league next year, to be honest. After that, we start thinking about Champions League finals. Let’s think about Saturday first.”</p> \n<p>Ward and Murray have an interest in the north London club, Ward’s driven by birth – he is the son of a Euston cab driver – Murray’s by an admiration for their football. It is a bond that has contributed to the good feeling between them, either as Davis Cup team-mates or campaigning in a slam, which they are doing side by side now, rather than Ward going home early.</p> \n<p>“He’s just a good friend above all,” Ward said. “We get on really well. We have a lot of the same interests as well outside of tennis. He’s always there supporting, he’s always watching matches. A lot of people know that he follows live streams of challengers, is always there to send you a message when you’ve done well, or pick you up when you need a bit of support.</p> \n<p>“A lot of stuff that he does and says really doesn’t get reported that much. As I said for few of us, it’s nice to have that support from such a great player.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/02/wimbledon-2015-day-four-live\">Rafael Nadal knocked out of Wimbledon 2015 by Dustin Brown – day four as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Murray added: “I’ve spent a lot of time with him over the last 12, 18 months.We’ve done a few training blocks together. He stayed with me in Miami a few times. I watch a lot of his matches online when he’s playing challengers and stuff.”</p> \n<p>As for their joint assault on the third round, Ward remains cool-headed rather than sentimental. “Everyone is concentrating on their own thing,” Ward said. “It’s great for British tennis and it’s great for everyone involved that more people are winning matches and doing well. But, as I say, I’ve got to worry about my match. Andy worries about his. Aljaz worries about his as well.”</p> \n<p>Murray is looking only towards his match against Seppi. “He has had such good results this year. He made the final a couple of weeks ago in Halle, plays well on the grass. He won against Roger [Federer] at the Australian Open this year. He’s capable of playing some top tennis.”</p> \n<p>Ultimately, they are all on their own here.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435871384916/487fd76a-a7fb-4c2e-9a9e-229b6e9f52c1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media/UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media","altText":"James Ward","cleanCredit":"Photograph: UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media/UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T21:15:59Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T23:55:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Kevin Mitchell","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741641/KevinMitchell.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/kevinmitchell"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Wimbledon 2015","Andy Murray","James Ward","Wimbledon","Tennis","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/andymurray","webTitle":"Andy Murray"},{"id":"sport/james-ward","webTitle":"James Ward"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Kevin Mitchell","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/kevinmitchell"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/andy-murray-james-ward-wimbledon","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4abgv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/02/andy-murray-james-ward-wimbledon","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/02/andy-murray-james-ward-wimbledon"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435871384916/487fd76a-a7fb-4c2e-9a9e-229b6e9f52c1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"James Ward celebrates his four-set victory against Jiri Vesely at Wimbledon.

You put in all the work but you get none of the public plaudits. Not if the person you’re second to is Andy Murray, at any rate.</p> \n<p>No wonder that the victory of James Ward – for many years Andy Murray’s de facto deputy – over Jiri Vesely was accompanied by such an outpouring of love on No2 Court. The Londoner’s 6-2, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3 defeat of the Czech player, ranked 65 places higher, was his greatest on-court achievement and secured his progression to the third round for the first time.</p> \n<p>It would have felt all the sweeter since Ward had recently lost his ranking as British No2. Recent injuries and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/05/aljaz-bedene-andy-murray\" title=\"\">the arrival in the UK of Aljaz Bedene</a> – who fared less well on Thursday, losing in four sets to 22nd seed Viktor Troicki – had combined to knock him down to No4, and Ward, who helped <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/mar/08/andy-murray-davis-cup-john-isner\" title=\"\">Great Britain defeat USA in the Davis Cup in March</a>, was under threat of his place for the upcoming quarter-final with France. You suspect that is now far from his mind.</p> \n<p>Ward may have had a little luck in the draw so far – the No8 seed, David Ferrer, withdrew, leaving Ward a first-round match against the non-qualifying Luca Vanni – but his Czech opponent was a big favourite in this match. Celebrating his 22nd birthday next week, Vesely is considered a rising star of the tour – a former junior No1 whose father is a tennis coach and who won his first ATP Tour title in Auckland this year. Ward, meanwhile, had been struggling with both knee and foot problems since March and was playing on painkillers.</p> \n<p>So Ward knew that a short match was a good match. He broke Vesely in only the second game and tested the left-hander’s backhand from the outset. Since hiring the Australian coach Darren Tandy last year Ward has been working on his accuracy, and that precision was evident throughout in his cool passing shots, his whipped cross-court forehand, and a pin-perfect lob to the baseline in the second set tie-break.</p> \n<p>Ward has been taken under the wing of Ray Kelvin, otherwise known as Ted Baker, who <a href=\"http://tedbakerblog.com/2015/01/james-ward-englands-1-tennis-pro/\" title=\"\">has been designing him a daring sequence of bespoke outfits</a> for the tour this year. Under Wimbledon’s stringent clothing restrictions the only flash on show here was the little hint of red on his collar and his socks – but there was plenty more in his play. He thrashed his first serve of the match past Vesely’s air shot of a backhand, and ended up hitting 15 in the match in total.</p> \n<p>Both players challenged each other all round the court, demonstrating deft net play that kept the 4,000-strong crowd oohing and aahing. Ward was especially quick to move forward but he was composed at the baseline too, and when the pair did manage a long rally of ground strokes in the second set, he was the man who brought it to a killer finish.</p> \n<p>The looked-for break failed to come, though; at 4-3 and 0-40 up Tandy had given Ward an approving nod but Ward lost that game and went 0-30 down in the next. A set point then went begging to a viciously spinning volley, and by the time he was 0-3 down in the tie break, Ward’s long arms seemed to hang a little longer. He prevailed, only for Vesely to take the third set.</p> \n<p>The Czech, who needed a medical time out for treatment on his left shoulder, played the match’s more muscular shots. But he also made more errors and a number of times the ball flew wildly from the edge of his racquet. “I&nbsp;had a bit of a lapse in the third set, which was frustrating,” Ward said. “To bounce back and come through showed a lot of character. I have a lot of belief in myself.”</p> \n<p>That showed in the final set, which required him to hold his nerve through a couple of testing games – including one where, close to the net, he got hit on the cheek by a Vesely backhand. “Those last three service games in that set were tough. He didn’t miss too many balls,” Ward said. “I think he returned pretty well throughout the whole match.”</p> \n<p>Ever since Murray’s appearance in the top four, it has always been the hope – not least of Murray himself – that his success would inspire those around him. Heather Watson and Laura Robson have both responded to that aspirational call in recent years; Ward’s achievement will, you suspect, feel even closer to home.</p> \n<p>Murray took Ward to Miami on a boot camp at the start of this year as the pair helped each other prepare for the season. Those preparations have paid off: Ward, ranked No173 before the start of the French Open, has now entered the top 100 for the first time.</p> \n<p>“It’s always a good help spending time with him, at Davis Cup and off-season as well, which I’ve been lucky enough to do,” Ward said. “Good habits rub off on you if you spend enough time around someone.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435846235064/James-Ward-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"James Ward reacts after his victory over Jiri Vesely at Wimbledon.

I just really look forward to playing her. Draws are funny like that. Sometimes you can play the same person three weeks in a row, and then you might not play one person for maybe three years. She is a great champion and a legend in the game, so it will be a great experience for me – and where better for me to play her than here at Wimbledon?”</p> \n<p>Watson has gone this deep after a fighting come-from-behind win over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/30/heather-watson-caroline-garcia-wimbledon\">Caroline Garcia</a> – the French player identified a few years ago by Andy Murray as one to watch – and an even more impressive 6-4, 6-2 victory over the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/01/heather-watson-daniela-hantuchova-wimbledon-serena-williams\">Slovakian Daniela Hantuchova</a> on Wednesday. It has buoyed her occasionally flagging spirits. Serena, the world No1 and obvious favourite, gave up just five games to the Russian qualifier <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/serena-williams-margarita-gasparyan-wimbledon-2015-first-round\">Margarita Gasparyan</a> then beat the Hungarian <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/01/serena-williams-beats-timea-babos-wimbledon-2015-heather-watson\">Timea Babos</a> by the same margin. She has not been remotely stretched yet.</p> \n<p>Watson said she first became aware of the Williams sisters on her initial visit to Wimbledon as a child.</p> \n<p>“It was when I came to Wimbledon and I bought two posters. I was like seven or eight years old. One was Venus and Serena together and one was Roger Federer. Those were the three players that I liked. They went straight up on my wall.”</p> \n<p>She next saw Serena at Nick Bollettieri’s academy in Florida. “When I was 12 or 13 at school there it was a big thing for her to come and train, so all of our teachers let us out of school to go and watch her practise and play. We were just hundreds of us schoolkids there. I don’t know if she signed autographs there. And now I might get the opportunity to play her, and it’s really exciting. When people that don’t know much about tennis find out I play tennis, one of the first questions is: ‘Have you played Serena?’ And I’m like: ‘No – but I have played Venus.’”</p> \n<p>Watson says she does not know either of them socially, adding: “Yeah I would say hello – but I say hello to everybody!”</p> \n<p>As for Serena’s legendary regal presence in the locker room, Watson said: “I always find I don’t see her that much. I don’t know what time she practises. Some people you see all the time, but I hardly see her. But she does have a presence about her. She is a strong woman, and even if she wasn’t a tennis player she would have a presence.”</p> \n<p>All of that will count for nothing at all when they confront each other on Friday. Watson has had stretches of form this year that promised more than they delivered. Playing at Wimbledon might well provide a significant edge to her game but she will do well just to stay in the contest with one of the greatest players of all time.</p> \n<p>Serena is not just No1 of this and many other years, and of her era, but a contender for consideration at the very peak of her sport.

Aliz&eacute; Cornet has won her past three meetings with the American and is probably the last person Williams would want to see across the net as she continues her quest for grand slam title No21. Drawn in opposite halves this time round, their chances of a meeting were slim – they could only have face each other in the final – but slim became none on Thursday as the Frenchwoman was ousted 7-6, 2-6, 6-1 by Olga Govortsova of Belarus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/heather-watson-serena-williams-venus-wimbledon-2015\">Wimbledon 2015: Heather Watson undaunted by double Williams challenge</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Cornet got the better of Williams three times in 2014, the most famous of the three coming in the third round at Wimbledon, a match Cornet won in three sets. In the year since, Williams has lost only three times, including to Cornet in Wuhan in September, when she retired at 6-5 up in the first set. Whatever the reason, Cornet has been able to do something few others have managed lately – to make Williams play below her imperious best. So if a smile passed the American’s lips yesterday as Cornet went out, it would have been easily understood.</p> \n<p>“I think I played with good tactics for the three times I beat her last year,” Cornet said. “I was playing the right shot at the right time and I was not panicking of who I had on the other side of the net, forgetting about who she is, how many titles she has and her ranking.”</p> \n<p>“She is a good runner, she is strong and a great athlete so I was trying to play up the middle and deep. I think the key is to play very deep against Serena because if you play short, you’re dead. I put a lot of first serves in and one of the keys for me was to return all of her serves, and I think she was annoyed by the fact I was returning them, just getting them back. And I was aggressive on the second serve and I think she is not used to that.”</p> \n<p>Not everyone can do that, of course, and Cornet admits that consistency is her own problem. But if Heather Watson is looking for tips, then Cornet is worth listening to. “Against Serena you have nothing to lose,” she said. “It’s a pleasure for me to play against such a big champion. I think I put her in a kind of trouble when I play against her and I’m proud of it. My best is coming out against her somehow. I wish I could do it against everyone.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435873067038/cfba77d3-3547-4132-ae24-5f61e0375002-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom Jenkins/Tom Jenkins","altText":"Alize Cornet","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tom Jenkins/Tom Jenkins"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T21:38:15Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T23:08:18Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Simon Cambers","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/simon-cambers"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Heather Watson","Serena Williams","Wimbledon 2015","Wimbledon","Sport","US sports","Tennis"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/heather-watson","webTitle":"Heather Watson"},{"id":"sport/serena-williams","webTitle":"Serena Williams"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Simon Cambers","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/simon-cambers"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/heather-watson-serena-williams-alize-cornet","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4abg4","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/02/heather-watson-serena-williams-alize-cornet","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/02/heather-watson-serena-williams-alize-cornet"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435873067038/cfba77d3-3547-4132-ae24-5f61e0375002-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alizé Cornet, who beat Serena Williams in 2014, rued her lack of consistency after losing this year to Olga Govortsova, Photograph: Tom Jenkins/Tom Jenkins","credit":"Tom Jenkins/Tom Jenkins","altText":"Alize Cornet","cleanCaption":"Alizé Cornet, who beat Serena Williams in 2014, rued her lack of consistency after losing this year to Olga Govortsova,","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tom Jenkins/Tom Jenkins"}},"importance":0,"kicker":{"title":"Simon Cambers"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435873067038/cfba77d3-3547-4132-ae24-5f61e0375002-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom Jenkins/Tom Jenkins","altText":"Alize Cornet","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tom Jenkins/Tom Jenkins"}}]}],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435855320362/Wimbledon-Championships-2-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Heather Watson has impressed at Wimbledon this year but now faces Serena Williams.

She’s inconsolable and we didn’t deserve that as a team. We deserved to go through. We were the better team. It’s crap, isn’t it!”</p> \n<p>A Japan side who had been a little condescending towards England ended up being really put through their paces and the winger Carney gave the impression she will not cheering them on in Sunday’s final <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/30/womens-world-cup-usa-into-final-after-carli-lloyd-tames-germany\" title=\"\">against the USA</a> in Vancouver.</p> \n<p>“Their karma, or whatever it is, will get them,” she said before turning her attention to the legacy the Lionesses trust will be created by their achievement in reaching a semi-final for the first time. “We believed we would come back with a gold medal, we believed we would win the trophy but we haven’t,” she said.</p> \n<p>“Hopefully, though, we’ve inspired a nation. Hopefully we’ve changed a lot of stereotypes and a lot of people’s perceptions about women’s football.”</p> \n<p>The sense that a watershed has been reached is acute. “Hopefully people now fully respect us,” Carney said. “Hopefully young girls, and young boys, now admire England, are backing our team and have rediscovered a love for the game.</p> \n<p>“I think we’ve got a lot of respect for the way we are as people. We’re just normal people who put on a jersey for our country and give everything. Television viewers would have seen that after the game, seen how heartbreaking it was for us.”</p> \n<p>And one player in particular. “We’re all looking after Laura, letting her know it wasn’t her fault,” said Carney. “We’re there for her; we’re a team through all the highs and lows. We have to stick together.</p> \n<p>“We just need to look after Laura now. We’re 100% going to give her all the love and support she needs. Losing wasn’t just about the own goal, it just wasn’t meant to be today.”</p> \n<p>As Bassett enjoyed the additional consolation offered by her boyfriend and her brother – who, without accreditation, performed the not insignificant task of persuading Fifa officials to permit him into the Lionesses’ dressing room to comfort his sister at the final whistle – Carney attempted to look forward to Saturday’s third place play-off against Germany. “We’ve got to get our jerseys back on,” she said. “We’ve got to try and get that third place.”</p> \n<p>It was a message reiterated by Steph Houghton. “Now we have Germany,” said Mark Sampson’s captain. “We’re desperate to finish third. Fingers crossed we can do that.</p> \n<p>“We’re devastated to have lost to Japan but they are world champions for a reason and we were immense. Hopefully we did the nation proud. Our aim was to try and inspire young girls in England – and we were that close to the final.

I couldn’t be prouder of everyone.”</p> \n<p>During the Lionesses’ long trek across Canada, all the way from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific, they have increasingly captured hearts and minds – and Houghton could not be more delighted.</p> \n<p>“We’re aware a little bit of how we’ve been received back home but when I talk to my family they tell me how much it has gripped the nation,” she said. “We wanted to do England proud and I think we have.</p> \n<p>“The amount of TV exposure we’ve had and the attention women’s football has got has been brilliant.

And whether you’re a player, fan, father, mother, just talk, talk to people”, he said.<br /></p> \n<p>He paid tribute to Walsh, who had taken over the club late last year: “He’s a coach, he’s a leader of men. Unambiguous, straight up and down, clear messaging, inspiring, genuinely cared,” he said. <br /></p> \n<p>Politicians and sporting figures from the many clubs he was involved with expressed their shock and grief at the killing.<br /></p> \n<p>The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, said there was “a pall” over Walsh’s home town, Hamilton, and “a pall over AFL more generally today”.</p> \n<p>“I certainly would want to extend my deepest condolences to his family, to his friends, to his colleagues and perhaps we might just pause for a moment or two of silence,” he said.</p> \n<p>McLachlan said earlier Walsh was a man of “boundless energy and enthusiasm”.<br /></p> \n<p>“Our industry is grieving today, and we send our love and support to the Walsh family, the Crows staff and players, Phil’s wider circle of friends, the other clubs he worked with and his many colleagues across the AFL,” he said.</p> \n<p>South Australia’s premier, Jay Weatherill, also expressed his condolences. “My thoughts are currently with Phil’s family, friends, as well as the players, officials and supporters of the Adelaide football club. These thoughts extend to everyone who has associated with Phil throughout his career.”</p> \n<p>Nathan Brown, a former player at Richmond Football Club and a TV commentator for Australia’s Nine Network, said the death was shocking and would affect many AFL clubs.</p> \n<p>“He’s been at half the AFL clubs,” Brown said. “This is going to touch so many people.”</p> \n<p>The Adelaide-born Australian education minister, Christopher Pyne, tweeted that Walsh’s death was a “terrible tragedy”.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cpyne/statuses/616756320616648704\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Phil Walsh's death is a terrible tragedy for his family and all who knew him <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Adelaide_FC\">@Adelaide_FC</a>.

He won the equivalent of the Rising Star award for best young player, and was poached by Richmond the following year. He joined Brisbane in 1987, picking up the club’s best and fairest award.</p> \n<p>A handy wingman, it was as an old-school coach – “a hard man, a hard taskmaster,” <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/australia-news/adelaide\">Adelaide</a> legend Graham Cornes said – that Walsh left his biggest imprint on the game.</p> \n<p>He became strength and conditioning coach at Geelong football club in 1995, joined Port <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/adelaide\">Adelaide</a> as an assistant coach four years later and then the West Coast Eagles in 2009. In 2014 he re-joined Port, before applying for the vacant spot at the Crows and winning it.</p> \n<p>“He bloomed, it was the opportunity he had been waiting for,” Cornes said on Friday.</p> \n<p>However, his obsessive focus on football left little room for anything else. Asked if he was a good father, he admitted “that’s a really hard question”.</p> \n<p>“The bonus of me taking the Crows job is my son is 26 and my daughter is 22, so the collateral damage isn’t so big. But have I been a good father? To my son, I had a disconnect because of footy,” he said.</p> \n<p>“In a selfish way, I taught my daughter to surf, and that’s my release, so when I go surfing, I take her. Now I’ve got my son into it as well and that’s what I should’ve done a long time ago.</p> \n<p>“A couple of months ago we all went surfing together at Middleton and it was almost the best day I’ve had ... ever,” he said.</p>","section":"Australia","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/69823029cb3c45418d8fc0557f0272fc970bae41/0_79_2097_1258/2097.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1258,"width":2097,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Julian Smith/AAP","altText":"The Crows' coach Phil Walsh","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T04:50:40Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T07:04:53Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Adelaide","AFL","Australian rules football","Australia sport","Sport","Adelaide","South Australia"],"tags":[{"id":"australia-news/adelaide","webTitle":"Adelaide"},{"id":"sport/afl","webTitle":"AFL"},{"id":"sport/australian-rules-football","webTitle":"Australian rules football"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/adelaide","webTitle":"Adelaide"},{"id":"australia-news/south-australia","webTitle":"South Australia"}],"section":{"id":"australia-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-457396237","source":"Australian Associated Press","durationInSeconds":111,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/03/150703Fans_FromGAus-16x9.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/03/150703Fans_FromGAus/150703Fans_FromGAus.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435899895534/Adelaide-Crows-supporters-001.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":640,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jenny Smart, a spokeswoman for the Adelaide Crows Supporters group, speaks outside the club's football headquarters at AAMI Stadium in Adelaide, after senior coach Phil Walsh was found dead after a domestic dispute at his home. 03 July 2015 Photograph: AAP","credit":"AAP","altText":"Adelaide Crows supporters group","cleanCaption":"Jenny Smart, a spokeswoman for the Adelaide Crows Supporters group, speaks outside the club's football headquarters at AAMI Stadium in Adelaide, after senior coach Phil Walsh was found dead after a domestic dispute at his home. 03 July 2015 Photograph: AAP"}}],"adTargetingPath":"australia-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/australia-news/2015/jul/03/australian-rules-football-son-charged-after-coach-phil-walsh-stabbed-to-death","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4abtz","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/australia-news/2015/jul/03/australian-rules-football-son-charged-after-coach-phil-walsh-stabbed-to-death","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/03/australian-rules-football-son-charged-after-coach-phil-walsh-stabbed-to-death"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/69823029cb3c45418d8fc0557f0272fc970bae41/0_79_2097_1258/2097.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1258,"width":2097,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Australian rules football coach Phil Walsh was killed on Friday.

If I win just another grand tour it’s not going to change my career but if I achieve the double this is something people are going to remember. I take a lot of motivation from this.”</p> \n<p>The winner of the 2007 and 2009 Tours added he would have preferred to be on the start line feeling as he did in 2014 before his race was curtailed after breaking his leg in a fall during the 10th stage. “It’s new to me, how my body will respond to the effort.”</p> \n<p>The Spaniard believes the 2015 race is “one of the most open in Tour history”: “In the first nine days there are six intense stages. It will be a Tour without respite.”</p> \n<p>He rates the 2014 Giro winner, Nairo Quintana of Movistar, as favourite in a Tour “for the climbers”. But he also sees his major challengers as last year’s winner, Vincenzo Nibali of Astana, citing the Italian’s consistency, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/video/2013/jul/23/chris-froome-tour-de-france-2013-video-highlights\" title=\"\">and the 2013 champion, Sky’s Chris Froome</a>. “On his day he has a change of rhythm that nobody can follow,” Contador admitted.</p> \n<p>While those four appear to be the main contenders to wear the yellow jersey into Paris, Trek Factory Racing’s Fabian Cancellara has his eyes firmly set on winning Saturday’s prologue in the Netherlands, in what may prove to be his final Tour. Nicknamed Spartacus for his aggressive riding style, the Swiss crashed badly in March and missed the Cobbled Classics. He battled back at the Tour de Suisse, narrowly losing the opening prologue to the Dutchman Tom Dumoulin of Giant-Alpecin, who will meanwhile carry local hopes at the Grand D&eacute;part in Utrecht.</p> \n<p>“I’m looking forward to this,” Cancellara said. “I have my goals and my ambitions but first I will try also to enjoy the race and all the experience I have to put it into the race because it is a special one, a tough one.”</p> \n<p>Among his challengers will be Tony Martin (Etixx-Quickstep), the three-time world time trial champion and Britain’s Alex Dowsett (Movistar) who held the Hour record until Sir Bradley Wiggins broke it in style in June.</p> \n<p>After his press conference, some Dutch journalists presented Contador with a canary – he bred them before turning professional – and the Spaniard named it Yellow. He will be hoping it isn’t the only yellow he takes home from the 2015 Tour.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435857786404/Tour-de-France-2015-press-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Contador receives a yellow canary from the hosts of Dutch TV programme Bureau Sport during a press conference in Utrecht.
