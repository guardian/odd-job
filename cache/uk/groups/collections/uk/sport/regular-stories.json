He resisted pressure later to informally canonise his conqueror afterwards but he did say: “That’s definitely the best he served against me.” Federer agreed: “Definitely it was one of the best serving days of my career.”</p> \n<p>Federer’s greatness is not only delivered on his racket, though, or framed in mere statistics, but is forged in his heart and soul: he loves this game and winning so much that his insistence afterwards that revenge for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/06/novak-djokovic-wins-wimbledon-title-roger-federer\" title=\"\">losing in the final here last year to Djokovic</a> was not his prime motivation rang a little hollow. He wants to beat him as badly as he has wanted anything in the game in recent years. Djokovic is his new Rafa Nadal.</p> \n<p>“It’s great to play Novak anywhere these days,” he said, sounding vaguely nostalgic about some of their titanic battles. “Especially the last few years, he’s been unbelievably dominant.”</p> \n<p>He added, not entirely convincingly: “I don’t really think about the match we played against each other last year. I just remember it was unbelievably thrilling.&nbsp;The crowd really got into it. I’m just happy to be back in a final. Whoever&nbsp;that’s going to be against, it’s always a big occasion. That it is Novak, the world No1, it obviously adds something extra.”</p> \n<p>He added for the benefit of his audience of many millions: “I think the fans know why I’m playing. At the end of the day, I enjoy it. The game is bigger than any athletes we’ve ever had. It really is. I feel very much liked by many people around the world. It’s been amazing to have that support. It helps when you’ve been around the block for a long time. People sort of get to know you.”</p> \n<p>Victory would give him a record eighth Wimbledon title and 18th major, at 33 – and with at least a couple of years to come. He plays for love, but he loves trophies too, and reaching for those records against the best player in the world after being written off in many quarters as incapable of winning at the highest level again will provide him with all the incentive he needs.</p> \n<p>Murray, choosing to receive, did not get in front throughout the match but, after nearly breaking in the first game, he carried the fight to Federer all the way to the end of each set. The hub of the whole contest arrived in an astonishing struggle near the end of the second set. Murray saved five set points in 15 tortuous minutes of high-grade exchanges that left everyone breathless – followed by a swift and killing denouement by Federer to go two sets up.</p> \n<p>“He played some unbelievable shots, great retrieving,” Federer said of Murray. “I had my chances. I didn’t get down on myself. It’s a perfect game, regardless if I win or I lose. Even though you could see it in another way, as well, it was a key game for him to stay on and break my good run. It would have changed things around completely.</p> \n<p>But it did not. The extended moment mirrored the second game of the fourth set in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jan/22/andy-murray-out-roger-federer-australian-open\" title=\"\">2014 Australian Open quarter-final</a>, when Murray survived a 20-minute test of his resolve, only for Federer to hold to love in the next game and go on to take the match. Here his march to the line in the third set – at 33 minutes the shortest of the three – also had the air of inevitability about it at the end, Murray sticking a final forehand wide.</p> \n<p>But he left content – and that might not have been the case years ago. He has the look of a happy man – this was only his second defeat since marrying Kim Sears in April – and much to look forward to.</p> \n<p>“I got broken right at the end all of the sets,” he pointed out. “But I didn’t actually play a bad match. At times I played some very good tennis.</p> \n<p>He clearly deserved to win the match. He had more opportunities than me. If Roger serves in the final like he did today, he’ll give himself a great opportunity to win that match.</p> \n<p>“I was trying to fight as hard as I could. I served pretty well under pressure in that game. I served well – the best I served in the tournament.” And, as he has said many times before, he relishes his time in this era, maybe the strongest in the history of the game. And he reckons Federer has some miles left on the clock.</p> \n<p>“When he plays like that, he could play for a long time. You never know when the last time you’re going to play against him. It’s great that I get the opportunity to play against these guys.</p> \n<p>“This year so far has been my most consistent by far. In comparison to last year, it’s night and day. I’m playing so much better than then. It’s still an extremely tough time to win these major events because the guys that are around are phenomenal tennis players. But I do enjoy it.” With that, he wiped his brow and retired to an ice bath.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/10/andy-murray-roger-federer-wimbledon-2015-semi-final-live\">Roger Federer defeats Andy Murray: Wimbledon 2015 semi-final – live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-db5ccf46-971a-4203-a90b-83c37ef703ef\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436551109293/69c713ad-9c81-4176-82ac-d66cf8940bb7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"andy murray leaves\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murray wonders what happened.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/10/novak-djokovic-richard-gasquet-wimbledon-final\">Novak Djokovic overpowers Richard Gasquet to reach Wimbledon final</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/10/1436550650984/andy-murray-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray congratulates Roger Federer after the Swiss handed out a tennis lesson on Centre Court.

Rule two: ignore rule one when he is playing Roger Federer.</p> \n<p>Up on the Hill and in living rooms around the country, things are different. But in the rarefied air of Centre Court it is still the appearance of the Fed Express, serving here like a train, that makes many of the pastel-clad masses go weak at the knees.</p> \n<p>Centre Court at Wimbledon, for all its maddening peculiarities, can usually be relied upon to fuel Murray with the self belief that allows him to play his best tennis. There is but one caveat. When he is playing Federer, all bets are off. Even during that tear-soaked 2012 final defeat, when the roof came over and Federer turned the screw, the vocal support was often fairly evenly matched.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/10/roger-federer-andy-murray-wimbledon-semi-final\">Roger Federer unbreakable against Andy Murray in Wimbledon semi-final | Andy Bull</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is perhaps no coincidence that it was instead at the Olympics here a month later, amid an orgy of flag waving, that Murray swept Federer aside in what the Scot this week called a huge turning point in his career. As Federer, ice cool in his white bandana, lined up to serve to his opponent, sporting a baseball cap, the crowd roared. But it was hard to tell who they were yelling for. Mainly, for once, they seemed excited to be there.</p> \n<p>The story of Murray’s relationship with middle England is well worn and does not need repeating. Suffice to say he won them over on his own terms and his 2013 victory has enshrined his immortality. Whoever they were backing, it was intense. And so very tense. t felt like a final. The woozy, boozy bonhomie and stifling heat of the first week had given way to a brittle, cool breeze and a huge sense of occasion.</p> \n<p>And no point more so than during that impossibly tense, epic 10th game of the second set. This was tennis on the edge, of impossibly high quality with zero margin for error. It went on for 17 heart-stopping minutes, both players went through two rackets and Murray saved five set points before finally prevailing.</p> \n<p>Concertinaed into that 17 minutes was a mini sporting epic all of its own. For the first time, Murray began to work the crowd, engaging them, shaking his fist, exhorting them. It was street fighting scrapping of which Sir Alex Ferguson, looking down from his perch in the Royal Box alongside Thierry Henry, would have heartily approved. The often reserved Centre Court crowd momentarily forgot their reverence for Federer and responded in kind, yelling him on, willing him back into the match.</p> \n<p>Yet when Federer went on to ultimately clinch the set two games later, they made plain their acclaim for him too, touched to be in the presence of his genius. There was a couple of Fed fanatics decked out all in red to the right of the scoreboard but most of those watching were metaphorically wearing both bandana and baseball cap. “It definitely also gave me a lift to see that the crowd was actually evenly split,” said Federer afterwards, speculating that their affection had grown as he had entered the latter stages of his career.</p> \n<p>There was also an all-prevailing sense in which even the entitled denizens of this famous sporting arena knew they were hugely privileged to be here, on this day, watching these two players. Following an incredible rally in the fifth game, where the pair exchanged half volleys on the approach before Federer won the point with the cutest of angled slices, the crowd audibly groaned at the quality of the banquet being spread before them.</p> \n<p>During the first set in particular the quality from both players was startlingly high. So accurately and aggressively was Federer serving that the tension was heightened rather than alleviated as Murray performed a high wire act. Eventually, he fell off and the Swiss was able to take the set 7-5. It felt like a hammer blow but seemed to rally support in Murray’s favour.</p> \n<p>The Scot, who had started so so positively, began to waiver. But as he did so, the volume of the support he received from the crowd grew. Yet he was still on that high wire, occasionally wobbling. And as the match drew to its inevitable conclusion, admiration for Federer trumped disappointment with Murray.</p> \n<p>Much had been made, before the match, of the fact that Federer would be fresher, having spent significantly less time on the court than his younger opponent. And so it proved.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/10/andy-murray-beaten-roger-federer-wimbledon-semi-finals\">Andy Murray beaten by Roger Federer in straight sets in Wimbledon semi-final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Murray was determined to be bold against an opponent who has never lost a Wimbledon semi-final and was looking to reach an incredible 26th grand slam final. Yet the 33-year-old Federer, now the oldest player to reach a final since 1974, looked lean, mean and effortless.</p> \n<p>It seems like a long time ago now that the first of those “end of an era” articles starting predicting his demise. Instead his quest to become the first man to win Wimbledon eight times remains firmly on track.</p> \n<p>At match point the crowd tried to rally Murray one last time to no avail.

The Chinese whispers told me it was Roger Federer at practice.</p> \n<p>Being tall can and cannot work in my favour and this time I praised the divine powers for giving me every final inch of my elongated lanky frame as I peered over to see the King himself. He hit balls with pedestrian brilliance, each the same as the last, yet of course it was pure art and every person who could lay their eyes on the court was transfixed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/10/andy-murray-beaten-roger-federer-wimbledon-semi-finals\">Andy Murray beaten by Roger Federer in straight sets in Wimbledon semi-final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The ability to make the brilliant look so very easy is one of the genuinely amazing features about the man. His coach, Stefan Edberg, looked on – purring in the sunshine. Champagne corks popped in the distance, the VIPs were out in force. All seemed well with the world on semi-finals day.</p> \n<p>So to the main event.</p> \n<p>The best players simply know where the service lines are, and it is impressive how they find the corners of the court at will. They have to, because when balls fall short of lines they are dispatched quickly. If Andy Murray doesn’t find depth on his hitting, Federer capitalises immediately, and will take his chance to attack and move to the net. The consistent accuracy is incredible to watch and that is the one aspect of professional sport we admire as spectators.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the more subtle aspect that we don’t always see is the variation, which becomes more evident live as opposed to coming from television. Watching the play on Friday afternoon it struck me immediately that the players at the top of the tree have so much variation in their game, finding and using different angles of shot.</p> \n<p>For the very best, awareness of the geometry of the game is heightened, and this ability singles them out. In tennis there are so many ways to hit the ball and the players don’t seem to play two shots the same, on the same line or with the same pace. This variation is key because it disturbs rhythms – and most players like rhythm in some form.</p> \n<p>Rallies would follow unique patterns, if there is such a thing. Fast-paced baseline hitting would unfold, but then the opening for a player would surface from a subtle changing of angle, a slightly nuanced racket impression on the ball. The players hit, hit, hit, and then the variation happens.</p> \n<p>Federer bides his time for as long as he needs to (his mind only can tell him how long that is), before deciding to throw in a shot with a completely different emphasis, which takes his opponent off balance and has him changing direction. The rhythm of the opponent is then broken, sometimes the rally is won. If not won then this type of play can at least bring the opening from which he can step up his attack.</p> \n<p>Novak Djokovic is also so adept at finding and playing trajectories of shot which get the opponent reaching away, stretching further on the shot, thus working harder and feeling more pressure. Again the rallies aren’t always won instantly, but the buildup of pressure begins to tell.</p> \n<p>The changing of angles and lines are hugely important, but so is the change of pace. In the arena you can sometimes hear the different sound of the ball coming off the strings on serve. They hardly hit the same serve twice. The angles will be different, the spin different, the pace different, and it all helps to keep the opponent guessing.</p> \n<p>Sameness in anything is not particularly desirable if you think about it. Apologies for the funny comparisons but when we eat food, we tend to find different textures please our palate more than the same type of food. When we listen to music we like a verse, bridge then chorus. When we watch a film we need lighter scenes to follow darker ones. It’s <em>chiaroscuro</em>. The same could be said for most sports I would think. A 1500m runner doesn’t just go and blast off. Instead he or she injects pace at certain points, slows down at certain points, and runs tactically.</p> \n<p>In sport rhythm is helpful to an opponent. Any opponent likes to know exactly where he or she is going. Federer and Djokovic know all about breaking rhythms and it will be fascinating to see who breaks the other first on Sunday.</p> \n<p>And if you want an example of a change of angle or variation, then watch 0-15 at 4-5 in the third set against Murray on Friday.

It is a rivalry running back to a match in Bangkok, October 2005. That one, like this, was settled in straight sets. But in between there have been many brilliant matches.</p> \n<p>There is an old story about two officers in Napoleon’s Army, Dupont and Fournier, who fought a duel when one was made to deliver a disagreeable message to the other. There was no winner and so, each being equally stubborn, they fought again the very next time they met. This time they were interrupted, so again there was no clear conclusion. A third meeting produced a third duel. The feud re-ignited each time they encountered each other ever after.</p> \n<p>This went on – no joke – for three decades. They fought 30 times, on horseback and on foot, with swords and with pistols, on cobbled streets and grassy fields. They came to know each other’s styles so well that they invariably fought to a standstill – until the day Fournier finally missed, twice, and Dupont had him at gunpoint.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/10/andy-murray-beaten-roger-federer-wimbledon-semi-finals\">Andy Murray beaten by Roger Federer in straight sets in Wimbledon semi-final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Andy Murray and Roger Federer are not quite there yet. This was their 24th match. They have played on hard courts and grass courts, in Cincinnati, Dubai and New York, Madrid, Doha and Shanghai, Sydney, Toronto and Indian Wells.</p> \n<p>And of course, at Wimbledon, the scene of their two most famous matches, back in the summer of 2012, when Federer won one, at the Championships, and Murray the other, in the Olympic final.</p> \n<p>It is not the most prolific rivalry in men’s tennis – Novak Djokovic and Rafa Nadal have played each other 44 times. But it is one of the hardest fought. Going into Friday’s match, Federer had won 12 times and Murray 11. There have been long stretches when each man has held the upper hand. Murray won four in a row in 2008 and 2009, as has Federer in 2014 and 2015.</p> \n<p>Just like Dupont and Fournier they now know each other so well that neither has many surprises left to offer the other. Each knew what to expect in this semi-final, as did most people watching. Federer would try to control the game with his serve and his forehand, would be quick and keen to come to the net to try to close points down and would also look to attack Murray’s weak second serve. Murray, on the other hand, would want to draw Federer into long cross-court rallies with his backhand and use the lob which has won him so many points already in this tournament. So Murray knew what was coming. Not, it turned out, that the knowledge made it any easier to face.</p> \n<p>At the age of 33, Federer is playing almost as well as ever. Certainly, Murray said, “that’s definitely the best he served against me”. In the first round at Halle back on 15 June Federer was pushed close by Philipp Kohlschreiber. In the end he won 7-6, 3-6, 7-6, after being 5-3 down in the final set. But late in the match something clicked.</p> \n<p>Ever since then his serve has been in a rare and record-breaking rhythm. After that he played Ernests Gulbis and Florian Mayer, Ivo Karlovic and Andreas Seppi and was not broken once. Then at Wimbledon he played Damir Dzumhur, Sam Querrey, Sam Groth and Roberto Bautista Agut. Again he went unbroken.</p> \n<p>In his quarter-final against Gilles Simon Federer broke Wayne Arthur’s 16-year-old record for holding serve in the most consecutive games. Arthur had done it 111 times. Federer’s streak got to 116. And then, finally, he was broken.</p> \n<p>Just the once, and, Simon said afterwards, it took “the perfect game” to do it. And of course, Federer immediately broke back. The point is: right now Federer’s serve is almost unassailable. The problem Murray faced, the problem Djokovic will face, is, how, exactly, does one go about beating a man who is unbreakable?</p> \n<p>As Murray said afterwards, he played OK, better even than that makes him sound. “I didn’t actually play a bad match,” Murray said. “I played pretty well.” But he never came close to finding an answer to that one crucial question. In the first set 85% of Federer’s first serves were in, in the third 81%. Federer has now played 10 matches against 10 men, two of them, Simon and Murray, among the very best returners in tennis, and he has been broken only once.</p> \n<p>Murray had an opening early on, in the very first game, a break point earned with an exquisite lob and a fine forehand down the line. But the next return went into the net, followed by an error and a service winner. The chance was gone and he did not get another. Federer’s grip on the match got tighter. Murray, on the other hand, seemed always to be scrambling to find a footing. Federer made it all look so easy.</p> \n<p>The difference was never better illustrated than late in the second set. In the 10th game Federer had five set points. Murray scrambled furiously, saved each and every one, then finally won the game with an ace. In the next game Federer won to love. One game took a little under 10 minutes, the other a little more than 60 seconds.</p> \n<p>Then the pressure was all back on Murray again. This was the day that Murray, just like Fournier, ended up looking down the barrel of his opponent’s loaded gun and knew that, this time, there was nothing he could do. The other man had won.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436556225860/Roger-Federer--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Roger Federer continued his remarkable run on his own serve to give Andy Murray no chance of progressing to another Wimbledon final.

Towards the end of a preposterously up-and-down week for his Etixx-Quick-Step team, the 30-year-old sprinter latched on to the wheel of one rider and riskily barged another out of his way en route to victory by half a bike length on the Boulevard des D&eacute;port&eacute;s in Foug&egrave;res. What could have been another boulevard of broken dreams for the Manxman will live in the memory as the scene of a much-needed triumph.</p> \n<p>“I’m very happy,” he said. “The guys could have given up on me after messing up the last two sprints. I’ve been too anxious and I’ve gone too early. If anything I went too late here but Greipel got the jump and I was perfect on him. He could have closed the door on me but he didn’t. He sprinted straight because he’s a gentleman.” Holding his young daughter Delilah in his arms, Cavendish could not help but laugh. “She understands what’s going on now,” he said. “She was angry I didn’t get the bunch of flowers the other day, so she’s happier now.”</p> \n<p>Stage seven was on the flat from Normandy to Brittany through the Mayenne <em>d&eacute;partement</em>, in sweltering heat with hardly a breeze. With limited opportunities remaining and his team-mate Tony Martin forced to withdraw from the race with a broken collarbone, the absence of such a vital cog in the Etixx-Quick-Step lead-out wheel might have scuppered any hopes Cavendish had of winning a stage. Happy to improvise in the closing stages, he played a waiting game, tucking on to Greipel’s wheel before muscling his way through a gap left by John Degenkolb and Peter Sagan to cross the line punching the air in triumph.</p> \n<p>Even though Martin finished Thursday’s stage with a compound fracture, it actually seemed something of a surprise when he failed to sign on in Le Havre. Despite being <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/09/tour-de-france-2015-tony-martin-race-in-doubt-stage-six-crash-zdenek-stybar-cycling\" title=\"\">nursed over the line in the French port</a>, the German they call “Panzerwagen” found time to chat cordially with team-mates and look after his media responsibilities before attending to the more gruesome and, one would think, more pressing concern that was the shattered collarbone poking through the skin of his shoulder. Were it not for strict doctor’s orders, one suspects he would almost certainly have begun this stage.</p> \n<p>“I will follow the race on TV today from the hospital,” he said from Hamburg, after undergoing surgery. “It will be strange but that’s life and cycling. I have to try to see the glass half full and keep the good memories. I had a great first part of the Tour with a great team around me. I won a stage and wore the yellow jersey for the first time in my career.”</p> \n<p>In Martin’s absence Chris Froome took over as race leader but did not don the yellow jersey until after the stage, as dictated by historical precedent and the president of the commissaires’ panel. Indeed, even if Froome had been given the option of wearing the <em>maillot jaune</em>, the Sky rider said it is not a garment in which he would have felt comfortable under the circumstances. “Out of respect for Tony I would never have worn it in any case,” he said. “That’s not the way to get the yellow jersey due to someone else’s misfortunes. I was second on the GC so there was no way to wear it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4cbdfc65d07623ce35d3f164876143b095e86b4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436554043922/c143a0c6-6212-4b6f-9529-b7f1ed1765eb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Cavendish\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Cavendish celebrates his stage win.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim de Waele/Tim de Waele/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the red and white polka dot corner, the Eritrean rider <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/10/tour-de-france-daniel-teklehaimanot-africa-eritrea-cycling\" title=\"\">Daniel Teklehaimanot</a> was the proudest man in France as he made history by becoming the first black African to reign as king of the mountains.

In search of the sole king of the mountains point on offer, Teklehaimanot was to the fore and got his dues. The Lampre-Merida rider Kristijan Durasek, the obligatory Cofidis contribution of Luis &Aacute;ngel Mat&eacute; and homeward bound Bretagne-S&eacute;ch&eacute; Environnement duo Anthony Delaplace and Brice Feillu kept him company and the last remnants of the quintet were swept up with 10 kilometres to go as the sprinters boarded their respective trains.</p> \n<p>On Saturday the peloton will spend the second of three days in the cycling hotbed of Brittany, travelling from the region’s capital Rennes to a hill-top finish at M&ucirc;r-de-Bretagne. Froome, happy to be back in yellow, which he described as “a great privilege”, will begin with an 11-second lead. “To be honest, I don’t really know the M&ucirc;r-de-Bretagne,” he said. “I’m going to have to go and do a bit of studying myself tonight.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/10/tour-de-france-2015-stage-seven-live\">Tour de France 2015: stage seven – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f5a5c5431fc0af7cd58bc724707e4b88d74dcf04/0_34_3309_1985/3309.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1985,"width":3309,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Great Britain's Mark Cavendish celebrates as he crosses the finish line at the end of the 190.5 km seventh stage of the 102nd edition of the Tour de France cycling race on July 10, 2015, between Livarot and Fougeres, northwestern France.

It was not clever. A score of 207 for four at one time in their second innings had become 245 for eight, a considerable lead of 367, but with more than two days to play, not out of sight.</p> \n<p>Instead, as the Swalec lights glared out, the pair added 43 for the ninth wicket, Wood’s unbeaten 32 belying his No10 status. Mitchell Johnson was dispatched to the square-leg boundary in a manner off one leg that was reminiscent of Gordon Greenidge, while Nathan Lyon was deposited straight out of the ground and almost into the river.</p> \n<p>England were all out right on the whistle for 289, which means that the fourth day will resume with Australia requiring a daunting 412 to win and six full sessions in which to get the runs. The pitch is by no means unplayable (more than 1,000 runs have been scored in three innings so far), and the imperative for Australia to get their skates on is not there. But having done much of the hard work, England will kick themselves if they do not win from here.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/10/ian-bells-show-of-bravura-lights-the-way-for-new-englands-great-entertainers\">Ian Bell lights way | Vic Marks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Once more, that part of a session aside, England were outstanding, the confidence running through the side palpable. In the first 75 minutes of play the three seamers, using first the old ball and then the new, disposed of the last five Australian wickets for 44 runs to establish an important first innings lead of 122.</p> \n<p>That they then lost the wickets of Alastair Cook and Gary Ballance to the new ball, as they set about the task of establishing what they hoped would prove an unassailable lead on a pitch that is starting to play a few more tricks, proved of little consequence as Ian Bell and Adam Lyth, instead of battening down the hatches as once might have been the reaction, went on the counterattack, pasting 50 runs in the next seven overs, in a manner that was once the domain of their opponent.</p> \n<p>Then, when Lyth edged an off-spinner to be brilliantly caught at slip for 37, Joe Root was able to continue in the same vein, adding 97 with Bell before the latter was bowled by Johnson for a beautiful 60 that contained 11 fours, creamed through extra cover for the most part. Johnson had almost burst himself in the effort of seeking his first wicket of the match and had already conceded 160 runs in the quest. His celebration, puffing his cheeks out, was more one of relief than anything.</p> \n<p>Root was to go on to make 60 as well, and from an identical 89 balls, before he too was bowled, this time by Josh Hazlewood, the ball coming back sharply off the seam in a manner that has unsettled batsmen the whole game, even when apparently well set. But he had played yet another delightful innings, with nine fours, the best of them a classical bent-knee cover drive off Johnson that bisected the cover field precisely before they had a chance to move.</p> \n<p>Even Root was outdone by Bell’s strokeplay, in what must have been a cathartic innings for him. Since he scored a fine 143 in the first innings of the opening Test in Antigua in April, he had fallen on hard times, nine further innings producing 56 runs, and with a first-innings failure in Cardiff, there were already mutterings about his right to a place in the team. Here he simply seized the initiative, and, in so doing, seemed to release the shackles that had been imposed on Lyth.</p> \n<p>If there was one thing that really separated the two teams in the last series it was the capacity of the Australians to blow away the England lower order, with Johnson pre-eminent as the enforcer of this, while England were generally powerless to do the same themselves.</p> \n<p>Certainly when play began, with Australia still 166 adrift but with five wickets in hand, including that of Shane Watson and the bete noire Brad Haddin, they understood that anything near parity would keep them very much in the contest. So the response of Stuart Broad, Wood and, when the new ball became due after 10 overs, Jimmy Anderson was superb.</p> \n<p>Watson, one of the two not-out batsmen overnight, is well known for a tendency to plant his front foot and hit around it, making him vulnerable to lbw, and the scenario duly played out. Broad’s fourth ball of the day was full and thudded into Watson’s front pad – and, after a Bucknorish deliberation, Marais Erasmus raised his finger. Of course Watson reviewed – he almost always does as if unable to grasp that he might be out in this fashion – and the decision was upheld by a slender margin. Immediately afterwards, Wood produced a full delivery that caught Lyon bang in front and two wickets had gone for the addition of one run.</p> \n<p>For a brief while, as Cook replaced Broad with Ben Stokes to give him a breather for the new ball and Wood gave way to Moeen for a single over, there was a hint of deja vu as Haddin took three successive boundaries from Stokes and Johnson clobbered Moeen over the top. Use of the new ball is a vital element in this match, however, and Anderson and Broad both used it immaculately.</p> \n<p>The wicket of Haddin was a key one, edging a perfect away-swinger to Jos Buttler, and then Johnson, thinking he had clipped Broad nicely away through square leg, realised he had merely hit gently to Ballance. Anderson, round the wicket to the left-handed Hazlewood, took the final wicket, an excellent catch by Root. The standard of the England catching has risen along with the whole demeanour.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Cricket/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436551899123/England-batsman-Ian-Bell--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England batsman Ian Bell is bowled by Mitchell Johnson but only after his innings of 60 helped England to what should be a winning lead.

Whether they are winners remains to be seen. Their response to being 22 for two prompted the rubbing of eyes. Suddenly there was the danger of frittering away their hard-won advantage. What happened next?</p> \n<p>Well, Australia bowled a few half-volleys but even so it was remarkable that Ian Bell and Adam Lyth should crack 49 runs in five overs. This has not always been the traditional response of English batsmen to a bit of a crisis.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/10/england-australia-ashes-first-test-day-three-report\">England play a risky game but victory target still looks beyond Australia</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Historically they have been more inclined to batten down all available hatches. They used to say of Trevor Bailey, who in the 1950s played in one of the most successful England sides, that he always batted not necessarily as if there was a crisis but as if there was certainly one around the corner.</p> \n<p>In a curious way the situation might have helped Bell. This was his 10th innings since his 143 in Antigua and in that time he had not reached 30; he had rarely found double figures. So there was a personal crisis on the horizon, yet somehow England’s plight in what is fast becoming a riveting Test superseded that. The match had taken over and “cricket is a situation game” as Bailey always used to say. There was no time for Bell to fret about his own plight. This contest was hotting up.</p> \n<p>So the cover drives flowed from Bell’s bat. He plays that shot exquisitely – except when it lands up at second slip – and Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood kept feeding it. Bell purred and briefly Lyth joined in. The crisis passed rather quickly.</p> \n<p>Bell reached 30 at a run a ball with those cover drives and two aerial leg-side strokes against Nathan Lyon – a slog/sweep seems too coarse a description for any shot played by Bell.</p> \n<p>Having asserted himself and restored the situation he then reined himself in a little but there were still breathtaking shots. A little push of a cover drive against Hazlewood startled everyone at Cardiff including Lyon diving forlornly at cover point. One aerial drive against Mitchell Johnson even hinted at violence. England – or should we say “New England” (even though Trevor Bayliss does not appear to have many points of comparison with Tony Blair) – were back on course. So, too, was the Test match career of Bell.</p> \n<p>Actually in their 85 overs in the field when Australia were batting in their first innings Alastair Cook’s bowlers were very reminiscent of old England, in particular the teams of 2009 and 2010-11. The seamers bowled with fine discipline, in patches tying down batsmen who subsequently surrendered their wickets. They bided their time if necessary, nibbling away before Jimmy Anderson polished off the tail with his own special touch of artistry.</p> \n<p>Anderson and Stuart Broad have done this before. Mark Wood, with unquenchable enthusiasm and considerable skill, looks a more than willing pupil. Even Ben Stokes was economical, apart from an over against Brad Haddin when the old Australian keeper struck three consecutive fours. Moeen Ali had been more expensive yet had managed to remove Australia’s two most vaunted batsmen. England seized their chances expertly.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Australia have been duped. They were cunningly dispatched to Canterbury and Chelmsford before the series to play against second division sides, who were resting their senior bowlers, on pitches designed to ensure that the contest lasted four days and that the coffers were filled. The Australians piled up 507 for eight against Kent and 562 against Essex, up against the respective talents of Matt Hunn, 21, and Jamie Porter, 22.</p> \n<p>At Cardiff there has been a reminder of the gulf between what happens at county level compared with the Test arena. Here the bowling was in a different league from anything previously encountered by the Australians on this tour. Anderson, in particular, offered nothing to hit when bowling with an old ball and as a consequence the batsmen did not look so battle-hardened. After a few maidens, an experience not encountered at Canterbury or Chelmsford, they grew fidgety and made mistakes.</p> \n<p>The English bowlers were performing at a level seldom seen in county cricket. In part this is because the pitches in domestic cricket this season often do not require great bowling skills. As Sam Northeast, who has been captaining Kent, correctly pointed out after his side’s recent victory over Leicestershire at Grace Road, there are too many “result” pitches around at the moment.</p> \n<p>This pitch in Cardiff has not pleased Australia’s coach, Darren Lehmann, greatly. Before the start of play he shared his thoughts. “Obviously they’ve tried to negate the pace with the way the wicket has been prepared. That’s the way it was in 2013. The only disappointing thing is that I think fast bowlers running in being able to bowl a bouncer is one of the parts of the game that is exciting.”</p> \n<p>An Olympian purist with the broadest of perspectives might agree with Lehmann. The ideal cricket pitch should have more pace than this. But this is a typical Cardiff surface.</p> \n<p>Conspiracy theories are in abeyance until Lord’s. If the pitch is sluggish there, they can be aired with greater justification. There is nothing wrong with this Test track. It offers more to the seamers than anticipated; there has been some turn for the spinners. Wickets have fallen. It has negated the bouncer. And it suits England more than Australia.</p> \n<p>But shots can be played on this pitch and the runs can flow, as demonstrated by that dependable, old cavalier, Joe Root, and the resurgent Bell.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436550810549/Ian-Bell-005.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England’s Ian Bell acknowledges the crowd after reaching his 50 against Australia in Cardiff.

And now, after just 15 days in the job, it would appear the standards expected by England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, have permeated through to his new team.</p> \n<p>During Australia’s first innings here in Cardiff, one which saw them fold in the face of relentless discipline – only one side seems to be grumbling about the surface so far – every catch went to hand and two can be filed in the top drawer. For many, this will of course be the expected benchmark for any international side; to praise fielders for taking chances is to applaud the pilot who lands the plane safely.</p> \n<p>Their adhesive paws in Cardiff thus far must been viewed in light of their early summer, however, one where 11 catches were grassed in the drawn Test series against New Zealand, costing an aggregate of 250 runs. Some 182 of these came in the series-levelling defeat at Headingley, only 17 fewer than the tourists’ ultimate margin of victory.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/10/ashes-2015-england-v-australia-first-test-day-three-live\">Ashes 2015: England v Australia –&nbsp;first Test, day three –&nbsp;live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Not all of those chances were regulation, but then neither were they here. Alastair Cook’s removal of David Warner at first slip that got the ball rolling on Thursday afternoon required a flying leap high to his right to hold on two-handed after Jimmy Anderson got one to nudge the edge of the left-hander’s meaty blade.</p> \n<p>Joe Root’s effort to wrap up the Australian innings on Friday morning was a frictionless dive low to his left at third slip after the Australian No10 Mitchell Starc took the ill-advised decision to attempt an expansive drive to a full and late outswinger from Anderson. It also provided the Yorkshireman a chance to remind his former county team-mate that a finger-to-the-lips send-off ain’t that funny when one is on the receiving end.</p> \n<p>In between we saw Cook snaffle a simple take off Steve Smith at short mid-on, Moeen Ali hold a smart return catch off Michael Clarke and Anderson make light work of Adam Voges’ mistimed drive at short extra-cover. Jos Buttler behind the stumps, who had predecessor Matt Prior join him and coach Bruce French for a pre-series session, held the two nicks that came his way.</p> \n<p>So what has occurred between Headingley and now? Well, Bayliss and a four-day training camp in Spain. With their hands slightly tied by facilities – and perhaps the excess baggage charges associated with a glut of kitbags – England opted to leave the batting equipment at home and keep the physical stuff to fitness and fielding.</p> \n<p>Perhaps a by-product of this focus, whether intended or not, was that batsmen in particular were unable to go into themselves and demand throwdown after throwdown. Instead, the only way to impress their new boss, and apologise to the fielding coach, Chris Taylor, for their early summer sloppiness, was to ace the drills in Almer&iacute;a, which took place every day of the trip.</p> \n<p>Bayliss also resisted the calls to sub Ian Bell out of second slip in favour of the Yorkshire regular Adam Lyth, despite three drops at Lord’s against New Zealand. This particular decision had the confidence of the individual factored in, as well as the technical side of things. And while nothing came his way during Australia’s first-innings demise, Bayliss may see Bell’s second-innings 60 – one which broke a binary run of form – as an indirect repayment of sorts.</p> \n<p>A head coach taking a keen interest in fielding is nothing new. But if Peter Moores was an energetic presence during the pre-play warm-ups, Bayliss is a looming one. Decked out in a floppy sunhat and with an air of Duncan Fetcher about him from a distance, the Australian spent Friday morning prowling on the touchline during the football warm-up, bat in hand, a pile of balls at feet ready for the proper preparation to begin; the homework that follows fun time. The players now know what he expects and so far, so very good.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436548072100/Joe-Root--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Joe Root takes a sharp chance to dismiss Australia's Mitchell Starc on day three of the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.

It is a big difference from the Dutch league, always pressure on the ball, physical resistance high, so it is not so easy.

Depay is confident he can be as prolific in the Premier League as he was in his native Netherlands. “I think so,” he said. “I believe I will work on it and I am excited to do my job for Manchester United and to score goals. I am a striker so I want to score goals and get assists.”</p> \n<p>As Radamel Falcao has left for Chelsea and Robin van Persie may do so, Van Gaal could require a new striker. He suggested Depay may be tried in the striking role, a position he has played for Holland. “I have to see how we solve this problem and it is also one of the reasons that we have bought Memphis because maybe you remember that he has played in the striker’s position also in the Dutch team.</p> \n<p>“That was also new for him.

It is improbable any of her contemporaries will seriously challenge her reign.</p> \n<p>If Williams can destroy Sharapova – perhaps the toughest competitor in the game, men’s or women’s – she may not waste a lot of the fans’ time dismissing a player ranked 20th in the world who, before this tournament, had a single win at Wimbledon in three visits, over Anne Keothavong in 2013. If Muguruza is to become the first Spanish champion here since Conchita Mart&iacute;nez in 1994, she will have to play the match of her life against an opponent who has won the title five times.</p> \n<p>Muguruza does have some cause for optimism, having <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/may/28/serena-williams-garbine-muguruza-french-open\" title=\"\">beaten Williams handily in the second round at Roland Garros</a> last year, 6-2, 6-2. And she took a set off her the last time they met, in the fourth round of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jan/26/australian-open-day-eight-women-report\" title=\"\">Australian Open this year</a>. Williams won their only other encounter, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jan/17/serena-williams-australian-open-azarenka\" title=\"\">6-2, 6-0, also in Melbourne, in 2013</a>.</p> \n<p>Muguruza ought not be seduced by Williams’ cautious summary of the match the previous evening. Williams, reaching for her 21st slam title in her 25th final, is a raging favourite, yet talked down suggestions that this would be a formality. She has done this all summer and all tournament, clucking and chuckling to avoid even the mention of a “Serena Slam” here, as concurrent holder of all the majors, or a calendar grand slam by successfully defending her US Open title in September.</p> \n<p>As Williams would like us to see it: “It’s definitely not an easy match-up. She actually has a win against me. We had a tough match the last time we played, and she’s given me problems in the past. So this time I have to just go in, have fun and do the best that I can, just try to stay positive and stay focused. I don’t think she’s intimidated at all. She’s not that kind of person. She’ll be fine.”</p> \n<p>Pressed on why she should ask people to believe such a downbeat assessment, Williams said she wanted to take pressure off herself, repeating: “I want to have fun.”</p> \n<p>She added: “I’ve won so many grand slam titles. I could lose tomorrow. Sure, I won’t be happy but I don’t need another Wimbledon title. I don’t need another US Open. I don’t need any titles to make it. Every time I step out on court, the practice court, the match court, I do look at it as a more fun time because it’s not as stressful as it was. Getting to 18 [majors] was super stressful for me. It was fun, but I was so stressed out. After that, I’ve just been really enjoying myself.”</p> \n<p>Up to a point. Watson gave her fits over three sets, as did <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/serena-williams-victoria-azarenka-wimbledon-2015?CMP=share_btn_tw\" title=\"\">Victoria Azarenka</a>. It is as if Williams sometimes needs that shock to find her best tennis.</p> \n<p>Muguruza will do her best to provide that intensity. If she does, it could be an entertaining final. If not, it is likely to be as one-sided and predictable as was Williams’ win over Sharapova. That would be a shame.</p> \n<p>Williams is two wins from moving alongside Steffi Graf on 22 majors; after that – and we are allowed to say it, even if she does not want us to – there is the grand slam for 2015. As ever, there is only one player who can stop her – and her name is not Muguruza.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/10/1436540530199/Serena-Williams-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Serena Williams reached the Wimbledon final with a straight sets victory over Maria Sharapova.

That was the turning point, for me. I’m just glad to be in another final. There will be a lot at stake but I’m going to be ready.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/wimbledon-2015-richard-gasquet-stan-wawrinka\" title=\"\">Having beaten Wawrinka in the previous round</a>, Gasquet had been trying to reach his first final here, revelling in the role of the underdog and hoping to catch the world No1 napping. Once he had lost the first-set tie-break 7-2, however, he never looked likely to turn it around against a man who is among the best frontrunners in the business. Early breaks in each of the three sets left him always playing catchup, and any time Gasquet had a glimmer of hope, Djokovic sent down a big serve, ripped a forehand winner or slipped a pass beyond the Frenchman’s reach.</p> \n<p>Gasquet said afterwards that he had felt under pressure throughout because of the quality of the Djokovic return. “He never misses,” he said. “All the time, you serve, you serve. The ball is always on your side again. It’s very difficult. You never make so many aces. He doesn’t make unforced errors. Even from the baseline he’s playing fast with a lot of aggression and takes the ball early. That’s why he’s the world No1.”</p> \n<p>The sickening thing for Gasquet, who will nevertheless move up seven places to No13 in the rankings, is that he was the better player in the opening set. Having dropped his opening service game, he broke back for 2-1 and at 4-4 missed a simple smash that would have put him 0-30 up. In the tie-break, two loose forehands gave Djokovic a 5-2 lead and he closed it out 7-2. The match was easy on the eye but there is a reason why Djokovic has lost to Gasquet only once, way back in 2007. With the exception of net play, the world No1 is slightly better in almost every element of the game, holding his own against the venomous Gasquet one-handed backhand, which drew gasps from the crowd on several occasions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14bae73ffff97e43eaf89cf76c4c4cbc9b9f6683\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436540117089/344d28db-0221-4862-ab72-cdd795e1c3e7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Novak Djokovic celebrates after securing his place in the 2015 Wimbledon final.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Novak Djokovic celebrates after securing his place in the 2015 Wimbledon final.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At this level, one shot is rarely enough and there was a sense of inevitability about the outcome. The 11-1 head-to-head record in Djokovic’s favour did not help but early breaks in each set meant the Frenchman was playing catchup, never able to relax as the Serb pinned him behind the baseline with the power of his serve and depth of his groundstrokes.</p> \n<p>An exquisite backhand pass gave Djokovic the break for 2-0 in the second set and he saved two break points in the fourth game, holding the advantage throughout to double his lead, serving out the set from 15-30 with the help of two aces. In the third set, Gasquet slashed a backhand wide to give Djokovic another early break for 2-1 and, although the Frenchman saved two match points as he held for 4-5, Djokovic finished off with a ruthless love game.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/10/novak-djokovic-richard-gasquet-wimbledon-2015-semi-final-live\">Novak Djokovic beats Richard Gasquet to reach Wimbledon final –&nbsp;as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Djokovic consulted the trainer twice over what he later said was a “stiff shoulder” but said it would not affect the outcome. What might help him, though, is the presence of Becker in his camp. The German, who was courtside for Federer-Murray, has proved a lot of doubters wrong, showing he has plenty to offer as a top-level coach.</p> \n<p>“It’s about the mental approach, especially when you’re in the big tournaments and facing different adversities,” Djokovic said. “Especially in the later stages of grand slams, where things are getting tougher, that’s where I think his contribution is biggest for me and the team. It’s been an honour for me to have him in my team.”</p> \n<p>When <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/06/novak-djokovic-wins-wimbledon-title-roger-federer\" title=\"\">Djokovic beat Federer to win his second title here 12 months ago</a>, he was the villain of the crowd and he is ready for the same treatment again. “It’s the finals of Wimbledon and the most important match any tennis player can have,” he said. “I am going to get prepared for whatever is [awaiting] me on the court. It’s not the first time I’ll have had this feeling and I’ll try to use this experience in the past to help me this time.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436538944483/Novak-Djokovic-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Novak Djokovic stretches for the ball during his victory over Richard Gasquet at Wimbledon.

Rose seems perfectly placed to alter that next week, a second successive round of 66 at Gullane keeping alive his hopes of successfully defending the Scottish Open.</p> \n<p>Rose did not qualify for the St Andrews Open of 2000. Five years later, he was the first reserve but did not receive a call. In 2010, Rose found himself on the wrong side of a hugely important draw and missed the cut. This run is even stranger given Rose’s success as an amateur in the 1997 St Andrews Links Trophy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/10/the-open-at-st-andrews-joy-of-six\">The Joy of Six: The Open at St Andrews</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Winning the Open in general would mean the world to me,” Rose said. “It’s the one championship that I’ve dreamed about winning more than any other, because you know it’s the pinnacle of golf for a British player and I think to do it at St Andrews? It doesn’t get any better than that.</p> \n<p>“St Andrews is one of those places where you can be the only person around but you feel like people are watching you. It’s just got that aura about it, it’s got atmosphere, it’s got history. It’s one of those rare places in the world which is something special. The hairs on the back of your neck stand up, it’s just got that magic appeal.”</p> \n<p>Rose’s general Open record is curious. His best finish remains the tie for fourth he secured as an amateur, at Birkdale in 1998. And yet, in his home country there is a legitimate argument for Rose not being afforded the credit he deserves for a run that has seen him <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/26/justin-rose-zurich-classic-win\">win at least once on the PGA Tour</a> in each of the past six years.</p> \n<p>“When I come back here, I’ve always had really good support,” he said. “I’ve always had support since that Open at Birkdale. The crowd have always been good to me. I’ve always felt that goodwill to play well.</p> \n<p>“The rest, the under-the-radar stuff, I don’t worry about that. I’m not trying to promote myself. I’m just happy to go about my business. I would love if the extra attention came as a result of what I’m trying to achieve. I definitely feel like in America over the last few years my – maybe notoriety is the right word – has increased a lot.”</p> \n<p>Rose’s preparation for his latest tilt at the Claret Jug included the hosting of the Costa Smeralda Invitational in Sardinia, immediately after the US Open. Stars of football, athletics and cricket were also spotted there. The light-hearted nature of events in the company of his family was clearly useful for Rose, who has described his 2015 as “feast or famine.”</p> \n<p>Not so Jordan Spieth, who will head to Scotlandon Sunday night as the winner of both of this year’s majors. “Golf goes through those cycles,” Rose said. “Last summer Rory McIlroy was the one to beat and now Jordan is the one to beat and in years past Tiger was the one to beat. You know players always go through that hot period. I know how difficult the game is, I think we all know how difficult the game is and so yes, Jordan’s going to be a force to be reckoned with at the Open Championship but just because he’s won the first two majors doesn’t put him way ahead of us all going into the third.</p> \n<p>“Everything is very closely fought and contested. There’s no doubt he has a plan for sure to go on and win three in a row, but we all also have our plan to stop him.”</p> \n<p>On Friday at Gullane, Rose was upset having clattered a 67-year-old spectator on the head with an errant tee shot on the 16th hole. He took note of the man’s details, with some form of complimentary gift inevitably set for the post.</p> \n<p>“It was a pretty bad feeling as soon as I realised someone had gone down,” Rose said. “He took it like a trooper, he was talking to me and I was just trying to reassure him.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436539581074/Justin-Rose-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Justin Rose misses a birdie putt at the third hole during day two of the Scottish Open at Gullane.
