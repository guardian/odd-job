I’d won pretty much every race building up to the Tour and I did feel as if, once I got past the halfway mark in the 2013 Tour, I was just hanging on to the finish.</p> \n<p>“This year I feel as if I’ve come in much fresher, a lot more mentally prepared, and I feel as if I’m getting stronger in this year’s race. Now it’s up to other teams to put the pressure on us. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/chris-froome-2015-tour-de-france-cycling-vincenzo-nibali-nairo-quintana-alberto-contador\" title=\"\">This is the heart of the race now.</a> This is where all the action’s going to be happening. We’re going to see who has done their homework, who has got what in the mountains.</p> \n<p>“It’s for the other guys to try to get the jersey from me now. This next phase of the race the pressure’s certainly not on my shoulders to be making the race and to be having to try to take time back from anyone.”</p> \n<p>In both Sky’s successful Tours, 2012 and 2013, Bradley Wiggins and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/06/chris-froome-tour-de-france\" title=\"\">Froome took the yellow jersey</a> at the earliest opportunity, enabling the black-clad team to ride in the powerful, dominant style they have made their own. The problem Contador and Quintana, and others, face is this: Sky can set such a fast pace in the mountains with their specialist <em>domestiques</em> – Geraint Thomas and Peter Kennaugh in 2013, this year Wout Poels and Leo K&ouml;nig in addition – that it becomes desperately hard for any rival to make an impression without going into the red.</p> \n<p>That was certainly how Contador found it in 2013, as Cadel Evans did the previous year. If there is a difference this year it is in Quintana’s position. The Colombian is more mature than in 2013 and is clearly in superb form, given that the opening nine days of the Tour suited him – on paper – even less than they did Froome.</p> \n<p>Quintana lost time on the second stage into Zeeland and on the Mur de Huy finish but performed better than expected on the cobbled stage into Cambrai, while his Movistar team came close to beating Sky in Sunday’s team time trial. In contrast, in 2013 he had dropped over five minutes to Froome before the Alps were reached in the final week.</p> \n<p>“It’s one thing not to lose any time to your rivals but to actually gain quite substantial amounts of time on quite a lot of contenders has really put us in a fantastic position,” Froome said, thinking of one man in particular, the defending champion, Vincenzo Nibali, who won the race in the first week last year but has had a nightmare 12 months later and is 2:22 behind.</p> \n<p>Before the Tour all the talk was of a “Fab Four” of contenders: Froome, Nibali, Contador and Quintana, a quartet who had won at least one Grand Tour each and who were clearly going to arrive in Utrecht in more than decent form. The French, optimistically, added a fifth man, Thibaut Pinot, on account of his third place last year, but Pinot has been the big loser of the Tour’s first phase.</p> \n<p>Instead the young American Tejay van Garderen has lifted himself into the ranks of the favourites for a podium slot, riding – after Froome – the best first half and ending it only 12 seconds behind the Briton. But the 26-year-old lacks Quintana’s fleet-footedness in the mountains and he has yet to acquire the pure racing nous of either Nibali or Contador; of all Froome’s potential rivals he is probably the one the race leader is most relieved to have breathing down his neck.</p> \n<p>Two other riders with credentials have made it through to the Pyrenees with their bones and ambitions intact. The newcomer Warren Barguil – a more doughty character than his nickname Wawa might imply – is within three minutes while last year’s fifth-placed finisher, Romain Bardet, is further back, at 4:38. But in the context of a mountain stage this is small beer and both the youngsters can hope to press on up the standings in the Pyrenees.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/13/geraint-thomas-future-leader-team-sky\">Team Sky’s Dave Brailsford earmarks Geraint Thomas as future leader</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So too, perhaps, can Thomas. He began contemplating pushing for a high place in the Tour after supporting Froome in 2013 and he lies eighth overall after a sterling first nine days when he was always precisely where his leader needed him. “Geraint has been one of the best riders in this race,” the Sky head, Sir David Brailsford, said in Pau.</p> \n<p>“He could lead the team but the good thing about Geraint is he will say he is there for Froomey and he means it. The next logical step is for him to lead a team at the Giro or Vuelta. He is a brilliant rider.”</p> \n<p>Thomas, who took Olympic gold medals in the team pursuit in London and Beijing, also talked up his chances. “Since I left the track behind it’s felt like I’ve been improving as a climber all the time and as a rider,” he said. “Hopefully this Tour I can keep doing that. Podium would be out of this world but top 10 or top 20 would be great on a personal level as well.

There were questions about our team and not so much about Australia.</p> \n<p>“But that is credit to how our players have played and it’s nice to get that win when everyone contributes. It was not just two people carrying the team home but everyone can walk away from that game feeling like they have contributed.”</p> \n<p>He added: “Because first Tests of a series – especially an Ashes series – are nervy affairs, so no one wants to walk away with no wickets or no runs, feeling like you are trying to find your feet in the series. It is important that not everyone gets too carried away with one Test match.”</p> \n<p>Broad has warned England that, at 1-0 down in the series, Australia will be doubly motivated to correct their performance in that opener and the best way to damage them further will be to win the early exchanges. Either way, the 29-year-old expects another result “It all starts again on Thursday, so we need to get into the game and start well,” he said. “We know Australia have a lot of experience and will come back strongly. Having been in a team who have lost the first Test and are all up for winning the next one, if a team comes out and just hits you straight away with skill it can be quite deflating. So we need to start well. We are also well aware we had a bit of the rub of the green in the last Test. We won the toss, Joe Root got dropped [second ball before scoring a century]and a few decisions went our way. That happens in cricket and it might not be the same this week, so we’re going to have to work hard to get a win. We won’t change the way we play. We want to play attacking and aggressive.”</p> \n<p>With the turnaround between Test matches extended by a day by virtue of the quick result in Cardiff, Broad is happy that England needed only 70 overs to skittle the tourists for 242 on Saturday and are able to head into Lord’s with energy reserves intact.</p> \n<p>“When you are playing good cricket you want to keep playing,” said Broad, speaking at an event for the sponsors Hardys. “We have had back-to-back Tests in the past where there have been 200 overs in the field and you are knackered. But what did we field on Saturday? 60, 70 overs? It’s not taken too much out of the bodies. We are fresh and ready to go. So back-to-back Tests will suit us I’m sure. It’s a pretty good wicket to bat on but there have been a lot of results here. I expect it to be 1-1 or 2-0 at the end of the week.”</p> \n<p>While the two sides did not share a beer after the Cardiff Test, the England team did find a friend to celebrate with in Sir Ian Botham. The former all-rounder spent the Sunday before the series opener speaking to the team as part of a move by the director of England cricket, Andrew Strauss, to tap the knowledge of the greats.</p> \n<p>“We’re trying to get this relationship between ex-players and current players closer because ex-players offer us so much as a team and have so much useful information,” said Broad. “Beefy was a prime example of that, offering us advice and spurring us on each day. So we had a drink with him after the game.</p> \n<p>“When you hear someone like Beefy saying what it meant for him to play in an Ashes series and how proud he was of his playing career, it does spur you on. He gave us a congratulations chat after the Cardiff Test and the whole changing room was in awe of him. Those things are inspiring.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/13/1436814670302/Stuart-Broad-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Stuart Broad said that every member of the England team contributed to the defeat of Australia in the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.

Last summer’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/sep/01/ajax-transfer-daley-blind-manchester-unted\">addition of Daley Blind</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/jun/26/ander-herrera-signs-manchester-united\">Ander Herrera</a> bolstered Louis van Gaal’s options but neither of these players can dominate a contest. This is what the club continue to require and this is what fascinates<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/13/bastian-schweinsteiger-manchester-united-bayern-munich\"> about the acquisition of Schneiderlin</a>. Lynchpin, maestro, gun midfielder: whatever the sobriquet, can the Frenchman really grab a high-end Premier League match or thrive in the crucible of the Champions League? <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/11/manchester-united-bastian-schweinsteiger-morgan-schneiderlin-louis-van-gaal\">Bastian Schweinsteiger’s purchase</a> means the club have a been-there-done-that-won-the-World Cup elite schemer but the German is more in the Michael Carrick mould. Perhaps Schneiderlin has not been bought for this lead role. If not then he may simply be an upgrade on Blind or a younger Carrick. It would follow, then, that Van Gaal continues the quest for a central operator who can be <em>the man</em>. This is now Schneiderlin’s moment to prove he can be. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jul/13/bastian-schweinsteiger-transfer-bayern-munich-manchester-united\">Bastian Schweinsteiger’s exit robs Munich of a Bavarian football god | Raphael Honigstein</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>What can United expect from Schneiderlin?</strong></h2> \n<p>Ronald Koeman was asked exactly that as he conducted his pre-Austria training camp <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/06/southampton-morgan-schneiderlin-27m-manchester-united\">press duties at Staplewood</a>.</p> \n<p>“Everybody knows the qualities of the player and, if they are looking at the position where he plays with us, then that’s the best for him,” Southampton’s manager said. “He is still a young player, an international player already, and he can develop himself even more than he did over the last few years at Southampton.”</p> \n<p>That was a brutally honest response. Schneiderlin developed his game at St Mary’s since his arrival there from Strasbourg as a teenager, progressing with the team from League One, through the Championship and into the upper reaches of the top flight. He is an imposing figure, a player who recorded more tackles last season than Blind, Herrera or the injury-blighted Carrick, and is classy in possession. He sets the rhythm and was the fulcrum of Southampton’s side, the oil in their engine room, and his significance was reflected in Koeman’s desire to retain him last season when players such as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/jun/27/luke-shaw-manchester-united\">Luke Shaw</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/jul/01/adam-lallana-move-southampton-liverpool\">Adam Lallana</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/jul/27/loic-remy-move-liverpool-queens-park-rangers\">Dejan Lovren</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/jun/02/rickie-lambert-joins-liverpool-southampton-adam-lallana\">Rickie Lambert</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/jul/28/arsenal-sign-calum-chambers-southampton\">Calum Chambers</a> left. <strong>Dominic Fifield</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Is he worth the money?</strong></h2> \n<p>He is certainly worth the &pound;24m fee to Southampton, who have grown used to seeing their stellar performers pilfered, albeit generally at a premium. He was deemed central last season to a team that flourished. Koeman effectively built his whole lineup around him, his significance to the collective perhaps best exposed in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/nov/30/southampton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">home defeat by Manchester City</a> in November. The hosts were excellent up to the interval, stretching the then champions, but wilted after the break when Schneiderlin was substituted after suffering a thigh injury.</p> \n<p>Although the France international’s importance to Southampton was clear, it remains to be seen whether he can command such a similarly pivotal role at Old Trafford. Schneiderlin will enter a dressing room crammed with elite performers, and will have to displace Carrick – if the Englishman is fit – from the starting lineup to play regularly in the buildup to Euro 2016. This is a different environment, and one to which he will have to adjust if his game is to continue progressing and United are to feel they have paid an appropriate price. <strong>DF</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>So what does this mean for Michael Carrick?</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>Towards the end of last season Van Gaal hinted that this season could be Carrick’s last, with the player turning 34 on 28 July. When healthy, Carrick should remain first choice yet injuries have plagued him and Schweinsteiger’s arrival could threaten his place. Schneiderlin could, however, prove a boon for Carrick if Van Gaal asks the France international to operate as the dynamic box-to-box player he can be, rather than playing as the holding midfielder he was at Southampton. For all of Carrick’s metronomic play and precision passing, his style can slow United down. So it will be intriguing to see if Schneiderlin allows United to move the ball forward faster. Last year, Van Gaal’s side were continually criticised for their pedestrian pace. <strong>JJ</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d21a16bb2f3e788070cfeab8e406069fe30aeaf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436444299428/b09289a4-5735-4dc3-bae0-fd36195afdbf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Michael Carrick will be 34 by the time the season starts and this is likely to be his final campaign at Old Trafford.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Carrick will be 34 by the time the season starts and this is likely to be his final campaign at Old Trafford.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Could Schneiderlin be key to United winning the Premier League?</strong></h2> \n<p>The reflex answer is no, yet Schneiderlin could be the X-factor in Manchester United’s quest for a 21st title. To put it another way: it is difficult to claim the title without a central midfielder who stars all season. So if Schneiderlin is a first choice but is mediocre, the club faces disappointment. He is unproven at elite level so there would be some surprise if he swept United to championship glory. But Van Gaal is a shrewd judge of ability and the Dutchman will believe that the Frenchman can rise to the challenge. <strong>JJ</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/13/edinson-cavani-manchester-united-angel-di-maria-psg-louis-van-gaal\">Manchester United identify Edinson Cavani as Robin van Persie replacement</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>Where else do United still need to strengthen?</strong></h2> \n<p>The manager will require a goalkeeper should <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/17/louis-van-gaal-david-de-gea-real-madrid-manchester-united\">David de Gea depart for Real Madrid</a>.

The manager may even need two as Wayne Rooney is the only proven goalscorer at the club. If Van Gaal can pull all of this business off he will be confident of making United serious challengers.

Watson may be widely portrayed as a cuddly 65-year-old but he has always been one of his sport’s hardest characters.</p> \n<p>For all this Open <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgJTW1SvW04\">has been billed as Watson’s last hurrah</a> there is an alternative scenario. As a past champion Watson would be eligible for another five Opens should he finish this one in the top 10.</p> \n<p>Improbable, yes, but not impossible.</p> \n<p>“I’m not <em>totally</em> convinced,” admits Watson when asked if this is indeed goodbye. “Never say never as far as a competitor is concerned. Do I have enough of it left to compete and finish in the top 10? Which is my goal this week, to finish in the top 10 and be able to play in the Open Championship for another five years on a special exemption.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/13/the-open-2015-tee-times-st-andrews-golf\">The Open 2015: tee times for first two rounds at St Andrews</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I am sure there will be a few tears shed on the Swilcan Bridge. I hope it is on Sunday, I hope I have that chance to make it into the top 10. Those are my goals. If it doesn’t happen that way, it will be a bittersweet final walk.</p> \n<p>“I still feel somewhat competitive. There are some holes I can play well out here, there are others I have great difficulty with, like the 4th and 2nd. I have a game plan, I have played the course enough times to figure it out but when all is said and done that walk across the [Swilcan] bridge will be a special time in my career. And my life.”</p> \n<p>This is typical Watson. Not that he is lacking in emotion, far from it. He cried more than anybody when his playing partner and long-time rival Jack Nicklaus exited the Open, also at this venue, 10 years ago. In 2010 Watson reckoned his time was also up.</p> \n<p>“I really haven’t pictured it too much,” he admits of this year’s scene. “I have been there, been on the bridge <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/19/tom-watson-open-championship-2014\">saying final goodbyes that weren’t final goodbyes</a>.</p> \n<p>“The bottom line is I am grateful to have been able to play for all these years. The time has come for a final farewell. It is a little bit like death, there is a finality like death. But the memories fill this up, wonderful memories, including at St Andrews; I never won here but I played well enough to win here.”</p> \n<p>Watson has no interest in continuing his playing career when challenging at the upper echelons of leaderboards is impossible. “I truly don’t.”</p> \n<p>But when will that end point arrive? “It just depends on how I am playing and how well I feel I can compete,” he says. “I have lost some distance in the last couple of years and that’s the problem.</p> \n<p>“I have a desire to go out and hit great shots, to compete, to hit shots under pressure that mean something. That is what I love to do. I still have that gut feeling that I am out here to do that. Hopefully I have that this week, that I’m in a position to hit shots under pressure.”</p> \n<p>Watson’s love for all things links and St Andrews was an unlikely one for so long. Even when he won the first of five Open Championships, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acKS9Lm-fPE\">at Carnoustie in 1975</a>, this element of the game perturbed him.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t like links golf at all,” Watson concedes. “I didn’t like the uncertainty of it. I played the ball through the air, very high. The biggest reason I played well, even though I didn’t like it early on, was my ability to get the ball up and down. I first played St Andrews in 1978 and didn’t like it at all; blind, bumpy, it was not a lot of fun for me because of the uncertain bounces.</p> \n<p>“I fought it all the time. ‘I don’t like this, I don’t like playing like this.’ I didn’t say that. I kept it to myself. You don’t whine. You never whine.”</p> \n<p>A social trip with a close friend in 1981 altered that perspective. Watson played at Ballybunion, Prestwick, Troon and Dornoch. His links outlook suddenly changed.</p> \n<p>Four years earlier he had triumphed over <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCttgsGWp44\">Nicklaus in Turnberry’s epic Duel in the Sun</a>. “That was the time in my career that I finally believed I could beat the best in the game,” Watson recalls. “It started a run.”</p> \n<p>And yet an element of self-doubt remained. “I really didn’t learn to swing the golf club properly until 1994,” Watson says. “All those years, it was searching for something that would work on any given week.”</p> \n<p>Fast forward to 2009 and one of those links nuances which initially frustrated Watson so much <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2009/jul/19/clink-tom-watson-open-golf\">cost him what would have been a quite incredible Open victory</a>, again on the Ayrshire coast. “This ain’t a funeral,” was his opening gambit to the assembled solemn members of the media in the aftermath. Privately Watson was sore.</p> \n<p>“It doesn’t hurt now,” he says. “At the time it was really disheartening. I didn’t get much sleep that Sunday night. I was there, I had the opportunity to do it. I think winning the Open Championship that many times before that year tempered it. If that was my only chance it probably would have stuck with me. But it didn’t stick with me.”</p> \n<p>Watson’s rivalry with Nicklaus was the finest in golfing history. The former is perfectly placed then to discuss whether the rivalry currently hailed between Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth is worthy of the title.</p> \n<p>“Right now Rory is the best player in the game,” Watson says. “Jordan, as he said, ‘I can’t put myself in a rivalry position just now. I haven’t achieved what Rory has.’</p> \n<p>“It is very close to being in that category and people want to see it. It is a rivalry but you have to understand how competitors play. I didn’t go out particularly wanting to beat Jack Nicklaus. But I tell you what, I was always looking at the scoreboard to see if Jack’s name was there. I like Jordan’s adult take on things and his commonsense. He is level-headed. And he is a heck of a player.</p> \n<p><br /></p> \n<p>I like when he doesn’t play well, you can see it. You can see how upset he gets with himself. That’s the way I was, I hated playing badly. That just makes you play better. You go to the practice tee, work on it, and get better. Jordan will have lulls in his career just like everybody else has and what defines you is how you deal with those challenges. Not the victories, the defeats.”</p> \n<p>The eight-times major winner shrugs off the circumstances of McIlroy’s injury in a football match. “I thought it was kind of stupid to do that but I was stupid, too. I was skiing and diving for loose balls on basketball courts when I was his age. You have a life to live, you have things to do in your life. It’s not all golf.”</p> \n<p>Watson’s last competitive appearance in Scotland was a troubled one. The United States lost the Ryder Cup and there was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/sep/28/phil-mickelson-tom-watson-ryder-cup\">post-match rancour between Watson and Phil Mickelson</a>.</p> \n<p>“It is water under the bridge,” Watson insists. “The team was outplayed. I think everybody realises that. You look at the scores, the Europeans were 56 more under par than we were. You don’t win when you are that far behind, you just don’t.”</p> \n<p>That love for the heat of battle has never left Watson. It is the reason a St Andrews goodbye isn’t certain. The man himself wouldn’t have it any other way.</p> \n<p><em>Tom Watson is a MasterCard ambassador.

This is why he handles things so well.</p> \n<p>“It’s amazing, when you’re that young, you’d say one good night’s sleep to get over jet lag and he’ll probably be fine tomorrow morning, and especially coming off a win and shooting scores like that.</p> \n<p>“If he believes that’s the way to do it, then that’s the way to do it. That’s the way Jordan Spieth wants to do it. Guess what, it’s right.”</p> \n<p>Spieth has already won four tournaments this season and, though he has played only one round at St Andrews and was one of the later arrivals on the Fife coast, Faldo reckons that the Texan has a gift for learning new layouts in a short space of time.</p> \n<p>“Jordan has got this great ability – many people play practice rounds with him, one round, and the next day he’ll be talking about the golf course and they’ll have missed everything he’s talking about, all the little subtle slopes. So he’s obviously got a very high golfing IQ and he takes a lot on board.</p> \n<p>“Obviously that’s how he works with his caddie, Mike. They’ve got their own little formula and great belief in what they’re doing. And he’s confident. And he keeps churning out good shots. When you’re doing that, you just jump back on the saddle and ride again. That’s what he’s doing.”</p> \n<p>The only downside for Faldo is that the tournament is missing out on a showdown between Spieth and the injured world No1, Rory McIlroy, though he expects the in-form Rickie Fowler, who won the Scottish Open on Sunday, to contend.</p> \n<p>“Obviously Rory had a serious opportunity,” Faldo said, “so he must be kicking himself – as long as he doesn’t injure it. Hey, boys will be boys. They want to go and play and he had a weird and wonderful accident. I hope he gets himself fully fit and strong. It’s unfortunate with an injury like that, he’s got to get himself 100% fit before he can start the comeback. I feel for Rory.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436812071611/Jordan-Spieth-falls-over--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jordan Spieth of the United States falls over laughing in reaction to a putt during a practice round at St Andrews.

The merits of Bolton Wanderers’ Neil Lennon, Peter Schmeichel and Guus Hiddink, who <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/29/guus-hiddink-holland-quits-coach\">left his job with Holland</a> last month, were also discussed before the club’s Thai owners turned their attentions to the Italian.</p> \n<p>“It is my great pleasure to welcome Claudio Ranieri, a man of remarkable experience and knowledge that will lead us into the next phase of our long-term plan for Leicester City,” said Srivaddhanaprabha. “His achievements in the game, his knowledge of English football and his record of successfully coaching some of the world’s finest players made him the outstanding candidate for the job and his ambitions for the future reflect our own.</p> \n<p>“To have attracted one of the world’s elite managers speaks volumes both for the progress Leicester City has made in recent years and for the potential that remains for the club’s long-term development.”</p> \n<p>The 63-year-old Ranieri will be taking on his 16th position, with spells at Fiorentina, Valencia, Atl&eacute;tico Madrid, Juventus, Roma and Internazionale on his curriculum vitae. His four years at Chelsea coincided with the sale of the club to Roman Abramovich in 2003 and, although he led the team to the Champions League semi-finals, he spent the last few months in the role effectively as a dead man walking with Jos&eacute; Mourinho having been earmarked for the position.</p> \n<p>His nomadic coaching career took him to Monaco, whom he led to promotion from Ligue 2 and to second place in the top flight the following season, after his spell at San Siro, though his most recent employment, with Greece, ended in humiliation. His two-year contract was cancelled after only four games, the third of which was a home defeat by the Faroe Islands.</p> \n<p>“I’m so glad to be here in a club with such a great tradition as Leicester City,” said Ranieri. “I have worked at many great clubs, in many top leagues, but since I left Chelsea I have dreamt of another chance to work in the best league in the world again. I wish to thank the owner, his son and all the executives of the club for the opportunity they are giving me. Now I’ve only one way for returning their trust: squeeze all my energies to getting the best results for the team.”</p> \n<p>The Italian will be initially assisted at the team’s base in Bad Radkersburg by Craig Shakespeare and Steve Walsh, who both remained at the club after Pearson’s dismissal, before the first pre-season friendly at Lincoln City next Tuesday. The manager will be backed further in the transfer market, with players such as Robert Huth, Shinji Okazaki and Christian Fuchs having been recruited.</p> \n<p>Leicester, who spent 140 days at the foot of the Premier League last term, revived to win seven of their last nine games under Pearson to finish an impressive 14th despite the manager appearing to have a magnetic attraction to controversy at times. He had clashed with a City supporter – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/dec/19/nigel-pearson-fine-ban-fa-row-leicester-supporter\">earning a &pound;10,000 fine</a> from the Football Association – journalists and had <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/feb/07/nigel-pearson-james-mcarthur-leicester-palace\">grappled with Crystal Palace’s James McArthur</a> on the touchline in February.</p> \n<p>Pearson had been informed after that bizarre incident that he was out of a job only to be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/feb/08/nigel-pearson-sacked-leicester-james-mcarthur-incident\">told that he was back in work a few hours later</a>. Yet an ill-fated end-of-season “goodwill” tour of Thailand ended with three Leicester players, including the manager’s son James, accused of taking part in a racist sex tape, with the trio subsequently <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/leicester-sack-three-players-racist-thai-orgy\">having their contracts terminated</a> following a club investigation.
