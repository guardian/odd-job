In a club statement that came like a bolt from the blue Leicester’s Thai owners made it clear that the damage was irreparable and that their working relationship with Pearson had totally broken down.</p> \n<p>While the club chose not to go into the deeper reasons behind a decision that had been brewing at various stages last season – Pearson was informed in February that he was out of a job only to be told that he was back in work a few hours later – focus will inevitably fall on that ill-fated end-of-season “goodwill” tour to Thailand, where three Leicester players, including the manager’s son, James, were accused of taking part in a racist sex tape.</p> \n<p>Pearson Jr, Tom Hopper and Adam Smith <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/leicester-sack-three-players-racist-thai-orgy\" title=\"\">all had their contracts terminated after the club</a> investigated the allegations that the players had racially abused and made other offensive comments to women with whom they were engaging in sex acts in a hotel room. The whole episode was a huge embarrassment to Leicester, who are owned by the Thai billionaire Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and Aiyawatt, his son.</p> \n<p>Whether the fall-out from that unsavoury incident contributed significantly to Pearson’s dismissal remains to be seen. It is clear, though, that Vichai and Aiyawatt were no longer willing to tolerate Pearson being in charge of their football club and that there was only one course of action in their eyes.</p> \n<p>A club statement said: “The board of directors recognises the success Nigel has helped to bring to Leicester City during his two spells in charge of the club, particularly during the last three and a half years. However, it has become clear to the club that fundamental differences in perspective exist between us. Regrettably the club believes that the working relationship between Nigel and the board is no longer viable.”</p> \n<p>Although Pearson had finished the season on a spectacular high as he masterminded an improbable escape, with Leicester winning seven of their last nine Premier League games to climb off the bottom of the table and finish 14th, the manager seemed to have a magnetic attraction to controversy throughout that season and the board took a dim view of his behaviour at times.</p> \n<p>In December he was fined &pound;10,000 by the Football Association and given a one-match touchline ban after an angry verbal exchange with a Leicester supporter towards the end of the 3-1 defeat by Liverpool. Pearson told the fan who was abusing him to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/dec/05/nigel-pearson-refuses-apologise-video-row-fan\" title=\"\">“fuck off and die”</a>.</p> \n<p>Two months later Pearson <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/feb/11/nigel-pearson-rang-james-mcarthur-touchline-tangle\" title=\"\">grappled with James McArthur</a> and had his hands around the throat of the Crystal Palace midfielder at one point. The following day reports began to surface that Pearson has been sacked. There was another bizarre incident later in the season when Pearson <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/apr/30/nigel-pearson-rant-full-leicester\" title=\"\">called a journalist an “ostrich”</a> during a post-match press conference. He publicly apologised for those comments the next day.</p> \n<p>Pearson, who was in his second spell as Leicester manager after returning from Hull City in November 2011, was backed in the transfer market this summer. He brought in Christian Fuchs, Robert Huth and Shinji Okazaki and there was no hint among the staff close to him that he might be out of job anytime soon.</p> \n<p>Leicester have placed Steve Walsh and Craig Shakespeare, the joint assistant managers, in temporary charge of first-team duties while they begin the process of recruiting a replacement for Pearson.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435689880805/Nigel-Pearson-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nigel Pearson has been in charge at Leicester since 2011.

He goes through to the second round against Robin Haase on Thursday at least mildly gingered up after struggling midway through his straight sets win over the 59th-ranked Mikhail Kukushkin on Centre Court on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Murray, who has been in splendid form all summer, on clay and grass, spent almost twice as long on court as Roger Federer did in his far easier win over the Bosnian Damir Dzumhur.</p> \n<p>While Murray expressed no interest in the Federer match, the comparison is relevant in terms of where each of them is placed after the first round of a tournament that may bring them together in the semi-final. Federer was pretty much faultless against an opponent he also destroyed at Roland Garros three weeks ago; Murray was less convincing against an opponent with whom he shares the distinction of being coached by a woman and who played with the freedom of an acknowledged outsider.</p> \n<p>Still, beating an out-and-out shot-maker like Kukushkin 6-4, 7-6, 6-4 in two hours and 11 minutes, while lacing his performance with some breathtaking ground strokes and delightful dinks near the net, told Murray he should not be rushing back to his psychiatrist just yet.</p> \n<p>He did come perilously close to blowing a 5-2 lead in the second set as his serve disintegrated for no apparent reason and he acknowledged that it is an area of his game he needs to address before playing Haase.</p> \n<p>Murray did play some terrific tennis against Kukushkin, which was reciprocated in several dazzling exchanges in the first and third sets, but that dip in the second disturbed his equilibrium.</p> \n<p>“I made it hard for myself at the end of the second set,” he said. “Then he started playing some very aggressive tennis, low over the net. Towards the end of it, I missed 10 or 11 first serves in a row. I wasn’t surprised [by Kukushkin’s occasionally high level].</p> \n<p>“I’ve seen some of his results in big matches. He’s a tough opponent when he goes for his shots. Credit to him … but there’s definitely work to be done.”</p> \n<p>From the beginning, Kukushkin was not shy in the shot and hit some of his forehands with rasping power at the lines to stay on level terms in the opening exchanges and for much of the second set.</p> \n<p>The 11th game of that session was an odd one. Murray double-faulted, aced, made a lousy challenge and then watched a Kukushkin return skim the white lines. Kukushkin then lost focus entirely as Murray broke yet again to force the tie-break, and take the set. The third was a more comfortable ride for Murray, who looked relieved at the end.</p> \n<p>Haase, who has lost to Murray in three of their four encounters, took two hours and 22 minutes to beat Alejandro Falla 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 on Court Seven, and admitted he had misgivings beforehand because the Colombian has been dangerous on grass, most memorably when taking the first two sets off Federer in the first round here five years ago, before blowing match point in the fourth set. (Federer, incidentally, has not lost a set in the first round at Wimbledon since).</p> \n<p>Haase, a couple of months younger than Murray (although they never met as juniors) and ranked 78 in the world, took a set off him in each of their matches at the US Open, but might struggle to do so on grass.</p> \n<p>“Last time I played him in New York, I don’t know exactly what happened,” Murray said. “But I had terrible cramps from very early on in the match. It was a very tough match for me to get through. He’s a tough opponent, likes grass, enjoys playing on big courts.”</p> \n<p>Murray said he was glad to be back on a court where he has seen more good days than bad. “It’s a great court. I’ve had some of my best matches on there. It doesn’t happen at all of the events from where the first day it’s a packed crowd from start to finish. It’s always nice to play in front of that sort of crowd.”</p> \n<p>From the reaction to his victory, the feeling would seem to be mutual. It’s a little while now since any comedian has felt the urge to yell, “Come on, Tim!” during one of Murray’s matches (although if they read this, that may change). There is a genuine empathy between him and tennis fans, wherever they come from, and the suggestion in other parts of the media forest recently that his support for Scottish independence was something of a “public relations disaster” would seem to have lost traction.</p> \n<p>At 28, Murray is not only a matured and distinguished athlete, he is operating at the height of his powers. He will not be perfect in every match, nor will he avoid defeat now and again but a feature of his flawed victory was his ability to overcome the frustration of losing his way and powering on to the right result.</p> \n<p>As John McEnroe, the three-time Wimbledon champion, said afterwards: “I don’t think the result was ever in doubt.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435688644147/002b5baf-b262-4da1-ad06-7e1b32c87fa6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom Jenkins for the Guardian","altText":"Andy Murray","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T17:06:34Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T23:01:39Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":83,"contributors":[{"name":"Kevin Mitchell","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741641/KevinMitchell.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/kevinmitchell"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Andy Murray","Wimbledon 2015","Wimbledon","Tennis","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/andymurray","webTitle":"Andy Murray"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Kevin Mitchell","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/kevinmitchell"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/30/andy-murray-wimbledon-mikhail-kukushkin","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9f3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/30/andy-murray-wimbledon-mikhail-kukushkin","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/30/andy-murray-wimbledon-mikhail-kukushkin"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435688644147/002b5baf-b262-4da1-ad06-7e1b32c87fa6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray struggled in the second set before regaining his composure to win in straight sets.

This was an agreeably low key straight-sets first-round defeat of Mikhail Kukushkin by the No3 seed, on an afternoon when there was if anything an absence of other more familiar kinds of heat.</p> \n<p>Murray performed well enough against an opponent who came here to play, offering in glimpses the full range of his deep defence and well-timed attack. Perhaps the most interesting part of a fairly routine 6-4, 7-6, 6-4 victory, however, was the lack of intrusion from the fringes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/30/andy-murray-wimbledon-mikhail-kukushkin\">Andy Murray starts Wimbledon with straight sets Mikhail Kukushkin win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The only union flags in evidence throughout were the odd flutter in the seats behind the umpire’s chair, always the last stronghold of the face-painted hardcore, an armpit of ingrained Timwittery. There were precious few gurgles and shrieks and come on Andys. Instead, this was Centre Court in its grownup guise, the mood serene and quietly appreciative, perhaps even significantly so in the cycle of Wimbledon’s modern history.</p> \n<p>The match also brought with it the 20-year anniversary of a rather overlooked event back at the start of what we might call The Henman Revolution. The summer of 1995 was probably the last of the pre-modern Wimbledons, two years into the tournament’s fevered commercial revolution and 12 months before the first of those flushed and oddly revelatory Tim Henman quarter-finals.</p> \n<p>Twenty years ago a distinctly pre-celebrity Henman had just been ejected from the tournament for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2008/jun/28/wimbledon.tennis1\" title=\"\">whacking a ball into a ballgirl’s head</a> while playing doubles with Jeremy Bates, a bizarre end to an event that had also brought him a first major tournament win.</p> \n<p>It was, in many ways, the last breath of something and a moment from which the ongoing, expertly monetised Henman-Murray two-hander would spring into being. Henman was terribly chastened by the incident.</p> \n<p>A year later, though, he returned and some stirring performances were greeted with a bizarrely overwrought and unbuttoned display of slightly squiffy mid-afternoon hysteria.</p> \n<p>Fast forward 20 years and Wimbledon has ridden that wave with expert commercial opportunism. The Henman Years resulted in a rapacious growth in revenues, driven by capacity expansion and the decision in 1993 to create a separate arm devoted entirely to exploiting the commercial possibilities of the Wimbledon brand. In 1994 Wimbledon’s commercial surplus had leapt from &pound;16m to &pound;27m as the tournament was geared up as a jewel of the new sporting economy.</p> \n<p>Wimbledon was lucky, too. It needed a star. In Henman, and then Murray, it lucked out, gifted a pair of ready-made standard-bearers; muster points for the two-week beano around which British tennis’s considerable wealth is now based.</p> \n<p>The issue of Wimbledon’s initially rather awkward embrace of the best British player since Fred Perry has already been done to death, a slight chilliness that has in reality nothing to do with Scotland per se and much to do with that certain Surrey-inflected Englishness that tends to set the emotional barometer on the show courts of SW19.</p> \n<p>Not that it matters. Murray’s interest is in winning titles. Those who care about the sport see only his supreme intelligence, his angles, his returns, his champion nerve. In his maturity he is simply a thrillingly good tennis player and a brilliant role model for reasons unrelated to anything but sport. There is currently no finer British sports person, a rare combination of hard work and intelligence that has no edge, no sense of anything left behind, no outer fringe of his talent unexplored.</p> \n<p>Here Murray looked utterly relaxed, a British No1 playing without the weight of anything other than a champion’s natural expectations and freed now from the attentions of the hand-stitched tea towel brigade, the Princess Diana memorial porcelain plate collectors, the swivel-eyed fuzzy ball ultras.</p> \n<p>The greatest roar of the opening 45 minutes was for the superb running backhand pass that took Murray to 15-0 on his own serve at one set and two games up. The first set had been sealed with an extended rally that featured five or six different types of forehand alone, from block to chip to whipped, drawing not so much an error from Kukushkin as a tangling of the brain, the sense of man finally giving up and tossing the cryptic crossword into the fire.</p> \n<p>There was a slight wobble in the second set as Kukushkin broke serve. Murray remains, however, the great passive aggressive powerhouse of the men’s game, a player whose defence is a powerful attacking weapon at such moments. He responded with a sustained back-court drive, forcing Kukushkin to hit wildly in search of winners. Before long Murray was two sets up and there was a pleasant sense of sleepiness around Centre Court as the sun dipped and afternoon began to congeal into early evening.</p> \n<p>Murray will need to improve for the later rounds but he will be encouraged by his best moments here. Wimbledon, meanwhile, has the chance simply to enjoy him this time around: not so much a great British champion as just a wonderfully engaging tennis player, and a gift to this venerable old domestic powerhouse of a tournament</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/30/1435694246632/Tim-Henman-kisses-ballgal-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tim Henman kisses ballgall Caroline Hall after he accidentally hit her with a ball during a Wimbledon doubles match and was disqualified in June 1995.

Germany, ranked No1 and the tournament’s strongest attacking unit, looked unprepared for USA’s pressure. </p> \n<p>“We knew we had this in us. This team had a lot of confidence and we’ve done a really good job of blocking out you guys,” USA coach Jill Ellis told reporters after the game. “We had every belief we could win this game and that’s part of the spirit of the American player.”</p> \n<p>This pulsating semi-final was physical from the get-go — Alexandra Popp needed her head bandaged after a gruesome collision — but it would be a pair of penalties that went a long way to deciding the game.</p> \n<p>Annike Krahn desperately hip-checked forward Alex Morgan to the ground in the 68th minute, drawing a yellow card and a penalty. Nadine Angerer guessed the wrong way and Lloyd calmly slotted the ball home, finally breaking the deadlock. </p> \n<p>The Germany coach, Silvia Neid, noted correctly that replays showed the foul occurred outside of the box. </p> \n<p>“Of course, I’m very sad that this penalty decided the match,” she said. “What am I going to do though? A referee’s decision is something we have to live with.”</p> \n<p>Germany had their own chance from the spot 10 minutes earlier, but Sasic, tied for leading scorer of the tournament, bungled her attempt and shot wide of goal. Popp earned the penalty after being pulled down by an uncharacteristically shaky Julie Johnston.</p> \n<p>“That was probably every defender’s worst nightmare. It happened so fast,” Johnston said. “This was a team performance and the team today really stepped up for me. I really can’t thank them enough and I think I’ll thank them all the way to the final.”</p> \n<p>The Germans are deprived of a shot at a third world title while USA can set a record if they win their third in Vancouver on Sunday. USA will face the winner of the England v Japan semi-final on Wednesday night.</p> \n<p>Though Ellis had used a 4-4-2 formation with two strikers up front throughout the tournament, she changed things up for this match in a surprise move, instead switching to a 4-2-3-1 with Morgan as the lone forward.</p> \n<p>Lloyd’s role was an open question going into the match, and Ellis opted to give her what she wanted: a chance to roam in the box for goals, while central midfielders Morgan Brian and Lauren Holiday mopped up German attacks. Lloyd essentially turned into USA’s second striker, focused entirely on offense.</p> \n<p>It was a masterstroke from Ellis. Lloyd ended up the hero again after her stellar performance against China just days ago. She scored the penalty and set up Kelley O’Hara for the second goal by dribbling her way through Germany’s backline in the 86th minute. Her pass met a lunging O’Hara in front of Angerer’s goal. </p> \n<p>O’Hara’s finish was as emphatic as it was ruthless, and it was her first-ever for the US senior national team.</p> \n<p>“It’s euphoric, to be honest. It was something I was not expecting,” O’Hara said. “I’m kind of still processing it. I’m so proud of this team and as a sub you just want to help your team however you can, bring energy to the game.”</p> \n<p>The Americans had the better chances all day, but Angerer single-handedly kept the Germans in the match in the first half with some splendid saves to deny what should have been a couple of USA goals.</p> \n<p>In the seventh minute, center-back Johnston connected well with her head on a set piece to direct the ball toward the far post, but Angerer saved brilliantly with her feet. Shortly afterwards, Angerer denied Morgan on a one-on-one breakaway after a clever ball from Tobin Heath.</p> \n<p>Germany out-shot USA, 15 to 12, but USA had five chances on goal to Germany’s one. Germany held possession for stretches, but their attack was unable to find a way through the Americans. </p> \n<p>“It was an even match, but we did not follow through,” Neid said. “We weren’t dangerous enough in front of goal.” </p> \n<p>Angerer agreed. “I think we didn’t give up, even after we were down 1-0,” she said. “But at the end of the day, I think the US earned the win today.”</p> \n<p>Both teams had been considered favorites going into the tournament and appeared destined to meet in the semi-final. Of the three times these teams have faced one another in a Women’s World Cup, the winner has gone on to lift the trophy.</p> \n<p>Germany had dominated this year’s tournament, recording the most goals and most shots of any team by a significant margin. Though their 10-0 thrashing of Ivory Coast skewed the numbers, they still remained the strongest-looking team in Canada.</p> \n<p>The Americans also progressed relatively smoothly, but looked low on confidence. Since their win against China in the quarter-final, though, the Americans are riding a wave of dominating soccer.</p> \n<p>“This team is getting better, but we have to remember that this isn’t the final,” Abby Wambach said. “We have to win one more game.”</p> \n<p>That game is in Vancouver on Sunday at BC Place. On this form, USA will be tough to beat.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435713929848/07c1a0de-684d-48c1-bae0-0db40762fded-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dennis Grombkowski/Bongarts/Getty Images","altText":"Carli Lloyd","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dennis Grombkowski/Bongarts/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-01T01:26:40Z","lastModified":"2015-07-01T03:25:22Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Caitlin Murray","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/caitlin-murray"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Women's World Cup 2015","USA women's football team","Football","Women's football","Sport","US sports","US news"],"tags":[{"id":"football/women-s-world-cup-2015","webTitle":"Women's World Cup 2015"},{"id":"football/usa-womens-football-team","webTitle":"USA women's football team"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"football/womensfootball","webTitle":"Women's football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Caitlin Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/caitlin-murray"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/30/womens-world-cup-usa-into-final-after-carli-lloyd-tames-germany","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9kt","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/30/womens-world-cup-usa-into-final-after-carli-lloyd-tames-germany","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/30/womens-world-cup-usa-into-final-after-carli-lloyd-tames-germany"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435713929848/07c1a0de-684d-48c1-bae0-0db40762fded-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Carli Lloyd celebrates with her USA team-mates after her penalty.

Farah welcomed investigations by Usada and Ukad into the claims against Salazar but said his accusers should talk to the authorities rather than making allegations in the media.</p> \n<p>“They need to go to the right people. And I encourage anyone, Kara [Goucher], the rest of the guys, to go to the right people and let’s get to the bottom of this,” he told Sky Sports News from his training camp in the Pyrenees, where he is preparing for a return to the track next week in Lausanne. “It’s killing me, it’s killing my family. There are people there who are the painting the picture of me: ‘Oh, Mo Farah he’s on this.’ I am not anything. Trust me.”</p> \n<p>Goucher is one of 19 witnesses who have lined up to testify against Salazar and the Nike Oregon Project since the BBC and the US website ProPublica made the initial allegations.</p> \n<p>“I was shocked. I couldn’t believe what I saw. For me when I saw it afterwards I wanted answers so I spoke to Alberto and he gave me answers. I was the first person to say: ‘What’s going on?’”Farah said.</p> \n<p>The long-distance runner has since said he was satisfied with Salazar’s 11,700-word rebuttal against allegations that included claims he had given the 2012 Olympic silver medallist Galen Rupp testosterone when he was 16 and that he abused the Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) process.</p> \n<p>“I wanted him to come out because these are allegations about him, not me. I wanted him to come out publicly and tell the people,” said Farah.</p> \n<p>“I work so hard to do what I do. It’s taken me half of my life to achieve what I have achieved and for people to think I’m taking a short cut is not right. I’m 100% clean. I love what I do and I want to continue to win medals but I want people to know I’ve never taken any drugs.”</p> \n<p>But he said if it was proven Salazar had “crossed the line” or manipulated the system he would sever ties with the coach. “Boom! I’m out. Trust me. I work every day hard, I put my body through hell. Every year, seven months of the year, I’m away from my family. Year in, year out. I don’t see my family. I miss my kids. I miss my kids’ birthdays, our anniversary,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Those are times I can never go back and share with my kids. And that really kills me. To be labelled something you are not, to have people label me as a cheat, it’s not fair and it’s not right.</p> \n<p>“If I am a cheat, prove that I am cheat. Or just leave me alone. Let me do what I do best. And that’s to run, to represent my country and make my country be proud. Seventy-five-thousand people were there in London, cheering for me, shouting out my name. I will never let them down. If people say I am a cheat, I am crossing the line, then prove I’m crossing the line.”</p> \n<p>UK Athletics has promised to complete its own review into whether it should retain Salazar as a consultant by early August, while the Usada and UKAD investigations are ongoing.</p> \n<p>“These are just allegations. If they are proven and UKAD and Usada find something wrong then I am the first person to run but you have to give people a chance in life,” said Farah. “Someone who has helped so much in your career you have to give them the benefit of the doubt.”</p> \n<p>Farah also attempted to explain in detail why he missed two drug tests before London 2012. If he had missed a third within the same 18 month period, he would have missed the Olympics. “I was in Teddington. I was staying in one of the Kenyan’s houses. I was just racing. I was staying at the top floor. And I didn’t hear the buzzer. I was sleeping in my tent. I didn’t hear it. That was the genuine thing. I am not going to lie about it. I know I shouldn’t have done it,” he said.</p> \n<p>“There are a lot of athletes who have missed tests and they never seem to come out in public. So why me? Let me tell you this: I have taken 148 tests since 2007, I have taken 103 tests since 2012 Olympics. And every single one of them has been negative. So I can’t win.”</p> \n<p>Farah’s agent Ricky Simms subsequently tried to prove that he couldn’t hear UKAD’s doping control officers ringing the bell in a failed attempt to get the missed test struck from the record.</p> \n<p>The runner was backed by other athletes after his missed tests were made public, with Steve Cram suggesting he was the victim of a “witch hunt”.</p> \n<p>Farah also attempted to explain why his performances had improved markedly once he made the decision in 2011 to train with Salazar in Oregon.</p> \n<p>“I have always had the talent. As a youngster I had the talent but I never learned to win big races. It always came down to the last lap,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Now I’ve learned how to have more speed at the end of the races. It’s about taking advantage of the facilities and being stronger at the end. Alberto has helped me.”</p> \n<p>In a passage of the interview that echoed Lance Armstrong’s admission of drug taking in his interview with Oprah Winfrey, Farah was challenged over whether he had ever taken testosterone, EPO, HGH or any performance enhancing drugs.</p> \n<p>“No never,” he insisted, adding that the only medication he took was for the asthma he has had since he was a child.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/30/1435682416393/Mo-Farah-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mo Farah says the uncertainty over doping allegations is 'killing' him and his family.

You flew to Oregon. When you confronted him how would you have described the mood of that meeting?</p> \n<p><strong>MF</strong> “It wasn’t good, obviously, the meet. But, at the same time, I wanted answers as an athlete. I work so hard for what I do. To achieve what I have has taken me half of my life to be able to achieve what I have achieved. And for people to think I have taken a short cut, it’s not right and it’s not fair.</p> \n<p>“This picture has been painted of me. It’s not right. I am 100% clean. I love what I do. I want to continue winning medals. But I want people to know that I am 100%, I am not on any drugs, I am not on thyroids, I am not on any other medication. The only medication that I am on, I am on asthma and I have had that since I was a child. That’s just a normal use. I am on TUE [therapeutic use exemption] where you have … it’s just the normal stuff. And that’s it.”</p> \n<p><strong>JW</strong> I want to get more of this meeting. You withdrew from the Diamond League in Birmingham and you flew straight to Oregon. So you are in front of Alberto Salazar and he spoke to you. Did he allay your fears there and then?</p> \n<p><strong>MF</strong> “Yeah. He said to me: ‘Mo, I can assure you this, trust me. These are just allegations. I can prove all this. Wait until it comes out. And it will come out.”</p> \n<p>“I was like: ‘Are you sure?’</p> \n<p>“He said: ‘Yes.’ That is when I just left it.</p> \n<p>“For me, I wanted to just continue running. I couldn’t be there because, you know, I wanted at the time to relax with my family, to enjoy time. But it was difficult. Certain newspapers would come to my house, park outside the house, bother me with the kids. It was just too much.”</p> \n<p><strong>JW</strong> Did you believe what he told you that day?</p> \n<p><strong>MF</strong> “Yes. I believed in him. But, at the same time, there’s no point in me just believing in him. He needs to prove it to the public and the people. For all the people to come out … I want those people to go to the right authority. Not just to the media and everyone else and [their] words get twisted. They need to go to the right people. I am glad now that UK Anti-Doping and Usad [the US Anti-Doping Agency] are going into these allegations.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/alberto-salazar-issues-denial-doping-statement\">Alberto Salazar denies allegations: ‘I will never permit doping’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>JW</strong> How would you describe your relationship with him following this meeting?</p> \n<p><strong>MF</strong> “Yeah, it was good. Obviously, you know, I wanted to be sure. At the same time separate myself. I came out here to France, to get on with training, to do what I do. At the same time, it’s like with all this going on … look I don’t want to be there. I really don’t want to be there. I want him to answer the questions, to answer everything and then later on, ‘OK, let’s sort it out’.”</p> \n<p><strong>JW</strong> More and more people are alleging that Alberto Salazar has manipulated the system. As more and more alleged this, might you consider, the longer than this goes on, distancing yourself from him or moving on from altogether?</p> \n<p><strong>MF</strong> “Yeah, for sure. If more people come out, and it’s proven that he has crossed the line, yeah I’m the first person out. I’m out. Trust me on this, Jim. Because I work every day hard, I put my body through hell. Let me just tell you. Every year, seven months of the year, I’m away from my family. Year-in, year-out. I don’t see my family. I miss my kids. I miss my kids’ birthdays, our anniversary. Those are times I can never go back and share with my kids. And that really kills me. To be labelled something you are not, to have people label me as a cheat, it’s not fair and it’s not right. If I am a cheat, prove that I am cheat. Or just leave me alone. Let me do what I do best. And that’s to run, to represent my country and make my country be proud. At least the people and the public … 75,000 people were there in London, cheering for me, shouting out my name. I will never let them people down. If people say I am a cheat, I am crossing the line, then prove I’m crossing the line.”</p> \n<p><strong>JW</strong> People allege, though, that he has crossed the line. So, again, I put it to you, if not now, you are saying some time maybe in the near future, you would distance yourself from Salazar altogether?</p> \n<p><strong>MF</strong> “For sure, 100%. If he has crossed the line and it is proven he has crossed the line, and the more people come, and more people go to the right authorities, instead of going to the newspapers, we can deal with this, then yes, I’m out. Why would I be there?”</p> \n<p><strong>JW</strong> How does Salazar’s method provide you with more energy during a race? How did he get you quicker?</p> \n<p><strong>MF</strong> “For me, I have always had the talent. As a youngster, I had the talent. I started off when I was young, representing my country and winning medals. I never learned to win big races. I was there, thereabouts. In 2007 in the world championships I was number six. Then again in 2009 I was number seven. So, I was just there or thereabouts. It always came down to the last lap. Now I have learned to use more speed. Obviously, I have more speed at the end of races. I am more stronger. I have probably taken advantage of the facilities and been a lot more stronger as an athlete and used my head.”</p> \n<p><strong>JW</strong> So he has undoubtedly helped you become the athlete that you are today?</p> \n<p><strong>MF</strong> “100%. Alberto has coached me and helped me. I have trained with the rest of the team. It has helped me. There is no question of a doubt, I have won medals by being coached by Alberto.”</p> \n<p><strong>JW</strong> But, if you had to progress in your career without him, you could?</p> \n<p><strong>MF</strong> “Well, I have to do it. If these things are [true] and Alberto is proven that he’s doing something wrong and it’s not right, and he has crossed the line, then, of course, I have to do it.”</p> \n<p><strong>JW</strong> But look at where we are today. As you said, US Anti-Doping agency, now UK Anti-Doping, are investigating this man Salazar. The renowned British athlete Jo Pavey has said she would, quote, ‘run a mile if her coach was accused of the things that Salazar has been accused of’. The UK Athletics boss Ed Warner, you know him, said: ‘Your best friends should be telling you to suspend links with Salazar and wait for investigations to conclude.’ And, yet, as you speak to me you are still with him?</p> \n<p><strong>MF</strong> “These things are just allegations, Jim. Let’s put it right. If these things are proven and it has worked out, UK Anti-Doping and Usada go into it, and there is some wrongdoing, he has crossed the line, yes I’m the first person to run. But you have to give people a chance in life. That’s fair. Someone has helped in your career, done so much for you, you have to give them the benefit of a doubt. These are just allegations and someone has said, she said this, he said this; it’s no good to anybody. It’s no good to me. It’s no good to the sport. So, there’s no point them falling out, saying this, that or the other.</p> \n<p>“They need to go to the right people and the right investigations. UK Anti-Doping need to keep on top of this. Usada need to get on top of this. It needs to be dealt [with] properly. Because it’s overshadowing athletics. It’s not good for athletics. I think the people and the public need to know this. There’s no point us talking about it. They need to go to the right people. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/28/mo-farah-warned-team-mate-alberto-salazar-revelations\" title=\"\">And I encourage anyone, Kara [Goucher]</a>, the rest of the guys, to go to the right people and let’s get to the bottom of this!

How is that possible? Are you saying that I am on EPO? I’m one of the top athletes in the world. And I put my body through hell, week-in, week-out, 120 miles week-in, week-out.

Am I a cheat?”</p> \n<p><em>On Farah’s second missed drug test, White asked “how on earth did he not hear the doorbell ring?”</em></p> \n<p><strong>MF</strong> “I was in Teddington. I was staying in one of the Kenyan’s house in Teddington. I was just racing. I was staying on the top floor. And I didn’t hear the buzzer. I was sleeping in my tent. I didn’t hear it.

Nothing to get alarmed about just yet of course and, hey, at least they have some top-quality reading material with them, isn’t that right Mill readers? Oh. Well anyway, United’s negotiations with Real Madrid over <strong>Sergio Ramos</strong> and <strong>David de Gea</strong> have hit a logjam, with Real not prepared to smooth the defender’s passage to Old Trafford and United scrunching up their faces and clinging on to the goalkeeper for all he’s worth.</p> \n<p>City, meanwhile, continue to woo <strong>Paul Pogba</strong> but, despite the prospect of the entire output of an Abu Dhabi oil well being pumped directly into his piggy bank, the Frenchman is waiting for the outcome of Barcelona’s presidential elections before deciding where to go. At the same time, Wolfsburg are waving their fists at City and telling them where to go if they think they can make off with <strong>Kevin De Bruyne</strong>. The German club are proving they’re no sheep in Wolfburg’s clothing, as they’re also baring their teeth at Newcastle, who rather fancied picking up striker <strong>Bas Dost</strong> for &pound;9m but have, according to other reports, been told that Wolfsburg will not let him go for less than &pound;30m.</p> \n<p>But there will at least be a some arrivals at City over the coming days: two delegations from Milan, for a start, as Inter seek to buy <strong>Steven Jovetic</strong> and AC Milan bid for <strong>Matija Nastasic</strong>.</p> \n<p>Stoke will continue their attempts to creep furtively towards the top four by nicking Ghanaian midfielder <strong>Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu</strong> from Udinese for &pound;4m. Now you might think that if the Udinese player was really any good, he’d be playing for Watford this season, but Mark Hughes thinks you’re wrong. Meanwhile, near enough everyone thinks <strong>Asmir Begovic</strong> would be wrong to join Chelsea just to become a glorified Hilario, but the keeper reportedly disagrees and is deadset on going to Stamford Bridge.</p> \n<p><strong>Arda Turan</strong> is not so keen. Atl&eacute;tico Madrid’s Turkish winger is said to be about to eschew the advances of Chelsea and United in order to enrol with Barcelona instead. But <strong>Radamel Falcao</strong> will join Chelsea this week so that’s something. Something, in fact, that will convince Lo&iuml;c R&eacute;my to head to West Ham.</p> \n<p>Liverpool’s apparent plan to conceal the holes in their defence by sneaking 15 forwards on to the pitch will move closer with a bid for <strong>Christian Benteke</strong>, who is so convinced that Brendan Rodgers will come calling that he has reportedly told Aston Villa he will turn down Spurs even if the club accepts an offer from the north Londoners. <strong>Rickie Lambert</strong> may miss out on all the fun, however, as West Brom, QPR and Bournemouth are all weighing up bids for the 33-year-old.</p> \n<p>Paris Saint-Germain are poised to strengthen their goalkeeping options by springing <strong>Kevin Trapp</strong> from Frankfurt. Marseille, meanwhile, are jostling with Crystal Palace and West Ham for the services of Lille’s Senegalese midfielder <strong>Idrissa Gueye</strong>.</p> \n<p>Finally, soon you should refer to Swansea full-back <strong>Jazz Richards</strong> as Fulham full-back Jazz Richards. That ‘finally’ was not meant to suggest that that was the move for which we’d all been waiting, just that the Mill has nothing more to say to you right now. Except goodbye. Oh, and Sevilla want <strong>Leroy Fer</strong>. And Inter want to buy <strong>Juan Cuadrado</strong> and/or <strong>Mohamed Salah</strong> from Chelsea.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435737211383/Kevin-De-Bruyne-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kevin De Bruyne is in Manchester City's sights but Wolfsburg are playing hardball.

Now a 34-year-old veteran lumbering into his 11th year of Test cricket - pundits furiously debate whether Watson or the youthful and ascendant Mitch Marsh should claim Australia’s all-rounder slot when the Ashes begins next week in Cardiff.</p> \n<p>If Darren Lehmann is to be taken at face value much will depend on the bowling speeds Watson generates throughout Australia’s final tour match against Essex because the coach favours both pace and the presence of an all-rounder in his Test sides.</p> \n<p>Should he though? If either Watson or Marsh ends up having a series-turning impact with both bat and ball it will go against half a century’s worth of Australian cricket history because the last man to do so during an away Ashes trip was Alan Davidson in 1961. </p> \n<p>Even as Watson found some batting success in the 2013 and 2009 series, it came with virtually no bowling impact in conditions not inhospitable to his wobbly, partnership-breaking seamers. To think he could do much more than hold up an end in a series such as this one feels like a stretch. Ashes wins are secured by strike bowlers, not fill-ins.</p> \n<p>To be fair, Marsh is not himself the irresistible prospect with the Dukes ball in his hand that he is batting - taking just the single wicket in 366 Test deliveries so far and having quite clearly lost some oomph in the process of recalibrating the action that kept crocking him. Touted by Rod Marsh upon his debut Test selection as an exciting bowling prospect, Marsh still looks very much like a batsman who can bowl a little bit.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/jason-gillespie-australia-ashes-england\">Jason Gillespie: Australia start as Ashes favourites in England – and rightly so</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What he does have in spades though is a Lehmann-esque freedom and fearlessness to his cricket. At one point of his and Watson’s partnership in the first tour game against Kent, Marsh outscored his senior teammate 77 runs to 5 on the way to a blazing century. In favorable batting conditions Watson continued with that unfortunate knack for posting scores that symbolize his short-comings; the in-and-out ‘Watto Lotto’ 21 of the first innings, and then the unfairly exasperating not-quite-hundred of the second, when he holed out for 81. </p> \n<p>Marsh grew up in a family where the life of international cricket always stood at close and familiar quarters so - you’d guess - possibly seems to him a far less intimidating vocation than it might to others. By contrast, Watson still bats with the neurotic air of a body-builder pensively assessing whether the next deadlift could do him in for good. Both men possess the tools to take a session and perhaps an entire Test away from England but only Marsh actually seems likely to do so these days. </p> \n<p>The second-in-line senior reserve batsman’s slot would be a strange sort of role for Watson to finish up in given that sustained period he enjoyed atop the list of limited overs cricket’s most belligerent and impactful players, but it seems so long since he last strode to the crease like Whelan the Wrecker and lay waste to bowling attacks; something he never quite managed at Test level anyway.</p> \n<p>England does at least hold memories of personal successes but Watson’s one genuinely imposing score in Test cricket – 176 at The Oval in 2013 – came when the series was already lost and after one of the most poignant Watsonian Test series sequences; 13, 46, 30, 20, 19, 18, 68 and 2. Should they elect to pick him the Australian selectors can’t expect any greater returns this time around. In 16 Test innings since the 103 he made against England in Perth during December 2013, Watson has scored only three half-centuries and all of them came when the series trophy was already in the bag. </p> \n<p>Most likely Watson will finish his Test career in the position he’s always occupied, battling against his physical, technical and emotional shortcomings at the crease, giving rise to spirited selection debate and only grudgingly admired for his persistence at Test level when he might instead have retreated permanently to the lucrative and less demanding T20 circuit.</p> \n<p>On the batting of another fill-in Australian Test captain, Brian Booth, cricket writing doyen Ray Robinson theorized that “his style might have been influenced by unorthodox circuitry in his nervous and muscular system.” You wonder what he would have made of Watson’s reflexively thrusted front pad, muscular pounding of the ball and the incredulous facial reactions shot at any bowler with the temerity to verbally joust with the Australian.</p> \n<p>If youth wins the day and Marsh is indeed the man for the job in this Ashes series and beyond, there still remains the likelihood that he or a teammate will tire and need the capable relief that Watson can offer on his final Ashes voyage. </p> \n<p>Say hello, wave goodbye.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bd98a0842429585fa2cc1f0757b1cca6ef111116/0_0_3549_2130/3549.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2130,"width":3549,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"John Sibley/REUTERS","altText":"Shane Watson","cleanCredit":"Photograph: John Sibley/REUTERS"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-01T07:37:22Z","lastModified":"2015-07-01T07:44:28Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Russell Jackson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/russell-jackson"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Ashes 2015","The Ashes","Australia cricket team","Cricket","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/ashes-2015","webTitle":"Ashes 2015"},{"id":"sport/ashes","webTitle":"The Ashes"},{"id":"sport/australia-cricket-team","webTitle":"Australia cricket team"},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Russell Jackson","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/russell-jackson"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/01/watson-marsh-australia-selection-headache","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9n9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jul/01/watson-marsh-australia-selection-headache","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/01/watson-marsh-australia-selection-headache"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bd98a0842429585fa2cc1f0757b1cca6ef111116/0_0_3549_2130/3549.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2130,"width":3549,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Beleaguered all-rounder Shane Watson will need to prove his case against Essex, as Australian coach Darren Lehmann runs the rule over Watson and Mitchell Marsh.
