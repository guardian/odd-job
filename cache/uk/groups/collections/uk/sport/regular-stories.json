Usada has interviewed more than a dozen witnesses and is actively pursuing documents and other evidence from Salazar, who coached Rupp to the silver medal in the 10,000m at the London Olympics.</p> \n<p>Usada would not comment on whether an investigation was taking place but in a statement it said it took “all reports of doping seriously and we aggressively follow up on all information we receive in order to fulfil our oath to protect clean athletes and the integrity of competition”.</p> \n<p>Salazar has largely kept his counsel in the three weeks since a Panorama documentary made a number of sensational claims, including that he gave Rupp the banned steroid testosterone as a 16-year-old. But in a 11,750-word statement published on the Nike Oregon Project website he finally tackled the allegations which he said had left “innocent athletes’ careers tarnished with nothing but innuendo, hearsay and rumour”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/alberto-salazar-statement-galen-rupp-nike-oregon-project\">Alberto Salazar statement: let the haters hate – we will keep winning</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Salazar insisted Rupp had only ever used legal testosterone supplements designed to naturally boost his levels, and that photographic evidence of testosterone being noted in his medical notes – obtained by his former assistant Steve Magness – was a recording error. “Galen has clearly stated that he did not take testosterone in December 2002 or at any other time,” he added.</p> \n<p>In Salazar’s lengthy rebuttal there were frequent references to dates, documents and exhibits. For the most part it gave his response a more formal and almost legal air. But there was no disguising his anger as he accused Magness of “spreading malicious false allegations” and suggested he left the Nike Oregon Project not because he saw anything suspicious but because he “proved to be a poor coach who had difficulty building rapport with world-class athletes”.</p> \n<p>He also claimed Magness had appeared happy when he discussed his role next to Salazar with <em>Runner’s World </em>in 2011. “Steve Magness did not leave the Oregon Project,” Salazar added. “The Oregon Project terminated his contract in 2012.”</p> \n<p>However, last night Magness revealed that he had a signed document to show that there had been a “mutual termination” of his contract. “I also have a recording of the conversation Alberto and I had when we decided to part ways, which makes absolutely zero mention of any relationship between myself and any other athlete, or any mention of departing for failure as a coach,” he said. “I did not have a relationship with any athlete during my time at the Nike Oregon Project.</p> \n<p>“Salazar goes to great lengths to use a July 2011 interview with me as evidence of my thought process at the time. I’d like to point out that since my employer was Nike at the time, I knew that speaking my true feelings would certainly jeopardise my career, so I stuck with the politically correct answers out of fear.</p> \n<p>“Since leaving Nike, this fear has been realised and demonstrated on many occasions, first with the insistence of disclaimers and phone calls following a Lance Armstrong piece I wrote, which were followed up with a confrontation at the 2013 London athletics meeting. It’s humbling to say but the intimidation and fear of speaking out is what kept me from publicly addressing my concerns at that time.</p> \n<p>“Salazar paints me as an inadequate coach, which my performance before and after Nike I dispute. In the past two years I have coached three individuals to top 20 at world championships.”</p> \n<p>Magness is one of nearly 20 former athletes or employees who have spoken out against Salazar’s methods. Some have indicated to the <em>Guardian </em>that they also plan to respond to his report in the coming days. Several of Salazar’s current athletes, including Rupp, Matthew Centrowitz and Shannon Rowbury, are also expected to speak after competing in the US Track and Field championships, which begin evening.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile a spokesman for the BBC defended its Panorama programme about Salazar, saying: “We are confident in our programme and that it was right to air the allegations of the witnesses who appeared on it. We stand by our journalism and it is now for the relevant anti-doping authorities to investigate the allegations.</p> \n<p>“The detailed allegations were put to Mr Salazar four weeks before the programme aired, giving him the opportunity to address them in full. The BBC has also invited Alberto Salazar to be interviewed about the allegations, an offer which still stands.”</p> \n<p>The back-and-forth is likely to continue in the coming days but Salazar says he has documented evidence going back to 2001 to show that another allegation, that Rupp was a frequent user of the asthma drug prednisone – which is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency for use in competition – is “completely false”. Rupp was forced to take allergy and thyroid medicine because he suffered from “severe allergies and breathing issues”, not because he was cheating, said Salazar. “He is medically diagnosed as suffering from both asthma and Hashimoto’s disease, a thyroid disease,” he added. “Galen takes asthma medication so he can breathe normally, not so he can run better. Galen takes his thyroid medication so that his body can function normally, not for any competitive advantage.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/galen-rupp-us-track-field-championships-coach-alberto-salazar-eugene\">Galen Rupp to race at US championships amid Salazar controversy</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But Salazar insisted Rupp was the exception not the rule at the Oregon Project when it came to using asthma and thyroid medication. He added that of the 55 athletes he had coached at Nike only five had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and only eight with exercise-induced asthma after he had started working with them.</p> \n<p>Salazar also rejected the claims of his former athlete Kara Goucher, the 10,000m world championship bronze medallist, that he had “coached” Rupp to try to flout the strict rules around Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUEs) certificates so he could get an intravenous drip before the 2011 world championships – and said Rupp had had only two TUEs since 2010.</p> \n<p>But Salazar did admit that John Stiner, the massage therapist who worked briefly with him in 2008, was right to say that he had seen Androgel, a testosterone gel banned by Wada, in his room. However, he said it was strictly for his own use because he suffered from low virility levels.</p> \n<p>“My excessive training as an athlete did extensive damage to my body,” he added. “One of the lingering negative effects from which I still suffer today is hypogonadism with significant symptoms, including multiple low testosterone serum levels. There is no question that I have a valid justification for my possession of Androgel as defined by the Wada code. I have never given Androgel to any of my athletes.”</p> \n<p>Salazar also dismissed suggestions that a fridge full of vials in his training camp in Park City, which was seen by Stiner, was suspicious. “Stiner has tried to imply that Galen’s allergy immunotherapy medicine is something else,” he said. “It’s not. Galen has been receiving allergy immunotherapy vaccine injections since approximately 2004.”</p> \n<p>Yet Salazar did admit he had “let his paranoia get the best of him” when he asked Dr Jeffrey Brown to conduct an experiment to find out whether it was possible for someone to rub enough testosterone cream on an athlete to make them test positive. It had come about, he said, because Justin Gatlin had blamed his positive test for exogenous testosterone on being sabotaged by his massage therapist, Chris Whetstine, and he was worried the same thing might happen to Rupp.</p> \n<p>“On May 9, 2009, Galen Rupp’s University of Oregon 4x1 mile relay team set a new NCAA record,” he said. “Shortly after the race while talking to the press, Galen felt someone rubbing his shoulders. He turned around and it was Chris Whetstiner. Galen had heard the stories. He was extremely concerned and called me. I called the US Anti-doping Agency hotline to report it. Usada may still have the tapes or notes of my call. Nothing came of it but it caused us grave concern.”</p> \n<p>Salazar concluded with a message for his detractors: “Let the haters hate; we’re going to keep winning through hard work, dedication and fair play.” But the immediate response from Usada and Magness suggests this saga will rumble on for a long while yet.</p> \n<p>Nike later released its own statement saying it had conducted its own review and found no evidence of doping.</p> \n<p>“We take the allegations very seriously as Nike does not condone the use of performance enhancing drugs in any manner,” it read. “Both Alberto and Galen have made their position clear and refute the allegations made against them, as shown in Alberto’s open letter.</p> \n<p>“Furthermore we have conducted our own internal review and have found no evidence to support the allegations of doping.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435189878618/Alberto-Salazar-has-issue-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Salazar has issued a 12,000-word rebuttal of allegations of doping.

Here are some of his key points …</p>","byline":"Guardian sport","body":"<h2><strong>Of the allegations</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>At best they are misinformed. At worst they are lying. I told both media outlets that their stories contained false information before they were published. I have now offered evidence that they are false. I hereby demand the BBC and ProPublica immediately publish a retraction of their false statements.</p> \n<h2><strong>On Galen Rupp</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>Claims made around Galen’s prednisone use are false. Claims made around Galen’s use of TUEs [therapeutic use exemptions] and manipulation of the TUE system are false. Galen has received only two TUEs in his running career since 2010. Galen is one of the hardest-working, most honest and genuine athletes I have ever known. Galen has never taken a banned substance in violation of the Wada [World Anti-Doping Agency] code.</p> \n<h2><strong>On the Oregon Project</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>The Oregon Project will never permit doping and athletes must fully comply with the Wada code and IAAF rules. We proudly embrace science and technology to give our runners every legal means for success and, more importantly, to protect their health and wellbeing. I will never permit doping. Oregon Project athletes must fully comply with the Wada code and IAAF rules. At no time do we use science in violation of the code. Here success is earned with talent, hard work, dedication and fair play and that’s how it is going to stay. Let the haters hate – we’re going to keep winning through hard work, dedication and fair play.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/alberto-salazar-issues-denial-doping-statement\">Alberto Salazar denies allegations: ‘I will never permit doping’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>On himself</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>My drive and determination as an athlete is well known. I pushed myself as far as my body could go. In fact, I trained and ran so hard it nearly killed me and I still suffer today the negative physical effects of my excessive training. I have that same drive and determination as a coach, combined with much more wisdom. I push my athletes to be the best but will not hurt my athletes like I hurt myself.</p> \n<h2><strong>On the Steve Magness allegations </strong><br /></h2> \n<p>While Magness makes a number of inflammatory and false statements about the Oregon Project and me personally, at no point does he allege that any doping violations occurred while he was with the Oregon Project. That’s because none did. Magness’ comments to Runner’s World in July 2011 directly contradict what he is now alleging. After a year of research at great expense the BBC and ProPublica journalists fail to mention that. In the BBC/ProPublica stories, Magness claims he left the Oregon Project because his “anxiety was rising” and he was disillusioned about what we were doing. That is not correct. Magness’ contract was terminated.</p> \n<h2><strong>On Wada rules</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>I have always fully complied with the Wada code and IAAF rules. I am always extra cautious and take every step to ensure my athletes comply with the anti-doping rules.</p> \n<h2><strong>On the BBC</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>Unfortunately Galen and I were the ones these “reporters” decided to damn with their “publish at all costs” philosophy. It is our reputations they have harmed. Innocent athletes’ careers tarnished with nothing but innuendo, hearsay and rumour. Some have tried to console me by saying public attacks like these are the price of success in today’s world. You win [and] people will try to tear you down. That’s not my world.</p> \n<h2><strong>On use of thyroid and asthma medicine</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>Athletes are not pushed to take medications. Of 55 athletes only five have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism after I had started coaching them. Only eight have been diagnosed with exercise induced asthma. Claims I have manipulated the test for exercise induced asthma are false, and the testing referenced is standard protocol as any basic research would show.</p> \n<h2><strong>On TUEs</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>In the BBC/ProPublica<em> </em>stories and in additional stories I have seen since, a number of people have alleged that I attempt to manipulate the TUE process for Oregon Project athletes. That is completely false. Kara Goucher’s claim that someone can make a couple of statements to a doctor and get a TUE is absurd and demeaning to the TUE processes of Usada and the IAAF. The Usada and IAAF TUE process is very rigorous. Medical doctors must submit substantial medical records to support an athlete’s request for a TUE. The medical professionals at the IAAF and/or Usada then closely scrutinise those documents. It is not a rubber stamp that can be easily manipulated.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435169715604/Alberto-Salazar-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Salazar has issued a strong rebuttal to all of the major allegations levelled against him and his work for the Nike Oregon Project.

He was banned for four years, though many thought that would be the end of his career. To the ire of many he has become even better since becoming eligible to run again in 2010.</p> \n<p>No one has beaten him at either 100m or 200m since 2013, while this year, aged 33, he has set or equalled lifetime bests in both and become a serious threat to dethrone Usain Bolt at August’s world championships in Beijing.</p> \n<p>“If I felt like I did anything that I was trying to take away from the sport of track and field, then I would stand up and say ‘yes, I am guilty and I did this. Please have mercy on me’,” Gatlin said.</p> \n<p>He has never admitted to doping and continued to insist his 2006 test came from a massage therapist rubbing testosterone cream on to his legs, a contention the therapist has denied. “I have stuck to my story so far, and I have been honest with that,” Gatlin said. His four years off have given his legs new shelf life, he claimed. “I feel like 26 or 27 years old,” he said.</p> \n<p>With Bolt having difficulty regaining his top form, many expect Gatlin to defeat the Jamaican in the 100m at the world championships, though the American will not go that far.</p> \n<p>“I think that I am a serious threat to anybody out there who is trying to get that medal,” he said. “But I think those guys are a threat as well.”</p> \n<p>He and Bolt have not raced since 2013 and, despite the Jamaican’s lack of form this year, Gatlin thinks his rival will be ready by August. “He’s done that in 2012,” Gatlin said. “He was beaten by his own team-mate at Olympic trials, in the 100m and 200m, and he seemed like he was going to lose the Olympics in 2012. But he woke up in the semi-finals and pulled it off.”</p> \n<p>The pair will meet again in August and Gatlin is relishing the challenge in Beijing where he wants to take Bolt’s mantle as the world’s top sprinter. “I want it all again,” he said. “I want to be able to run the table. I want to be able to say that I have all those things once again.“</p> \n<p>Athletics fans have been keen on the pair meeting before Beijing and while Gatlin accepts it would have been a tempting showdown, he was more interested in facing the Jamaican in China, when he expects him to be back at his best.</p> \n<p>“What is it really going to amount to if I go out there and run against Usain when he is not at his best?,” Gatlin added. “That is not a great storyline.

Hughes and Dronsfield have transferred allegiance from Anguilla and Sweden respectively, while the other three have opted to compete for Great Britain having yet to represent the United States, where they are based.</p> \n<p>UKA has insisted it does not actively recruit athletes from abroad and is instead guided by international regulations on athlete eligibility. However, a leading coach, who asked not to be named, questioned the governing body’s motives before the World Championships and Olympics.</p> \n<p>He said: “The Olympics are coming up now and there’s all this panic because we need to get this amount of medals for the sponsors to stay with the GB team. They have gone after female 400m runners. If you look at it at the moment, we’ve only really got one and she’s not running that well at the moment. So you know there’s a blank space there that they want to fill in.</p> \n<p>“You look at the other athletes. A sprint hurdler, that’s another space they want to fill in. Then the high jumpers – we don’t have top female high jumpers, our best high jumpers are heptathletes. It’s very clever what they’re doing. They want to fill in blank spaces. It happens in Olympic cycles.”</p> \n<p>Hughes, 19, trains in Jamaica alongside Bolt and earlier this month finished behind him in second over 200m <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/13/usain-bolt-200m-new-york-icahn-adidas-grand-prix\" title=\"\">at the Diamond League in New York</a>, clocking 20.32sec. Hughes is from Anguilla, the British overseas territory which is not recognised by the International Olympic Committee and therefore ineligible at the Rio Games.</p> \n<p>Ofili, 20, is the younger sister of Tiffany Porter, the European 100m champion. Both are from Michigan, USA, but their mother was born in Britain and Porter opted to represent the country before London 2012.</p> \n<p>A UKA spokeswoman said: “No proactive recruitment takes place. If an athlete has British nationality and achieves the required selection standards, then they are eligible to compete for Great Britain and Northern Ireland.”</p> \n<p>The former sprinter Darren Campbell, who won Olympic 200m silver at Sydney 2000 and relay gold in the 4x100m at Athens 2004, said athletes unhappy because their places may become under threat <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/darren-campbell-gb-athletes-relish-competition\" title=\"\">should see the new competition as healthy</a>.</p> \n<p>He said: “I can understand why it would be unsettling but, if you’re trying to be the best in the world, then everyone needs to be beaten. It means the current British athletes have to be ready to go.</p> \n<p>“When you hear of a sprinter, aged 19, who is labelled the new Usain Bolt, that is going to spread fear among the sprinters. If his potential is realised, he’ll go on to run crazy times. This is going to block paths for other sprinters. You would be worried. But as I’ve said, your mindset has to change.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Martyn Rooney, the European 400m champion, wrote <a href=\"http://www.martynrooney.com/news/\" title=\"\">in his blog</a>: “Personally I’m a supporter of athletes coming across becoming British citizens on the condition that they contribute to British society. They should improve the standard of competition, help in local sports projects, pay tax in the UK, be good role models to younger athletes, integrate themselves into the team etc.</p> \n<p>“My wife, Kate Dennison, was born in South Africa and moved to the UK when she was four, she’s done all of the above and is a celebrated double Olympian. She took pole vault in the UK from national standard to world class and from her success, others have gone on to world medals. If the newest batch of athletes can do this, then we should support them the same as any other British athlete no matter what accent they have.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435167311758/Zharnel-Hughes-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Zharnel Hughes, right, finished close behind world record holder Usain Bolt at this month's Diamond League meeting in New York.

So that was a hugely frustrating situation for me.”</p> \n<p>Under the whereabouts system, designed to support out-of-competition testing, cyclists are obliged to inform officials where they will be for a specific hour between 5am and 11pm when they are obliged to be available for testing.</p> \n<p>Most nominate a time early in the morning, as it is when they are most certain of their likely whereabouts: at home in bed. While Froome had logged his temporary holiday address on the whereabouts website, he neglected to let hotel staff know he may have callers who should be granted immediate access to his room.</p> \n<p>“I did appeal to try and explain the circumstances to the authorities but at the end of the day I take full responsibility for that case,” said Froome, who has previously claimed to have been tested more than 30 times in one three-week period.</p> \n<p>“I should have been more proactive in letting the hotel know this was a possibility that I could be tested. I’ve certainly learned my lesson there. I’ve stayed in hotels all over the world and I’ve been tested all over the world without any issues at all. Unfortunately I just didn’t see this one coming but it’s opened my eyes and I’m definitely going to be more pro-active in the future. It’s always the athlete’s responsibility to make sure he or she is available for testing.”</p> \n<p>The World Anti-Doping Agency operates a three-strike policy that means anyone who misses three tests in a 12-month period is deemed to have committed an anti-doping rule violation and incurs an automatic ban of up to two years.</p> \n<p>Despite the recent blot on his copybook, Froome is pleased with what he sees as a more rigorous approach to drug testing in cycling.</p> \n<p>Last year he observed that neither he, nor his high-profile Tour de France rivals Vincenzo Nibali and Alberto Contador, had been asked to undergo drug controls during lengthy spells of altitude training in Tenerife.</p> \n<p>“As far as I can see that has been rectified,” he said. “This year, up in Tenerife alone, I think we were tested at least three or four times during the period when we were up there. So yes, I think the authorities have acted on that.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435178957279/The-2013-Tour-de-France-w-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The 2013 Tour de France winner Chris Froome is one of the favourites to win this year's race.

The cricket they and England have played has been compelling all the way through, from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/25/england-new-zealand-first-test-match-report\" title=\"\">the first Test match at Lord’s</a>, to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/23/england-new-zealand-twenty20-international-cricket\" title=\"\">the single T20 at Old Trafford</a>. Just as much, though, has been the manner in which the game has been played, something that is sneered at in some quarters, as if the values of sportsmanship, good manners and pure enjoyment, which both teams have managed to convey, are somehow redundant ideals and secondary to success.</p> \n<p>The response of the cricket-following public to the tour as it has unfolded has shown emphatically that this is not the case, the pity only that it has all been too short. The fullness of time could well show this visit of the New Zealand team to be one of the most important in memory simply for what it has done for the game.</p> \n<p>It is against this backdrop that the Australian team has arrived, and, attending Michael Clarke’s first press conference of the tour, rather than the frisson of excitement that has always preceded an Ashes series in this country, it all seemed rather flat, as if the best, or at least most entertaining part of the summer has passed with the solstice. This has nothing to do with the Australian team itself, except in the sense that the visit of New Zealand was always regarded (not least by themselves one imagines) as the precursor to yet another Ashes series, and Clarke’s men will no more enjoy having their thunder stolen by the warm-up act any more than the Who would if Paul Weller play them off the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury on Sunday.</p> \n<p>Already the talk, largely but not entirely media-driven of course, has turned to aggression, attitude and confrontation. Clarke is probably wearied of fielding the same questions, but then there are elements within his side – <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/west-indies-v-australia-2015/content/story/886227.html\" title=\"\">David Warner’s recent interview with ESPN Cricinfo</a> a case in point – who have done little to divert the issue. But then Clarke talked of “the line” and “headbutting” it, whatever that means, and without quite explaining what that line is, and where exactly it is drawn. Or indeed whether it cannot be moved as Brendon McCullum has managed to do. It is, he said, “the Australian way”, which, repeated as it was by Shaun Marsh the next day, sounds suspiciously like the latest PR euphemism for what was once termed “banter” (as an aside, one of the first cricket books bought for me, which I stlll have, is called Cricket, The Australian Way by Jack Pollard, and I can find no reference therein to intangible lines, banter, attack dogs or sledging ).</p> \n<p>The turnaround in the England team since they slunk ignominiously away from the World Cup has been huge. There were good signs in West Indies, although some passive selections were not helpful, but since then self-belief and confidence has grown. Two months ago, the majority view would have been that England had the slimmest chance only of competing against a strong Australian side. Now though, that has changed from something beyond even guarded optimism into a feeling that the series will be a lot closer and harder fought than was anticipated.</p> \n<p>In this, there is a historical element, for although England have suffered two hideous whitewashes in Australia either side of their brilliant win there in the winter of 2010-11, there is not one member of the current Australian touring party who was here in 2001 when they last won a series in this country. In terms of matches here in that time it is 7-2 to England, a massive record of Australian underachievement away from home, and one they now must realise they will have to scrap mightily to rectify.</p> \n<p>The “Dad’s Army” jibes have been predictable and misplaced in intent for the selection of the touring party has been pragmatic: age, as they say, is just a number. Whatever the outcome of the last Ashes series in Australia, it is undeniable that the top order batting had weaknesses, and it was to England’s detriment that they could not destroy the lower order as the Australians managed to do so effectively to them. This time, much of the batting is largely unproven in English conditions, and hence the inclusion of both Chris Rogers and Adam Voges, experienced county players, at ages well beyond those at which they might once have been selected: they know the ropes. On the other hand, the rise of Steve Smith has been phenomenal but his technique will be challenged if the ball swings, so too those of Clarke, Warner and Shane Watson: Rogers and Voges are important cogs in this wheel and well chosen.</p> \n<p>The key to this whole series will rest with the respective attacks, however, and here it is hard to get away from the view that it is Australia who are better equipped. Bowlers who can swing the ball are always a great asset in England: those who can do so at pace are gold dust.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect will be to see quite how Darren Lehmann and the selectors balance the attack for in the two Mitchells, Starc and Johnson, Josh Hazlewood, Ryan Harris, and the redoubtable workhorse Peter Siddle they have performers for all conditions, the deepest pool of quality pacemen in the business. In particular it will be intriguing to see how high up the pecking order Johnson comes now. His success against England in Australia has not been matched by that in England, and as a potent threat he has been overtaken by Starc, a pacier version of Trent Boult, the New Zealander who gave England considerable trouble in May.</p> \n<p>In Hazlewood they have a relentlessly accurate seamer, likened in method and attitude to Glenn McGrath, while England have encountered no more skilful bowler in the last five years than Harris, this barn door of a man with the most gently sublime wrist action around, whose fitness will be the only issue. It may well be Johnson, along with Siddle, who is sidelined at the start. This is the group, the wolfpack, in which the destiny of the Ashes lies.</p> \n<p>Maybe us poms have seen the best of the summer – but it won’t be without a scrap.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435150867002/Australia-captain-Michael-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Australia captain Michael Clarke in batting practice during a nets session in the runup to the Ashes series against England.

Idiosyncrasies in the right-hander’s technique give bowlers hope right up to when the ball flies off the middle of his bat, while in the field he represents one of the most dynamic in world cricket. All nine of his Test hundreds have come in the first innings.</p> \n<h2><strong>Pace ace – Mitchell Starc</strong></h2> \n<p>Dominating large swathes of the Ashes buildup by virtue of being <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/mar/31/mitchell-starc-new-generation-the-spin\" title=\"\">player of the tournament at the World Cup</a>, it is Mitchell Starc – not Mitchell Johnson – who is being touted as the most dangerous weapon in the Australian armoury. Those 22 wickets at 10 runs apiece, in a tournament dominated by the bat, were claimed with the white Kookaburra ball, however, and do not guarantee the 6ft 5in left-armer success with the red Duke on English pitches. But while his Test career is yet to ignite in the same fashion as in one-day cricket, with just two five-wicket hauls in his 17 matches to date – both on home soil – his 10 victims in the recent two-Test series with West Indies suggest we may be about to witness the 25-year-old’s coming of age in the format.</p> \n<h2><strong>Latecomer – Adam Voges</strong></h2> \n<p>Arriving in Test cricket <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/01/adam-voges-australia-debut-west-indies\" title=\"\">at the age of 35</a>, Adam Voges had booked in for a full season captaining Middlesex in the County Championship, where he had previously filled in for fellow Australian Chris Rogers during the 2013 Ashes, until a monstrous showing <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/mar/25/victoria-claim-sheffield-shield-title\" title=\"\">in the most recent edition of the Sheffield Shield</a> – he scored 1,358 runs in 11 matches at an average of 104.46 – convinced the selectors that age was his least important number. Leaving Lord’s after four championship games, Voges was awarded his Baggy Green on the recent Caribbean tour and repaid that faith with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/05/voges-scores-unbeaten-century-on-debut-to-rescue-australia-in-west-indies\" title=\"\">an unbeaten, match-changing 130</a> on his debut in Dominica. The right-hander may not be one for the future but in the here and now of the Ashes cricket, his seven summers of experience playing for Nottinghamshire and Middlesex gives the tourists additional local nous.</p> \n<h2><strong>Newcomer – Josh Hazlewood</strong></h2> \n<p>Tall (he stands at 6ft 5in), quick (he regularly clocks 88mph) and blessed with the ability to consistently threaten off stump, the 24-year-old Josh Hazlewood has made up for time lost to injury early in his career and goes into his first Ashes series brimming with confidence after finishing as the leading wicket-taker on Australia’s recent tour of the Caribbean with 12 in the two-Test victory over West Indies, and on pitches not entirely conducive to fast bowling. The Glenn McGrath comparisons – by virtue of being a metronomic quick from the country in New South Wales – are yet to stretch to predictions of a whitewash.

From the very early emails I told them what I was doing and they suggested this was the way to go about it.”</p> \n<p>The cricket management at Middlesex do not see the issue preventing Rogers playing for them and will discuss his return after the Ashes. But senior club officials may yet disagree, with Rogers stating he had lined up two of their players – England’s Steven Finn and Sam Robson – to make guest appearances as part of the proposed hospitality packages. After missing two Tests in the West Indies earlier this month through concussion, Rogers admitted his final winter on tour with Australia is not going to plan.</p> \n<p>“Middlesex have been amazing to me and I have nothing but respect for the people in that organisation so hopefully I can continue that relationship,” he added. “The business was something I was hoping to be able to develop after I finished playing. It’s been a distraction but the cricket starts tomorrow and I can’t wait to get out there – the concussion and now this, it’s not how I saw my last tour.”</p> \n<p>Rogers’ error of judgment may provide England with some verbal ammunition when the first Test gets under way in Cardiff on 8 July, even if Anderson – a player never far from the centre of such on-field hostilities – claims his side want the series to be played in the same good-natured fashion as their fixtures with New Zealand have been.</p> \n<p>“That was a really positive series and the nature of both sides’ cricket was helped by the spirit the game was played in,” Anderson told Sky Sports News. “Needle is something I thought I thrived on or needed in the past. But having played in the last few months, I think it’s important we get the balance right of playing in the right spirit but also having that competitive edge to win a game of cricket for your country.”</p> \n<p>Anderson will meet Bayliss for the first time this weekend as part of a 14-man England party travelling to Spain for an Ashes training camp. Speaking to Fox Sports at Sydney airport, before his flight to London, Bayliss said: “I’ll get to know the players, number one ... apart from that, a little bit of planning before the Ashes.</p> \n<p>“It’ll be some good fun, I think. I’ll be just doing things the way I normally do with any of the cricket teams I’ve been involved in and hopefully that means England playing some good cricket. I’m confident of putting up a good show and, if they play some good cricket, there’ll be a chance of winning.”</p> \n<p><strong>Australian XI to face Kent</strong> Chris Rogers, Shaun Marsh, Steve Smith, Michael Clarke (capt), Shane Watson, Mitchell Marsh, Brad Haddin, Mitchell Johnson, Peter Siddle, Ryan Harris, Fawad Ahmed.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Cricket/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435166484784/Chris-Rogers-faces-the-pr-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Australia's Chris Rogers faces the press over his role in the resale of tickets for the Lord's Ashes Test.

For the third time in succession England bowed out of the European Under-21 Championships at the group stage after slumping to a hugely-disappointing defeat to Italy in Olomouc.</p> \n<p>Gareth Southgate had hoped his side’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/21/sweden-england-european-under-21-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">win over Sweden</a> in their second group game would liberate his players but here they were clinically dispatched by opponents who they have now failed to beat in five meetings at this tournament.</p> \n<p>In truth, the result was never in doubt after Andrea Belotti and Marco Benassi had put Italy two goals to the good in the space of two minutes midway through the first half. Benassi’s second with just under 20 minutes to go simply killed the potential for drama despite Nathan Redmond’s late consolation. Positive thinking had been prevalent in the camp throughout but this result left little scope for optimism.</p> \n<p>“We can’t put this group of young players in with everything else that has happened in England’s football history,” said Southgate. “These are young players and there’s some improvement that needs to happen in terms of their general defending as a group and as individuals. That’s the age they’re at. All teams in this competition have made defensive errors, sometimes they’re punished, sometimes they’re not. We’ve been punished ruthlessly for them.”</p> \n<p>Sweden’s 89th-minute equaliser against Portugal in the other Group B game meant that both sides here are heading home before the semi-finals. But while Italy went out on a high, this was certainly the lowest point of Southgate’s two-year tenure with the under-21s. The former Middlesbrough manager signed an extension to his contract with the Football Association in January and is scheduled to take the team through to the end of the 2017 edition of this competition.</p> \n<p>“I’m contracted to stay on, I’d like to stay on. In the end, it’s not my decision,” he said. “But I think what we’ve done over two years has progressed the profile of the team, the style in which we’ve played. I think we’ve had some massive success stories in terms of individuals that have come through the programme. Even in this tournament one or two players that have come through have emerged from it. So I think people will look at all of that when they’re making that decision.”</p> \n<p>Southgate had been bold with his team selection, playing Danny Ings in the No10 role behind Harry Kane and giving Brighton’s Jake Forster-Caskey a surprise first appearance of the tournament. He was rewarded with the brightest opening his side has made in the competition, with Ings pulling a shot wide when clean through and Kane, a cut above his team-mates here after enduring a largely frustrating tournament, drawing a spectacular save from Francesco Bardi in the Italy goal.</p> \n<p>Two minutes after that effort, though, events began to unravel for Southgate and his side. With England caught cold from an Italian free-kick, the impressive Domenico Berardi dinked the ball over the defensive line to find Belotti, whose telescopic volley beat Jack Butland from close range. Almost immediately the Azzurrini doubled the lead, with Lorenzo Crisetig allowed to rumble forward unchallenged and Benassi seeing his deflected shot curl low past the helpless goalkeeper.</p> \n<p>That left England with a huge task and though they set about it with relish, Italy drew the sting expertly. Even so Redmond, enjoying perhaps his best game of the tournament, Kane, Jesse Lingard and Ings all went close but any lingering hope was extinguished with 18 minutes to go.</p> \n<p>Stefano Sabelli took a throw-in, Marcello Trotta – probably best known in England for a promotion-costing penalty miss while on loan on Brentford in 2013 – hooked the ball over his head and Benassi directed his header past Butland, condemning England to yet another early exit.</p> \n<p>Redmond did eventually thrash home a goal that England’s energy deserved from the edge of the area in injury time but for Italy there were two more important late goals in the other group game between Sweden and Portugal. The first, for the Portuguese, looked to be sending them into the semi-finals. The second, an equaliser from Sweden’s Simon Tibbling, meant neither side in Olomouc will be playing in the final four.</p> \n<p>“There’s so little between the teams in this tournament,” said Southgate. “Sweden have gone through, Italy haven’t. There’s nothing between the eight teams in my opinion. So it then comes down to detail and concentration and the two-minute spell in the first half when we concede two is the turning point of the game.”</p> \n<p>It meant a bleak scene for all concerned at the Andruv Stadium – even the Czech fans in the crowd went home disappointed, with England’s defeat costing their side an Olympic play-off – but Southgate tried to sound a note of positivity. “In general terms, in terms of what they can give to English football, I think there are some good characters that are going to come through this group who will go into the senior team and make that senior team stronger.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d563356b1b6504bdaf16aa2e3f7ec676147bc9fd/207_54_1197_718/1197.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":718,"width":1197,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Michael Regan/Getty Images","altText":"England’s Danny Ings looks dejected after the third Italy goal during the Under-21 European Championship match.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-24T21:06:13Z","lastModified":"2015-06-24T23:45:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":769,"contributors":[{"name":"John Ashdown","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/johnashdown"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["England Under-21s","Italy","European Championship","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/england-under-21s","webTitle":"England Under-21s"},{"id":"football/italy","webTitle":"Italy"},{"id":"football/european-championship","webTitle":"European Championship"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"John Ashdown","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/johnashdown"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/24/england-under-21-italy-european-championship-match-report","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a5xq","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/24/england-under-21-italy-european-championship-match-report","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/24/england-under-21-italy-european-championship-match-report"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d563356b1b6504bdaf16aa2e3f7ec676147bc9fd/207_54_1197_718/1197.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":718,"width":1197,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England’s Danny Ings looks dejected after the third Italy goal during the Under-21 European Championship match.

The Spain international defender held a meeting with Madrid’s chief executive, Jos&eacute; &Aacute;ngel S&aacute;nchez, on Wednesday morning and confirmed his intention to depart after 10 years at the Bernab&eacute;u. The Spain international asked the club to listen to offers with United having signalled their intention to sign the defender late last week.</p> \n<p>Although Madrid did not provide the standard response, which is to demand that any interested clubs meet the €180m (&pound;128m) buyout clause, and agreed that they will entertain bids, they will set the bar prohibitively high – initially, at least.</p> \n<p>Neither Ramos, 29, nor Madrid have made any public statement but privately their positions are now clear. Ramos arrived at the Valdebebas training ground a little before 10am and departed without talking to the media. The previous day he had visited his lawyer in central Madrid.</p> \n<p>Madrid’s willingness to entertain offers does represent some movement, and suggests that they would not mind selling if the conditions are right, while the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/22/sergio-ramos-real-madrid-relationship-manchester-united\" title=\"\">strained relationship between the player and the president Florentino P&eacute;rez</a> makes brokering a lasting peace at the club difficult.</p> \n<p>Goalkeeper David De Gea, 24, is also a factor in any negotiations, with United able to use Madrid’s interest as leverage. A swift resolution is unlikely but it is clear the defender is prepared to leave after playing more than 400 games for the club.</p> \n<p>Despite Manchester United informing them of their interest in Ramos and reports in Spain of them making an offer, Madrid have claimed not to have received any bids. United informed Real Madrid of their desire to sign Ramos in a meeting at which Madrid had hoped to make progress on an agreement to sign De Gea.</p> \n<p>Neither side backed down on Wednesday on a potential contract renewal at the Bernab&eacute;u. Madrid have made no move towards reconciliation or a renewed offer for Ramos to extend his current &curren;6m-a-year deal (&pound;4.3m) which expires in 2017. Nor did Ramos say that he was prepared to reopen negotiations which have been at a stalemate for some months now. Madrid made an improved offer to take the vice-captain’s salary to around &curren;7.5m but Ramos wanted closer to &curren;10m, according to reports in Spain. Unless there are significant changes in the positions of both player and club, this issue appears to have moved beyond a simple battle over a new contract.</p> \n<p>This has become a battle played out through the press. The sports daily AS, which is critical of P&eacute;rez, reported that Ramos had made up his mind he wanted to leave. On the other side of the divide, the newspaper La Raz&oacute;n, which is close to P&eacute;rez, demanded that he “respect the badge!” Ramos, has been accused of being a money-grabber by the pro-P&eacute;rez press, which has only deepened the sense of mutual distrust.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/22/sergio-ramos-real-madrid-relationship-manchester-united\">How relationship between Sergio Ramos and Real Madrid turned ugly | Sid Lowe</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/24/1435160506218/Sergio-Ramos-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sergio Ramos has a £128m buyout clause in his contract.
