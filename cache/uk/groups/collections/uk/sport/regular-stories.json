Perhaps ironically, they came undone when the geometry-obsessed World Cup holders delivered a rare cross. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/gallery/2015/jul/02/womens-world-cup-japan-beat-england-in-pictures\">Women's World Cup: Japan beat England – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A semi-final England’s coach had predicted would be very much about set pieces was level courtesy of a pair of somewhat debatable penalties, and drifting into extra time when Japan broke and Nahomi Kawusumi unleashed an excellent, subtly curving ball from the right. If anyone needed a reminder of why high-calibre crosses change games, this was it.</p> \n<p>Under acute pressure from two attackers, Bassett attempted to clear but merely succeeded in forcing the ball over Karen Bardsley’s head before watching in horror as it grazed the underside of the bar and dropped a yard over the line.</p> \n<p>As tears began rolling down Bassett’s face, the final whistle blew. Instantly the centre half was engulfed by team-mates desperate to offer her a consolatory hug.</p> \n<p>Bassett and the rest of Sampson’s squad must travel back to London via Saturday’s third place playoff against Germany, while Japan will face USA in the following day’s denouement.</p> \n<p>Prince William and David Cameron had been at the front of the queue of well wishers sending the Lionesses good luck messages on Wednesday, but Norio Sasaki was not convinced.</p> \n<p>“There are places where England fall unintentionally apart,” said Japan’s coach, somewhat sniffily, shortly before kick off. “I wonder how they have been so successful so far?”</p> \n<p>Shortly after kickoff, Jodie Taylor looked set to ruffle his confidence after connecting with Karen Bardsley’s long kick – but she directed her volley slightly off target.</p> \n<p>After that, much of the first half was all about Japan dominating possession, with the Lionesses struggling to second-guess Aya Miyami’s midfield promptings and sometimes wrongfooted by the classy Rumi Utsugi.</p> \n<p>The good news for Sampson was that the <em>Nadeshiko</em> struggled to get behind a supremely well organised defence, and Bardsley was barely troubled. Indeed, on admittedly rare counter-attacks invariably featuring long balls, Jill Scott and Taylor, the Lionesses looked reasonably threatening.</p> \n<p>Everything changed when Claire Rafferty shoved Saori Ariyoshi just inside the area – England protested, forlornly, it was just outside – and Miayma stepped up to take the penalty. Despite delaying her kick and then stuttering in the run-up, she sent Bardsley the wrong way.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN57_OiHpqQ\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vN57_OiHpqQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  England coach Mark Sampson praises the team’s performance despite an injury-time own-goal by defender Laura Bassett which put Japan into the final of the Women’s World Cup\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If Sampson had a case for arguing that Rafferty’s inital push had been made marginally outside the area, he could have had no complaints when England – due &pound;35,000 per woman bonuses had they lifted the trophy – won a distinctly iffy penalty of their own. </p> \n<p>This time, Steph Houghton tumbled all too easy in the face of Yuki Ogimi’s challenge, but the referee bought it and Fara Williams stepped up to the spot. Sampson’s set-piece specialist did not let him down, her kick comfortably evading Ayumi Kaihori’s grasp.</p> \n<p>With Taylor’s knee – she had surgery only two months ago – forcing her replacement by Ellen White after an hour, Japan looked relieved. They appeared even more so as Toni Duggan’s shot rebounded off the bar.</p> \n<p>Sasaki introduced Mana Iwabuchi – aka “The Killer” – from the bench, and the creator dubbed “the brightest flower” of the Japanese women’s game promptly began causing England all sorts of problems as she ran through a repertoire of tricks. So many, indeed, that there was a strong suspicion that Sampson, ever streetwise, instructed Bardsley to fake an injury in order to use the break in play to re-group his Lionesses.</p> \n<p>No matter. Despite Taylor’s withdrawl, England remained very much in the game. White forced a splendid save from Japan’s goalkeeper Kaihori, and Jill Scott headed wide.</p> \n<p>Extra time and possibly penalties were beckoning – but then Bassett, otherwise excellent for England throughout this tournament, endured the worst moment of her career.</p> \n<p>In time, even she may be able to see the bigger picture. It involves the Lionesses’ achievement in reaching the semi finals of a women’s World Cup for the first time, and becoming the first national team of either gender to make the last four since Sir Bobby Robson’s boys of Italia 90.</p> \n<p>They may have stumbled at the penultimate hurdle but, with a nation newly inspired, it will be a major surprise if the topography of the female game in England does not alter beyond recognition.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/035f6fa906e080bf907c5bc1889ad9c82c396d10/0_172_3544_2126/3544.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2126,"width":3544,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ronald Martinez/Getty Images","altText":"Laura Bassett","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ronald Martinez/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T07:23:53Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T07:23:55Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1011,"contributors":[{"name":"Louise Taylor","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/21/1400686541664/Louise-Taylor-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/louisetaylor"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Women's World Cup 2015","England women's football team","Football","Women's football","Sport","UK news","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"football/women-s-world-cup-2015","webTitle":"Women's World Cup 2015"},{"id":"football/england-womens-football-team","webTitle":"England women's football team"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"football/womensfootball","webTitle":"Women's football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Louise Taylor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/louisetaylor"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aatp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/035f6fa906e080bf907c5bc1889ad9c82c396d10/0_172_3544_2126/3544.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2126,"width":3544,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Laura Bassett is comforted by team-mates after scoring her own goal.

USA were winning games, but in ways where it always seemed like the team could crumble at any moment.</p> \n<p>But the USA coach, Jill Ellis, it appears, was playing the long game. The team’s motto is to “peak at the right time” and USA certainly peaked against a fierce and talented Germany to secure a spot in the final.</p> \n<p>“This was our best game so far,” striker Alex Morgan said after Tuesday’s semi-final. “We’ve been playing better and better each game. I think people were pretty critical of us early on, but today proved just how good we can be.”</p> \n<p>The Americans were indeed good enough to knock out the No1-ranked team in the world and, at least for neutral or American supporters, they were fun to watch for perhaps the first time in the tournament. </p> \n<p>A lot of that comes down to the woman who has faced the brunt of the criticism early in this World Cup: Ellis, who has shown her tactical mind is far less rigid than many thought.</p> \n<h2><strong>Shifting Xs and Os</strong></h2> \n<p>Call it a 4-2-3-1 or call it a 4-4-1-1, but Ellis’s against Germany was a stroke of genius.</p> \n<p>Throughout this tournament, Ellis went with a 4-4-2 that looked disjointed and ill-fitted for her personnel. It didn’t seem viable for the latter stages of the tournament, but it looked like USA would live and die by the formation.</p> \n<p>Ellis, however, seemed to see everything critics had been pointing out and then some. Perhaps she was just waiting to surprise everyone with a new system, or maybe midfielder Carli Lloyd gave Ellis no choice.</p> \n<p>“Carli scored some goals and it just seemed like a natural fit,” Ellis said when asked if she had been holding onto that formation, which USA did use last year, but sparingly.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/30/womens-world-cup-usa-into-final-after-carli-lloyd-tames-germany\">Women's World Cup: USA into final after Carli Lloyd tames Germany</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Indeed, Lloyd proved in the quarter-final against China that Ellis had been using her all wrong, and forcing Lloyd to defend was an exercise in frustration. </p> \n<p>Throughout the group stage and the round of 16, Ellis placed Lloyd and Lauren Holiday as tandem central midfielders who split attacking and defensive duties. But that led to gaping holes in the midfield and trouble finding reliable paths to connect lines up the field with passes. Against China, Ellis finally gave Lloyd free rein to attack – and she scored the game-winner.</p> \n<p>With Tuesday’s top-of-the-world semi-final clash looming, Ellis freed up Lloyd even more. She tasked Holiday and youngster Morgan Brian with hanging back and fending off Germany’s efforts to go at goal. Lloyd roamed around the 18-yard box and Morgan was the only dedicated forward on the field, but Ellis said Lloyd became a de facto striker.</p> \n<p>“I wouldn’t say we played with a lone forward. We played with two central 6s to stabilize us,” Ellis said, referring to her holding midfielders. “That way we could get our wide players up and we could afford to release Carli.”</p> \n<p>The frustration Lloyd had been experiencing in the group stages was palpable. Talking to reporters and answering for an attack that was struggling to score goals looked like the last thing Lloyd wanted to do.</p> \n<p>Lloyd said on Tuesday that she met with Ellis when the group stage wrapped up to talk about getting in the game more.</p> \n<p>“[Ellis] was like, ‘Don’t stress it. We’re going to find a way to get you going.’ As a player, you want to have an impact, but I knew my time was going to come,” Lloyd said.</p> \n<p>Holiday and Brian played less glamorous but key roles against Germany. They swept up German attacks and acted as an important connecting piece in moving the ball through the midfield in possession.</p> \n<p>For Brian, it’s not the sort of attacking work she is used to, but as the youngest player of the squad, she has stepped up. “It’s not a natural role for her, but she makes it look natural,” Ellis said.</p> \n<h2><strong>Working the flanks</strong></h2> \n<p>Brian and Christen Press are talented, impressive players. But they are players who know the center of the park and feel comfortable there. That’s why it never made much sense when Ellis forced them to play as wide midfielders.</p> \n<p>Ellis went with the strengths of her squad on Tuesday and used players who feel comfortable working along the sidelines and stretching defenses. Megan Rapinoe and Tobin Heath played well in those wide roles, but perhaps Ellis’ most impressive decision was substituting Kelley O’Hara for Heath.</p> \n<p>O’Hara, a former forward, was groomed into a left-back for the 2012 Olympics and has played there since. But Ellis, not needing to change an ironclad defense that has now gone 513 minutes without conceding a goal, found a different spot for her: wide midfielder.</p> \n<p>The position was perfect for O’Hara, a speedy player who always seems to have a second wind. She was directed to race up along the flanks and provide service into the box, which she could focus on entirely in her new midfield role Tuesday.</p> \n<p>“I thought today would be decided based on the substitutes that were made, and I was right,” veteran forward Abby Wambach said. “I said that to Kelley. I told her I think that this result will be decided based on the subs, either from [Germany’s] coaching staff or ours. I was right because Kelley came in and made the difference.”</p> \n<p>O’Hara’s goal was an audacious, almost desperate attempt to get something on the ball. “Kelley was full-steam coming,” said Lloyd, who got the assist. “That was an unbelievable goal with the commitment on her end.”</p> \n<h2><strong>An awful miss</strong></h2> \n<p>Celia Sasic has been a star of this tournament. </p> \n<p>There was no reason going into it to think she wouldn’t be. She came into Canada with 42 goals in two seasons in the Bundesliga and 57 international goals at the age of 26.</p> \n<p>Going into the semi-final, she was tied with her team-mate Anja Mittag for the tournament’s top-scorer. She had been dominant and confident.</p> \n<p>But that miss – oh, that miss. Sasic sent her penalty wide, even as goalkeeper Hope Solo guessed the wrong way. It was a wasted chance for her side to get ahead and the Germans never seemed to recover.</p> \n<p>To hear the Americans tell it, it wasn’t just that Sasic messed up – Solo psyched Sasic out. “You do what you can,” Solo said. “I did the stall tactic. It worked.”</p> \n<p>Wambach noticed the same thing.</p> \n<p>“Hope did take quite a bit of time, to get their penalty kick shooter, who is very good at going both ways, to think more about it,” Wambach said. “It’s very difficult to make a penalty kick if a ‘keeper stalls, right?”</p> \n<h2><strong>A dash of luck (or controversial refereeing)</strong></h2> \n<p>There is no question that the Americans were the better side on the day. They held more possession, they moved the ball better, they had more dangerous chances and they outlasted Germany with plenty left in the tank.</p> \n<p>But it has to be said: The biggest refereeing decisions probably did go the way of USA.</p> \n<p>The first time was when center-back Julie Johnston wasn’t shown a red card for her takedown of Alexandra Popp. If a player fouls to deny another player a goal-scoring opportunity, it should result in a sending-off. Johnston earned yellow and stayed on the pitch instead.</p> \n<p>Germany coach Silvia Neid was asked if Johnston should’ve been given a red card, and her response was brief: “The rule says yes, but she didn’t get a red card.” </p> \n<p>The second error that went in USA’s favor came when Annike Krahn stepped in front of Morgan and brought her to the ground. The Americans got a penalty but replays showed the foul occurred outside the area.</p> \n<p>Ellis was asked if the bad calls would tarnish her team’s win, but she said she thought USA looked like a winning team.</p> \n<p>“It’s just a part of the game, in terms of officials,” she said. “So whether I’m on the receiving end [of a beneficial call] or the other end of it, it’s not something I comment on or criticize.

I’ve had people threatening to kill me and kill my family, wishing that I get cancer and die a slow, painful death. Horrible words I couldn’t even think up in my head, to be that mean.”</p> \n<p>She said on Wednesday: “I think those people, they’ve got no life. They’re just kind of cowards thinking they can say whatever they want on the internet. They don’t understand that we’re just people at the end of the day.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think they’d appreciate people saying that stuff to them. But what can you do? I don’t think you’re going to be able to stop it.”</p> \n<p>She told reporters she continues to post on her own accounts, saying: “I think some people get sick of me posting pictures. But I like it so I’m going to keep doing it.”</p> \n<p>Her 6-4 6-2 win puts Watson into the third round where she has the daunting task of facing Serena Williams, and means she will take home at least &pound;77,000 from this year’s championships. This is the second time Watson has played in the third round at Wimbledon, having previously reached this stage in 2012.</p> \n<p>Watson, who was supported on court by her parents, grandmother and a childhood friend from Guernsey, as well as the sports presenter Colin Murray, beamed as she revealed she had recently bought her first property close to the All England Club, which had been “a big goal of mine for a long, long time”.</p> \n<p>She was surprised, she said, by the temperature on court. “It was very warm. But I’m not complaining. It’s nice weather for Wimbledon.”</p> \n<p>Asked to describe her emotions at the moment she defeated Hantuchova, she said:“I was very happy. I wanted to smile, but my mouth was so dry, I couldn’t even open my mouth.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/c015a040f274d47038ec3a2cf81be9ca24315eb0/0_365_4048_2429/4048.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2429,"width":4048,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ella Ling/BPI/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Heather Watson celebrates","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ella Ling/BPI/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-01T19:07:29Z","lastModified":"2015-07-01T23:39:22Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Esther Addley","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/estheraddley"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Heather Watson","Sport","Tennis","Wimbledon 2015","Wimbledon","Social media"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/heather-watson","webTitle":"Heather Watson"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"media/social-media","webTitle":"Social media"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Esther Addley","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/estheraddley"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/01/heather-watson-defiantly-slams-cowardly-social-media-abuse","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aaez","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/01/heather-watson-defiantly-slams-cowardly-social-media-abuse","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/01/heather-watson-defiantly-slams-cowardly-social-media-abuse"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/ce32cbed4f335643df4c99f030d25f4a574080bd/0_0_4828_2899/4828.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2899,"width":4828,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Heather Watson celebrates during the second set of her victory on Court One.

In the five weeks since Bayliss was appointed by England’s director of cricket, Andrew Strauss, the void has been filled by the ringing endorsements of those players who have worked under the 52-year-old Australian.</p> \n<p>Eoin Morgan, Mahela Jayawardene, Brendon McCullum and Brad Haddin – disciples of his regimes at Kolkata Knight Riders, Sri Lanka and New South Wales – have talked up his ability to empower cricketers by keeping their dressing room calm and delivering concise, considered messages without ever going down the route of hyperbole, or, as Morgan put it, “bullshit”.</p> \n<p>“I keep things simple. At the top level it’s about creating a good environment,” Bayliss continued. “If you’ve got a good, honest, hard-working environment where players enjoy what they’re doing, it allows them to go out with less pressure and show off the skills they’ve got.”</p> \n<p>These words could have been delivered by Paul Farbrace, who is reunited with Bayliss six years after their time together in the Sri Lanka set-up and who seemingly began the unshackling of England’s cricketers while they awaited the permanent replacement to Peter Moores. “He will be my eyes and ears early on while I get to know the system and the players,” said Bayliss, who admitted his old friend played a part in convincing him to up sticks from Sydney and start a new life in the mother country. “He is a good coach as well. I’m very lucky to have him.”</p> \n<p>The pair have been through more than just cricket together, of course, having both been on the team bus that was attacked by terrorists in Lahore in 2009 and saw six policemen and two civilians killed.</p> \n<p>“I certainly remember when the bombs and the bullets were flying around,” he said, while demonstrating he was just a matter of inches from being struck. “There was nothing you could do except keep your head down and your arse up.”</p> \n<p>Bayliss admits that ordeal, along with the tragic death of the batsman Phillip Hughes last November when playing for South Australia against his New South Wales side, has shaped his outlook on life and keeps the cricket fully in perspective.</p> \n<p>Having left his dual roles in Australia and Kolkata following a &pound;400,000-a-year offer from Strauss – an approach he neither courted nor expected having agreed contract extensions at both – Bayliss will not be joined by his wife and two children for at least 12 months because of his 17-year-old daughter’s final year at school.</p> \n<p>Now, with a working visa secured, the former first-class batsman can familiarise himself with their new home and continue passing on a message of self-determination to his players that began during their four-day training camp in Spain over the weekend.</p> \n<p>“One of my philosophies is that the best coaches are the other 10 players in the team,” he said. “The younger players look up to those older players and learn from them. If you’re watching the right things, listening to those players, asking the right questions, you will learn more about the game actually competing than you will from any coach.”</p> \n<p>Whether this player-led approach, the green shoots of which were evident against New Zealand, can bring about an Ashes victory this summer remains to be seen, with just seven days now until the first Test in Cardiff. Much has been made of his inside knowledge of Michael Clarke’s tourists, with nine of his former charges in their 17-man touring party. Yet again, it comes down those who take the field.</p> \n<p>“There are enough guys in the England team with enough experience and who have played these guys plenty of times before,” Bayliss said.</p> \n<p>How will he feel when the national anthems blare out at the Swalec Stadium just as the sledging-heavy pre-series hype turns into actual bat on ball action? “I am old enough that in the first seven or eight years I was at school I sang God Save the Queen so I know most of the words and probably more than I do of our own at the moment,” he joked.</p> \n<p>While Bayliss has worked with the one-day captain, Morgan, at Kolkata, his relationship with Test equivalent Alastair Cook is just days old. Asked if he rated his new ally’s abilities as a leader, he replied: “I’ve not seen him up close or worked with him before. What I will say is that it is a lot easier from the captain’s point of view if the team are playing a good, positive brand of cricket.”</p> \n<p>And the overall objective? “Like any other team worth their salt we want to be No1 in Test matches, ODIs and T20s. If you haven’t got those aspirations I&nbsp;think you’re kidding yourself.”</p> \n<p>With a CV that includes two Sheffield Shields, two IPL titles, winning the Big Bash League at Sydney Sixers and two ICC limited-overs finals with Sri Lanka, success has followed everywhere Bayliss has worked. To make that hot streak to continue, England’s players will be told to stand on their own two feet. There will be no spoon-feeding.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/afef8040b4ef02acda0797bb07410ab52339737e/0_173_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images","altText":"Trevor Bayliss Press Conference & England Ashes Squad Announcement<br>LONDON, ENGLAND - JULY 01:  New England Coach Trevor Bayliss gives TV interviews during a Press Conference at Lord's Cricket Ground on July 1, 2015 in London, England.

Going back to their karting days, Rosberg has been in pursuit of his faster rival, struggling to keep up with the man who is now his Mercedes team-mate. The British driver was again quicker last season, but the dogged Rosberg took the Formula One world championship into the very last race in Abu Dhabi.</p> \n<p>This season Hamilton’s early pace has been brutal, carrying him to seven pole wins in eight races; Rosberg has come back to win three of the past four races and going into Sunday’s British Grand Prix at Silverstone, he is only 10 points behind in this two-hander of a championship production; the other drivers are extras. The title race could once again go to the wire and if Rosberg prevails it would represent a high-speed reworking of Aesop’s The Tortoise and the Hare.</p> \n<p>“I never, ever give up,” says Rosberg, smiling grimly. “I just keep pushing, keep believing. Of course there are doubts. That is normal. I just push through them, put them aside and overcome them with self-confidence.”</p> \n<p>But it has to be asked if the tenacious Rosberg will maintain his challenge. The German, who was 30 on Saturday, and owns luxury homes in Monaco and Ibiza, is expecting a baby girl next month with his wife, Vivian. Won’t he find fatherhood a distraction? Nappies and babies’ dummies are hardly de rigueur in the uber-selfish and masculine world of Formula One.</p> \n<p>“Oh, I don’t know. There are fathers in Formula One. Kimi Raikkonen, Felipe Massa, Sebastian Vettel, Romain Grosjean …” The fact that none of these drivers will be world champion this year rather leaves the point suspended in midair, but Rosberg continues: “The fact is, I&nbsp;have no idea. I really don’t know.</p> \n<p>“There are so many different possibilities, how it can impact on my life. Let’s see how it goes. I will tell you in a few months. But I’m sure it can also make you a better racing driver, just because you see that winning races is not the most important thing and that you get more easy going, which is never a bad thing. So it really depends. But I look forward to it a lot. This is really very exciting for me.”</p> \n<p>And yet Rosberg has only got where he is through the ferocity of his will, by making his driving the most important thing in his life. He concedes: “ I also know that focus is extremely important. I notice that if I have a bit too much going on, left and right, it can influence my race driving performance. You have to be 100% present when you are doing it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c426567bb928f54001b6e364d66450b6c27eb264\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435755447905/d57f7a28-377c-4dfe-b9a2-c9e11c022c55-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rosberg and Hamilton\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton at the World Karting Championships in 2001.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sutton Images/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In this season of strawberries and cream it is possible to view Rosberg as the Andy Murray of Formula One. He is one of the leading drivers in the world but it is his considerable misfortune to be up against three of the true greats of his sport: think Hamilton, Vettel and Fernando Alonso rather than Nadal, Djokovic and Federer. “That’s not really a criticism, is it?” he asks. “I just need to raise my game a little bit to make it happen. Just like Andy Murray, right? I just have to move up one notch. It’s just up to me to do better.</p> \n<p>“I don’t feel unlucky that Lewis is my team-mate. It’s an awesome challenge. That’s why I race. And I know that if I do a good weekend at Silverstone I can beat him. I just need to make that happen, like in Barcelona and Austria.”</p> \n<p>He is renowned for his work ethic. No one is more sedulous when it comes to preparation with the simulator and he talks late into the night with his mechanics and engineers every race weekend. “Maybe it is the German in me,” he says. I smile. He doesn’t smile back.</p> \n<p>He has spent nine of his 10 years in F1 with the same engineer, Tony Ross. “Continuity is important to me. I have been many, many years with my wife now, 12 years. It’s incredible. I can’t remember not being with her.”</p> \n<p>A relaxed Rosberg is talking in the Mercedes motor home in Spielberg, Austria. He granted an exclusive interview with the Guardian for a reason. “The Guardian is my favourite newspaper,” he says. “I always buy it when I am in England.”</p> \n<p>He is, arguably, the most intelligent of the drivers. He speaks five languages: German, English, French, Italian and (a little less fluently) Spanish. He reads the business pages of newspapers with the forensic care of the investor he is.</p> \n<p>When he joined Williams and had to take their mandatory engineering aptitude test, he scored the highest marks in the team’s history. “I’m very interested in engineering. I was going to study aeronautics in London,” he says.</p> \n<p>While Hamilton famously wears his heart on his sleeve, the assiduous Rosberg is likely to tell you that he carries his behind his sternum and just to the left of his midsagittal plane. “Everything relates to physics and maths,” he says.</p> \n<p>Indeed, Bernie Ecclestone, F1’s chief executive who will be 85 in three months, is a mean backgammon player and regularly beats Vettel. “Bernie has never beaten me. I have a straight record with him,” Rosberg reveals.</p> \n<p>Earlier this season Ecclestone told him: “You’re not good for my business.” But Rosberg says: “I took that with a pinch of salt. He was comparing me with Lewis. Bernie is the commercial-rights holder, so what he wants is the drivers to be out there in the public eye. Because that promotes the sport. That’s what Lewis does more than me.”</p> \n<p>But unlike Vettel, who has little time for social media, Rosberg is very involved with his supporters, and is the teller of teasing, funny jokes. “I do think about my sport, and give back with social media. It’s to engage with the fans and give them some fun. I try to do my part. It’s a pity how much drivers have criticised their own sport.”</p> \n<p>But again like Murray there is a certain introversion which can manifest itself in a passivity of performance, though recent signs of a more aggressive approach have paid off, as in his early overtake of Hamilton in the last race in Austria. He is so unlike his brasher, more extrovert father, Keke, a Finn and the world champion of 1982, when he famously won only one race (actually no driver won more than two). Keke used to enjoy pointing to the sponsors’ names on his overalls and boasting that each patch represented a house. “My dad is always around, supporting all the time. I see him quite a lot, especially privately. I saw him after the last race.”</p> \n<p>Keke, though, prefers to keep in the background. He’s never been personally shy but he is very reserved when it comes to talking about his son.</p> \n<p>Rosberg Jr was only four weeks old when his parents left Wiesbaden in Germany and moved to Monaco, where he has remained ever since – when he’s not travelling the world and spending time in his mansion in Ibiza, with his cats and his labrador.</p> \n<p>There is chess, and tennis and boating, and he loves driving classic cars. “I have a 1970 Pagoda. I love it. I’m really into those old cars. I like reading about them and learning about them. I look at auctions too, though the prices are a bit crazy. But driving them is the best part, going on a cruise with my wife, through the south of France, without any destination. It’s cool.

But, as with Vettel, his countrymen have not embraced him as they did Michael Schumacher. “It’s because Michael was such a giant,” he shrugs, and there was certainly a ruthlessness and mischievousness about Schumacher which gave him so much appeal to the German masses, beyond the winning of seven titles.</p> \n<p>Neither Rosberg nor Vettel will ever have that, even if the former wins the world championship he covets so much. Rosberg and Hamilton, like many great rivals, help define each other, each viewed through the prism of the other. Very slightly, the alter egos have morphed into each other; Hamilton is a more controlled, calculating driver than he was while there are signs of a new aggression about Rosberg. Hamilton has the stronger record, with two championships and 37 wins to Rosberg’s 11. So what can Rosberg do that he just failed to achieve last season?</p> \n<p>“Just become better, even better, I mean, use the extra experience to learn, grow, personally. I had to improve my racing and I have done that, for sure. It is very close now, between the two of us.”</p> \n<p>But will they ever be the close friends they once were, in their cavorting karting days, after heated clashes at Monaco and Spa last year? “Who knows? Maybe after we stop being team-mates. But while we are team-mates it’s difficult because we are fighting each other for race wins. It’s so competitive, such an extreme situation. It makes friendship tough.” And the closer they are on the track, the tougher it becomes.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435756541973/054c10fe-53d3-4354-8b37-641e9a52031b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter J Fox/Peter J Fox","altText":"rosberg","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter J Fox/Peter J Fox"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435755449368/d57f7a28-377c-4dfe-b9a2-c9e11c022c55-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton at the World Karting Championships in 2001.

And we, the drivers, passionately share that view.</p> \n<p>“They want competitive sport, not just a show, and they think that F1’s business has become too important, jeopardising our sport.”</p> \n<p>In a separate statement to fans, published on the GPDA website, Wurz said they did not believe a revolution was required, as Ferrari’s principal, Maurizio Arrivabene, has suggested. Nor did they want “an artificial show with gimmicks introduced to simply make it more entertaining”.</p> \n<p>The results came on the day of a strategy meeting in London, ahead of Sunday’s British Grand Prix, grouping the six top teams as well as the commercial rights holder and governing body. They are considering changes from 2017 to make the cars faster, louder, harder to drive and more aggressive-looking.</p> \n<p>Wurz said the GPDA would examine the data and work with key stakeholders “to put fan feedback at the centre of our sport’s future”.</p> \n<p>The summary revealed fans wanted louder and more powerful engines, more emphasis on driver skill, a return to re-fuelling and competition between tyre makers. They were in favour of relaxing technical regulations and introducing budget caps.</p> \n<p>Worryingly, the top three words used to describe the sport were “expensive”, “technological” and “boring”, in that order. Respondents had an average age of 37, and three quarters had followed Formula One for more than 10 years. Kimi Raikkonen was the favourite driver and Ferrari the top team.</p> \n<p>77% felt business interests had become too important and 89% said F1 needed to be more competitive. In contrast, only 32% said F1 needed to promote increasing fuel efficiency and just 14% said it would be better served by fewer teams running more cars.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/ec92b27a94dc1b96dd40c30931456680e6656441/0_304_4928_2958/4928.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2958,"width":4928,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sutton Images/Corbis","altText":"Austrian Grand Prix Race<br>21 Jun 2015, Spielberg, Austria --- Fans and atmosphere at Formula One World Championship, Rd8, Austrian Grand Prix, Race, Spielberg, Austria, Sunday 21 June 2015. --- Image by © Sutton Images/Corbis","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sutton Images/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-01T21:38:45Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T00:05:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Formula One 2015","Motor sport","Formula One","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/formula-one-2015","webTitle":"Formula One 2015"},{"id":"sport/motorsports","webTitle":"Motor sport"},{"id":"sport/formulaone","webTitle":"Formula One"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/01/f1-fans-sport-boring-expensive","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aah4","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/01/f1-fans-sport-boring-expensive","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/01/f1-fans-sport-boring-expensive"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/ec92b27a94dc1b96dd40c30931456680e6656441/0_304_4928_2958/4928.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2958,"width":4928,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Attendances at the Austrian F1 Grand Prix were well down on 2014.

He would not be drawn into criticising other players but told a story from his teenage days in Spain that shines an interesting light on a serious subject.</p> \n<p>“I wouldn’t want to speak about other players because I don’t know,” he said, “but when I was a junior, one of the coaches Pato [&Aacute;lvarez] that I used to work with used to do signals to a lot of his players.</p> \n<p>“I was playing a futures tournament when I was about 16 out in Spain. I won the match but it was close, not a very good match. And he went: ‘Andy, what are you doing? You never listen to me when you are on the court.’</p> \n<p>“I said: ‘What do you mean?’ He said: ‘I was telling you to serve and volley and you weren’t doing it.’ I was, like: ‘You never told me what the signals were.’</p> \n<p>“He was there at the back of the court telling me what to do and I didn’t know. He is the only coach that I have ever worked with [to do that]. Since I have been on the tour none of the coaches I have been with have ever given me any hand signals, or anything like that.</p> \n<p>“Ivan Lendl didn’t say a word, really, when I was playing matches and, no, I have not had that since I have been on the tour. I don’t think I have ever had a coaching warning. It’s possible but I don’t think so.”</p> \n<p>He might not need anything more than encouragement against Haase, whom he has beaten three times out of four, but he will hardly disregard the danger posed by a player who has taken a set off him in each of their two US Open matches.</p> \n<p>“I was cramping after an hour and 15 minutes [when they last played there, in the first round last year]. Idon’t know how I managed to come through that match, to be honest. The time when I played him before in New York [in 2011], he was coming in to it having played very&nbsp;well.”</p> \n<p>Murray and Haase have slightly differing recollections of their history, the Dutchman saying he never played him as a junior, while the Scot does remember him being around at that time of their development.</p> \n<p>“He is someone I grew up with, in juniors and stuff like that. He likes playing on the big courts as well. He goes for it, which makes things tough. I don’t know him unbelievably well. He is quiet off the court, but on it he is quite loud and open and emotional. So it should be a fun match.”</p> \n<p>Murray says he has been turning to the snooker table to relax between matches, alongside Ross Hutchins and the Delgado brothers, a habit he picked up during his spells of rehab after injury, when he would play his Davis Cup captain, Leon Smith, in Glasgow. “We get pumped to play,” he says of his time on the tables at the All England Club. “None of us is any good but it is a fun way to spend time with friends.”</p> \n<p>Aljaz Bedene and James Ward, meanwhile, have the incentive of moving closer to an all-British fourth tie – if they can beat Viktor Troicki and Jiri Vesely, respectively. The newest Brit, Bedene, has the tougher task, up against the Queen’s semi-finalist who gave Murray a good argument. He revealed he had a brief phone conversation with his mother after beating Radek Stepanek in the first round.</p> \n<p>“She was really happy and proud,” said Bedene, who was born in the old Yugoslavia before Ljubljana became the capital of independent Slovenia and was granted British citizenship in April. “But she cut the call short because she said I probably had a lot of work to do now. It was only five seconds, but they were really happy. They are on holiday – I think they followed it on the internet.”</p> \n<p>Bedene, whose partner is the singer Kimalie, says he is being recognised more often in public lately – hopefully because of his tennis. “I was talking to Kimalie – who has been working with Jeff Wayne and they will probably be releasing a song or two this year – and she said: ‘Definitely next year it will be different for us,’ and I agree. I still don’t want to be too well-known. I want to be able to enjoy my personal life – but if it happens, you cannot do anything about it.”</p> \n<p>Ward’s might be the more straightforward task against the lively young Czech left-hander Vesely, although he invariably views every match as a struggle – even his win over lucky loser Luca Vanni after the withdrawal through injury of David Ferrer.</p> \n<p>But the Londoner did take heart from the presence of three other British players in the second round for the first time in 10 years.</p> \n<p>“I think everyone’s picked their game up, playing well coming into the tournament,” he said. “Everyone’s ranking is improving. It’s good to have a few more guys playing well and winning matches. You just keep knocking at the door.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435785739348/Wimbledon-day-two-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray revealed his former coach Ivan Lendl 'didn’t say a word, really, when I was playing matches'.
