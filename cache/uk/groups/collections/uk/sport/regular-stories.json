I think he must relax and try to do something good.”</p> \n<p>Indeed he must, probably over five sets, and their respective and mutual histories do not suggest that is likely. They are worlds apart in achievement, money and prospects, with Murray, the world No3, many people’s favourite to win his second Wimbledon title, and Kukushkin, ranked at 59, probably grateful to be picking up &pound;29,000 as his first-round cheque.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/liam-broad-wimbledon-first-round-win-friends-floors\">Liam Broady hopes Wimbledon win will get him off friends’ floors</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Murray has won their only two encounters fairly easily. However, where Kukushkin and Murray have common ground is more obvious: both are coached by women, as is Denis Istomin (uniquely tutored by his mother, Klaudiya), who is on their side of the draw. It is a trio unique in the ATP top 100, rarely in the whole of the game.</p> \n<p>Anastasia played until she was 16 and was a coach at the famous Moscow club, Spartak. “She was working there for a couple of years,” Kukushkin says. “When we met and she started to help me, then she start to go full-time with me. She had to quit [the club] because there was not time enough for that.”</p> \n<p>While Murray has been hailed as a pioneer for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/28/amelie-mauresmo-coach-who-made-andy-murray-mint-again\">hiring Am&eacute;lie Mauresmo</a> a year ago to succeed Ivan Lendl and lauded as a feminist for his stalwart defence of her, as well as the protective sentiments he has expressed as she approaches the delivery of her first child in August, the Kazakh of Russian origin has been allowed to tour with his wife without much fuss.</p> \n<p>His ranking probably explains why – although he is a clever player with a fine tennis brain. And he does not lack for ambition.</p> \n<p>“To get a draw with Andy Murray at his home, one of his favourite tournaments, it’s tough for sure,” he says. “But it’s one of the challenges that I met a lot in my career. I played twice here in the Centre Court against Roger [Federer] and Rafa [Nadal]. I won one set last year against Rafa – I play good in the first set and after that … not really.”</p> \n<p>Murray beat him in Brisbane then Melbourne two years ago but Kukushkin says: “It is different to the Australian Open. It was fourth round, I played already a couple of matches before so it felt inside the tournament. Now it’s the first round, just preparing, waiting for your match. It’s a bit different but I’m not that nervous.”</p> \n<p>For Anastasia, it has not always been an anxiety-free experience, watching her husband play, week in week out, often on outside courts away from the glamour and noise of the Tour.</p> \n<p>“But I’m not so nervous, like three or four years ago,” she says. “Now I’m just relaxing and try to give him some more …power?” She laughs again.</p> \n<p>“Confidence,” he smiles.</p> \n<p>Kukushkin is not surprised there are few women coaching men on the Tour. “All of us [Murray, Istomin and himself], we are happy with it but I believe most other tennis players, they don’t support it. A lot of people around tennis, they think that it’s not good.”</p> \n<p>“Not professional,” offers Anastasia. They have what she calls, “sceptic vision”. She adds: “In my opinion it doesn’t matter with whom you are coaching. If you have a result, it doesn’t matter if it is a female or a male.”</p> \n<p>There is a level of irritation emerging, although Mr and Mrs K are impeccably polite. Still, Anastasia does not like the fact she is not allowed near the locker room – as well as other manifestations of exclusion. “I don’t have access,” she says. “Maybe I can go in but not everywhere.”</p> \n<p>Kukushkin reveals his wife has even had trouble getting accreditation as a coach, as tournament organisers regard her as just his girlfriend. “There are always problems.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/lleyton-hewitt-bids-farewell-to-wimbledon-after-nieminen-loss\">Lleyton Hewitt bids farewell to Wimbledon after Nieminen loss</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He explains also why he switched his allegiance from Russia to Kazakhstan in 2008. “As I remember, I was about 150 in the rankings and everyone, all the coaches, thought I could be a top-100 player but there were a lot of good Russian players [ahead of him] back then.</p> \n<p>“I knew I had to do something to break through. The Kazakhstan federation came to me with good support, the kind of support which I believe is important to every player. I think it was a good decision to move to Kazakhstan and I have lived there seven years. I have had good results in the Davis Cup as well as my own good results on the tour. I believe it has helped me a lot – to become a better player.”</p> \n<p>Kukushkin regards himself – as do many players – as an “internationalist”. “I feel more international,” he says, “because for 51 out of the 52 weeks of the year I travel and stay in hotels. When I have a week out of a tournament [when losing early], now I just go to practise somewhere. If I have time during the off season, I go on holiday, so I am never at home. I don’t feel like I belong to one country.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435602672263/Andy-Murray-with-Am-lie-M-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray shares a light moment with his coach Amélie Mauresmo and trainer Matt Little during practice at Wimbledon.

He said the money would be used to help him continue his quest to climb the rankings and would enable him to do so in greater comfort.</p> \n<p>“That money will go away down a hole somewhere. I’ll keep that one safe. It will just be there, when I need it for the tournaments and for the travel; I know that I’ve got that security, so it’s great. I’ve got some fantastic friends and they’ve been patient with me over the last couple years, sharing beds and stuff. I get my own bed every now and then. But, to be honest, I travel more than anything. That’s what the money’s good for, because I probably spend 35 to 40 weeks on the road. And even then I’m back in Nottingham or at the National Centre [in Roehampton] training, so I spend very little time back at home.”</p> \n<p>Broady hit back superbly to level the match against Matosevic, the world No138 who has been as high as 39, but he looked to be in trouble when he dropped his serve for 0-2 in the fifth. He rallied superbly, though, to win six of the next seven games for the biggest victory of his career. It was the first five-set match played by Broady, a finalist in the boys’ singles here in 2011.</p> \n<p>“It means everything, to be honest,” he said. “To the guys that have supported me up until now, my trainer Ric [Moylan], my coach Mark [Hilton] and my mentor Adrian [Tannock]. I do it as much for myself as I do for those guys. I know how much time they put into it. But personally, it’s my home tournament. I’ve had good success here before. It’s been a long road to finding myself in the main draw of a slam. Couldn’t be happier.</p> \n<p>“I’m not sure how much I believed I could win a round of Wimbledon before today, even going into the match. But I knew that belief didn’t really matter as long as I focused on point by point. I’m hoping that it will sort of push me on and give me a bit more fire to want to get back here.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/andy-murray-mikhail-kukushkin-wimbledon-2015\">Andy Murray faces Mr and Mrs K’s plan A – ‘do something good’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Andy Murray immediately tweeted his support for Broady and the left-hander said the world No3 had been a huge inspiration, helping him believe in his ability and work ethic, even when things got tough. “It’s just good to be around Andy,” he said. “He wants the British players to do well. He really puts his time back into the game, back into the British players. I think to have someone like that is invaluable for British tennis. It’s just fantastic. He doesn’t have to do it but he does it anyway.”</p> \n<p>Broady is estranged from his father, Simon, who disapproved of his son’s return to the Lawn Tennis Association fold a few years ago, but his sister Naomi, who later lost her own first-round match, was in the stands to watch, along with most of the family, and their support, he said, had been imperative in his success. “To be honest, my dad’s not even popped into my head with the result,” Broady admitted. “But it was fantastic to have my sister there and the rest of my family watching. That’s what makes it more special, is being able to share such a moment with so many people I love.”</p> \n<p>His reward will now be a match with David Goffin, the No16 seed from Belgium, a match he cannot wait to play. “Today was massive for me. To have my first ever first-round men’s win at Wimbledon. I feel good about my game now.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435605529786/Liam-Broady-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Liam Broady shows he can control with his feet as well as his racquet against Marinko Matosevic at Wimbledon.

I didn’t feel overwhelmed by the situation, nor did I feel overwhelmed by the player I was playing.”</p> \n<p>Konta was also savvy enough too to deflect a question about whether or not Sharapova’s loud exhortations after striking the ball, which seemed to be louder than ever, had put her off. “I don’t quite hear that on the other side,” she said, not altogether convincingly.</p> \n<p>For Sharapova, whose best performance since she won Wimbledon as a 17-year-old was being the runner-up to Petra Kvitova in 2011, it was the perfect preparation for sterner tests.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/wimbledon-temperatures-heat-rules\">Wimbledon women to get heat breaks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>She may not have been playing competitively but she has been practising on grass for the past fortnight and eventually she saw off her opponent with typically ruthless precision.</p> \n<p>“You can’t get too comfortable no matter what match you’re playing.

The regulation allows females a 10-minute break between the second and third sets of matches played in extreme heat.</p> \n<p>The forecast for Wednesday states temperatures may reach the mid-30s, potentially setting a record at the championships since such information was first formally recorded 10 years ago. The highest temperature was 33C on 27 June 2011.</p> \n<p>If that figure is eclipsed this week, players in the women’s and girls’ competitions will be permitted a break between the second and third set of matches that go the distance. Organisers will take a heat-stress index if the temperature rises above 30.1C and players can then take a break if they request it. The heat rule has never been used at the championships before.</p> \n<p>Andrew Jarrett, the Wimbledon referee, said in a statement: “The heat rule allows a 10-minute break between the second and third set when the heat stress index is at or above 30.1 celsius. It only applies to ladies’ and girls’ singles matches that have not yet been called to court. Only one of the players participating in the match needs to request the break for the rule to be implemented.</p> \n<p>“The heat stress index is a measure which factors together the air temperature, the humidity and the surface temperature, and is measured by a heat stress monitor. The heat stress monitor readings are taken 30 minutes prior to the start of play and then at 14.00hrs and 17.00hrs.</p> \n<p>“If there is a change in weather conditions and the rule is lifted, those matches already in progress will be completed with the rule in place.”</p> \n<p>The heat rule does not allow men to take breaks even if they ask to do so. In addition, the Centre Court roof will not be closed to keep temperatures down, but can be used to shade spectators if necessary.</p> \n<p>The All England Club has already advised spectators to drink plenty of water, wear hats and use sun cream if they are attending. There are 13 drinking-water fountains across the grounds at SW19.</p> \n<p>Temperatures may reach 35C on Wednesdayand the Met Office says there is a slight risk the heat and humidity could trigger late-afternoon and early-evening thunderstorms.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/29/1435603174412/Kirsten-Flipkens-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kirsten Flipkens won in three sets against Annika Beck on Monday.

The world No1 can make yet more history here and with every match the focus on what she could achieve will build. Victory a week on Saturday would give her a sixth Wimbledon title, a 21st grand slam title in all, a second “Serena Slam” of four straight majors and leave her needing “only” to win the US Open this summer to become the sixth person to complete the calendar-year grand slam.</p> \n<p>To deal with the pressure, Williams does a good line in pretending she is not sure what is going on. Not completely – of course she knows what is at stake – but on Monday, after a slightly nervy opening-round win, 6-4, 6-1 over Russia’s Margarita Gasparyan, she gave the impression that she has been hiding away from anything to do with what stands before her in the next two weeks.</p> \n<p>Not only did she say she had not known that Gasparyan was a qualifier, until she was told by an interviewer, the 33-year-old then appeared to have no idea she will meet her sister and five-times champion, Venus, in the last 16, should the seedings pan out. Venus crushed the young American, Madison Brengle 6-0, 6-0.</p> \n<p>Given that they are sharing a house, as always, over the fortnight, it seems unlikely, but it was classic Serena – and who are we to argue with her thought process? “I didn’t know that,” she said, to a number of raised eyebrows. “Well, she’s been really tough. Last time we played, she actually beat me. That’s not going to be an easy match. You know what, I’m going to just focus on right now. You got me?”</p> \n<p>Williams had the grace to smile as she said it but of course she is well aware of what she can achieve. Having fought her way to the French Open title this month, she is two grand slam wins short of Steffi Graf’s total of 22, while Margaret Court’s all-time record of 24, won before and after the open era began, is also within her grasp. She knows about it but does not want to think about it too much.</p> \n<p>“Honestly, I don’t think about it,” she said. “But every time I come into press, you guys talk about it, so naturally it’s definitely getting more on my mind than I want it to be, than what it has been. It’s definitely historic, I guess, but it’s also six matches away. It’s definitely not guaranteed. I’m just going to try to enjoy holding three right now and enjoy that moment.”</p> \n<p>There is, of course, good reason to try to avoid over-egging the subject. In 2002, when she won the French Open, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/wimbledon\" title=\"\">Wimbledon</a> and US Open, she went into Australia chasing the Serena Slam and was very nervous.</p> \n<p>“I remember I almost lost in the first round,” she said. “I remember I had a very intense final against Venus. I don’t remember much in between. Maybe I had a tough semi, I think against Kim [Clijsters]. I don’t remember mentally where I was at this moment, whether I was thinking about getting the Serena Slam. I don’t know; we’ll see.”</p> \n<p>When she trailed the world No113 Gasparyan 3-1 in the first set here, the Serena Slam seemed a long way off as the American’s feet refused to move. Beaten early in the past two years in SW19, there were nerves, something that was clear for everyone to hear when she was warned for swearing in the sixth game. That was the game that got her back on track, though, as she broke to level and then eased through the rest to set up a match against Timea Babos of Hungary.</p> \n<p>The former world No1, Ana Ivanovic, crushed China’s Xu Yifan 6-1, 6-1 but the No9 seed, Carla Su&aacute;rez Navarro, was hammered 6-2, 6-0 by last year’s junior champion Jelena Ostapenko, of Latvia. The former grand slam champions Victoria Azarenka and Sam Stosur advanced while the French Open runner-up, Lucie Safarova, battled through to beat the American, Alison Riske, 3-6, 7-5, 6-3.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435587767948/Serena-Williams--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Serena Williams recovered from being 3-1 down in the first set to convincingly beat qualifier Margarita Gasparyan in the first round at Wimbledon.

For Gillespie, the current head coach of Yorkshire who has enjoyed his fair share of column inches already this summer after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/22/jason-gillespie-ecb-england-dream-coach\" title=\"\">being interviewed for the England job</a>, the explanation is pretty simple.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/darren-lehmann-stuart-broad-steve-smith-australia-england-ashes-cricket\">Australia’s Darren Lehmann brushes off Stuart Broad’s Steve Smith comments</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“It certainly caused a stir, didn’t it? But it was very simple, I was asked the question as to how, if I was in the England camp, would I try to beat Australia,” he says during our time together at Headingley. “Now I saw no glaring weaknesses in the Australian team. Their batting is sound, the seam bowling is quality, the spin is very good but the opposition still need to find a way in. So I looked at the ages and thought England could target that. They have 10 players over 30 years of age, how can England use that to their advantage?</p> \n<p>“So if I was England coach, I’d keep those guys out there for a long time. If Chris Rogers is out there for two days then has 10 minutes to strap on his pads and get his feet moving, could that work to England’s advantage? Brad Haddin is 38 this year, so test his fitness. The same with Michael Clarke, he’s had back problems; test him out and keep him in the field. Ryan Harris, it’s well documented he has a dodgy knee, so why wouldn’t you try to keep that guy on the ground bowling lots of spells? It’s just common sense. So I was asked a question and I’m not the sort of person who dodges them. I didn’t say anything that isn’t true.”</p> \n<p>For all the angry Australians on social media asking him to hand back his passport – one can only presume they remained silent and cross-armed after all 402 of his international wickets as part of <em>that</em> great side – Gillespie is not rowing back on this analysis. It is the same plain speaking that led to the 40-year-old guiding Yorkshire to their <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/sep/12/yorkshire-win-county-championship-nottinghamshire\" title=\"\">first County Championship title in 13 years</a> in 2014 and earned him a shot at the England job in May, before <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/25/trevor-bayliss-england-cricket-head-coach\" title=\"\">eventually missing out</a> to his lesser-known, but more decorated, compatriot Trevor Bayliss. There is no bitterness about the rejection.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The Australian bowlers versus Alastair Cook will be fascinating and could well shape the series</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“It was so humbling to be invited to interview. The England job is one of the biggest in world cricket, so to be spoken about in those circles was something I’ll remember for ever,” he says. “I walked out of our conversations just thinking that, regardless of what happens, England will be in a pretty good place going forward. They have the right people in charge – I spoke to [Andrew] Strauss and the chief executive, Tom Harrison, and both were very impressive. They have a vision and a drive to make it work. I didn’t get the job, ultimately, but I can stick it on my r&eacute;sum&eacute; and the experience stays with me.”</p> \n<p>It leaves Gillespie happily continuing his job at Headingley, which he will combine with a role at Adelaide Strikers in the winter, and with something of a foot in both camps before this summer’s Ashes series, one which he hopes will result in England continuing to ride the wave of positivity witnessed already this summer in one-day cricket. “It was crying out for someone to break the shackles,” he replies when asked for his take on the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/england-new-zealand-fifth-odi-cricket\" title=\"\">recent series win over New Zealand</a>. “It makes you wonder what prevented them from doing that before. You can mull it over but the reality now is there is an air of freedom with how they are playing and, as a cricket fan, I want to see that. And, of course, I expect Australia to match that and we get a great series.”</p> \n<p>Having been taken to the hearts of cricket supporters in Yorkshire – both during his two seasons as overseas professional until 2007 and his three and a half as coach – Gillespie takes enormous pride at seeing his players represent England. Mention Joe Root, Gary Ballance, Adam Lyth, Liam Plunkett or Adil Rashid and his face lights up instantly. Equally, however, those 10 years wearing the Baggy Green for Australia mean he is not the naturalised pom some are calling him back home; inquire as to how Australia can win their first Ashes series on English soil in 14 years and you get similarly forthright replies.</p> \n<p>“The Australian bowlers versus Alastair Cook will be fascinating and could well shape the series,” he says. “They have implemented a gameplan to him in the past and I don’t see that changing. You will hardly see him play a cut or pull, or nudge one away off his hips, because Australia will be ruthless in their line to him – just on off-stump or outside. They know that if they get something off the pitch or through the air they will ask questions of his technique and if he’s not spot-on with movements he will be found out. Cook should go into the series with a positive outlook as he’s scored Ashes runs in the past but Australia will believe they have the wood over him.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5047893c78d444aba1203d795bcc764c9fffd5d\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c5047893c78d444aba1203d795bcc764c9fffd5d/0_0_2359_3000/786.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Gillespie, left, has known the Australia coach, Darren Lehmann, since their South Australia days\" width=\"786\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Gillespie, left, has known the Australia coach, Darren Lehmann, since their South Australia days.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Lewis/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While a former fast bowler himself – he grins when proclaiming Mitchell Johnson “has a mental edge” over the home side following his 37-wicket Ashes series in 2013-14 – it is the subject of England and spin bowling that gets Gillespie really fired up. Cook’s side remain, in his opinion, too timid in how they play the turning ball and their own selection in that department. For the first time since Warne retired in 2007, Australia have the edge, with Nathan Lyon 30 matches deeper into his Test career.</p> \n<p>“Lyon will play a big role for Australia and that is somewhere where England simply have to be proactive – they cannot let him settle,” he says. “That’s where England missed a massive trick in the Test series against New Zealand; they let Mark Craig bowl and go at 1.8 runs an over in the first innings at Headingley and it played a big part in why they lost. That’s just unacceptable batting. There is not an off-spinner in world cricket who should go at under two runs an over, so they cannot let Lyon settle into a groove. They need to put pressure back on him. You can be sure as hell that Australia will do that to Moeen Ali. They will go hard and make Cook go back to Jimmy Anderson, Stuart Broad, Mark Wood, Ben Stokes and get them bowling lots of spells.”</p> \n<p>Should the leg-spinner Rashid, who took 46 wickets in Yorkshire’s title win last summer, therefore get the nod instead? “Yes. And the reason I would look to push for Rashid – and forget the county allegiance – is that you have Root and Lyth who can bowl off-spin. Why wouldn’t you have a spinner who turns it both ways? Is that harsh on Moeen Ali? It probably is and if he was top six you could look at it differently but the fact is he’s at No8, and what is best for the side would be to have a leg-spinner to complement the four quicks and the two lads who can bowl decent off-breaks. But I just can’t see England going down that path.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Jimmy Anderson is a person who winds Australia up like no one else I have seen in cricket</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite></cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Gillespie, of course, played with Warne, the greatest leg-spinner to draw breath as part of that fabled attack in which the now Yorkshire coach shared the new ball with Glenn McGrath for 58 of his 71 Tests – with support from one of Brett Lee, Andy Bichel, Damien Fleming or Michael Kasprowicz – and was part of three Ashes-winning teams, starting in England in 1997.</p> \n<p>“When you have those sorts of bowlers at the other end you know you are part of something special,” he says when recalling the glory years. “Warnie and Glenn both attacked and defended at the same time, so I think opposition saw me as an opportunity to score runs and be a little bit looser against me. I always liked that because it was an opportunity to take wickets. There was no doubt bowling at the opposite end to those guys allowed me to do my thing.”</p> \n<p>Were the team that won a record 16 consecutive Test matches under Steve Waugh the greatest of all time? “It’s hard to compare eras, it opens a can of worms. But we would have been highly competitive in any era – and I’ll leave it at that‚” he replies diplomatically, before adding with a glint in the eye. “You can’t compare us to the great Yorkshire side of the 1960s, of course.”</p> \n<p>Gillespie became the first Australian Test cricketer of indigenous heritage when he made his debut against West Indies in Sydney in 1996 aged 21 – a fact that did not garner public attention until four years later – and believed he was always destined to wear the Baggy Green cap, having been given his first cricket bat aged six by his late father, Neil, himself a prominent activist for aboriginal legal rights.</p> \n<p>“My dad was a wonderful man. His nickname was ‘Have a chat’. He was so talkative he could probably talk underwater with a mouthful of marbles. He taught me how to bat and always told me to play straight and watch the ball. He never got involved beyond my early years though; he handed me over to the coaches. Ever since I can remember I knew we were of indigenous heritage. It was just what we were. We were proud of it but I wasn’t one to sing from the rooftops and beat my chest. I had no idea I was the first and it wasn’t until years after my debut the media cottoned on. Maybe it was naivety but I was sure there would have been lots before me; we’re all Australians after all.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/ashes-2015-four-key-australia-players-steve-smith-mitchell-starc-adam-voges-josh-hazlewood-england\">Ashes 2015: Four key Australia players for England to contend with</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I saw my Baggy Green cap as a symbol of my journey as a player.

Johnson, whose express left-arm pace claimed 37 wickets in the 2013-14 series, is the latest to offer his thoughts ahead of the first Test in Cardiff on 8 July, citing all-rounder Ben Stokes as the sole Englishman <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/dec/17/ashes-2013-14-ben-stokes-england\">to show fight</a> during the 5-0 whitewash in Australia 18 months ago.</p> \n<p>Stokes, was one of the few positives for England from that doomed tour but has only this year nailed down his spot in the drawn series with West Indies and New Zealand. Those performances - including an 85-ball century at Lord’s last month - have caught the eye of Johnson, with the 33-year-old admitting the Durham all-rounder, with whom he enjoyed a running battle during the last Ashes, is the type of cricketer his side relish coming up against.</p> \n<p>“We like someone who has got a bit of guts and determination,” said Johnson. “We spoke about Stokes throughout that series, that he was probably the only guy that really fought and it showed. He stirred up a few of the West Indians recently too. That is what I love about cricket, having a bit of fire in the game. That is what people want to see in Test cricket.”</p> \n<p>The spirit in which Ashes cricket is played has become a talking point in the lead-up to the 2015 series, with the England fast bowler Jimmy Anderson admitting there is a will on England’s part to continue the feelgood spirit witnessed against the early summer tourists New Zealand. Johnson, however, scoffed at the suggestion.</p> \n<p>“That is interesting coming from him because he is probably one of the biggest ones in the England team,” said Johnson, who admitted this summer could be his last Ashes series.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think anything is going to change. I think he is just trying to get it out there to make himself look better.” Asked if England are a side who struggle against extreme pace, Johnson replied: “It seemed to trouble them in Australia. But they play well on their wickets and in their conditions.</p> \n<p>“I’ve seen that Joe Root has been playing well. They have got some new guys up at the top and Alastair Cook has scored a few runs recently. They seem to be going all right at the moment.</p> \n<p>“We have got some fast bowlers in our team, there is no doubt about that. Mitchell Starc can bowl at 150kph and swing the ball, and he is much improved in the Test format as well. We have got a lot of pace behind us but whether that is going to count in these conditions we don’t know yet.”</p> \n<p>Among the more curious head-to-heads this summer could be England’s fast bowler Mark Wood and the Australia all-rounder Shane Watson.</p> \n<p>Their only previous encounter came in the nets at Chester-le-Street during the 2009 Ashes tour. Wood, then 18, was instructed to bowl bouncers by Watson’s team-mate Mike Hussey, much to the annoyance of the all-rounder.</p> \n<p>“[Watson] called me a ‘net hero’ and said he would like to have a go at me,” Wood told the BBC Radio 5 live in an interview broadcast on Monday night. “Well, he’s going to get his chance. Let’s hope he remembers me, because he’s going to get a few more bumpers.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/yorkshire-durham-county-championship-division-one-match-report\">Jonny Bairstow and Tim Bresnan share record stand for Yorkshire at Durham</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The incident was lost on Watson, however, even if the 34-year-old, who is vying with Mitchell Marsh for the No6 spot in Michael Clarke’s side, welcomes such pre-series bravado.</p> \n<p>“[Wood] obviously seems like he has got a lot of confidence. He’s very sure about himself by coming out and talking about this sort of stuff,” said Watson.</p> \n<p>“That is a great thing. It means he is going to be up for the challenge.

The BBC will have the chance to sub-licence some of the rights. We’ll open up those discussions in every market,” he said.</p> \n<p>“We want to give them the opportunity to sub-licence. In some markets we will run free to air, pay TV and all devices and in others we’ll partner with others.”</p> \n<p>But even if the BBC is ultimately able to sub-licence some of the rights, it will no longer be able to market itself as the home of the Olympics across all platforms.</p> \n<p>The BBC’s sports portfolio has come under unprecedented pressure in recent years as pay TV broadcasters have tussled over rights. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/feb/03/sky-sports-buys-open-championship-golf-bbc\">The Open golf was the latest event to move to Sky</a> and it is also expected to face a fight to hang on to the rights to rugby’s Six Nations.</p> \n<p>Under the complex deal Discovery, which owns Eurosport, has dramatically seized the rights to both the summer and winter Olympics across Europe, excluding Russia, from 2018 onwards.</p> \n<p>But in the UK and France deals had already been signed for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and the 2020 summer Games in Tokyo, with the BBC retaining the rights to those two Games following its triumphant coverage of London 2012.</p> \n<p>Unless existing legislation changes, Discovery will still have to broadcast the entire winter and summer Games free to air. Zaslav said it would come to different arrangements in different markets across the European territories covered by the deal.</p> \n<p>“We understand the great legacy of Olympic programming across Europe and we have great respect for the quality of content produced by the BBC, by French TV and German TV,” he said. “Now we have the exclusive rights to the Olympics on every platform, we’ll begin discussions with all the different players in every market.”</p> \n<p>For many years, the IOC has signed deals with a consortium of public broadcasters throughout Europe but more recently has started to examine the possibility of working with pay TV groups, as long as they guaranteed to show at least 200 hours of the summer Olympics and 100 hours of the winter Games free to air.</p> \n<p>In 2012, the Guardian revealed that the then IOC president Jacques Rogge was considering just such a deal in the UK but the BBC managed to retain the rights to the 2018 and 2020 Games.</p> \n<p>Last year, the IOC signed a $7.5bn broadcasting deal in the US with NBC that runs until 2032. The deal, signed by the IOC president, Thomas Bach, without a bidding process, will help underwrite his ambitious plans for an IOC television channel between Games.</p> \n<p>“This agreement ensures comprehensive coverage of the Olympic Games across Europe, including the guarantee to provide extensive free-to-air television coverage in all territories,” said Bach, who took over from Rogge in 2013.</p> \n<p>“Discovery and Eurosport have demonstrated a major commitment to the Olympic Games, to Olympic sports and to the future of the Olympic Movement.”</p> \n<p>As part of the deal, Discovery will help develop the new Olympic channel. Zaslav said it was a “historic day”.</p> \n<p>“With Eurosport’s proud and long-standing tradition of broadcasting many winter and summer sports showcased during the Olympics, adding the Olympic Games, the greatest live event in the world, is a perfect editorial and strategic fit,” he said.</p> \n<p>“But most of all, this new partnership is an exciting win for European sports fans as we will deliver record amounts of content across platforms to ensure the Olympic flame burns bright all year long.”</p> \n<p>The Olympics currently remains on the government’s list of events protected for free-to-air television. The list was last officially reviewed in 2009 but no changes were eventually made after the coalition government came to power in 2010.</p> \n<p>The then sports minister Hugh Robertson said the list would be reviewed again when the digital switchover was complete but there is little mood at present to revisit the issue.</p> \n<p>Discovery bought Eurosport last year and has ambitious plans for the pan-European broadcaster. It seriously considered bidding for the live UK Premier League rights that ended up costing Sky and BT Sport &pound;5.1bn between them and has been linked with several other major sports rights.</p> \n<p>Zaslav said it would work with the IOC to promote Olympic sports between Games, both on Eurosport and the mooted new Olympic television channel.</p> \n<p>“There is no more unique property anywhere on the globe. It’s live, it’s must have, it has universal appeal from male to female,” said Zaslav.</p> \n<p>“With the change with the way content is being consumed, live programming where people can come together and watch – this is a two-and-a-half week Superbowl across Europe. It’s very unique and a great opportunity to get the most compelling programming to our viewers.”</p> \n<p>Timo Lumme, the managing director of the IOC’s television and marketing services, said the deal with Discovery gave it a “partnership made in heaven” as it developed plans for a new channel that would promote Olympic sport between Games. “We would hope the outcome will be some sort of Olympic channel contract where people can connect 365 days a year, 24 hours a day,” he said.</p> \n<p>The BBC’s director of sport, Barbara Slater, recently warned that cutting the licence fee could lead to the BBC no longer being able to compete for major sporting events.</p> \n<p>“Having had for a number of years now [the same] flat licence fee, which has resulted in smaller budget for individual divisions such as sport, there is going to come a tipping point at which the BBC does need investment if it is going to continue to compete for, I think, events that people really treasure on the BBC, like the Olympics and some of the major championships,” she said.</p> \n<p>“And, of course, we’re exploring a multitude of different solutions to that, including sharing with other broadcasters etc. And there is still a very, very significant investment that we’re currently making.</p> \n<p>“But to see that on a significantly downward trajectory, I think, would be enormously damaging to the ecology of sports broadcasting.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e5ea82728bf77d970ec0d1899698be45a4e39a90/585_102_3579_2148/3579.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2148,"width":3579,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Todd Antony/BBC","altText":"Clare Balding was a popular host of the BBC’s swimming coverage at the London 2012 Olympics but the broadcaster has now lost control of the rights form 2022 onwards.

That’s why we could deliver 24 live HD channels, 3D, a fantastic online service and the range of mobile and social media applications that lived up to the promise: you’ll never miss a moment.</p> \n<p>Despite the bad news, all is not lost for the BBC. </p> \n<p>Discovery will probably sub-license some of their rights, and the fact that the Olympics are a listed event will mean the key action is still available to all. But the BBC’s relationship with the Games, which goes back almost to the founding of the corporation, will inevitably be less rich. That is a shame for audiences, though my friends at the BBC are saying that they will still try to maintain the Olympic link as best they can. We must trust that the International Olympic Committee recognises just how much they owe to the BBC’s commitment over so many decades..</p> \n<p>This outcome is not, I think, just a function of the size of the licence fee. The fact is that public service broadcasters the world over are losing key rights to the soaraway inflation caused by pay TV. It is impossible to imagine that the BBC could ever be in the market again for something like live Premier League, which comes in at over &pound;10m per match.<br /></p> \n<p>I was never a fan of efforts to cap the percentage of the licence fee spent on sport; in the end it has to be a management judgement about editorial and strategic priorities within an annual budget of &pound;3.7bn.</p> \n<p>However, the corporation needs to fight as hard for its reputation in sport as it is currently doing in music and the arts. I sometimes found the BBC Trust less sympathetic to sport than they should have been, given its manifest value to viewers and listeners.</p> \n<p>Most important of all, though, is that politicians should not waver in their commitment to listed events. The biggest sporting moments should be available to everyone in the UK, irrespective of their financial means. </p> \n<p>Imagine London 2012 behind a paywall, with the triumphs of Bradley Wiggins and Jessica Ennis seen only by those who paid a subscription; or contemplate the future of the Champions League now wholly owned by BT or the lessons of cricket only live on Sky. However good a job the pay broadcasters do, public service and maximum access for all are still things that matter hugely in the world of sport.</p> \n<p><em>Roger Mosey was BBC director of the London 2012 Olympics and now master of Selwyn College Cambridge</em></p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/047c98a121fb67680031065ed9624ad9fb5855d5/620_583_3540_2124/3540.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2124,"width":3540,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Stu Forster/Getty Images","altText":"LONDON, ENGLAND - JULY 28:  BBC presenters Mark Foster (L) and Clare Balding (C) pictured in the BBC studio on Day 1 of the London 2012 Olympic Games at the Aquatics Centre on July 28, 2012 in London, England.

Moreover, and as importantly, if the decision were down to Mourinho, the goalkeeper would not be going to Arsenal.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/29/petr-cech-arsenal-chelsea-transfer\">Petr Cech seals &pound;10m Arsenal move and tweets goodbye to Chelsea fans</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“The club is more important than the player and, as was true this season, the club needs two very good goalkeepers,” Mourinho said. “For me, decision No1, Petr will stay. After that, second point, to go but not in England. The option I don’t want is for him to go to an English club.”</p> \n<p>It was 8 May and Arsenal were second in the table to Chelsea – albeit 13 points behind, with a game in hand. Chelsea had made sure of the title but Arsenal had won 18 of 21 fixtures in all competitions. It was becoming clear at the time – and the impression would subsequently harden – that Ars&egrave;ne Wenger’s principal transfer targets in the summer would be a goalkeeper and a defensive midfielder. In other words the Arsenal manager considered an upgrade between the sticks – which he got on Monday <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/29/petr-cech-arsenal-chelsea-transfer\">when Cech signed his four-year deal at the club</a> – to be one of the missing pieces in a potential championship challenge.</p> \n<p>To Mourinho the thought of granting the piece to Arsenal was faintly ludicrous. And so he made his feelings plain. At that press conference back in May he put the ball firmly into Roman Abramovich’s court. The only thing to conclude now, as Arsenal celebrate the capture of Cech, is that the Chelsea owner promptly fizzed a passing shot beyond him.</p> \n<p>There is discomfort on plenty of levels at Chelsea over the sale of Cech to a direct rival – and not just from Mourinho, whose frustration and point-making was reflected in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/jose-mourinho-petr-cech-arsenal-chelsea\">his demand for an Arsenal player to be included in part-exchange</a>; he wanted Theo Walcott or Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, which was never going to happen. There is the acknowledgment among Chelsea directors that the transfer is far from ideal and many of the club’s supporters are gutted.</p> \n<p>The mind goes back to the deadline day in September 2013, when Arsenal thought that they had a deal in place to take the striker Demba Ba on loan from Stamford Bridge. Chelsea strung them along before they pulled the plug at the last moment, leaving Arsenal with no time to pursue an alternative. “Why would we want to help a rival?” a club source said.</p> \n<p>This is the kind of intransigence that might be expected of the elite. When Chelsea have sold a big player to a Premier League club in the recent past – think <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2013/jan/02/liverpool-chelsea-striker-daniel-sturridge\">Daniel Sturridge to Liverpool in 2013</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/jan/25/juan-mata-completes-move-manchester-united\">Juan Mata to Manchester United</a> last year – it was because they did not consider them to be rivals. Mata did not fit into Mourinho’s system. Had the midfielder done so, Chelsea would not have sanctioned the move.</p> \n<p>Cech’s case is different. Mourinho loves him and had said on several occasions last season that he felt the club had – in Thibaut Courtois and Cech – the best two goalkeepers in the division. “Without Petr we would not be champions,” Mourinho said. “Without the points in the games he played, we would not be champions.” Cech made seven appearances in the league and he conceded only twice. Chelsea won all seven.</p> \n<p>Mourinho is aware not only of the need for high-quality back-up but of the difficulty in replacing Cech with somebody who is even comparable. He likes Asmir Begovic of Stoke City but it is a tough sell persuading any top goalkeeper to sign up as the No2 to Courtois.</p> \n<p>Abramovich’s hitherto unseen benevolent side has allowed Cech to get the move he wanted, which keeps the 33-year-old and his young family in London. Abramovich felt he owed it to Cech to let him choose his next club, on the basis of his 11 years of outstanding service. Cech’s professionalism has always been total, particularly last season when he found himself in the unfamiliar role of understudy. But Abramovich has been more benevolent than Mourinho would have liked and Chelsea must hope that the decision does not return to haunt them.</p> \n<p>Cech is almost 18 months younger than Edwin van der Sar was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2005/jun/06/newsstory.sport1\">when he moved from Fulham to Manchester United in 2005</a> – and look at how that ended up. Van der Sar won virtually everything at Old Trafford over six seasons, including the Champions League in 2008, when he helped <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2008/may/22/championsleague.chelsea\">United to beat Chelsea</a> on penalties in the final. Goalkeepers tend to age much better than outfield players and Cech, who has looked after himself with diligence, believes he has at least four more seasons at the highest level.</p> \n<p>Has Cech still got it? Wenger thinks so. Cech’s form remained impressive last season and this was when he was in and out of the Chelsea team, to get into a groove. He made nine appearances in the various cup competitions, conceding nine goals – four of which were in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jan/24/chelsea-bradford-city-fa-cup-fourth-round\">FA Cup defeat against Bradford City</a>. Chelsea do not give up many chances but, when called upon, Cech was polished. He had the highest save percentage in the Premier League, according to Opta, of the goalkeepers who played in more than one game.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/29/chelsea-asmir-begovic-stoke-reject-bid\">Chelsea hope to sign Asmir Begovic despite Stoke rejecting &pound;6m bid</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Arsenal are getting a winner and a leader, an overall improvement on David Ospina and Wojciech Szczesny, and they might also enjoy the sensation of nabbing a player from a rival, which has happened to them in recent years. In some respects the boot that kicked them with Robin van Persie and Samir Nasri is on the other foot.</p> \n<p>There are people close to Abramovich who say that, when he buys something, he buys it to keep. It is part of his makeup. Since his takeover at Chelsea in 2003 he has rarely sold a highly rated player. But that is changing. In the era of financial fair play, Chelsea are learning when to sell. They believe the sale of David Luiz to Paris Saint-Germain was excellent business and they have been happy with the outgoing deals for Mata, Romelu Lukaku, Kevin De Bruyne and Ryan Bertrand.</p> \n<p>Cech becomes only the sixth Chelsea player to move directly to Arsenal, following Bill Dickson (1953), George Graham (1966), William Gallas (2006), Lassana Diarra (2007) and Yossi Benayoun (loan, 2011). The risk on this one looks pronounced.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435592853246/Petr-Cech-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Petr Cech after completing his £10m move from Chelsea to Arsenal.
