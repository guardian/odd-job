But in the end, it wasn’t so simple for James, and the Golden State Warriors won game six in Cleveland 105-97 to take their first NBA championship in 40 years.</p> \n<p>The key to the Warriors’ win was that they appeared not to have a “best” player. NBA regular-season MVP Stephen Curry had 25 points, but it was a balanced attack for Golden State that put the Cleveland on their heels most of the game, chasing after a team that could run the break, dunk, and hit threes when needed. Five of the Warriors scored in double figures.</p> \n<p>Klay Thompson knew who he thought was the best. “We’re the best team in the world with the best player in the world,” Thompson said in the post-game interview as he looked at Curry sitting next to him.</p> \n<p>Curry was modest. “It’s about winning. Stats don’t really matter. Little things make a championship possible,” he said.</p> \n<p>James – wearing shiny gold shoes – finished with 32 points (on 13 of 33 shooting), 18 rebounds and nine assists. But the key stat in the game was the turnovers. The Cavs turned the ball over an incredible 19 times (a team-leading six by James), and those turnovers led to 25 Warrior points. Golden State turned the ball over just nine times, and those led to just 13 Cavs points.<br /></p> \n<p>LeBron said afterwards: “We were under-manned. I don’t know any other team in the history of the NBA that got to the finals without two all-stars. We had our playmakers in suits. For a good playoff run, you have to be healthy and little bit lucky. We weren’t healthy and we weren’t lucky.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457183674__\n</div> \n<p>Cavs coach David Blatt admitted: “Their depth over time did have an impact.”</p> \n<p>Warriors forward Andre Iguodala was the difference maker in victory. He did a decent job defensively on James, ran the floor on the break, drove to the hoop and finished with 25 points, five rebounds and five assists. He was versatile and played with size and speed, and making Warriors coach Steve Kerr look like a genius for putting him in the starting lineup for games five and six.</p> \n<p>Iguodala was named NBA finals series MVP. Golden State coach Steve Kerr said: “It is fitting the [MVP] award went to Andre [Iguodala]. He sacrificed his starting role this year. He did that to make our bench better, to make our team better. He set the tone for everything we accomplished.”</p> \n<p>Thompson said of Iguodala: “He is the ultimate professional … he stepped up when we needed him both on offense and defense. He deserved the NBA finals MVP.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"445ec4eb19ebf77b4341b352cbb0f68520742f4c\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/445ec4eb19ebf77b4341b352cbb0f68520742f4c/0_0_2316_1390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andre Iguodala: MVP\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andre Iguodala: MVP</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Richard/USA Today Sports</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Timofey Mozgov only played a total of 9:19 minutes and had no points in game five as the Cavaliers reacted to the Warriors going small in game four. But the Cavs switched gears in this one, playing Mozgov 10 minutes in the opening quarter and 32 minutes in the game. James drove and dished to Mosgov for an easy layup and the Cavs’ first bucket. Mosgov finished with a double-double: 17 points and 12 rebounds in 32 minutes.</p> \n<p> Cavs jumped to a 7-2 lead at the start of the game, but the Warriors outscored the Cavs over the final nine minutes of the first quarter by 26-8, to take a 28-15 lead. The Warriors – with a starting lineup that was basically four forwards and one guard – showed balance in their offense, with a combination of driving layups and long range shooting. Curry led the Warriors in the opening quarter with nine points.</p> \n<p>And the Warriors played big men Andrew Bogut and David Lee very little in this game (just one minute for Lee and a DNP for Bogut), preferring to let Tristan Thompson and Mozgov get points inside. Mozgov and Thompson scored 32 points between them, but the Cavs had little scoring other than those two and James. </p> \n<p>The Cavs hurt themselves with poor execution. Matthew Dellavedova seemed unable to keep pace with Curry, and the Aussie point guard had just one point and two assists in the game. A three point field goal by Iman Shumpert halfway through the second quarter was nullified by an offensive foul away from the ball by Tristan Thompson. James missed three of four free throws in the first half.</p> \n<p> But despite the poor play, Cleveland was behind by just 45-43 after an 8-2 run to close out the half. James has 15 points on six of 14 shooting in the first half. </p> \n<p>The Cavs took the lead early in the fourth quarter on a jump hook in the lane by Thompson (47-45), but the Warriors went on a 9-0 run with 8:13 left in the third quarter to lead 54-47. A fast break dunk by Iguodala with 5:12 left in the third extended the Warriors’ lead to 61-51. Golden State never looked back.</p> \n<p>James did make a steal and ran the floor for a dunk with 10:13 left in the game to cut the Warrior’s lead to seven, 75-68. But after a timeout, Curry hit a three and the lead was up to 10. The two teams traded baskets down the stretch, but it was obvious the Cavs looked tired, and the Warriors continued to move without the ball. It was that team effort that won the game; five in double figures for the Warriors and 28 assists for the NBA champions, compared to just 12 for the Cavaliers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acb9953a064d95af44dda1c95e747c5a8be88976\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/acb9953a064d95af44dda1c95e747c5a8be88976/0_99_4134_2482/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LeBron James couldn’t propel his Cavs team to victory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LeBron James couldn’t propel his Cavs team to victory.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So the team that had versatile scoring, passed the ball well, and didn’t turn it over much, beat the team with the self-proclaimed “best player in the world.” During one of the official timeouts in the first quarter, the Cavs game presentation crew played Dream On by Aerosmith from 1973 and showed highlights from old Cavs teams – teams that also failed to win it all.</p> \n<p>For Cleveland fans, in a city which has not won a major sports championship since 1964, the mantra looks like it will be “Dream On” once again. But for Warriors fans, who have also been suffering for what seems like forever, the dream came true, because the team played unselfishly and with little ego.</p> \n<p>“The sacrifice this team made, different guys stepping in … just pride. This is an amazing group of guys,” Kerr said as his team celebrated. </p> \n<p>“There’s been all this talk about us only winning by shooting the three-point shot, but what was overlooked was our combination of great offense and great defense. It’s about the balance. It turned into special season as a result.”</p> \n<p>Iguodala said: “I was just happy winning the ring, I don’t care about the MVP stuff.</p> \n<p>“For me it was just playing my game … when I am scoring the ball or not, I try to be an effective force on the court in all the other aspects of the game.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0a865a2c5da271b1e4057199c03ad11391f17da5/0_103_3155_1893/3155.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1893,"width":3155,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jason Miller/Getty Images","altText":"Golden State Warriors celebrate their victory.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jason Miller/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/445ec4eb19ebf77b4341b352cbb0f68520742f4c/0_0_2316_1390/2316.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1390,"width":2316,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andre Iguodala: MVP Photograph: David Richard/USA Today Sports","credit":"David Richard/USA Today Sports","altText":"Andre Iguodala: MVP","cleanCaption":"Andre Iguodala: MVP","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Richard/USA Today Sports"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/acb9953a064d95af44dda1c95e747c5a8be88976/0_99_4134_2482/4134.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2482,"width":4134,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"LeBron James couldn’t propel his Cavs team to victory.

In the meantime, here are some thoughts on tonight’s game from Les Carpenter:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> are tired now. The relentless zeal that pushed them to two early victories in the NBA finals has drained away. The series has grown long and the injuries to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love have proven all but fatal to the title dreams that burned just a week ago. LeBron James and a whole lot of enthusiasm are no match for the speed and depth of Golden State.</p> \n <p>Even with the series in Cleveland for Game 6 on Tuesday night, it feels like a last gasp for the Cavs. The way the Warriors raced past them in those final few minutes in Game 5 makes the result of this series seem a certainty. </p> \n <p>And yet because this is the finals and Cleveland have James, there remains that shred of doubt. If James is going to have that career-defining moment of pure greatness he never had to have in his title with the Miami Heat, tonight would be the time to do it. </p> \n <p>“One thing I’ve learned playing with LeBron for three years, you never count the man out,” his former team-mate Shane Battier said on a Monday conference call for the American Century Championship golf tournament. “If he scores 50 points, the Cavs will win. If he doesn’t I have the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> ending the series at six.”</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-5580baa7e4b0e91d8f409675","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-17T00:11:04Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T00:38:05Z","body":"<p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

The relentless zeal that pushed them to two early victories in the NBA finals has drained away. The series has grown long and the injuries to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love have proven all but fatal to the title dreams that burned just a week ago. LeBron James and a whole lot of enthusiasm are no match for the speed and depth of Golden State.</p> \n <p>Even with the series in Cleveland for Game 6 on Tuesday night, it feels like a last gasp for the Cavs. The way the Warriors raced past them in those final few minutes in Game 5 makes the result of this series seem a certainty. </p> \n <p>And yet because this is the finals and Cleveland have James, there remains that shred of doubt. If James is going to have that career-defining moment of pure greatness he never had to have in his title with the Miami Heat, tonight would be the time to do it. </p> \n <p>“One thing I’ve learned playing with LeBron for three years, you never count the man out,” his former team-mate Shane Battier said on a Monday conference call for the American Century Championship golf tournament. “If he scores 50 points, the Cavs will win. If he doesn’t I have the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> ending the series at six.”</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-5580c95de4b0e91d8f4096a8","title":"Tip-off!","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-17T01:12:46Z","body":"<p>Cavs score first at 11:31 of the 1st quarter on a made free throw by Iman Shumpert.

Given that this is an ongoing federal investigation, it is not appropriate for us to comment further.”</p> \n<p>If Cardinals employees did indeed hack into the Astros files it would be the first known case of a sports team penetrating the secret communications of another team. It would also signal a new era of information tracking in an industry where the tiniest piece of information could be worth tens of millions of dollars.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/sports/baseball/st-louis-cardinals-hack-astros-fbi.html?smid%3D=tw-nytsports&amp;_r=0\">The New York Times says the investigation</a>, which is being run by the FBI’s Houston field office, has reached a point where subpoenas have been served on the Cardinals and Major League Baseball. The sources for the Times story did not name which Cardinals officials were under investigation and would not say if the team’s highest officials knew of the hacking. The subpoenas on the MLB are due to the Cardinals’ membership of the league, rather than any suspicion that league officials are guilty of any wrongdoing.<br /></p> \n<p>The story says that investigators believe the Cardinals were concerned that Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow had taken some of the team’s proprietary information with him to Houston and some team employees used a list of passwords he kept in St Louis to break into the Astros system. </p> \n<p>“The FBI aggressively investigates all potential threats to public and private sector systems,” said the agency in a statement. “Once our investigations are complete, we pursue all appropriate avenues to hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace.”</p> \n<p>Luhnow previously worked for the Cardinals as vice president of baseball development before eventually becoming the team’s scouting director. Before he got to the team he worked in business development. He was brought in by owner William DeWitt in 2003 to bring an analytics approach to assessing talent. This sometimes pitted against him against more traditional baseball evaluators in a scene reminiscent of the Moneyball where A’s general manager Billy Beane challenges the thinking of longtime baseball scouts. </p> \n<p>After the 2011 season, the Astros hired Luhnow as the team’s general manager. At the time, the Astros were in the National League Central, the same division as the Cardinals, making them close competitors. Houston has since been moved to the American League as part of a larger league alignment plan. </p> \n<p>Luhnow, who has led a stunning turnaround that has seen Houston go from the worst team in baseball to first place in the American League West division. But his organization’s open boasting about its analytics expertise annoyed many in baseball. When it was revealed that his staff of like-minded numbers crunchers dumped information into a database called “Ground Control” many traditionalists in baseball rolled their eyes.</p> \n<p>Last summer, several documents from Ground Control <a href=\"http:// http://deadspin.com/leaked-10-months-of-the-houston-astros-internal-trade-1597951970\">were posted by Deadspin</a> and proved embarrassing to the team. Most of the leaked files revolved around trade talks with other teams, revealing trades possibilities that had never been known before – a breach of information that was not only damaging to the Astros but to the other teams named in the files since several of the players discussed had no idea their teams were open to dealing them. </p> \n<p>According to the Times it was this release of information that led MLB to contact the FBI. Eventually, the FBI was able to trace the computer that infiltrated the Astros network, discovering it was a laptop in a home where some Cardinals employees lived. </p> \n<p>The right stolen information could be worth a fortune to a team. For instance, one club’s medical reports on a player might show a serious injury that others don’t know about, devaluing that player in free agency. Knowledge about one team’s interest in trading a star player might affect the way it pursues players itself, a decision that might mean the difference of millions in potential contracts. </p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the MLB commissioner, Rob Manfred, confirmed the league knew about the investigation. “[MLB] has been aware of and has fully cooperated with the federal investigation into the illegal breach of the Astros’ baseball operations database,” read a statement.</p> \n<p>The Cardinals and Astros were division rivals in the National League between 1994 and 2012, a feud that peaked with consecutive NLCS meetings in 2004 and 2005. St Louis are one of the most decorated teams in baseball history, and have the best record in MLB this season at 42-21. They have won the World Series 11 times – more than any club but the Yankees – including two victories in the last decade, in 2011 and 2006.<br /></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/15783f65a7dbf9533f85280b0a9787a95ad2afba/0_98_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jeff Curry/Getty Images","altText":"St Louis Cardinals","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jeff Curry/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T15:41:50Z","lastModified":"2015-06-16T20:24:09Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Les Carpenter","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/les-carpenter"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["St Louis Cardinals","Houston Astros","MLB","Baseball","Sport","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/st-louis-cardinals","webTitle":"St Louis Cardinals"},{"id":"sport/houston-astros","webTitle":"Houston Astros"},{"id":"sport/mlb","webTitle":"MLB"},{"id":"sport/baseball","webTitle":"Baseball"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Les Carpenter","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/les-carpenter"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/16/fbi-investigates-st-louis-cardinals-over-claims-they-hacked-rivals-houston-astros","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49p8a","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/16/fbi-investigates-st-louis-cardinals-over-claims-they-hacked-rivals-houston-astros","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/16/fbi-investigates-st-louis-cardinals-over-claims-they-hacked-rivals-houston-astros"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/15783f65a7dbf9533f85280b0a9787a95ad2afba/0_98_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Cardinals last won the World Series in 2011.

I am playing better than before and enjoying my tennis more on court than before. I will keep going, keep practising hard. I hope to be ready to play well at Wimbledon.”</p> \n<p>He said the presence of Juan Carlos and Mourinho – both of whom he knows well – did not disturb his focus. “I have a great relationship with the king. I have a very good relationship with Jos&eacute;, too. It is good to have the support of the crowd, but it’s not an inspiration, not an extra pressure. I play my game. I try to do my best in every single match of the year and not try to be better if there is somebody or not on the crowd.”</p> \n<p>Nadal deflected a suggestion that Mourinho might have been in a position to give him advice. “He’s a football manager. He’s one of the best of the world. And I have my team. I will never give him advice on football and probably he will not be giving me advice on tennis.”</p> \n<p>Having complained of nerves and self-doubt during four defeats on European clay before Roland Garros, Nadal does look rejuvenated. It was his misfortune to strike Dolgopolov on one of his best days. “He’s difficult on every surface and his serve today was great, huge. His second serve was so difficult to read, too, because sometimes he played with bigger slice, and sometimes he played with topspin. So it was not easy.” Dolgopolov plays Guillermo Garc&iacute;a L&oacute;pez next.</p> \n<p>Andy Murray survived two breaks of serve against the Taiwan qualifier Lu Yen-hsun to win 6-4, 7-5 and book a second-round match against Fernando Verdasco, who gave him such a tough time over five sets in the quarter-final at Wimbledon two years ago.</p> \n<p>The French Open champion Stan Wawrinka beat Nick Kyrgios 6-3, 6-4 in 49 minutes and the defending Queen’s champion Grigor Dimitrov is also through, finishing off his overnight match against Sam Querrey in three sets.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434483209238/Rafael-Nadal-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rafael Nadal had a hard time against Alexandr Dolgopolov, who won 6-3, 6-7, 6-4 in the first round at Queen's.

Nadal has some work to do if he is to go to Wimbledon in better shape than he left it last year, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/01/nick-kyrgios-rafael-nadal-wimbledon-2014\" title=\"\">beaten by the young Australian Nick Kyrgios</a> in the fourth round.</p> \n<p>“I think my serve was the key,” Dolgopolov said courtside. “He only broke me once, in the third set – and that made me more confident on his serve. I risked more and it worked. I think it is tougher for him to play on grass. It is my best chance to beat him, but he is great everywhere.”</p> \n<p>Nadal seemed nervous, as he had done during his clay court horrors before the French Open. Dolgopolov, whose 16 aces kept him pinned deep for much of the contest, had match point in the second set after an hour and 25 minutes but a backhand went wide.</p> \n<p>It took Nadal an hour and 42 minutes to fashion his first break point and he took it with a vicious forehand that kissed the baseline in the third game of the concluding set. He struck his fifth ace for 4-2, got a time violation on break point in the eighth game and saved, but Dolgopolov levelled at 4-4 with the most delicate backhand volley.</p> \n<p>As they went into a third hour, the energy was with the younger player, who saved a third break point with his final ace, forcing Nadal to serve to stay in the tournament. Dolgopolov had his second match point and this time made sure of it.</p> \n<p>It is not often you get four slam winners – Nadal, Stanislas Wawrinka, Andy Murray and Marin Cilic – playing on the same day in a tournament outside the majors, although some fans who were unaware that the field had been reduced to 32 complained there was no chance to see the leading players on the outside courts.</p> \n<p>For those left on the wrong side of the moat, Nick Kyrgios made a puzzling admission after losing to Wawrinka in 49 minutes: “I almost found it difficult to get myself engaged and didn’t want to be&nbsp;there.”</p> \n<p>The 20-year-old Australian is nursing a chronic elbow injury but also complained of having not felt well for a week.</p> \n<p>He is in London with friends and has rented a house for a month to cover his commitment here and at Wimbledon, but sounded here as fed up as a kid who has had his scooter stolen.</p> \n<p>He said: “Probably going to stay in my house for a couple of days and sleep, play computer games and chill out, not think about tennis, turn off all tennis channels, delete my ATP app, and just not think about tennis for a week or so.”</p> \n<p>Wawrinka, who won 6-3, 6-4 and looked totally at ease with the switch from clay to grass after his victory at the French Open, wasn’t buying that. He likes Kyrgios but observed, “With him, you never know what’s happening in his mind. I think he’s enjoying his time. He’s the future of&nbsp;tennis.</p> \n<p>“I have been trying to practise with him since many months but [he] didn’t find a time for that.

His Open Championship victory at Royal Liverpool last July is pertinent in respect of Chambers Bay, given it endorsed an ability to win on a links venue.</p> \n<p>In McIlroy’s view, this recently created Seattle property “plays more like a links than some links courses”. The following month, McIlroy endorsed his status as the finest player in the world with his second US PGA Championship triumph. He was riding the crest of a golfing wave.</p> \n<p>By the time McIlroy arrived at the Masters in April, he was in the spotlight as never before. He was seeking to complete a career grand slam of majors, with failure to achieve that surely linked in part to a level of background noise. Here McIlroy is back on the big stage, refreshed and, he feels, with a game which suits.</p> \n<p>“Just being able to go about my business,” said McIlroy of the difference between the first two majors of this season. “And obviously not fly under the radar but there’s not as much attention or as much hype.</p> \n<p>“I can get here and just do my thing without much worry. And I guess, as well, there’s not as much on my mind about what I can achieve. It’s hugely important, a chance to win a second US Open and the fifth major, and that’s all important, but there was just so much hype and so much attention around Augusta. This one feels very different.</p> \n<p>“This is really like playing an Open Championship in the United States. That’s what it’s going to be like this week, apart from the fact that it’s about 20 degrees warmer. I really like the course. I think it sets up well for my game. You’ve got to be aggressive off the tee. You’ve got to hit driver.</p> \n<p>“I think a place like this can separate the field a lot. This is the sort of course that if you’re just slightly off, it’ll magnify that. But it’ll really reward people who are hitting good shots, are confident and their short games are sharp. I definitely think this is the sort of course that you could see the guys that are really playing well and are confident with the set-up and how they approach it, they could really separate themselves from the rest of the field.”</p> \n<p>Recent history is in McIlroy’s favour. Four of the past five US Opens have been won by European players. “I think there’s a direct correlation between Europeans winning Ryder Cups and Europeans winning major championships,” he said. “I think it’s given Europeans the confidence to come over here and compete – three of the four major championships are in this country.</p> \n<p>“Most likely you’re competing against players who you compete against at the Ryder Cup. So I think having that success in the Ryder Cup has translated into major victories for European players.”</p> \n<p>Mcllroy, who won the 2011 US Open at Congressional, is clearly more comfortable with his status as the pre-eminent player in golf than, for example, two years ago. Growing maturity is the logical explanation for that. At 26, he is willing to speak expansively about what would ensure a lasting legacy as a world No1.</p> \n<p>“I think the biggest thing is motivation. It’s setting your goals all the time and trying to achieve those,” McIlroy said. “In a golf perspective, it’s just trying to get better, trying to achieve more things and set goals for yourself and to try to accomplish them.</p> \n<p>“And then, off the course, you have to be stable, be happy, keep it simple. I think that’s the big thing. If you want your longevity in golf you’re going back to the days of Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player. They all had very stable personal lives and kept life fairly simple. I think that’s a big key to having a long and successful career.</p> \n<p>“If you look back at the last four or five years, I guess I’ve won more majors than anyone else in that time period. So do I feel like the best player in the world? Yes. And obviously I want to go out every week, try to back that up and show that.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/16/1434479285787/rory-mcilroy-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rory McIlroy, the world No1, is all smiles at Chambers Bay, where he figures driver will be key over the four rounds.

Ten days ago, on the Saturday of the Memorial Tournament, he shot 85, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/06/tiger-woods-worst-round-career-85-memorial\" title=\"\">his worst round as a professional</a>.

I want to win these championships. I love them, I love playing them,” the 39-year-old said. “My first major was the Masters, my first US Open was at Shinnecock Hills and then obviously the British at St Andrews. For me it was a pretty good introduction to major championship golf and I’ve loved it ever since.</p> \n<p>“There’s pressure, of course there’s pressure. You’re trying to win the biggest events against the best fields and that’s the fun part.”</p> \n<p>Pressed on what he has left to accomplish in golf, Woods added: “More wins.

Was this Aidan O’Brien’s 44th Royal Ascot winner, or his son Joseph’s first?</p> \n<p>O’Brien Sr has always stressed the importance of the team effort at his Ballydoyle stable after any major victory, but even so, his determination to pass the credit for Gleneagles’ outstanding season to his oldest son was striking.</p> \n<p>“Joseph said before the race that he had him better today than at any stage, which was pleasing to hear,” O’Brien said. “He does everything with the horse and he wouldn’t say that lightly.</p> \n<p>“I’m just a small part of a very big team, and privileged to be able to play a part. I’m getting older now and the younger lads are coming on. I’m watching more and going with the flow. I’m 45 and it’s great to see younger people coming along and taking responsibility. I just stand at the top of the gallops and watch the work, which is good for me, and a lot less pressure.”</p> \n<p>Gleneagles’ victory was as straightforward as his starting price of 8-15 suggested it should be. The money riding on his chance included a single bet of &pound;150,000 to win &pound;80,000, and the payout was as good as banked from start to finish. Ryan Moore, who replaced Joseph O’Brien as the stable’s main jockey at the start of the season, settled his colt three lengths off the pace as Consort and Frankie Dettori cut out the running, and then opened a decisive lead approaching the furlong pole as Make Believe, the French 2,000 Guineas winner, weakened abruptly to finished last of the five runners.</p> \n<p>O’Brien gave no hint he intends to hand in his licence any time soon. Yet even after a success that was as routine as they come at this level, it was clear from O’Brien’s comments that the day-to-day pressure of caring for horses that are bred and expected to be champions has taken a toll.</p> \n<p>“He’s doing a lot more now and I’m watching,” O’Brien said. “They [his four children] are all getting older and bigger and know a lot about everything and it’s a big team.</p> \n<p>“They are grabbing it and I’m not stopping them, I’m giving it. I might live a bit longer then. Anything they want, they can have it, and I’m very happy to be sitting in the back seat, believe me.</p> \n<p>“We [O’Brien and his wife Annemarie] have done this for 20 years, hard graft day in and day out. Maybe next year at Ascot we might be able to stay here an odd night. That’s the reality, we’re over and back every day, we never stay anywhere. Maybe shortly we might be able to start doing stuff like that, living normal lives. I’ve never seen any of the cities that we go to, I go racing and go back home.”</p> \n<p>This has already been a year of transition for Ballydoyle with Moore taking over as the stable jockey, and Gleneagles has now emerged as the clear leader among the yard’s horses. His main contenders for the Derby, a race O’Brien had won three times in a row from 2012, fell by the wayside during the spring’s series of Classic trials, and Gleneagles appears to be the only potentially high-class recruit to the Coolmore Stud’s stallion roster from this year’s crop.</p> \n<p>“It’s been vital, he’s a star horse,” O’Brien said. “Our other horses did disappoint but if they don’t get it together the rest of the year, they might stay in training next year, and that would be a big advantage to us because we had no four-year-olds this year and it’s a big strain on the three-year-olds.”</p> \n<p>Gleneagles could step up to a mile-and-a-quarter in the Irish Champion Stakes in early September but first he is likely to run in the Sussex Stakes at Glorious&nbsp;Goodwood in early August, a race that is also the target for Solow, the winner of the Queen Anne Stakes, Tuesday’s opener.</p> \n<p>Solow did not quite produce the form of his outstanding success on World Cup night in Dubai back in March, but with Able Friend, the best miler in Hong Kong and his main market rival, running below form to finish sixth, it was good enough to take Solow’s winning streak to seven races, including three Group Ones.</p> \n<p>“He’s a fantastic horse, a great warrior who can do anything, he can wait, he can lead,” Freddy Head, the winner’s trainer, said. “I hope he lasts and we’ve got many more years for him.</p> \n<p>“Maybe we will come back for the Sussex at Goodwood. I’m not going to run everything that comes because I want him to last, so I’m not sure we’re going to go to America [for the Breeders’ Cup Mile] this year. I’m not very fond of the Keeneland racetrack [which will stage this year’s event], I think it’s a little tight.”</p> \n<p>Robert Cowell, who consistently produces top-class sprinters from a relatively small string, took the Group One King’s Stand Stakes for the second time in five seasons when Goldream edged out Medicean Man and Muthmir in a blanket finish.</p> \n<p>Sheikh Mohammed’s Godolphin operation got on the board for the meeting when Buratino won the Group Two Coventry Stakes for Mark Johnston with another Godolphin runner, the warm favourite Round Two, well beaten. Moore completed a treble in the last three as he followed up his win on Gleneagles aboard the Willie Mullins-trained Clondaw Warrior and O’Brien’s colt Washington DC in the Ascot Stakes and Windsor Castle Stakes respectively.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434475317486/Royal-Ascot-Gleneagles-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Gleneagles wins the St James's Palace Stakes on day one of Royal Ascot.

Now four, he will be remembered mainly as a well-backed flop in last year’s Arc de Triomphe but it may be worth forgiving that effort.</p> \n<p>Just three weeks earlier, Ectot was the subject of some excitement when making a sweeping move around all his rivals in the Prix Niel to win with authority despite having failed to settle. That was his first outing since April, when he was similarly impressive in beating a subsequent Classic winner over a mile.</p> \n<p>Ectot begins to look like a horse who is best caught fresh, so it may be all to the good that he missed last month’s Ganay with a minor injury. He warmed up for this with a racecourse gallop at Longchamp and connections reportedly feel he has made progress over the winter with his physique.</p> \n<p>In an ideal world, Ectot would have matured enough to settle rather better here than has been his wont. So long as he does not run the fire out of himself, he should be able to make a bold bid in a 10-furlong race around here.</p> \n<p>Free Eagle’s chance is clear, though he has also had a history of niggling problems and his short odds do not allow for any doubts about his readiness this time. The Grey Gatsby also has a bit to prove after two beaten efforts, though his form behind Solow in Dubai looks rather better now than it did beforehand.</p> \n<p>Criterion is an interesting raider but Australian middle-distance types do not yet carry the same status, when they travel abroad, as do their sprinters. The greatest danger appears to be Western Hymn, unbeaten this season and a better racehorse for being gelded.</p> \n<p><strong>2.30 </strong>Ivawood looks a very short price and there may be each-way value in his stablemate <strong>Tupi</strong>, who seems much improved over seven furlongs on fast ground this season. When last seen, he beat a horse who was second in a Group One here on Tuesday.</p> \n<p><strong>3.05</strong> The Queen Mary was an early conquest for the American trainer Wesley Ward and his <strong>Acapulco</strong> is interesting here. Though a disappointing favourite on dirt last month, she has since impressed. “All her works have been lights out,” Ward says and apparently this is a good thing. Indeed, the trainer says he has never had a horse work better on grass. When he enthuses about a runner to this extent, it has generally been worth paying attention.</p> \n<p><strong>3.40</strong> Last year’s winner, Integral, will surely go well again but she must concede 5lb to <strong>Euro Charline</strong>, which is no straightforward matter. Marco Botti’s filly was only beaten a length here in the Coronation last year and later won a Grade One in the US. She started her year in Dubai with a fine fourth behind Solow, The Grey Gatsby and Mshawish and has a big chance back in female company.</p> \n<p><strong>5.00</strong> Odds of 25-1 look too big about <strong>Mondialiste</strong>, beaten just a neck in the Lincoln on his first run since joining David O’Meara from France.</p> \n<p><strong>5.35</strong> The winner of her only previous handicap start, <strong>Realtra</strong> is just 5lb higher and still well weighted, judged by her effort in a Listed race against colts at Epsom last time.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434473522751/Royal-Ascot-2015---009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The field negotiate the home turn in the Ascot Stakes on day one of the Royal meeting.

The 29-year-old striker managed just four goals in 29 appearances for Louis van Gaal’s side and a solitary shot on target in his final 12 Premier League games. United duly passed up the chance to make the deal permanent for &pound;43.2m.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/loi-remy-role-chelsea-radamel-falcao\">Lo&iuml;c R&eacute;my to seek assurances at Chelsea over arrival of Radamel Falcao</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Chelsea would have a similar option next summer, albeit for nearer &pound;35m, having agreed to pay a loan fee in the region of &pound;4m for the forward. Falcao earns &pound;265,000 a week under the terms of his contract at Stade Louis II, a figure United covered last term, though it is understood he will waive a proportion of that salary to move to the Premier League champions. Chelsea’s highest earner at present is Eden Hazard on around &pound;200,000 a week and the new arrival is unlikely to match that&nbsp;salary.</p> \n<p>Falcao’s time at Old Trafford was initially hampered by injury, though once available he rarely looked the same powerhouse who had so thrived at Porto and Atl&eacute;tico Madrid – not least at Chelsea’s expense in the 2012 Uefa Super Cup, when he scored a hat-trick – before suffering a serious cruciate knee ligament injury with Monaco which ruled him out of last summer’s World Cup finals. His four United goals came against Everton, Aston Villa, Stoke and Leicester, the last on 31 January, and his campaign rather petered out in frustration.</p> \n<p>Yet Jos&eacute; Mourinho, who shares the same agent as Falcao and has lost Didier Drogba this summer, impressed upon the Chelsea board his belief that he can coax the best from the forward. He went public in his admiration for the Colombian in an interview last week with DirecTV Sports. “I know him very well from when I was in Portugal and Spain,” he said. “For a player of his level and quality, it’s a real shame that people in England think Falcao is the player who was at Manchester United.</p> \n<p>“I don’t have a close relationship with him, but it hurts me because he’s a great player. If there’s any way for me to help the English people to get to know the real Falcao, that would give me pleasure. But I don’t do the negotiations. I just tell the board, my club, the players I’m interested in.”</p> \n<p>Talks between Mendes, Monaco and the Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia, who oversees their transfer and contract negotiations, are now understood to have led to an agreement in principle even if the player is likely to require extensive medical checks once Colombia’s participation in the Copa Am&eacute;rica in Chile is over. The Ligue 1 club could still seek to take players on loan from Chelsea as part of the arrangement having declared an interest in the teenage Belgium Under-21 international Charly Musonda and the Croatia midfielder Mario Pasalic.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/15/chelsea-homeless-two-seasons-stamford-bridge\">Chelsea may have to vacate Stamford Bridge for at least two seasons</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The completion of the deal for Falcao would leave R&eacute;my contemplating his future at Stamford Bridge, as the France striker had been seeking reassurances he would receive more playing time next year before Euro 2016.

They have spoken to Paris Saint-Germain about another former Newcastle player, the midfielder Yohan Cabaye, and would be prepared to offer the striker, who earns around &pound;80,000 a week at present, a competitive wage.</p> \n<p>Whether they could meet the fee required to prise R&eacute;my away, however, remains to be seen though the fact Chelsea could potentially follow up Falcao’s arrival with a &pound;43m move for Atl&eacute;tico’s Antoine Griezmann could hasten his departure.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434480121304/Falcao-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Radamel Falcao, who is currently playing for Colombia at the Copa América, has agreed a deal to join Chelsea on loan.
