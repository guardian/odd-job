He it was who took the wicket of Ambrose in his first over, the latter not having added to his overnight score and well taken by Ben Cox , standing up to the stumps. Twice in as many deliveries Shantry found unexpected lift from a length, first hitting Bell on the right glove, causing him to wring his fingers, and then doing the same to Clarke, who shortly afterwards, when 9, edged Shantry only for Cox, an otherwise impressive keeper up to the stumps, to miss the chance.</p> \n<p>Bell had reached his half century at the start of the day by gliding Shantry to the third man boundary, a trademark Bell shot, and had progressed to 71 while Clarke was still there on 21 as Warwickshire progressed to 155 for five.<br /></p>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-557eafcfe4b0e706bc8be0ae","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-15T10:58:52Z","body":"<p>Gary Naylor’s weekly county cricket blog is up...</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/99-94-cricket-blog/2015/jun/15/county-cricket-final-over-durham-hampshire-yorkshire-lancashire\">County cricket: the week's final over</a> </p> \n</aside>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-557eaaa3e4b0e706bc8be084","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-15T10:36:23Z","body":"<p>Hello again.

They were the ones who pushed for a 12.30pm start in order to attract more punters after work, but 42 overs lost to bad light on day one kind of defeats the object.</p> \n<p>I’m not so sure starting 90 minutes later will work wonders for the crowd anyway. I would much rather see play start at 2.30pm and finish under lights, which gives spectators a good three hours of play after work. As things stand, you would be lucky to get an hour’s viewing in. How many people finish work bang on 5pm these days? Not many, I’d wager. It’s more likely to be 5.30pm. Then you have to navigate rush hour traffic, which is not pleasant in Manchester.</p> \n<p>Anyway, yesterday was a good day on the field for Lancashire, who bowled Leicestershire out for 207 in 50 overs, with James Faulkner claiming the first hat-trick of his career. He was of the view that the Red Rose did not bowl as well as they could have, but gained that bit of luck.

As you’ve no doubt heard, Surrey’s Rory Burns and Moises Henriques had a sickening outfield clash that left both players unconscious and many hearts in cricketing mouths for the 40 minutes it took for them to be lifted into ambulances and taken to hospital in Chichester. Thankfully, it appears both are fine – Burns has had a load of stitches on cuts to his face and will leave hospital this afternoon, while last night Henriques had an operation on a jaw broken in three places and will stay in for another 24 hours. We’ll file it under near misses, I think.</p> \n<p>Anyway, back to the cricket. Durham are at Arundel today and, on a notorious road, Sussex’s Ed Joyce – presumably spooked by his team’s torrid recent record with the bat on a spitty Hove square – has put Durham in. Maybe he didn’t fancy facing Rushworth, Onions &amp; co on a cloudy morning. Anyway, loanees Tim Linley and George Dockrell go straight into the Sussex side, while Ajmal Shahzad returns from injury too.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, we have Mike Selvey at Worcestershire-Warwickshire, where Ian Bell resumes 46* looking for an Ashes-readying ton after 14 wickets fell on day one. Warwickshire trail by 142. And Graham Hardcastle is at Old Trafford for Lancashire’s trendy late kick off with Leicestershire. He’ll be with us from 12.30 when Lancs will be batting after a Jimmy Faulkner hat-trick reduced Leicestershire to 207.</p> \n<p>There are three more games going on. There’s a new-starter at Guildford, where Surrey face Glamorgan with a rather makeshift batting lineup in the absence of Burns, Pietersen, Sangakkara and more. Then Alastair Cook at Chelmsford is looking to go big on a tough wicket. He and his team had a fine first day against Derbyshire, bowling them out for 148 and reaching 108 for none, with the Chef 50 not out. On a Taunton track that seems to fit with the stereotype, Nottinghamshire resume 391/6 after a brilliant 152 from Brendan Taylor.</p> \n<p>Enjoy the cricket, folks.</p>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-557e9773e4b07c61f71d1e80","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-15T09:48:28Z","body":"<p>Morning all,</p> \n<p>Today we have at Graham Hardcastle at Old Trafford for Lancashire v Leicestershire, Will Macpherson at Arundel for Surrey v Durham and Mike Selvey at Worcester for Worcestershire v Warwickshire.

Surrey later also confirmed Monday’s County Championship game against Glamorgan at Guildford will go ahead as normal, the fixture having been in some doubt given the circumstances.</p> \n<p>Henriques underwent dental surgery after suffering a broken jaw. Surrey had tweeted an update late on Sunday evening which read: “Rory and Moises are both in good spirits in hospital..Rory is waiting to have stitches on head and facial injuries.. Moises has broken his jaw in three places and is waiting to have an operation..dental surgery will follow... Thank you for all your messages for the two lads...know they are very much appreciated...”</p> \n<p>And Surrey posted an encouraging update on Monday morning: “Latest news on the two boys..Both Rory and Moises are in decent shape following their operations overnight..further updates later in the day.” Stewart also posted a picture of Burns <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StewieCricket/status/610343226650836992\" title=\"\">smiling in his hospital bed</a>, accompanied by a member of medical staff giving a thumbs-up gesture.</p> \n<p>That positive prognosis on the players was welcome news after spectators in a crowd of 8,500 had earlier watched in horror as the freak accident unfolded. Both players needed oxygen treatment and three ambulances were called onto the pitch before they left the ground. The players were able to offer a thumbs-up to sympathetic spectators before being taken to St Richards’ Hospital in Chichester for further treatment and assessment.</p> \n<p>Sussex physiotherapist John Marrale, who was one of the first people on the scene, confirmed the men were unconscious after the collision. He said: ”They were given oxygen and pain relief was administered by an intravenous drip before they went to hospital. Fortunately they were sitting up when they left the ground, but it was a sickening incident.”</p> \n<p>Umpire Alex Wharf and his colleague Jeremy Lloyds decided to abandon the match after consulting players from both teams, who included Surrey’s Kevin Pietersen who was playing his last game for the county. Wharf said: ”It was a horrific situation for everyone involved – the players and the spectators who were close to the incident.</p> \n<p>”Incidents like that are very rare but the first priority is always the welfare of the players. We consulted with the ECB and the captains and there was never any chance of the game continuing.”</p> \n<p>Sussex chief executive Zac Toumazi praised the swift response of the emergency services, while also backing the decision to call off the match. Former England batsman Pietersen posted a message of support on Twitter. He wrote: “Thinking about you both, @roryburns17 &amp; @Mozzie21!”</p> \n<p>The collision occurred halfway through the 19th over, which was bowled by Tom Curran, when Sussex batsman Steffan Piolet launched a huge top edge into the off side. Henriques and Burns were no more than 20 yards apart when they collided at full pace.</p> \n<p>Henriques joined Surrey earlier this month to play in the NatWest T20 Blast competition. The 28-year-old all-rounder has played 13 times for Australia including three Test matches.

It was, according to Cesar, a “stupid, stupid tackle” that Rooney apparently inflicted on him in England’s 3-1 win at Wembley, though he insisted he was not after revenge in the return game in Ljubljana. “On the pitch I am very aggressive and I enjoy the fight in physical games, but I don’t want to kill him.” He did, however, leave his calling card in the form of the forearm smash into the side of Rooney’s head during England’s 3-2 win and, putting aside for one moment the story of England’s captain and Sir Bobby Charlton’s goals record, that was a moment to demonstrate why the Manchester United player is now entrusted with the armband.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/wayne-rooney-strength-character-roy-hodgson-england\">Wayne Rooney’s character lauded by Roy Hodgson after England win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Roy Hodgson made the same point after Rooney had moved alongside Gary Lineker on 48 England goals, one short of Charlton with the usual turkey-shoot against San Marino conveniently timed in September to help him get over the line. “Wayne Rooney’s performance says a lot of things about him as a man,” Hodgson said. “Just before he took that chance he took a nasty blow from an elbow, which could have decked many a player and led to him losing his discipline. It didn’t and he got up. I like what that shows, and the fact that one or two chances had gone begging but when the ball fell to him he still stuck it away with aplomb. We can rely on that man.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457160825__\n</div> \n<p>In the buildup to this match, Rooney had talked about speaking to Ross Barkley at the end of a difficult season for the Everton midfielder and discussing with his fellow Liverpudlian the areas of his game that needed to improve. Rooney was not everyone’s choice to take over from Steven Gerrard as England captain but in his first year in the role he has scored eight goals in ten games, not been booked once and is yet to be on a losing side. These are still relatively early days but he has taken on the captaincy with distinction so far. <strong>Daniel Taylor</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/slovenia-england-euro-2016-qualifier-match-report\">Match report: Slovenia 2-3 England</a><br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/wayne-rooney-strength-character-roy-hodgson-england\">Rooney’s character lauded by Hodgson</a><br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/14/jack-wilshere-no-regrets-england-thunderbolts\">Dominic Fifield on Jack Wilshere’s impressive display</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>2) Maloney is Scotland’s man of this qualifying campaign</h2> \n<p>Gordon Strachan’s elation over the goal which hauled Scotland back into the game against the Republic of Ireland was matched only by the manager’s delight about the man who helped to provide it. Shaun Maloney has always been an independent thinker and occasionally an over-thinker. His is a career which continues to yield marquee moments, a matter apparently not impacted by his decision to continue his career in Major League Soccer. Maloney could quite easily have remained in England when departing Wigan Athletic last summer but fancied a fresh challenge. The attacker is Scotland’s man of this Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. He has consistently been the one to make things happen. When emerging as youth players at Celtic, it was generally accepted that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/12/aiden-mcgeady-ireland-scotland\">Aiden McGeady was of superior talent</a> to Maloney but the latter’s work ethic and attitude continues to reward him. He has also battled serious injury to remain prominent for club and country; few would merit a trip to a major tournament more. <strong>Ewan Murray</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/republic-of-ireland-scotland-euro-2016-group-d-match-report\">Match report: Republic of Ireland 1-1 Scotland </a><br /><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/13/martin-oneill-ireland-scotland-european-championship-qualifier\">Ewan Murray: O’Neill now faces battle to stop career petering out</a><br /><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span></strong> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/fai-shred-match-programmes-containing-john-delaney-fifa-criticism\">FAI shreds 18,000 match programmes with Delaney Fifa comments</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457155803__\n</div> \n<h2>3) Republic look out of date compared to Scotland</h2> \n<p>At the end of the 19th century “the Scottish style” meant something very specific: passing football, combination play, teamwork, as showcased for admiring crowds by the “Scotch Professors” in the first ever series of international matches against England. Ireland and Scotland’s 1-1 draw at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday was a messy game but a decent result for the Scots, who have looked throughout the campaign the more accomplished of the two teams. Shaun Maloney, James Morrison, Steven Naismith and Scott Brown may not be quite professor-level just yet. But even in a scruffy game there was confirmation in Dublin that Gordon Strachan – who is himself approaching national treasure status – has assembled a team that might not ever threaten to reach the final stages of Euro 2016 but which would at least look it was playing the same game as the best teams there.</p> \n<p>Against Ireland Scotland passed the ball well enough, crafted some nice triangles on the flanks and generally looked most comfortable playing a technically sound pass-and-move game. Should they fail to qualify from here they will do so in the knowledge that they have at least been pushing in the right direction, whereas much of the gloom around Ireland’s current trajectory is a sense that the basic method is simply a little out of date. Maloney was the most eye-catching player in midfield on Saturday, scorer now of five goals in qualifying and a fine all-round playmaking presence. Scotland may be two or three really good players (at least one of them a high class striker) away from being a top quality team. But Maloney and his fellow ball-playing midfielders would certainly add to the gaiety of a major tournament. Even in the fury of Dublin the glimpses in this qualifying campaign of a more historically Scottish Style have been a pleasure to watch. <strong>Barney Ronay</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/republic-of-ireland-martin-oneill-advantage-scotland\"><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> O’Neill claims Scotland’s Naismith ‘refereed the game</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>4) Coleman has discovered a match-winning blend</h2> \n<p>The headlines, inevitably, were commandeered by Gareth Bale, who inspired Wales to the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/live/2015/jun/12/wales-v-belgium-european-2016-qualifier-live\">1-0 win over Belgium</a> last Friday. It was not just his decisive goal, rather the confidence that he spread among his teammates. Yet this momentous effort, which set Wales fair for the Euro 2016 finals – and their first appearance at a major championship since 1958 – was characterised by a collective thou-shalt-not-pass attitude.</p> \n<p>It has underpinned the campaign so far. Chris Coleman, who deserves huge credit for the turnaround he has overseen, has watched his team concede only two goals, and neither Andorra’s penalty nor Cyprus’ slightly streaky free-kick were from open play. This was Belgium’s second blank against Wales and although they exerted pressure, they were unable to create too much of clear-cut note.</p> \n<p>Led by the indomitable Ashley Williams, Wales put bodies on the line and kept Belgium’s highly-rated attackers at arm’s length. But it was not just the defence since Bale and the midfielders worked tirelessly, too. Coleman keeps getting his tactics and organisation spot on. With Bale at the other end, it is a winning blend. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/12/wales-belgium-euro-2016-qualifying-match-report\">Match report: Wales 1-0 Belgium</a><br /><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/12/gareth-bale-wales-belgium-inspirational\">Bale proves full value with inspirational display for Wales </a><br /><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/chris-coleman-wales-belgium-euro-2016\">Coleman: ‘We have to stop thinking of ourselves as little old Wales</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-68b405db-b421-47a1-ad2c-a04b2e3c99a5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434355030476/61c92a66-e4ce-47f0-8d38-fd292b65c1de-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Gareth Bale and Wales team-mates celebrate Bale's 25th-minute goal against Belgium\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gareth Bale and Wales team-mates celebrate the deciding goal against Belgium.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>5) Wilmots leaves himself open</h2> \n<p>Before the tie with Wales, the Belgium manager, Marc Wilmots, insisted that all of the talk about his future – and that of many of his players – had been parked. The focus was exclusively on Wales. Yet on the day of the game, he became embroiled in a remarkable row. Wilmots had been tipped to take over at Schalke, having held talks with the Bundesliga club and he said that he would talk publicly about his future after the Wales game.</p> \n<p>Yet Schalke moved first, announcing that they had appointed Andr&eacute; Breitenreiter to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/26/roberto-di-matteo-resigns-schalke-coach-disagreement-club\">replace Roberto Di Matteo</a>, who resigned in May. Wilmots was furious and he immediately made his feelings known in an interview with Kicker. “To announce such a thing just hours before our crucial Euro 2016 qualifier is incredible and really bad form,” Wilmots said. “Schalke approached me, which is why it’s a bad joke when they make out now that they have turned me down.”</p> \n<p>Toby Alderweireld, the Belgium defender, told the Guardian that Wilmots had addressed his future with the players beforehand. “He told us before the game that he is staying,” Alderweireld said. Had the issue been a distraction? “No,” Alderweireld said. “As a group, we were focused on the result.” The subsequent defeat, however, gave Wilmots’ critics plenty of ammunition. <strong>DH</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/12/belgium-fans-trust-satnav-end-up-in-wrong-wales\">Belgium fans trust sat nav and end up in the wrong Wales</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2><strong>6) </strong>Northern Ireland architects of their own fate</h2> \n<p>Flinty Northern Ireland have finally vaulted a major psychological hurdle, as Saturday’s battling draw at home to Romania positions them nicely for Euro 2016 automatic qualification by September. The visit of Anghel Iordanescu’s side presented a stern test of character. And Northern Ireland’s industry, constantly compressing space for the group leaders, outlined a steadfast capacity to mix it when their normal, crisp, passing approach and fluidity along the channels to lone forward Kyle Lafferty starts to malfunction. Michael O’Neill’s men are now the architects of their own fate. Victories over Faroe Islands and Hungary will spirit them towards France. It helps that the Hungarians, two points adrift of Northern Ireland in third place, must play their Romanian rivals next. O’Neill’s job could get so much easier. If Lafferty, Steven Davis – “the brain of Northern Ireland” according to Iordanescu - and Jonny Evans, Northern Ireland’s best performers at the weekend, remain fit, it would be even better news. All three retain a solid presence which unquestionably carries the whole squad to greater heights and horizons. <strong>Julian Taylor</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/northern-ireland-romania-euro-2016-qualifying-match-report\">Match report: Northern Ireland 0-0 Romania</a></p> \n</blockquote>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434354121764/0095edf5-d6a7-463a-86d2-862c816330b1-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty/Action/PA/Euro 2016 qualifiers talking points","altText":"Euro 2016 qualifiers","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty/Action/PA/Euro 2016 qualifiers talking points"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434139394424/Gareth-Bale-and-Wales-tea-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Gareth Bale and Wales team-mates celebrate the deciding goal against Belgium.

That’s a long time, but we keep working hard, keep moving in the right direction and gaining experience all the time; that’s all you can do.</p> \n<p>“We don’t talk too much about the future, but the team are moving in the right direction. Everyone is gaining more experience, the younger players in the Premier League and, come next summer, they’ll have another year under their belt and more England caps. Experience is key going into the tournament and there is a lot of unfinished business from last summer. It’s something personally I cant wait to come around and put right. I’m sure everyone feels the same way.”</p> \n<p>England’s qualification group is hardly onerous. But having already visited Scotland and Italy in high-profile friendlies, the side will face France and Germany, then potentially Holland and Spain next season as they gear up for Euro 2016.

The 29-year-old is one shy of Sir Bobby Charlton’s record, with San Marino awaiting in September when qualification can effectively be secured. His eight goals in 10 internationals have contributed heavily to the side’s unbeaten record this season.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/slovenia-england-euro-2016-qualifier-match-report\">Slovenia 2-3 England | Euro 2016 qualifier match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Manchester United striker had missed a flurry of opportunities earlier in a frantic contest illuminated by Jack Wilshere’s first goals for the national side. “Wayne Rooney’s performance says a lot of things about him as a man,” said Hodgson. “Just before he took that chance he had taken a nasty blow from an elbow, which could have decked many a player and led to him losing his discipline. But it didn’t and he simply got up and played on.</p> \n<p>“The fact one or two chances had gone begging earlier also didn’t worry him because, when the ball fell to him four minutes from the end, he still stuck it away with aplomb. We can rely on that man. I’d have liked him to get a hat-trick today so all the talk of the record would have been finished, but he has plenty of time on his side to achieve that still.”</p> \n<p>Lineker was quick to congratulate Rooney, who now boasts 28 goals in qualification games for the World Cup or European Championships, on his achievement. “I’m pleased to be joined by Wayne Rooney on 48 goals,” he said. “It seemed, during a five-minute spell in the second half, it might not happen when he struck two over the bar, but Wayne’s been a consistently excellent player over the years.</p> \n<p>“I’m sure he will go on and surpass the great Sir Bobby Charlton. He’s still only 29 and he’s a formidable talent and he has a fabulous goalscoring record, especially in qualifiers.”</p> \n<p>Cesar was not cautioned for the elbow flung at the striker as the captains clashed inside the penalty area just after Slovenia’s equaliser, which had tied the game at 2-2. The pair had tangled once before, in a friendly at Wembley in 2009 when the England striker had won a penalty despite appearing to connect heavily with Cesar’s ankle. The Slovenian was booked and had subsequently spent a lengthy spell on the sidelines, describing the tackle as “stupid, stupid foul” at the time.“We thought it could have been a penalty,” said Hodgson of the incident in Ljubljana. “But the referee handled the game well. Slovenia are a strong, physical, aggressive team: Fabian Delph took an elbow to his jaw and Raheem Sterling a nasty kick at the end of the game as well. But the players showed their resilience. The team spirit is getting better all the time. They didn’t leave much on the field in terms of effort and determination.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-61235140-b8cb-4b8f-9c15-35aa07287ebb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434356506177/359706f9-fa9d-425d-a8da-2075daca0015-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jack Wilshere lets fly to score his second goal.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Wilshere lets fly to score his second goal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While there was frustration at the nature of the first-half goal which meant England trailed at the break, stemming as it did from a Phil Jones throw-in deep in Slovenia’s half, Hodgson was hugely encouraged by the recovery mounted courtesy of Wilshere’s eye-catching brace. “His whole performance was quality,” said the manager. “I’m very happy with the goals he’s scored but, in the second half in particular, he controlled that midfield. If we can keep him fit and he can get plenty of PL [Premier League] matches and international matches, at his young age we think we’ve got a good player going forward. “We know we have excellent technicians in midfield in Wilshere, Jordan Henderson and Delph, James Milner and Adam Lallana, and that they’ve all got goals in them. Now they have to prove it. We’ll need their goals. We can’t just rely on our front players.”</p> \n<p>The win means England have now gone 11 games unbeaten since their elimination from the World Cup in Brazil last June, with this their first season without defeat since 1990-91.</p> \n<p>“The team has made progress,” added Hodgson. “It’s a good achievement, completing a season of 10 games with eight wins and two draws. That’s not been done for over 20 years. The players deserve some credit for that, and get plenty of credit from me. Now we have to keep building on it. We want to keep that unbeaten run going.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434311560516/Wayne-Rooney-England-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Wayne Rooney celebrates scoring England's winner against Slovenia Photograph: Michael Regan/The FA Collection","credit":"Michael Regan/The FA Collection","altText":"Wayne Rooney England","cleanCaption":"Wayne Rooney celebrates scoring England's winner against Slovenia Photograph: Michael Regan/The FA Collection"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434304184235/71938095-d059-402a-aa16-0d5f97af270b-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jack Wilshere lets fly to score his second goal.

I scored a couple of goals, but I’ve been open in the past that I want to score more goals.</p> \n<p>“I am happy with my goals and hopefully I can get a few more.

If we factor in the next two competitions currently set for Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022, that trend towards developing markets carries even more weight.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e109eb09585eb4bc2fc8555a420f6966714eccdd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434364587180/c981dc4f-b61f-4502-acca-44125a36798e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"England's manager Bobby Robson poses with Ciao, the mascot of the 1990 World Cup.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s manager Bobby Robson poses with Ciao, the mascot of the 1990 World Cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Italia 90 took place in an era where attending a World Cup was not an outrageously extravagant idea for an adventurous football fan. There was no notion of hotels or restaurants bumping up their prices by insane percentages to rip off visitors. Tickets floated about at face value if you looked hard enough in most host cities, certainly in the group stage. Word got round in the streets of the names of shops and bars which were selling match tickets up to the eve of the game. There were no fan parks, it was all improvised for better or for worse. The idea of a group of corporate punters forming a crocodile in branded baseball hats following a pretty girl holding up a sign bearing the name of a vast conglomerate as they march to a tented village would not have got very far. That audience didn’t want to go to football anyway then.</p> \n<p>Confession: I retain the same blind love for Italia 90 today that struck me then. I was 18 years old, and it was beyond exciting for anyone who experienced it as a seminal World Cup experience. Luckily for me, not only was I at the right time of life to be able to plan my month around watching games, filling in wallcharts and so on, I was also old enough, and had enough free time in a post-exam lull, to actually go. The decision was spontaneous, made in the crazy excitement of the opening game, which I watched on telly with a couple of friends, Nick (Leeds United) and Paul (Everton).</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2014/feb/12/world-cup-25-stunning-moments-cameroon-argentina\">Cameroon v Argentina was dubbed the Miracle of Milan</a>. It was symbolic of how entrants from Africa were regarded that the BBC commentator described them, in a manner that seems so patronising today but was not intentional then, as “happy go lucky fellows”. They were able enough to not just compete with Argentina, the reigning champions, but to defeat them.</p> \n<p>We looked at each other after the final whistle confirmed one of the most improbable of all World Cup results with the same thought at the same time: Let’s go.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2010/oct/14/on-second-thoughts-italia-90\">On Second Thoughts: Italia 90 | Rob Smyth</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After a quick consultation with the wall chart, to determine who was playing where and what would be the best place to aim for, it was destination Genoa and Turin, armed with a couple of hundred quid and a sleeping bag. A fantastic group – Brazil, Sweden, Scotland and Costa Rica – was a great attraction, as was the fact it was significantly distant from England’s base in Sardinia. We wanted to enjoy the World Cup as peaceful football fans, without the bother of reputations shadowing our every step.</p> \n<p>There, with that awkward sentence for an English football-loving person to write, is another key to why Italia 90 mattered so much. In fact maybe it’s part of the explanation for why it matters so much more in England than in many of the other participant countries.</p> \n<p>God knows English football needed a tournament to salve wounds, to mend a broken reputation overseas, with the tragedies of Heysel and Hillsborough – which didn’t have the luxury then of the truth that is emerging at the current inquests all these years later – still so close in our minds and hearts.</p> \n<p>Pete Davies, the author of the outstanding account <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Played-Out-Story-Italia-x/dp/0224059548\">All Played Out</a>, summed up the ambience of the time in a recent interview with Esquire magazine. “The way the game is now derives, to a very great extent, from the transformation that Italia 90 affected. Prior to Italia 90 football in England was perceived as a squalid, hooligan-ridden, embarrassing sump of gormless violence. Our team was crap, our supporters were worse, and you did not talk about it over dinner.”</p> \n<p>We headed by train and ferry to Genoa, far from what was expected to be the madding crowd. We stopped off in Turin, the venue for Brazil’s opening game against Sweden. Then on to Genoa, to take in the surprise of Costa Rica beating Scotland, before Andy Roxburgh’s team redeemed themselves a bit by seeing off Sweden.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1100cb1155fbbf448da8efeb09d12a5402cc7ab4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434364824005/7caf3a2d-f642-4ecc-ac9d-0152c64c726c-326x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A young Amy Lawrence meets a Swedish fan in Genoa during the 1990 World Cup.\" width=\"326\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young Amy Lawrence meets a Swedish fan in Genoa during the 1990 World Cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Lawrence</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There was not enough accommodation for the many meanderers who had made Genoa base camp. The city officials decided the sensible thing was to keep the football fans together, so we were invited to sleep in the railway station. The daily routine went something like this: At around 6am, before the commuters had the misfortune of stepping over a series of comatose bodies on their way to work, the police gently woke us from our slumbers, we packed away our sleeping bags, dumped them in left luggage, and availed ourselves of the station showers for a wash and brush up. Some couldn’t quite manage that so ended up taking a soap and a shave in the ornate fountain which is the centre piece of the beautiful Piazza de Ferrari.</p> \n<p>The days were filled with impromptu football games in the square (there was a local kid who spent the whole time being Roberto Donadoni), the search for tickets, watching matches in cafes, conjuring up ways around the alcohol ban, enjoying the hospitality of the Genovese who brought out their children to have pictures alongside the colourful visitors and invited fans in for giant bowls of pasta.</p> \n<p>It was a true example of a catchphrase later bastardised by Fifa – this was the “football family” where anyone from anywhere was invited for one gigantic party. The evenings became louder, naturally, as the three main groups in town – the Scots, Swedes and Italians – joined in each others’ songs.</p> \n<p>On the day of Scotland v Sweden word got around that a band of pipers, in full regalia despite the sweltering heat, would lead a march through town to the Stadio Luigi Ferraris. Thousands of folk in kilts and Viking helmets mingled as they followed the music and danced to the match.</p> \n<p>Back in England, the team’s progress, and the lack of the kind of trouble everybody feared, was a huge part of the radical change that was coursing through our football in a post-Heysel and Hillsborough world. People who sneered at the game, accustomed to seeing only ugliness, found themselves unexpectedly swept along. Gascoigne, the “daft as a brush” boy who played with such spontaneity and wore his emotions so readily, captured public imagination, and presented a very different image of English football.</p> \n<p>In the coming seasons, with stadiums being reformed to meet all-seater requirements, Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch expressing the fan’s condition, the restrictions on foreign players being relaxed to open the doors to talent from across the world, the rebranding of the Premier League and arrival of Sky glitz, football would become more glamorous, more welcoming.</p> \n<p>The third-place play-off, contested by two desperately disappointed teams in England and Italy, turned out to be uplifting. After the medals had been doled out, all the players of both squads stood side by side clutching floral bouquets and they took a shared bow. It was an important moment, a bridge-building act of friendship and respect just five years after the nightmare of Heysel.</p> \n<p>For all that it means to English football, to Italians as the hosts whose fairytale didn’t come with a happy ending, to Cameroonians who hoped it would be the gateway to a major breakthrough for African footballers, there are also some other greatly changed nations for whom Italia 90 still has resonance. Four countries no longer exist in the way they did then. It was the last World Cup in which West Germany competed (unification came later in 1990). <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2007/jul/24/newsstory.sport9\">Yugoslavia began to break up in 1991</a>. Czechoslovakia split in 1992. This tournament represented the last appearance at a major finals of the Soviet Union team, as by the time the European Championship came around their place was taken up by the CIS, which was effectively just Russia.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-437658063__\n</div> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2014/may/15/england-world-cup-italia-1990-gary-lineker-diego-maradona\">Maybe it wasn’t the best World Cup you will ever see</a>. Not many Brazilians or Dutch will reflect with much fondness, which given their status as aesthetic football nations is revealing. The statistics are not positive – the fewest goals per game in the competition’s history and the most red cards at that point.</p> \n<p>But still, it was so profoundly important.

The France international, who joined Juve on a free transfer from Manchester United in 2012 and is under contract there until June 2019, is worth a reported &pound;80m.</p> \n<p>“A Pogba transfer? Obviously it would be a decision made by the club and not by the technical team,” Allegri said to Gazzetta dello Sport. “When you talk about certain figures, it’s difficult to say no. But if Paul remains in Turin, he should do it with the right mentality and without having any regrets.”</p> \n<p>Allegri, meanwhile, firmly believes that his club has uncovered a gem in the Spanish striker &Aacute;lvaro Morata. The player left Real Madrid in search of more playing time last summer and this season became one of the most dangerous strikers in European football.</p> \n<p>“If we must sell him, I hope the club at least gets €70-80m for him,” Allegri said. “This is Morata’s current value. I think we must focus on him and also on [the Juventus forward Kingsley] Coman, another youngster with excellent skills, that needs a bit more time to reach his top level.”</p> \n<p>Morata scored twice against Real Madrid to knock his former club out of the Champions League semi-finals, and also scored in his team’s 3-1 defeat to Barcelona in the final of the European competition.</p> \n<p>Real, who sold the 22-year-old to the Italian giants last summer for €20m (&pound;15m), have the option to buy him back for a set fee of €30m (&pound;22m) this summer.</p> \n<p>Allegri is also uncertain on whether he will have Carlos Tevez in his team for the 2015-16 campaign.

Overton replaces Liam Plunkett who has been ruled out with a thigh strain. Overton joins his twin Craig Overton in the squad. The 21-year-old brothers are both uncapped at England level.”</p> \n<p>Jamie, the younger twin by three minutes, was first called up to the England squad as a 19-year-old during the 2013 one-day series against Australia. He did not feature but his early call-up showed that the selectors were interested in harnessing his height and pace.</p> \n<p>His progress stalled due to injuries and inconsistent form and he did not add to his 14 List A appearances last season. Jamie’s record in the one-day format remains strong, with 20 wickets at 27, compared to Craig’s average of 54.20 for his 10 wickets.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5cdbf728ee1f4727d09927fee46b8e254414cf4f/0_81_4672_2802/4672.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2802,"width":4672,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Harry Trump/JMP/REX Shutterstock/Harry Trump/JMP/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Somerset’s Jamie and Craig Overton have both been called up to England’s ODI squad.

After that narrow, exasperating defeat at the Oval England were soundly beaten on the south coast by New Zealand by three wickets on another batsman’s paradise.</p> \n<p>Kane Williamson, magnificently measured, hit an effortless century; Ross Taylor, whose rehabilitation into the Kiwi side after the shenanigans of two years ago has been a beacon of dignified common sense, also reached three figures in the manner of an elder statesman. Thus the tourists were able to overhaul their target without too much bother. New Zealand were assisted by a fallible performance in the field from England. Four chances of varying difficulty went to ground and in this series, in particular, the bowlers need all they help they can muster.</p> \n<p>In another age England’s total would have been deemed formidable. In the twentieth century 302 won nine times out of ten but there has been rampant inflation, triggered by the advent of T20 cricket, flatter pitches, fresh fielding regulations, bats with a sweet spot as large as a football and faster, smaller outfields. Pity the poor bowlers. In golf the players now hit the ball further so what did they do? Lengthen the courses. In cricket batsmen hit the ball further so what is the response? Make the boundaries shorter.</p> \n<p>The defeat is a setback to the brave new world of England’s ODI cricket but it need not be a major one. England stuck to their determination to play carefree, fearless cricket. Indeed the phrase “We must bat the overs” must now be as outmoded in cricket dressing rooms as “Get me a couple of pints of bitter so I can wind down after the game”.</p> \n<p>England’s total might once have guaranteed victory but it now constitutes no more than a par score in 50-over cricket. There were more moments when onlookers were aghast at the audacity of the strokeplay, especially when Ben Stokes and Sam Billings combined in a pulsating sixth-wicket 61-run partnership in 34 balls. Stokes, as ruddy as a blacksmith, bludgeoned while Billings deflected impishly.</p> \n<p>Yet England will surely take note that they lost five wickets for 14 runs in 20 balls at the end of their innings. From 288 for five in the 42nd over they would have expected more. They certainly needed more. However, the captain, Eoin Morgan, was unrepentant about the batting. “We lost it with the ball”, he said afterwards. “Kane and Ross hurt us. If we had got one of those two early there was a chance.” He insisted that 302 “wasn’t bad” and that he was not disappointed that England failed to bat their 50 overs.</p> \n<p>Morgan is adamant that England should retain their aggressive outlook. “We are trying to change the process and the mindset with the bat and that may take time. I don’t want the team hesitating and questioning how they go about it. The guys are really enjoying the way they are playing.” Currently the mood beyond the dressing room is forgiving.</p> \n<p>After such a constipated World Cup there is relief that England are playing with fresh faces and freedom. The team is undergoing a rite of passage. The old ways had to be banished, therefore no backward step is permitted. It is a severe culture change, assisted by the presence here of New Zealand, whom England are minded to imitate.</p> \n<p>Hence the players must be given leeway. It will not do to be too grumpy at losing five for 14, especially when the final total is in excess of 300 for the third game in a row. But if this endearing new side is going to win their fair share of matches as well as friends, they will need to be smarter and to avoid squandering such positions. For the moment they are experimenting with having fun.</p> \n<p>The middle order fired again without producing the major innings. Joe Root purred along until he became tangled up against the unprepossessing spin of Mitchell Santner. Morgan, after a relatively watchful 71 from 82 balls, heaved and missed against Williamson, while Stokes smashed 68 from 47 balls.</p> \n<p>However, a callow tail betrayed their inexperience from the 42nd over onwards and the late-order collapse sealed England’s fate. For the Kiwis Ben Wheeler, on his debut, impressed – yes, it’s possible to impress with figures of three for 63 in this era.</p> \n<p>New Zealand stuttered at the start. Martin Guptill and Brendon McCullum were lbw to David Willey and Mark Wood respectively. But Williamson and Taylor could not be parted for 32 overs, during which they compiled 206 runs. For Williamson especially, batting seemed an effortless occupation.</p> \n<p>He played Adil Rashid, who did not bowl too badly, superbly. A combination of nimble footwork and deft timing sent the ball wherever the fielders weren’t. He took 18 from a blameless Rashid over, toying with boundary fielders and bowler alike: a masterclass of gentle demolition. And he also played the quicker bowlers pretty well.</p> \n<p>Taylor was not quite so fluent and was eventually out to an ugly heave against Willey. Thereafter the Kiwi tail, almost as careless as England’s, contrived to lose wickets needlessly, as if eager to be in unison with their opponents in this “friendly” series. England’s profligacy with the bat at the end of their innings had cost them dearly, whatever Morgan’s interpretation. But despite the defeat, no one is complaining much that they are going to stick to their new gung-ho style.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434304574860/Ross-Taylor-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ross Taylor of New Zealand is bowled by England's David Willey for 110 runs as Jos Buttler watches on behind the stumps at the Rose Bowl.\r  Photograph: Sarah Ansell/REX Shutterstock","credit":"Sarah Ansell/REX Shutterstock/Sarah Ansell/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Ross Taylor","cleanCaption":"Ross Taylor of New Zealand is bowled by England's David Willey for 110 runs as Jos Buttler watches on behind the stumps at the Rose Bowl.\r  Photograph: Sarah Ansell/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-14T17:57:01Z","lastModified":"2015-06-14T23:05:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Vic Marks","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/vicmarks"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["England v New Zealand 2015","England cricket team","New Zealand cricket team","Cricket","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/england-v-new-zealand-2015","webTitle":"England v New Zealand 2015"},{"id":"sport/england-cricket-team","webTitle":"England cricket team"},{"id":"sport/new-zealand-cricket-team","webTitle":"New Zealand cricket team"},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Vic Marks","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/vicmarks"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/14/new-zealand-england-one-day-international","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49nf5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/14/new-zealand-england-one-day-international","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/14/new-zealand-england-one-day-international"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434304574860/Ross-Taylor-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ross Taylor of New Zealand is bowled by England's David Willey for 110 runs as Jos Buttler watches on behind the stumps at the Rose Bowl.\r  Photograph: Sarah Ansell/REX Shutterstock","credit":"Sarah Ansell/REX Shutterstock/Sarah Ansell/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Ross Taylor","cleanCaption":"Ross Taylor of New Zealand is bowled by England's David Willey for 110 runs as Jos Buttler watches on behind the stumps at the Rose Bowl.\r  Photograph: Sarah Ansell/REX Shutterstock"}},"importance":0,"kicker":{"title":"Cricket"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"replace","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://media.guim.co.uk/b4d0425a19d55718b3adc49ec8c661ac14b8c60b/0_170_5184_3110/1000.jpg","height":600,"width":1000}}]}],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5cdbf728ee1f4727d09927fee46b8e254414cf4f/0_81_4672_2802/4672.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2802,"width":4672,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Harry Trump/JMP/REX Shutterstock/Harry Trump/JMP/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Somerset’s Jamie and Craig Overton have both been called up to England’s ODI squad.

Curry sparked a 25-14 run with 13 points including three from the arc, two of them well-contested. He wouldn’t be denied and finished with seven threes and 37 total points. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/14/nba-finals-2015-cleveland-cavaliers-v-golden-state-warriors-live\">NBA finals 2015: Cleveland Cavaliers 91-104 Golden State Warriors – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Just as in Game 4, the Warriors found another gear near the end to leave LeBron James and company choking on their dust. It offset another extraordinary game by James. The man with CHOSEN1 tattooed across his back did everything but hold mass on his way to 40 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists.</p> \n<p>“He has the ball in his hands a lot. Stick with the program. Don’t get discouraged if he makes shots. He’s going to,” Curry said when asked about how to deal with James. “Over the course of 48 minutes, we hope we wear him down to make it very tough on him.”</p> \n<p>Yet James had to do too much of the work on his own. After losing All-Star team-mates Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, the Cavaliers have been making do with role players asked to shoulder an increased role. While those players’ defense has been up to the challenge, they’ve had trouble filling the scoring hole left by their injured colleagues.</p> \n<p>James was a one-man wrecking crew as he reprised Thursday’s penetration-focused attack, taking the ball to the rim against pretty much every Warrior who tried to defend him. He hit 15-34 and generally got the type of shots he wanted, but the Warriors continued to keep his team-mates in check. The other Cavaliers went a collective 17-47 and only two players besides James shot any free throws. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Curry could lean on his running mate Klay Thompson. All season the Warriors, led by the prolific scoring duo, ran roughshod over Western Conference rivals like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Like their Hollywood counterparts, the Warriors seem blessed. Their two stars inherited NBA DNA from their fathers, and were fitted into a “sexy, cute” Hollywood-ready style that’s a successor to Showtime, and the very apogee of fast-paced West Coast basketball. </p> \n<p>The sun-kissed Golden State duo hadn’t suffered much adversity on their way to 67 wins during the regular season, and rolled through the playoffs with very little resistance. But the Cavaliers made up for it over the first four games, slowing the Warriors pace with grind-it-out offense and skintight defense.</p> \n<p>Returning home the Warriors bounded out to an early 13-7 lead after getting four straight transition buckets. They’d get only 10 more points that way for the rest of the game as the Cavaliers caulked their transition D, and tied the scores up at the end of the first quarter behind eight points from James and JR Smith. The Warriors shut down Smith from then on, holding him to six points the rest of the way.</p> \n<p>Cavs coach David Blatt answered the Warriors small lineup by sitting center Timofey Mozgov after the first quarter and playing him but nine minutes all night, one game after the Russian scored a career-high 28 points. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile the Warriors beat the Cavaliers on the boards 43-37 and even grabbed 11 offensive rebounds, one more than Cleveland. The Warriors won the points in the paint too, 38-34.It raised further questions about Blatt’s decision to keep Mozgov on the bench, costing them their big inside advantage. </p> \n<p>“When you’re coaching a game you’ve got to make decisions,” said Blatt, defending the move. “I felt that gave us the best chance for us to stay in the game.”<br /></p> \n<p>After entering half-time with a one-point lead, the Warriors tightened around James, who couldn’t get anything to fall, shooting 1-6 in a quarter where only three players scored. Tristan Thompson scored 10 on his way 19 in the game. </p> \n<p>Golden State had nobody with more than two baskets in the third and shot 7-21 overall, but had assists on six of them, and that ball movement carried over to the fourth, as they went 9-17 led by Curry, who was 5-7 and had 17 for the quarter.</p> \n<p>Though it was rough-riding when they went down 2-1, Golden State have smoothed out the journey the last two games and shown the kind of resilience some felt they lacked. In the process, Curry and Thompson have been able to write the script and are moving quickly towards their Hollywood ending.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434335984941/acc8ca99-7b81-466a-91d5-5ba9ec54981e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ezra Shaw/Getty Images","altText":"Steph Curry","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T02:55:54Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T12:10:13Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":32,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["NBA finals","Cleveland Cavaliers","Golden State Warriors","Basketball","NBA","Sport","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/nba-finals","webTitle":"NBA finals"},{"id":"sport/cleveland-cavaliers","webTitle":"Cleveland Cavaliers"},{"id":"sport/golden-state-warriors","webTitle":"Golden State Warriors"},{"id":"sport/basketball","webTitle":"Basketball"},{"id":"sport/nba","webTitle":"NBA"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/14/nba-finals-golden-state-warriors-one-game-from-title-after-beating-cleveland-cavaliers","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49nt3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/14/nba-finals-golden-state-warriors-one-game-from-title-after-beating-cleveland-cavaliers","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/14/nba-finals-golden-state-warriors-one-game-from-title-after-beating-cleveland-cavaliers"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434335984941/acc8ca99-7b81-466a-91d5-5ba9ec54981e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Steph Curry came up with some huge points in the last moment of the game to help seal victory for his team.

Smith has been second only to Andre Iguodala in the Warriors’ MVP competition should they win this series: he has brought Knicks basketball to the Finals, and we are all lesser for it. <br /></p> \n<p>But, as I must stress, I have no idea with this particular series. The sense of the basketball world rightening itself that took place on Thursday might just be a trick to lull me into a false sense of security.</p> \n<p>What is obvious is that the outcome of tonight’s game will clear things up immensely. Not all 3-2 series leads are the same: If the Cavaliers win, they merely keep their crazy championships hopes alive. If the Warriors win, they essentially put a stranglehold on the series. We’ll find out which it will be together.<br /></p> \n<p>As always, we here at the Guardian are always looking for your contributions, so email your comments, questions, and jokes to <a href=\"mailto:Hunter.Felt@theguardian.com\">Hunter.Felt@theguardian.com</a> or tweet them to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HunterFelt\">@HunterFelt</a> and we’ll use them throughout tonight’s liveblog.

The legs were tired after yesterday and the whole team suffered because of what they did. They all lifted themselves. Ian Stannard rode on the front behind the break for 100 kilometres, I don’t know how he did it.”</p> \n<p>The final stage resulted in a British one-two, with the 22-year-old Simon Yates showing he too is ready for the Tour by outsprinting Van Garderen and the 2013 world road race champion, Rui Costa, for second place, and clinching fifth overall, plus the best young rider’s white jersey.</p> \n<p>Another Briton, the former team pursuiter Steve Cummings, staked his place at the Tour for the MTN-Qhubeka squad, by figuring in the day’s main breakaway and leading the race over the penultimate climb until the race favourites made their moves in the final kilometres.</p> \n<p>Froome started the final stage 18 seconds behind Van Garderen, who had taken the race leader’s yellow jersey from the 2014 Tour winner, Vincenzo Nibali, when the Italian cracked on a short, steep climb close to the end of the stage. That thin advantage, and the 10 seconds bonus on offer for winning the stage, meant that Sky had to ensure their leader was in a position to dislodge the American on the ascent to the finish and, if possible, take the stage victory.</p> \n<p>On the steepest section of the climb, with 2.5km remaining, Froome made a typical attack to swoop past Cummings and open a few metres gap on Van Garderen. In a carbon copy of the previous day’s final phase, Van Garderen slipped gradually backwards as Froome pulled away in his ungainly but efficient climbing style, like a praying mantis in its death throes, arms akimbo, legs spinning wildly and his head constantly flicking up and down.</p> \n<p>Van Garderen has twice finished fifth in the Tour and looks set to be another major actor in July, but he seemed to have gone too deep in his initial response to Froome’s attack. He slowed definitively with a kilometre and a half to go, allowing Yates and Costa to close on him, with Yates taking the six second time bonus for second place. The upshot was Team Sky’s fourth Dauphin&eacute; title in five years, making up for Froome’s mixed fortunes in the 2014 event when he lost the overall lead after a heavy crash.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/chrisfroome/statuses/610100702447304704\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Done! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dauphine?src=hash\">#Dauphine</a> 👍😊 <a href=\"http://t.co/KvUBpC5dC7\">pic.twitter.com/KvUBpC5dC7</a></p>— Chris Froome (@chrisfroome) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisfroome/status/610100702447304704\">June 14, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>If Froome emerged from the Dauphin&eacute; as the favourite for the Tour de France, Nibali did enough to suggest he too will be at his best when the Tour starts in Utrecht on 4 July, and as in 2012 and 2014 in the Dauphin&eacute; he looked to be carefully selecting the moments in the race when he wanted to test himself.</p> \n<p>He went missing in the first major sort-out, stage five to Pra-Loup, and did so again on Saturday, but figured in a day-long escape on Friday’s rain-hit stage through the Vercors and shredded the field with a lengthy effort at the foot of the climb to Modane.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434298309945/Chris-Froome-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chris Froome also won the Criterium du Dauphine in 2013 on his way to victory in the Tour de France.

There is no general appetite to undertake the effort and expense of a successful effort to deliver doping-free sport. These are not my words. They come in a 2013 report led by Dick Pound, the former chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency, when asked to examine why testing programmes are so unsuccessful. But they cut to the heart of the chase.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/13/uk-athletics-mo-farah-alberto-salazar\">UK Athletics will fully support Mo Farah if he cuts ties with Alberto Salazar</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Because for all the recent talk of micro-dosing and other cutting-edge techniques in the – unproven – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/13/uk-athletics-mo-farah-alberto-salazar\" title=\"\">allegations against Mo Farah’s coach, Alberto Salazar</a>, we should not forget this: tests exist for all the major performance-enhancers, including EPO, human growth hormone, testosterone, designer steroids and stimulants. We are far better at identifying banned drugs than we have ever been. The science is far less of a problem than resources and willpower.</p> \n<p>No one knows how many athletes cheat. When questioned in 2013 Pound reckoned that 10% was a “conservative” number. An anonymous survey of over 2,000 athletes, conducted by researchers on behalf of Wada in 2011, estimated 29% of athletes at the world championships and 45% at the Pan-Arab Games admitted they had knowingly violated anti-doping regulations by using a prohibited substance or method in the past 12 months, an astonishing figure if true.</p> \n<p>Yet we do know this: despite the advances in testing and the formation of Wada in 1999, the percentage of positive doping tests – around 1% – has not changed much since 1985. For all the efforts of the anti-doping community it is too easy for athletes to slip through the net.</p> \n<p>What can be done? In his 2013 report Pound makes 90 recommendations and while there are more bullet points than magic bullets, there are a number of measures that could alter the shape of the battle. For a start anti-doping agencies should use the $400 Carbon Isotope Ratio (CIR) tests far more frequently than they do. Want to know how effective these are? Ask Justin Gatlin. He would never have been found using testosterone in 2006 without one. In almost every case, though, anti-doping agencies use the cheaper Testosterone/Epitestosterone (TE) test first – with CIR used as a nail-in-the-coffin test only after a positive TE one.</p> \n<p>When I spoke to Victor Conte, the man at the heart of the Balco scandal in 2003, last week he pointed out CIR had other benefits too, including extending the detection period for fast-acting testosterone gels and creams from a few hours to several days. “If somebody uses this stuff at night and they showed up the next morning and they did CIR they would bust you,” he said. “If they did the TE ratio test – sorry, you are under the radar.”</p> \n<p>CIR tests can also be used retrospectively, allowing investigators to examine frozen samples. The announcement of comprehensive retesting of samples from the Beijing and London Olympic Games wouldn’t just ruffle a few feathers, it would show that those in authority were dedicated to clean sport.</p> \n<p>As Pound noted, missed tests are also being used by athletes to avoid testing without consequences. Yet here the rules have recently softened. It used to be that if you were absent three times over a rolling 18-month period when the testers came knocking it would count as a failed test. Now that has been cut to 12 months, reducing the timescale for which you can be held liable for missing a test.</p> \n<p>“It is like a speeding ticket on your driving record,” Conte says. “At the end of the one year, or whatever time you got the first missed test, it drops off. This is a big loophole because athletes on performance-enhancing drugs are able to get a steroid cycle in without any consequences.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/11/lance-armstrong-interviews-deconstructed\">Lance Armstrong’s latest interviews deconstructed | William Fotheringham</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Many in the anti-doping world would like athletes to be allowed only one missed test in 12 months, with the second counting as a doping charge, to increase the pressure on those cheating.</p> \n<p>A third issue: as things stand, anti-doping agencies make a distinction only between in-competition and out-of-competition testing. That is too imprecise. Out of competition could mean anything from a few days before a major race to the off-season. An extra category, revealing how many times an athlete was tested between November and March when they are more likely to be using steroids to put on strength and muscle, would be welcome.</p> \n<p>Somewhere approaching a gold standard would be to have Wada staff in every country, coupled with an independent testing agency for every sport. Last year Wada’s director general, David Howman, said that would cost $100m a year. With every doping scandal and allegation it seems a small price to pay but no one seems willing to stump up the cash. While the IOC got $7.75bn from its deal with NBC to show the next six Olympic and Winter Olympic Games, Wada’s budget is only $26.5m.</p> \n<p>Still, there are people fighting the good fight and it was reassuring to hear Ed Warner, the head of UK Athletics, urge the IAAF to spend more of its reserves to tackle doping.</p> \n<p>“This is something that has been with us forever and feels like it probably will be with us forever,” he sighed. He is right. Yet while sport may never completely cauterise the damage from doping, it still needs to do far more to stem the bleeding.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434305542615/Sean-Ingle-column-illustr-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"We are far better at identifying banned drugs than we have ever been.

I also was with the team and John Stiner at the altitude camp he spoke about in Park City, and believe his report as well.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/03/mo-farah-training-camp-documentary-alleged-drug-use-alberto-salazar-\" title=\"\">In the BBC Panorama documentary </a>Kara Goucher alleged Salazar had coached Rupp to get a therapeutic use exemption for an intravenous drip before the 2011 World Championships. Under Wada rules, such drips are prohibited and anyone caught manipulating the TUE process to get one would be liable for a ban. She also claimed Salazar tried to get her to take prescription thyroid medicine to lose weight after the birth of her son.</p> \n<p>Stiner was the masseur who alleged he saw a bottle of Androgel, a testosterone gel, in Salazar’s training camp in Park City in 2008. And it was Magness who made the most serious allegation of all, telling Panorama he had documented evidence that Salazar had given the banned steroid testosterone to Rupp when he was 16.</p> \n<p>“I have never met Steve but from all accounts believe him to be an honest individual. I firmly believe that any and all performance-enhancing drugs activity within the NOP while I was there was limited to Galen Rupp,” Rohatinsky said.</p> \n<p>Among the charges against Salazar are that he gave the banned steroid testosterone to Rupp when he was 16, coached Rupp to get a TUE so he could use an intravenous drip before the 2011 World Championships and flouted several other doping rules. Salazar and Rupp deny all charges and there is no suggestion that Farah has done anything wrong.</p> \n<p>According to the American news website ProPublica, at least 17 people who have worked with Salazar have now spoken out against him. Rohatinsky, the latest person to come forward, said he had become particularly suspicious seeing Rupp win a 10,000m silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics behind Farah.</p> \n<p>“Watching that race live was surreal,” he said. “Seeing someone I had trained with consistently for two years not too long before – and beaten several times in races in the years prior to that in college – push through that last lap and accelerate on the homestretch to beat the likes of the Bekele brothers was incredible. And when I say incredible I mean it in the literal sense of the word. How does that amount of progress happen in that short a time frame? Supporters always point to hard work but we all worked our butts off. It reminds me of the Lance Armstrong commercial, What Am I On?</p> \n<p>“The entire time I was with the group there was always what I would call a wall of separation between Alberto/Galen and the rest of the group. Galen was very much Alberto’s son while the rest of the group were his athletes. In saying this I will give credit to Alberto, he worked his butt off for all of us and was very dedicated to taking care of the needs of everyone in the group. But that wall was always there and the level of secrecy and seclusion was definitely palpable.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile tThe chair of UK Athletics Ed Warner has told the BBC’s Sportsweek that his organisation had spoken to Farah “very frequently” over the past week and had no fears that he would return to top form later in the summer. “All things considered I think he’s in a good frame of mind in difficult circumstances,” he said. “He is going to get out there and show the great athlete he is in the summer, I am convinced of that.”</p> \n<p>But Lord Coe, who is running for the presidency of the IAAF, global athletics’ governing body, agreed it had “not been a good period” for the sport. He also admitted he would “probably not” sever ties with Salazar if he was in Farah’s shoes.</p> \n<p>“If Mo is satisfied that there’s nothing to answer then he will want to keep what has been an extremely good coaching and training relationship,” he said. “I’m sure he will be weighing all that up but dependent upon the answer Mo gives. We have to be very sure that the testimony that has been given stands scrutiny.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434311524106/Alberto-Salazar-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The pressure on Alberto Salazar intensified when another of his former athletes backed the full extent the allegations made against the coach.
