It was getting irritating. Jason Holder and Denesh Ramdin had been batting for the past 32 overs, adding 105 for the seventh wicket to frustrate England. The pitch was slow, offering little, and the second new ball already more than 30 overs old.</p> \n<p>Before the over started Anderson, wearying, had walked back to his mark and engaged in conversation with Stuart Broad, standing at mid-off. “Try some leg cutters,” said Broad, “hold the seam straight down rather than across, fingers alongside and just rip it.” So Anderson gave it a go. The first one, to Ramdin, failed to grip on the pitch and held its line, and the batsman, a half century to his name already, defended it easily enough on off-stump. Anderson tried again. This time the seam caught the ground, the ball deviated away from Ramdin’s defensive prod, took the outside edge, and Alastair Cook made a tumbling catch at first slip. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/18/west-indies-england-first-test-match-report\" title=\"\">Anderson wheeled across to the legside in triumph</a>.</p> \n<p>Afterwards, Anderson acknowledged the part that his bowling partner had played in creating the record-breaking delivery. Bowling can be a solitary occupation, but within that it can also be collaborative. Broad’s habitual position at mid-off or mid-on when Anderson is bowling, and that of Anderson in the same positions when Broad is operating, are significant, at odds with the customary pace-bowlers post-over stroll to fine leg to graze and catch breath. The pair are in constant communication, and, as with the leg-cutter, bounce ideas from one to the other, communicating them through to Cook in his executive role.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/2005-alternative-history-greatest-ashes\">2005 and all that: an alternative history of the greatest Ashes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That fast bowlers hunt in pairs (leaving aside the exception of the West Indies side of the decade from mid-70s to 80s, who operated as an interchangeable pack) is one of the cliches of cricket. Some have become such that one bowler tends not be mentioned without the other: Fred Trueman forever allied with Brian Statham; Ray Lindwall with Keith Miller; Larwood and Voce; Hall and Griffith, Lillee and Thomson; Botham and Willis; Donald and Pollock; McGrath and Gillespie; and so on. Some are simply identified by first names, or even abbreviations, alone: Waz ’n’ Waqar; Curtly and Courtney.</p> \n<p>It will never be Jimmy and Stuart, but Broad and Anderson (somehow it trips off the tongue better that way round) should be included in the list. When they do so in Cardiff, no pair of England bowlers will have taken the field with more wickets between them than their 676, already 56 more than the total Botham and Willis had accrued by the end of the latter’s final Test in 1984. In matches they have played together, Anderson and Broad have taken 569 wickets – 296 to Anderson, 273 to Broad – which means a further 11 will see them overtake the Botham-Willis alliance.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/06/ashes-2015-a-to-z\">Ashes 2015: the A to Z of Ashes history</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Partnerships such as this work in separate but distinct ways. The collaborative element, the sharing of information and ideas, is an important one but so too is the competition that such a relationship can create. A personal illustration might be the couple of years at Middlesex when I opened the bowling with Allan Jones. We were friends, travelled to matches together, shared a beer together. But he knew, because I told him, that although I enjoyed his own success and the contribution it made to the team effort, part of me still begrudged him every wicket he got because it was one fewer for me to try and take.</p> \n<p>It would be unusual if Broad and Anderson did not harbour similarly sentiments. Indeed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/27/englands-stuart-broad-puts-up-his-dukes-as-he-relishes-villainous-role\" title=\"\">Broad himself might be entitled to feel more than a little miffed</a> at the perception of the relative values of the two when it comes to the England team. In the lead-up to this Ashes series much has been made of the importance of Anderson, and his use of the new ball, to any possible England success. For some years, it is Anderson whose brilliance is seen as being absolutely integral to England, and there is no question that he has earned his place in the pantheon of great England cricketers. Broad on the other hand, is viewed as mercurial, inconsistent, off-the-pace all too often, and not infrequently the source of public opprobrium. Where Anderson’s place is inviolate, Broad’s often appears to be hanging by a thread.</p> \n<p>Look at the records of the two bowlers over the past two and a half years. Between them, they have taken fractionally more than half of England’s 459 wickets in that time. But which of them has taken most and at what cost? The answer to the first part is neither: since new year 2013 Anderson and Broad have both taken 115 Test wickets. They have done so at an average, for Anderson, of 27.00, and for Broad, of 26.53. Anderson has taken five wickets in an innings on five occasions and had a single 10-wicket match, the Trent Bridge Test at the start of the last Ashes series here. Broad though has seven five-wicket hauls in that same period and a 10-wicket match at Chester-le-Street in that same Ashes series. Anderson’s Nottingham haul, and that of Broad in the north east, were huge contributing factors in the two victories that secured that series. It may not be how the general cricket public perceives it but the Broad and Anderson partnership is of equals.</p> \n<h2>How the Ashes pace attacks compare </h2> \n<p><strong>England </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Jimmy Anderson </strong>England’s highest wicket taker and part of a formidable duo with Stuart Broad. When the ball swings and he can pursue a full length, there is no finer bowler in the world, his command of the ball mesmerising. Also dangerous when reversing the old ball. Has to work a lot harder for wickets when there is no lateral movement. Unusually, his default to left handers is to swing the ball away from them rather than challenge the pads.</p> \n<p><strong>Stuart Broad</strong> A counterpoint to Anderson. Broad can have quiet periods and then suddenly will get on a roll when wickets seem an inevitability. He has been successful when bowling a fuller length but it does not naturally suit the arc of his swing and can tend to float. When under pressure, he tends to drop his length back. Not a huge swinger of the ball, but height lends him bounce and he has an excellent bouncer.</p> \n<p><strong>Mark Wood</strong> Can be rapid and a relative lack of height means he is a skiddy bowler. Short run and explosive action, he tries to bowl a full length from which he can swing it, similar to Simon Jones. He is an excellent exponent of reverse swing which will be important if the weather stays dry. He has played few first class matches and, coupled with injury, there is a question mark over his stamina: after an excellent debut Test at Lord’s he was off the pace at Headingley. Will need careful management.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74fe817faa504b8f1534077970285d3bed4de3db\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436203821333/d1dd35f0-940b-41d0-ae35-81a5e24534a3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Wood's reverse swing could be crucial.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Wood’s reverse swing could be crucial.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Steve Finn</strong> Starting to get some confidence back after a trying two years. He is still not back to the sort of devastating pace he showed in India and New Zealand three years ago. There are kinks in his action that persist but he is still pacy enough to cause problems. He retains the capacity to take wickets and may well be used during the series.</p> \n<p><strong>Liam Plunkett</strong> Tall, willing, fast at times, and extremely fit. He too can exploit a fullish length, targeting the top of off-stump, but in the past has been used to rough up the opposition as well. Like Finn, he could well be used on a rotational basis, if not during this series then in the next six months.</p> \n<p><strong>Australia</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Mitchell Johnson</strong> Nothing more than a simple change to the angle of his approach transformed him from a figure of fun to a world class bowler to be feared. Probably the fastest bowler in the world now, he will play a huge part in targeting England’s lower order. Can have his confidence dented though and has an unhappy experience of bowling in England. Rarely swings the ball into the right-hander intentionally but occasionally it clicks into place. His low delivery arm means his bouncer skids nastily.</p> \n<p><strong>Mitchell Starc</strong> Has the potential to be the bowler of the series now that Ryan Harris has been ruled out. A tall, pacy left-armer who swings the ball into the right hander and will have noted the success of Trent Boult earlier in the summer. He will enjoy bowling to England’s plethora of left handed batsmen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfd4d50ec6d1ff239e5a5ac793f6ad7e258917ab\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436203934782/a45700a1-a356-47fa-a4cc-6045de7315a2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mitchell Starc could be bowler of the series.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitchell Starc could be bowler of the series.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Josh Hazlewood</strong> Tall, accurate and quick enough, he might take time to adjust his length to the demands of bowling over here. Once he has done so, he could well complete a formidable pace trio with Johnson and Starc. Comparisons are inevitable: for Hazlewood it is with Glenn McGrath.</p> \n<p><strong>Peter Siddle</strong> An absolutely indefatigable right-armer who for the cause will bowl until he drops, pick himself up and go some more. If Hazlewood cannot yet be trusted to do the stock job, then there is no one better than Siddle. Having said this, his pace is said to be down on what it once was.</p> \n<p><strong>Pat Cummins</strong> Called into the squad following the departure of Harris. He was first selected when 18, the youngest Australian debutant for six decades, and immediately took six wickets against South Africa. Still only 22, he has suffered serious injury though and has not played a first class match for almost a year and six only in his career.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436201941874/Stuart-Broad-and-James-An-005.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Stuart Broad and James Anderson celebrate during the second Test against New Zealand at Headingley in May.

Fresh from spending their previous evening listening to tales of derring-do from the legendary all-rounder Sir Ian Botham over a beer, England held their penultimate training session in Cardiff on Monday before the much-anticipated first Ashes Test with Australia.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/2005-alternative-history-greatest-ashes\">2005 and all that: an alternative history of the greatest Ashes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Alastair Cook took a long look at his two spin options, the England captain netting against both Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, while fast bowler Stuart Broad struck Gary Ballance in the stomach with a rising delivery. That eye-watering moment was as close as it got to an injury scare and spirits in the camp appear high, despite an on-off afternoon with rain around.</p> \n<p>Australia’s session in the morning was equally interrupted, both by the South Wales weather and a visit from the Prince of Wales. A patron of Glamorgan, the prince met with players from both sides and was presented with a shirt by the touring captain, Michael Clarke.</p> \n<p>If the experience of his batsman Adam Voges was anything to go by – he and the heir to the throne discussed air travel, apparently – talk was very much of the small variety and certainly when compared to Botham’s chats with the England players on Sunday evening, in an informal drinks evening organised by Andrew Strauss, the director of cricket.</p> \n<p>“It was great last night,” said wicketkeeper Jos Buttler, who was quick to spot disparities between a bygone era and the modern day game. “It was like story time with your grandad, really. Everyone sat around and listened to Beefy’s stories about the rockstar life he led. It was quite different, the way he went about it to how our preparation has been. Situations like that arise and you pinch yourself – he is one of the greats.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think he warmed up as much as we do. He just had a warm bath in the morning and got straight into his whites. We won’t see any of that this week but that was his preparation. His favourite stories seem to involve rest days in Tests – they sound like the best invention ever.”</p> \n<p>Buttler is one of five England players who could face Australia in Test cricket for the first time this week after recovering from<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/jos-buttler-injures-hand-england-practice-cricket-one-day-international-new-zealand\" title=\"\"> the split webbing to his left hand </a>that forced him to miss the final two limited overs games with New Zealand. To help prepare for the biggest series of his life, the 24-year-old last week worked with his predecessor, Matt Prior, who won the Ashes three times.</p> \n<p>“I found it invaluable to talk to someone who has been there and done it,” said Buttler. “Matt is probably the best keeper-batsman we’ve had. To pick his brains, both technically and mentally, about wicketkeeping and more specifically Ashes series was a brilliant experience for me.</p> \n<p>“He told me that it’s a very intense environment and sometimes it can be tough to get away from it. It’s in the papers more, on the TV more, and he said you have to understand that is how it is but the cricket doesn’t change. You have to enjoy it and embrace the Ashes. It’s something you want to be a part of.”</p> \n<p>While one would expect Buttler, given his talent, to be heading into the first of many Ashes series in his England career, at the other end of the spectrum is the Australian right-hander Voges, who at 35 is set to win just his third Test cap after making his debut on the recent tour of the Caribbean.</p> \n<p>Voges, a late bloomer who will draw on his vast experience on English soil following five seasons for Nottinghamshire and two spells with Middlesex, is one of nine players in Clarke’s squad into their fourth decade – a statistic that led the Guardian columnist Jason Gillespie to ponder whether the tourists could be physically tested out in the field.</p> \n<p>“There’s no point tip-toeing around it, we’ve got a number of guys who are over 30,” said Voges, who became the oldest Test centurion on debut last month with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/05/voges-scores-unbeaten-century-on-debut-to-rescue-australia-in-west-indies\" title=\"\">an unbeaten 130 against West Indies in Dominica</a>. “That does bring experience but I think in today’s game we are a lot stronger, a lot fitter, we train more than ever before.</p> \n<p>“Physically we are a little bit older but I can’t see that being an issue throughout the series,” he added. “We train incredibly hard and we are all fit guys. If we didn’t think we could get through five Tests we wouldn’t be here.”</p> \n<p>Voges is tipping one of his fellow thirtysomethings to fire in the shape of left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Johnson, who he claims is now back to his quickest and making net sessions uncomfortable, having struck Shaun Marsh on the finger and left Steve Smith “on his backside” already this tour.</p> \n<p>“Our net sessions aren’t much fun at all at the moment to be honest,” said Voges. “He’s got his zip back, he’s bowling fast and he’s swinging them as well. That is the biggest thing with Mitch, there’s always been genuine pace but when he’s swinging it at pace as well then he’s a different proposition.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436203273463/Alastair-Cook-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England captain Alastair Cook, left, faced both of his spin options during the side's penultimate nets session – Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali, right.

Or when Allan Border lost his cool with Craig McDermott in ‘93? Glenn McGrath’s 8-38 at Lord’s and Jason Gillespie’s 7-37 at Headingley? What about Adam Gilchrist’s blazing 152 at Edgbaston in 2001?</p> \n<p>It’s always been a dodgy premise for Australians, that “where were you when…” Ashes question, because unless you paid some exorbitant amount of money to get sunburnt and drunk on the hill with Jeff Thomson and 25 balding men in matching polos, we all know exactly where we were; half-asleep and huddled under blankets on the sofa.</p> \n<p>Personally I remember each Ashes series by the houses I was living in when they happened; 1989-2001: tucked up in bed at Mum and Dad’s listening to the radio with the ABC cricket guide opened on my chest; 2005: in a squalid share house surrounded by empty pizza boxes and the stench of stale beer; 2009: in a slightly less squalid share house surrounded by empty pizza boxes and the stench of stale beer; 2013: co-habitation with its fancy non-Ikea furniture and proper meals cooked on stoves, but at the end of play still dozing off on the sofa for that deep, doomed three-and-a-half-hour Ashes micro-nap.</p> \n<p>As a child, the former ABC cricket broadcaster Neville Oliver got his Ashes fix listening to radio descriptions and rode the resultant waves of emotion each morning after. “Defeat at the hands of England [was] such a desolate happening as to be worth a day off school,” he said. “Victory was as good as the end of school year.” </p> \n<p>To remember each series better we also have all those creaking shelves-worth of Ashes themed books; The Ashes Crown the Year; Fight for the Ashes; Operation Ashes; Botham’s Ashes; Boony’s Ashes; The Ashes Retained; The Ashes Thrown Away; Aussies and Ashes; Ashes to Ashes; Martin McCague’s Bumper Book of Ashes Anecdotes. Okay, the last is a slight embellishment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/06/ashes-2015-a-to-z\">Ashes 2015: the A to Z of Ashes history</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Maybe Australia’s mood isn’t quite as cricket-dependent these days but knowing glances will be shared by those yawning into smart phones and scrolling through the Cricinfo app on the train. That meeting can definitely be shifted back to 10am, by the way. Your tax return? Do it in September. We’re all in this together. Except for my sister-in-law. I don’t think she realises yet the true reason that my brother just took six weeks of long service leave. I guess she will soon. Good luck Pete.</p> \n<p>In actual fact no-one should get too worried about prolonged sleep deprivation or major marital conflict this time because the 2015 Ashes series will fly past us rapidly; 25 days of cricket crammed into just 48 days of svelte schedule. Now Australia’s standby players make do with a three-day tour match wedged between the 2nd and 3rd Tests and one other following the 4th, by which time their input might be irrelevant. Covering the languidly-paced 1953 series, former Australian Test opener Jack Fingleton also had time to take in the coronation of Queen Elizabeth, the climactic stages of a thrilling Ryder Cup at Wentworth and also met England’s executioner. If he’d been assigned to this one he’d be lucky to see much more than press boxes and hotel rooms.</p> \n<p>The stage has been set well for this series thanks to the now-compulsory verbal wars, which have established a new benchmark in pre-Ashes nonsense; English paceman Mark Wood almost inventing his own rivalry with fringe all-rounder Shane Watson, Watson replying quite predictably that encounters with net bowlers aren’t prominent among his great cricket anecdotes; <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/joe-root-david-warner-interview-2013-walkabout-punch\">Joe Root’s disappointment</a> over David Warner’s disappointment over their mutually disappointing behaviour at a nightspot we can probably all agree was a particularly disappointing choice of drinking venue; Ben Stokes preemptively stating <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/england-ben-stokes-australia-intimidation-cricket\">he could handle any sledging</a> that comes his way; <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/29/ashes-england-wont-come-close-steve-smith\">Steve Smith kicking off all of that sledging stuff </a> before the Australians even arrived; Stuart Broad’s suggestion that run-machine Smith <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/graeme-swann-england-no1-steve-smith-ashes-australia-icc-test-rankings\">might in fact be a bit shaky</a>, presumably in the way that Bradman was often susceptible once he’d passed 200. By the time the first ball is bowled today in Cardiff, hopefully we’ve also established which of Root and Warner’s fathers is fastest and strongest.</p> \n<p>Amid all this froth, a few important events have also transpired. Ryan Harris has sadly succumbed to injury, dead level with Bruce Reid in claiming 113 wickets from 27 Tests and the source of universal lament that the game couldn’t have had him for one last bone-grinding burst of energy. With no small amount of irony Harris has been replaced in the Australian squad by the unfortunately-nicknamed Pat ‘Cummo’ Cummins, star of as many <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DjEpLnUbD0Y/UTgagZcaASI/AAAAAAAAAcU/FPx6U9fLMNE/s1600/BUPA+Cummins+Hussey+Haddin.jpg\">health insurance advertising campaigns</a> as Test matches. </p> \n<p>That’s not the only upheaval within Australia’s ranks either. The internal battle for almost half the positions in the Cardiff Test XI paints a far murkier picture of the side’s likely fate in this series than they like to project. The buoyancy of Smith’s batting and World Cup success only partially obscure the fact that Watson, Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin and Chris Rogers are all creaking towards the finish line in Tests. Those who sit at the fringes could at any point be thrown into the fray. </p> \n<p>And England? If Australia gets it emphatically right we might see the dethroning of an Alastair Cook as captain, giving the series a retro dash of Athertonian (Gowerian? Goochian?) dread. The greater joy for Australians is that England’s 13-man squad for Cardiff boasts five players – dynamic keeper-batsman Jos Buttler, opener Adam Lyth, spinner Adil Rashid, all-rounder Moeen Ali and paceman Wood – who’ve yet to feature in an Ashes Test and so provide the series most of its novelty allure.</p> \n<p>History tells us that lamentably few Ashes series’ in recent memory have been tight run and recent form dictates that Australia enter this one with favoritism. But let’s be honest, this is a rivalry in which the cocky favourite has so often found comeuppance and for that, Australians should remain alert and awake.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4e69017c0f983453577f8f08924755f62f2745ec/0_79_3018_1812/3018.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1812,"width":3018,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jason O'Brien/Action Images","altText":"Glenn McGrath Australia Ashes","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jason O'Brien/Action Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T05:00:02Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T05:26:05Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Russell Jackson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/russell-jackson"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Ashes 2015","The Ashes","Australia cricket team","England cricket team","Cricket","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/ashes-2015","webTitle":"Ashes 2015"},{"id":"sport/ashes","webTitle":"The Ashes"},{"id":"sport/australia-cricket-team","webTitle":"Australia cricket team"},{"id":"sport/england-cricket-team","webTitle":"England cricket team"},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Russell Jackson","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/russell-jackson"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/07/watching-the-ashes-from-the-other-side-of-the-world-late-nights-and-stale-beer","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aex3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jul/07/watching-the-ashes-from-the-other-side-of-the-world-late-nights-and-stale-beer","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/07/watching-the-ashes-from-the-other-side-of-the-world-late-nights-and-stale-beer"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4e69017c0f983453577f8f08924755f62f2745ec/0_79_3018_1812/3018.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1812,"width":3018,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Glenn McGrath’s scorching spell of bowling at Lords in 2005 will live long in the collective memory.

On a stage interrupted by a spectacular crash that could have been a lot worse, the Sky rider made his move on the vicious final kick up Mur de Huy but was passed by Joaquim Rodr&iacute;guez, Katusha’s Spanish climbing specialist, in an astonishing show of strength from both riders. Froome will begin Tuesday’s stage as maillot jaune, happy to have punched more time into his main rivals.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t wake up today thinking I was going to be in yellow,” he said. “That was a real surprise.

Most got it, but only up to a point: specifically the steep run-in to the finish at Liege that is Mur de Huy. Four didn’t even make it that far.</p> \n<p>The Mur is considerably less than two kilometres in length, but this Tour de France hat-tip to the Belgian Ardenne classic La Fleche Wallonne features a reasonably gentle climb under the <em>flamme rouge</em>, before veering heavenwards at a leg-sapping gradient of 19%. Also known as <em>Le Chemin des Chapelles</em>,<em>it</em> offers out-of-shape amateurs no fewer than seven different chapels in which to stop and light a candle in search of assistance for ascensions of the literal and metaphorical kind.</p> \n<p>After Saturday’s time trial and Sunday’s filthy weather, this was the first chance for roadside spectators to enjoy this Tour as it ought to be enjoyed: wine-fuelled al fresco dining, the gaiety of the publicity caravan soundtracked by overhead choppers and a couple of garish blurs as the riders in the early escape enjoyed their 15 minutes in the spotlight, followed by a peloton whirring along in largely leisurely but guarded pursuit.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457419717__\n</div> \n<p>Among the group: a visibly suffering Adam Hansen, the Australian Lotto-Soudal rider struggling on with a dislocated shoulder as he chases the completion of a record 12 consecutive Tours. Movistar and Astana towed them along, the teams of Sunday’s big losers Nairo Quintana and Vincenzo Nibali always mindful of the final climb and the fact that in this race every single second counts.</p> \n<p>The first real action occurred around the 50 kilometre to go mark, courtesy of a crash so violent the race director Christian Prudhomme felt compelled to controversially neutralise the race. With the peloton humming along several minutes after passing through the feed zone, FDJ’s William Bonnet clipped a wheel, went down and skidded along the asphalt, bringing down at least 20 other riders, among them the race leader Fabian Cancellara, who appeared to suffer a concussion. Clocked at 42km-per-hour, several of the fallen were catapulted towards the stout metal base of a roadside lamp-post but had a reasonably thick grass verge to lower the velocity with which they hit it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/06/tour-de-france-2015-day-three-live\">Tour de France: day three – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The race was eventually stopped so the lame and halt, many of whose kit was now in tatters, could have their cuts, bruises and sleep-depriving road-rash ministered to properly. It was a dangerous precedent to set so early in such a high level bike race, but organisers later justified it by citing a paucity of medical personnel to follow the peloton, because they were all busy tending riders at the scene of the crash.</p> \n<p>A by now ghastly looking Cancellara remounted his bike and prepared to carry on, while a conscious but horribly flayed Bonnet was found to have broken cervical vertebrae which will require surgery. Giant-Alpecin’s Tom Dumoulin and Orica-Greenedge’s Simon Gerrans were among the bigger names forced to abandon and at the 50km-to-go mark, the stage was given a new start.</p> \n<p>The stage once again underway, the riders of Astana and Tinko Saxoff attempted to escape only for the black-clad predators of Sky to zero in on them with Great White precision, allowing Monday’s stage winner Andr&eacute; Greipel to increase his grip on the green jersey by winning the intermediate sprint. He promptly relaxed, dropping back to a 70-strong group, including Cancellara, that would finish over 11 minutes behind the eventual winner.</p> \n<p>At the business end of the field the Etixx-Quick-Step rider Tony Martin led the main bunch uphill, before the riders of Saxo-Tinkoff hitched anyone who could keep up to their wagon. Sky’s Geraint Thomas soon took over, repeatedly looking over his shoulder to check on the whereabouts of Froome. He need not have worried; once inside the flamme rouge and with 500 metres to go, his leader hit the front and looked a good thing only to be passed for the win by Rodr&iacute;guez.</p> \n<p>Froome’s six-second time bonus will be no small consolation. He leads the race by one second from the luckless Martin, who missed out on his first day in yellow - again - because of bonus time won by others, while BMC’s Tejay van Garderen is back in third. Tomorrow they take to the cobbles, where more carnage is almost certain to ensue.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5fae417416285d7da3526fe8a0e86490d9663d9f/0_103_5184_3114/5184.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3114,"width":5184,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christophe Ena/AP","altText":"Scores of riders lie on the road after crashing during the third stage of the Tour de France cycling race over 159.5 kilometers (99.1 miles) with start in Antwerp and finish in Huy, Belgium, Monday, July 6, 2015.

In 1997 she said she was sympathetic to the cause of Pauline Hanson and considered standing for Hanson’s rightwing One Nation party in the 1998 election.

He has been in two of them, first wrestling with the bitterness of defeat by Roger Federer in 2012, then savouring the sweet triumph over Novak Djokovic the following year, as if the experience were a trial of his resolve.</p> \n<p>On a deceptively mild Monday afternoon, then, with a capricious breeze to sooth his reddening brow, he endured another hazardous part of the journey leading towards the ultimate test of his character, when he laboured for just over three hours to beat the Croatian mountain masquerading as a tennis player, Ivo Karlovic.</p> \n<p>Karlovic is a remarkable athlete. The physical advantage of a lithe, taut frame that stands 6ft 11in when stationary and extends perhaps another couple of feet towards the clouds when animated, is also the very vehicle of his demise. While he can routinely belt a tennis ball across the net at up around 135mph – as he did here many times in adding 29 aces to the 136 he had accrued in the first week – his crane-like legs do not always serve him well on the turn.</p> \n<p>And, in fashioning an artful, occasionally magnificent exhibition of defensive tennis to win 7-6, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 and secure a place in the quarter-finals for the eighth year in a row, Murray turned the big man as if he were calling Dick Whittington’s cat. If winning grand slam titles was easy, Murray would be in the wrong job.</p> \n<p>Only Federer of this generation brings ease of execution to a sport riddled with difficulties for even the very best. So there was inevitability about a win that began in struggle, moved smoothly through dominance, back to anxiety and finished in tightly orchestrated drama. He had to resist four of those booming aces in the first 20 minutes and time and again was frustrated as Karlovic got out of trouble with his serve.</p> \n<p>But the 36-year-old Croatian, the oldest player left in the draw after three rounds, also showed several delightful bits of touch, none sweeter than a back-hand half-volley struck behind his spindly legs in the closing moments that delivered Murray one final sliver of angst.</p> \n<p>In the beginning it was all high-energy blasting. It is difficult to recall a rally that lasted longer than five shots in the first quarter of an hour.</p> \n<p>And the Croatian’s fifth ace, 134mph down the middle, banged the woman calling the lines on her head and set up his 40-love hold to level in the eighth game after half an hour.</p> \n<p>Subtlety arrived in the 12th game, when Murray twice lobbed his towering obstacle, then forced an error from him with a third effort, en route to a tie-break where the serve, surely, was favoured to prevail.</p> \n<p>It was the 563rd of Karlovic’s career, almost twice as many as Murray’s, and his 36th of the year (to Murray’s 15). This was Ivoland. But Murray forced an overcooked forehand to take the shootout.</p> \n<p>The second set was far more straightforward, Murray striking his fourth ace on his way to going 2-0 after an hour and a half.</p> \n<p>When they last met here, in the second round in 2012, Karlovic was positively red-lining with anger after being foot-faulted 11 times on his way to defeat.</p> \n<p>On Monday, it happened again – thankfully just once, and he aced to stay in touch in the third set. Maybe that was the spur he needed. By the end of the frame, he was on fire, and they went to a fourth.</p> \n<p>In the home stretch, which lasted 42 minutes, Karlovic still gave Murray occasional fits and it was not until near the end where the world No3 dipped further into his bag of class to make his obdurate opponent err for the 32nd and final time, hitting tired and long.</p> \n<p>“I came up with some good lobs, passing shots, able to use the angles a bit more, trying to keep him from coming to the net so much,” Murray said courtside.</p> \n<p>“Physically it is quite quick but mentally it is very tiring. It wasn’t going to be the best tennis, but I felt like I passed well. When he missed his first serve, I got the return on his second serve to his feet.</p> \n<p>Murray at least has what should be a less physically demanding assignment in the quarter-finals on Wednesday, against Vasek Pospisil, who has not taken a set off him in their three matches.</p> \n<p>The young Canadian earlier endured his third consecutive five-setter to beat Viktor Troicki 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 over two hours and 39 minutes on Court 12.</p> \n<p>Murray said: “Pospisil is a tough match. He had a very close match with James Ward, came back from two sets to love today. He might be a little tired but confident for coming back. He has a game that suits grass, likes to come to the net, big serve.”</p> \n<p>If the 25-year-old Pospisil is leg weary on Wednesday, he will have good reason. After beating Troicki, he returned to Court 12 to partner the American Jack Sock in a third-round doubles match against Murray’s brother, Jamie, and the Australian John Peers. They kept Pospisil out there for almost three and a half hours, winning 8-6 in the fifth set – that’s brotherly love for you.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436202405390/Andy-Murray-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray is in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon for the eighth year in a row after his defeat of Ivo Karlovic.

Anderson had his day of days, routinely firing down pinpoint serves of 130mph and sending Djokovic scurrying in the relative few rallies.</p> \n<p>The agony went on for two hours, until Djokovic, two down and staring into the abyss, galvanised himself. Simultaneously Anderson seemed to lose an inkling of energy and a modicum of belief. By the time bad light stopped play at 9pm, Djokovic had secured two quick sets and had his rescue mission on track. But he will have seen enough to have no certainty about what happens when the two men settle the matter on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>A pattern established itself early; Djokovic no match for Anderson’s ferocity; was forced to rely on instinct, agility and clever placement; grace under cannon fire. Anderson could just swing away. He hit more than 30 aces. Everything was going in.</p> \n<p>Anderson started the tie-break the stronger, secured the mini break from the first exchange but Djokovic levelled, leaping improbably to his left to parry a backhand for a winner. With a deft lob that brushed the back of the line Djokovic went 2-1 up. Anderson broke back and the two men swapped blows until 6-6 when a hesitant Djokovic, long in his preparation, double faulted. Anderson launched another Scud to take the tie-break 8-6 and with it, after an hour, the set.</p> \n<p>Anderson began the second in the same belligerent mood with deliveries Djokovic could only flail at. In the fourth game, attrition told and Anderson got the break to go 3-1 up. Djokovic, grimly focused, increased his intensity, diving, stretching, lunging. He pulled it back to make it 3-2, and energised by the chink of light, held his own serve to draw level at 3-3.</p> \n<p>But still the Anderson artillery rained down. Djokovic went 4-1 up in the tie-break but Anderson kept pressuring. Soon it was 5-5. Then 6-6. After two mighty forehands and a deft drop volley it was 8-6, and Anderson two sets to the good.</p> \n<p>The champion – desperate for a boost – got one at the start of the third set with a break of Anderson’s serve to go 3-0 up. Even now Anderson was hitting powerfully but less reliably. With another break for 5-1 the champion took the third set 6-1 in just 24 minutes.</p> \n<p>Galvanised now by the sight of Anderson tiring and perhaps fallible, Djokovic also started the fourth set brightly. It took him three games to break serve. Suddenly Djokovic was imposing his game on the South African, driving him into corners and cutting off any responses at the net. At just after 8pm, in dwindling light, Djokovic whipped an angled forehand across the court, raised his arms. Finally, after three gruelling hours, he gained parity.</p> \n<p>It was the last act of an intriguing As the two men sat down, play was halted. drama. The winner will meet Marin Cilic and it is to Anderson’s credit that Cilic still cannot know who that will be.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436215893254/Novak-Djokovic-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Play was suspended due to bad light with the score between Novak Djokovic and Kevin Anderson poised at two sets all, 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 6-4.

That offer was rejected but Southampton, who are prepared to make a formal complaint to Fifa if Atl&eacute;tico Madrid sell Toby Alderweireld to Tottenham Hotspur, are prepared for a second bid.</p> \n<p>United want to secure Schneiderlin before their tour to the United States and for which they depart on 13 July but will have to up their bid to nearer &pound;27m to stand any chance of securing the 25-year-old midfielder. “Every player has his price and we have experience as a club of selling players,” Koeman said.</p> \n<p>“Last season we sold some players, and if there is interest in Morgan then OK. But it has to be at the price the club wants. He is one of the key players or our team, an international player. And I don’t think is a problem for Manchester United.”</p> \n<p>Asked if he was planning for the campaign ahead with Schneiderlin in the ranks, Koeman said: “No. I know the situation. I have spoken a lot with Morgan. Last season we finally said: ‘Stop all this business because we are not selling any more players’ [after Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert had been sold]. That was difficult for him but he came back after a few days with good motivation and had a great season. But we know the situation now. There is a lot of interest in the player. With a club like United, we know it’s difficult to keep the player. But if they pay, then OK, we can make the transfer.”</p> \n<p>Koeman has already pinpointed the Feyenoord midfielder, Jordy Clasie, as a replacement for the Frenchman should agreement be struck with United. “He’s a good player, a young player and a Dutch international who is ready to make a step up and show his qualities at a higher level than we have in the Dutch league,” he said. “He’s growing in his leadership qualities too and, if Morgan goes, we’ll need a player in that position. He is one of them [on the list of potential replacements].”</p> \n<p>While Southampton hope to conclude a deal for the versatile FC Twente defender Cuco Martina in the next few days, the situation with Alderweireld remains complicated and, potentially, fractious. The Belgium defender spent last season on loan at St Mary’s from Atl&eacute;tico, a deal that had been struck with a view to a permanent &pound;6.8m move. The Spanish club could cancel the buyout clause written into the deal by paying a fee of &pound;1.5m to Saints, but the deadline for the payment was missed.</p> \n<p>Tottenham Hotspur have subsequently moved for Alderweireld, offering the player a five-year contract while indicating a willingness to pay Atl&eacute;tico nearer &pound;11.5m for his services. Yet, according to the original agreement between Southampton and the Spanish club, Spurs are technically not yet entitled to speak with the player or put him through a medical.</p> \n<p>The Saints’ executive director, Les Reed, has travelled to Spain to speak directly with Atl&eacute;tico and the club are prepared to lodge a formal complaint with the Football Association and Fifa should Spurs be permitted to sign the player.</p> \n<p>Alderweireld had informed Southampton of his desire to return permanently to St Mary’s at the end of last season, though his head appears to have been turned since by Tottenham’s pursuit. “Of course there will be interest in the player,” said Koeman. “He is a good, strong defender and he had a good season with us. But we had a contract and Atletico were too late in paying back the option. It’s difficult. Maybe, at a certain moment, you say ‘yes’ but then, afterwards, there are other offers and it’s difficult...</p> \n<p>“But still I believe Southampton is the best place for the player. Why? Ask the player why he told me that he was very comfortable. Very happy. He was missing playing football when he was a player at Atletico Madrid. At Southampton normally he starts every game ,and he did well. His family was happy. OK, that’s all football business. But let’s wait and see what happens in the next few days.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436199809002/Morgan-Schneiderlin--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Morgan Schneiderlin missed trainign with southampton on Monday and has indicated he could leaveteh club in the coming days.

The manager wants to ascertain where the goalkeeper will play in the coming season before United fly to the US on 13 July for a tour because Van Gaal is conscious he has only 360 minutes of game time before it starts for real.</p> \n<p>United arrive in Seattle to start a four-match tour and return home on 29 July but Van Gaal does not want a further warm-up game before United face Tottenham.</p> \n<p>De Gea will not be sold to Real unless the Spanish club <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/03/manchester-united-refuse-sell-david-de-gea-sergio-ramos\" title=\"\">allow their defender Sergio Ramos</a> to move to Old Trafford.

This may prove disruptive, with United having a two-leg Champions League knockout tie in mid-August to negotiate to enter the competition proper, as well as four league matches before that deadline.</p> \n<p>Regarding the importance of the opener against Tottenham, Van Gaal said: “For me, the most important match is the first match of the Premier League.”</p> \n<p>In Seattle, United play Club Am&eacute;rica of Mexico on 17 July, local time. They then face the San Jose Earthquakes on 21 July in the Californian city and four days later in the same state face Barcelona in Santa Clara. Van Gaal’s team close the tour against Paris Saint-Germain in Chicago on 29 July.</p> \n<p>“In the first two matches I will play all the players at the most for 45 minutes because we have to adapt to that new situation,” said Van Gaal. “A lot of youngsters will also have the possibility to step into the matches. The Barcelona and PSG games are the third and fourth matches, and at that point we will play with certain players for 60 minutes and 30 minutes.

If McIlroy falls victim to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/rory-mcilroy-the-open-ankle-injury-playing-football\" title=\"\">a football injury sustained on a five-a-side pitch</a>, the world of golf will have cause to be upset.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/rory-mcilroy-the-open-ankle-injury-playing-football\">Rory McIlroy ruptures ankle ligament playing football to put Open in doubt</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This was the major to apparently endorse a new rivalry. Jordan Spieth’s consecutive wins at <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/13/jordan-spieth-masters-augusta-justin-rose-phil-mickelson\" title=\"\">the Masters</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/21/us-open-2015-jordan-spieth-wins-in-thrilling-finish-to-add-to-masters-crown\" title=\"\">US Open</a> have set the 21-year-old Texan apart as the main challenger to McIlroy at the summit of golf. At the ancient home of the game, in the oldest major of them all, where better for the youthful duo to square off?</p> \n<p>Should McIlroy miss St Andrews, there will be no joust with Spieth or, surely in the world No1’s mind, an opportunity to demonstrate his superiority on a venue he has grown to adore. If McIlroy plays, scrutiny will not so much surround his handling of a young pretender as how his fitness holds out at every walk and swing.</p> \n<p>For the sport, this is a highly unfortunate scenario. The Royal &amp; Ancient and its sponsors will never admit to an individual holding sway over the Open – they have stood back and watched the fluctuating fortunes of Tiger Woods for long enough, after all – but these key stakeholders can only have been dismayed by McIlroy’s news. Thankfully, the vast majority of tournament tickets are advance sales.</p> \n<p>The Scottish Open, which begins in East Lothian on Thursday, was first to deal with the impact of this McIlroy affair. “We are still looking forward to hosting one of the strongest fields in Scottish Open history over one of the great links tests at Gullane,” said its championship director Peter Adams. “The last four Open champions – of which Rory is obviously one – have all played in the Scottish Open the week before winning the Claret Jug and we hope to continue that trend this week.”</p> \n<p>At best, McIlroy has only suffered severe disruption of his Open preparations and will still take to the Fife links. At worst, his season has been seriously affected, maybe even cut short, by a ruptured ankle ligament. Just when golf was gripped by the excitement of the McIlroy and Spieth battle, it may have been postponed. And by virtue of an artificial surface, no less.</p> \n<p>McIlroy will inevitably be criticised for his willingness to risk professional problems by taking to a football pitch in the first place. He suffered an ankle sprain when doing likewise shortly before Christmas 2013. He quipped that his alternative ball sport dalliances were over at that point.</p> \n<p>Would Jack Nicklaus, or Woods, have stopped playing other sports? The answer is of course no. Woods, his former coach Hank Haney revealed in a detailed account of the 14-times major winner’s character, would be more prone to dangerous expeditions with navy seals.</p> \n<p>Nicklaus’s downtime was more quietly spent. He, though, lived in an era and environment far detached from the global superstar of 2015 where every move is closely monitored. In an endearing attempt to defy such interest, McIlroy makes it his business to try to lead as normal a life as possible. It is what makes him such enjoyable company.</p> \n<p>He attended a Neil Diamond concert in Belfast last week with friends he has retained since childhood. Rather than being criticised for the supposed recklessness of his Saturday pursuits, McIlroy should be credited with continuing to behave like every other 26-year-old would like to.</p> \n<p>Except, of course, from the fact he isn’t. The curse of Nike? The sporting industry giant had already suffered from Woods’s indiscretions and injuries before Paul Casey, another of their marquee golfers, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2012/jan/06/ryder-cup-paul-casey-dislocates-shoulder\" title=\"\">smashed his collarbone while snowboarding</a>. McIlroy suffered from a dip in form when switching to Nike equipment in 2013.</p> \n<p>“Like fans everywhere, we are saddened to hear about Rory’s injury and stand by him as his doctors continue to assess his condition and treatment day by day,” said a Nike spokesman. “More importantly, we wish him a speedy recovery.”</p> \n<p>McIlroy’s propensity to create headlines is bizarre for one so young and calm of character. Golf is a poorer place without him, which is why a broad group will place great hope on his powers of recovery over little more than a week.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436210955306/Rory-McIlroy-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rory McIlroy revealed the extent of his ankle injury on social media and is a major doubt for The Open at St Andrews.

The bigger picture relates to McIlroy’s season, which would see attempted defences not only of the Open but the US PGA Championship at Whistling Straits in mid-August. <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/sport/golf\">Golf</a>, not just McIlroy, would feel the impact of any extended absence.</p> \n<p>Dr Roger Hawkes, the European Tour’s chief medical officer, explained the significance of the ligament in question: “In the leading ankle [the left in a right-hander], it plays an important part in stabilising the ankle during the follow through when there is a tendency to roll over on the ankle. The anterior talofibular ligament as well as the peroneal muscles help resist this.</p> \n<p>“At the time of injury the associated capsule of the ankle joint is also damaged and this leads to considerable pain and swelling. Other complications include bone bruising in the joint as a result of significant smacking together of the ankle joint bones at the time of injury.</p> \n<p>“Initially, the ankle needs to rest and then slowly to get moving with an emphasis on maximising the stability of the ankle by developing the relevant muscles and, at the same time, retraining the brain to coordinate these stabilising muscles.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436178002127/Rory-McIlroy-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rory McIlroy will not be able to defend his Open Championship title at St Andrews later this month after suffering a serious ankle injury.
