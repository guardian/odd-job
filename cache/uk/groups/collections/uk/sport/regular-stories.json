For all there has been criticism of this venue, and plenty of it, two marquee names are the most prominent. <br /></p> \n<p>Spieth’s 67 on day two and a 69 for Reed leaves them tied at five under. They will thereby partner each other on Saturday, just like Perthshire but this time in direct combat. Branden Grace and Dustin Johnson lie a stroke further back in what may now become a mass attempt to tread water; only 16 players in the field are under par. Poor greens and what is expected to be a ferocious course set-up means low scoring over the weekend is highly unlikely at best. </p> \n<p>“I actually felt it was a pretty disappointing round,” said Reed. “To have five or six bogeys, I didn’t get up and down once, I was 0% on up-and-downs today. But we’re in a good position and we hopefully can have a good weekend and have a chance to win.</p> \n<p>“Anytime I play with Jordan I enjoy it. The main thing for me is to stay focused and focus on what I need to do to play some good golf. And plot my way around this golf course, especially if it gets firmer and faster.”</p> \n<p>Rory McIlroy faces a battle to play himself into contention. The world No1 started day two at two over par, a situation he had improved by one when reaching the 17th tee. McIlroy promptly four-putted the penultimate hole for a double bogey and dropped another shot at the last. Back to back rounds of 72 are hardly disastrous at this venue but, at nine shots adrift of the lead, McIlroy will find it difficult to make up ground. He has endured a particularly frustrating time on the greens. </p> \n<p>The defending champion Martin Kaymer was amongst the high profile names in the Friday afternoon wave of play to miss the cut, which was only confirmed at plus five after 9pm local time on Friday. When it finally was, an agonising bogey on his final hole by the 19-year-old amateur Nick Hardy meant a batch of high profile players survived for the weekend. Colin Montgomerie, Angel Cabrera, Ian Poulter, Jimmy Walker and Sergio Garcia were amongst that relieved group. So, too, was the Scottish qualifier Jimmy Gunn. </p> \n<p>Earlier on Friday, Jason Day’s management team issued an updated statement which confirmed the Australian retains hope of completing the Open. Day caused alarm when he collapsed in the final hole of his second round.</p> \n<p>It read: “Jason was diagnosed to have suffered from benign positional vertigo. He was treated locally by Dr Robert Stoecker and Dr Charles Souliere and is resting comfortably. His condition is being monitored closely and he is hopeful he will be able to compete this weekend in the final rounds of the US Open. </p> \n<p>“He wants to thank all who treated him at the Franciscan Medical Group and thank all of the fans and friends who have reached out to he and his family.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a107fe50701b44065b18ad8376dea53b37f782f5/0_334_4096_2459/4096.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2459,"width":4096,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Erik S.

Oosthuizen shot 77. Woods took 80. Fowler carded 81. It wouldn’t have been much worse had you sent <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2008/sep/19/golf.rydercup\">Maurice Flitcroft</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2011/jul/15/joy-of-six-open-nightmares\">Walter Danecki</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2012/apr/06/joy-of-six-golf-holes\">Angelo Spagnolo</a> out together.</p> \n<p><strong>Oosthuizen’s seven-over 77 seems a common-or-garden mishap compared to the other two scores.</strong> First, Fowler’s 81. Only Rich Berberian Jr. had a worse day, shooting 83. He’s a club pro. Fowler is the current Players champion, and was one of the favourites to win this week. Here’s Fowler’s finishes in the last five majors: tied 5th, tied 2nd, tied 2nd, tied 3rd and tied 12th. After yesterday’s fiasco, he’s currently in 155th place out of 156. And in case we forget, his 81 featured an eagle! He was an inch or so away from a hole-in-one albatross at the par-four 12th! Golf, huh?</p> \n<p><strong>But of course it’s the travails of Tiger which have hogged most of the limelight.</strong> His 80 is his worst-ever round at a US Open. He’s driving like a maniac, making Severiano Ballesteros look like Calvin Peete. He hit six of 14 fairways yesterday. He missed the widest fairway in US Open history by the best part of 50 yards. One shot saw his club fly 20 yards back down the hole. And on the 18th, he topped a fairway wood into a pot bunker like a rank amateur. When he disappeared from view to play the sand shot, the gallery exploded into laughter. There was a ripple of ironic applause when he splashed the ball back out. The man should suffer no more indignity. But of course he’s got another 18 holes to play this morning. God speed, Tiger Woods.</p> \n<p><strong>All of which has somewhat overshadowed the fine efforts of Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, Matt Kuchar, Ben Martin and the 22-year-old amateur Brian Campbell, who head the leaderboard after a memorable first round.</strong> A tip of the hat to those lads, then, but you know how it is sometimes.

Oosthuizen shot 77. Woods took 80. Fowler carded 81. It wouldn’t have been much worse had you sent <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2008/sep/19/golf.rydercup\">Maurice Flitcroft</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2011/jul/15/joy-of-six-open-nightmares\">Walter Danecki</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2012/apr/06/joy-of-six-golf-holes\">Angelo Spagnolo</a> out together.</p> \n<p><strong>Oosthuizen’s seven-over 77 seems a common-or-garden mishap compared to the other two scores.</strong> First, Fowler’s 81. Only Rich Berberian Jr. had a worse day, shooting 83. He’s a club pro. Fowler is the current Players champion, and was one of the favourites to win this week. Here’s Fowler’s finishes in the last five majors: tied 5th, tied 2nd, tied 2nd, tied 3rd and tied 12th. After yesterday’s fiasco, he’s currently in 155th place out of 156.

Golf, huh?</p> \n<p><strong>But of course it’s the travails of Tiger which have hogged most of the limelight.</strong> His 80 is his worst-ever round at a US Open. He’s driving like a maniac, making Severiano Ballesteros look like Calvin Peete. He hit six of 14 fairways yesterday. He missed the widest fairway in US Open history by the best part of 50 yards. One shot saw his club fly 20 yards back down the hole. And on the 18th, he topped a fairway wood into a pot bunker like a rank amateur. When he disappeared from view to play the sand shot, the gallery exploded into laughter. There was a ripple of ironic applause when he splashed the ball back out. The man should suffer no more indignity. But of course he’s got another 18 holes to play this morning. God speed, Tiger Woods.</p> \n<p><strong>All of which has somewhat overshadowed the fine efforts of Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, Matt Kuchar, Ben Martin and the 22-year-old amateur Brian Campbell, who head the leaderboard after a memorable first round.</strong> A tip of the hat to those lads, then, but you know how it is sometimes.

At one end of the event Jordan Spieth endorsed his willingness to win back-to-back majors. The other saw Tiger Woods leave the scene on an aggregate of 16 over par, having added 76 to Thursday’s hapless round of 80. As Tom Weiskopf, the former Open champion, pointedly put it, Woods has gone “from the top of Mount Everest to the bottom of a coal mine”.</p> \n<p>It was with Day, though, that the thoughts of Spieth, Woods and plenty of others were directed. The Masters champion was partnering the world No10 when he fell to the turf on the 9th, the group’s 18th. First impressions were of a slip on a -sloping surface but the reality soon became clear. Day told medical staff who attended to him immediately of vertigo-like symptoms which he has been encountering for a considerable time. </p> \n<p>Astonishingly Day finished the par-three hole when far from steady on his feet. He had to let a rules official remove a stone which was adjacent to his ball in a greenside bunker as the Australian believed his hand was too shaky to do it himself. Day was led away from the scene and taken for full assessment straightaway after holing out for a round of 70 which left him at two under par on aggregate and firmly in contention, should he be considered well enough to play through the weekend. </p> \n<p>“I turned around and he was lying down. All I heard was that he was -suffering from dizziness,” Spieth said. “At that point it was just about how could we help him out, kind of clear the scene and try and keep the cameras off and let him just rebound from being dizzy.</p> \n<p>“I heard earlier in the week that he had been a little under the weather. He could barely even walk when he got up so it was pretty strong of him to finish out there. It came out of the blue. Nothing was mentioned earlier in the round.”</p> \n<p>Woods had witnessed the entire incident from the 9th tee. He said: “I didn’t know he was ill but I knew he was laying down there and I know he didn’t play in Dallas this year because of vertigo. </p> \n<p>“I played with him at Memorial and we talked about it in depth. I hope he’s OK. I’ll call him as soon as I’m done here and see if he’s all right. He’s one of my really close friends. I’d like to get out of here and see if he’s OK.”</p> \n<p>As Woods and Spieth acknowledged, Day has openly admitted to health -worries in the recent past. He withdrew from the Byron Nelson tournament last month when suffering from dizzy spells. Before the first round of this event he revealed the extent of the testing he had undergone in a bid to establish the extent of such issues.</p> \n<p>He said: “I had three sleep studies done, I had a lot of blood tests done, I had an MRI on my head, my back and my neck. And everything came back negative. I think I just ran out of gas and I wasn’t feeling good. I had the shakes and the tingling up my arms. And the loss of energy and strength was probably caused by that.”</p> \n<p>Woods’s reflections on his own performance last night were therefore limited. The 39-year-old has missed cuts in two of his last three majors and he will inevitably slip outside the world’s top 200 ranked golfers next week. He insists, though, that his plan to compete regularly over the summer, including the Greenbrier Classic from Thursday week, will not change.</p> \n<p>“I’m playing the same events,” Woods said. “My schedule is set for the summer. And I’m playing every other week. I’m excited about it. I wanted to shoot five or six today but I wanted to be on the other side of it [par]. I hit the ball a little bit better today. But, again, I made nothing. I didn’t make any putts the first two days; I hit it better today.

While the former will undeniably be a force in this sport for a long time to come, evidence pointing towards a Woods return is increasingly difficult to glean.</p> \n<p>After 36 US Open holes Woods started his inevitable journey home. The primary damage was, of course, done on a first day where he recorded 80. However, it is telling that in a supposedly decent morning at Chambers Bay the 14-time major winner still could not break 70. For the first time in his professional career Woods has finished consecutive tournaments at double digits over par. He departed on 16 over par.</p> \n<p>Woods returns to his Florida drawing board before his next scheduled appearance at the Greenbrier Classic from Thursday week. The Open Championship at St Andrews, once a source of hope, is now laced with danger.</p> \n<p>The 39-year-old may be taking his fall from grace literally. Woods continues to labour under the false illusion that he can compete for major championships. At least, that is what his public utterances suggest. But in one of life’s laugh-or-cry moments, by the 10th hole on Friday at Chambers Bay, Woods’s 1st, he was flat on his backside after playing from wild rough on a steep hill. The desperate picture was a snapshot of Woods in the current professional context.</p> \n<p>Woods’s first set of second-round holes were typically erratic: bogey-par-birdie-par-bogey. Things barely steadied thereafter.</p> \n<p>Woods earlier insisted that he was “right there” at the Masters, a statement at odds with Augusta National reality. After three rounds he was 10 shots adrift of the eventual winner, Spieth. If the young Texan ever had cause to look over his shoulder, he needed binoculars to locate Woods.</p> \n<p>Here Spieth is seeking to become only the sixth player to win the Masters and US Open back-to-back. He could become the first player since Gene Sarazen to claim multiple majors before turning 22. ’s performance from Spieth keeps the dream alive.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Woods regards upbeat sentiment as necessary. Maybe he reckons that admitting he is only seeking to play four rounds in any given event with the aim of gradually building back towards competing would be a sign of weakness. Woods is a stubborn character. The problem is, he looks more and more ridiculous with every given assertion of imminent glory.</p> \n<p>There is no foundation for optimism. Woods has no apparent confidence in his golf swing, hence the willingness to keep setting up to hit soft cut shots. When it goes wrong, the outcome is horrendous – such as the topped three wood straight into a bunker on the 18th at Chambers Bay on Thursday. Woods still jerks and lunges into downswings far more frequently than is healthy.</p> \n<p>He claims he is in rude physical health, which nobody on the outside can confirm or deny. Interestingly Woods has now pointed towards the recovery from the back operation undergone in March of last year being tougher than anticipated. “Knee surgeries are pretty easy compared to a back surgery, the recovery time,” he said. “And for some reason it’s just a lot harder dealing with a nerve than a joint.”</p> \n<p>Woods at least has sympathy from the gallery. The number of spectators shouting in support of him this week has been noticeable. Fellow players, meanwhile, staunchly refuse to write Woods off. Even Phil Mickelson, with whom Woods shared indifference for years, now speaks of the contribution made to the game by this one player. Mickelson has gone so far as to credit Woods, single-handedly, with the rise in prize revenues in premier tournaments.</p> \n<p>Those detached from the top level, however, tend to be more critical. Greg Norman, for example, has claimed that Woods now looks “totally lost” on the golf course. Tom Weiskopf, the former Open champion, claimed Woods has gone “from the top of Mount Everest to the bottom of a coal mine”.</p> \n<p>Norman added: “When you are a great player and you go through a bad spell, it is usually a minor adjustment you need to get your game back into place, but Tiger needs to make major adjustments.</p> \n<p>“He will win again. He will win other tour events. But a major? I don’t see it. You need to be honest with yourself. And he has to find a way to put his mind and body together.”</p> \n<p>The Australian spoke from his own experience of recovering from injury: “As someone who has had multiple surgeries myself I can tell you that your body reacts to each one, and that other parts of you are working overtime to compensate. So it seems that your body is always out of kilter. And Tiger’s body now is very different from the one he had in 2000 when he was dominating the game.</p> \n<p>“Even if his body is sound, he has to go deep down within himself and find the belief that he can still do this. He has to strip his feelings raw and build it all back up again. I believe Tiger will come back to some degree – but to be the best player in the world again? No. He will win golf tournaments but he won’t win majors the way he is playing.”</p> \n<p>For now Norman’s prediction actually looks optimistic. Spieth, meanwhile, is in the vanguard of a new era.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434747762671/Tiger-Woods-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tiger Woods slips on a steep hill in the rough near the 10th green – his first hole of the second round – at Chambers Bay.

Following thrilling wins at <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/england-new-zealand-first-odi-match-report\" title=\"\">Edgbaston</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/17/england-morgan-root-new-zealand-centuries\" title=\"\">Trent Bridge</a> – and notable showings in defeat at <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/14/new-zealand-england-one-day-international\" title=\"\">Southampton</a> and T<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/12/eoin-morgan-england-new-zealand-run-chase-calculation\" title=\"\">he Oval</a> – the result here should allegedly not be considered the be-all and end-all.</p> \n<p>That philosophical outlook is hard to take issue with, especially when delivered by the sparky fast bowler Mark Wood who, alongside his Durham team-mate Ben Stokes, addressed the assembled media with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2014/jul/22/the-joy-of-six-sports-ghost-stories\" title=\"\">the reputedly haunted Lumley Castle</a> as a backdrop, offering the latest opinions as to why Eoin Morgan’s side have well and truly laid the ghost of their horror World Cup to rest. Not that a local marketing drive was required – the game is a sell-out.</p> \n<p>Win, lose or tie – the last perhaps most fitting for these two well-matched sides – Wood believes this series can be viewed only positively from an England perspective, representing progress against, if not always with, the white ball. Brendon McCullum’s hell-for-leather tourists have played their part, too, and now only 287 runs are required for this to pass India’s and Pakistan’s efforts in 2004 and become the heaviest-scoring five-match rubber in history.</p> \n<p>Following their epic chase of 350 at Trent Bridge on Wednesday – a win that drew the series level at two apiece and further underlined the elan with which England now play – Wood was happy, in his own way, to talk up their chances of securing a first bilateral series victory in 15 months at the ground where he learned his trade.</p> \n<p>“Does the win at Trent Bridge give us an edge? Let’s be controversial and say yes it does,” joked Wood, who claimed his home town of Ashington will be coming to watch the game. “We’ll chase down anything, eh? The manner of the victory was obviously pleasing, to win with six overs left, but we know how dangerous New Zealand are and they’ll come back fighting hard. It’s been a topsy-turvy series in terms of who’s come out with the end result but both teams have played some really good cricket.”</p> \n<p>England’s preparations have been dented somewhat by a blow to the left hand <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/jos-buttler-injures-hand-england-practice-cricket-one-day-international-new-zealand\" title=\"\">of the wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler in training</a>, splitting the webbing between thumb and forefinger. Buttler could play with a pain-numbing injection in the morning but it is far from an ideal option given the feel a gloveman requires in taking the ball and the proximity of the looming Ashes series – something Wood admits is hard not to think about, even before a first international on his home ground.</p> \n<p>While the medical staff are confident no further damage would be risked by Buttler playing, Yorkshire’s Jonny Bairstow was called into the squad on Friday and looks the sensible option – not least because of his own form with the bat this season that has him averaging 80 in the County Championship. Sam Billings, a specialist batsman at No7 this series, is the alternative given his status as Kent’s first choice behind the stumps but Bairstow, it is reported, is next in line.</p> \n<p>That issue aside, England have no reason to change tack from Nottingham – a game in which Buttler’s scoring talents were not required as they chased down their target with three wickets down – and the Chester-le-Street pitch looks another belter for batsmen. For New Zealand’s Ross Taylor, who was Durham’s overseas player five years ago, there is hope for the leather hurlers, however.</p> \n<p>“The ball tends to swing around a bit here and it is a day match,” Taylor noted. “If you look back on Southampton that was also a day match and it has been the only game where the ball has swung – and swung consistently. You need to assess the conditions and a score between 280 and 320 could be a winning one here.”</p> \n<p>That such numbers now represent a low-scoring one-day match is something in itself. The last time the two countries played out a decider for a five-match series was in Dunedin in 2002, where the home side triumphed by chasing down England’s 218 for eight with seven balls to spare thanks to an unbeaten 122 from Nathan Astle. Nasser Hussain, captain that day, scored 50 from 80 balls from No3 while Nick Knight’s 24 from 25 balls was considered racy and not a single six was struck by the tourists.</p> \n<p>Fast-forward 13 years and the boundary rope has been cleared 69 times in these four games to date, with only another seven maximums required for what would be another record in a five-match series. With a match still to play, this series has already yielded 338 boundaries, more than any previous five-game series. It is little wonder therefore that bowlers, who would once snap hands off for 10 overs, one for 40, are now rethinking what merits a decent set of figures.</p> \n<p>“If you can go at under six an over then you’ve done pretty well,” said Wood. “Even eight an over is OK, especially in the power-plays. David Willey was disappointed to go at eight an over at Trent Bridge but I just said to him: ‘Look, you’ve bowled up front when the field is in and you’ve bowled at the end when they’re trying to hit it.’ If you go at eight as a bowler in those times, then you’re actually doing all right in this one-day series. We have to try to take wickets. If you take wickets, that’s the best way to stop the scoring.</p> \n<p>“It’s like a long version of the Twenty20 now. The batters come hard straight away and there’s no looking to just knock it around. If the batsmen think they can take you down, they’re going to try to do that. My role as the attacking option is to fight fire with fire. If they’re going to come hard, I’m going to come hard as well as try to get them out. I quite enjoy that role.</p> \n<p>Is it fair? “As a bowler, probably not,” he said. “But the crowds are here for entertainment and they want to see fours and sixes and hear the loud music. It’s a challenge for us as bowlers but we have to be up for that.”</p> \n<h2>England v New Zealand, Emirates Durham, 10.30am Saturday 20 June, probable teams</h2> \n<p><strong>England</strong> Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (capt), Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Sam Billings, Adil Rashid, David Willey, Mark Wood, Steven Finn</p> \n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong> Brendon McCullum (capt), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi (wk), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghan</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434735051388/England-Durham-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England warm up during a nets session before the series decider against New Zealand at the Emirates Durham.

The tourists won the first with plenty to spare but Pakistan drew level when triumphing by one wicket with a ball to spare. South Africa edged the third ODI by two runs as the Pakistan chase fell short before the hosts repeated the trick again, although there would be no final push for ultimate bragging rights.</p> \n<h2>India v Sri Lanka, 2009<strong>:</strong> Sehwag’s greatest knock</h2> \n<p><strong> </strong></p> \n<p>Virender Sehwag set the tone in the opening stand of the first ODI with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2009/dec/15/verinder-sehwag-india-sri-lanka\" title=\"\">a blistering 146</a> as India set their visitors a daunting target of 415. Yet Sehwag’s knock was not even the innings of the day as Tillakaratne Dilshan struck 160 to give Sri Lanka a genuine chance of victory before Kumar Sangakkara came out swinging, racing his way to 90 off 43 balls. Needing 11 from the final over, the tourists were met by the sublime bowling of Ashish Nehra, who took the wicket of Angelo Mathews three deliveries from the end. Sri Lanka levelled the series in the next match but India continued their fine batting form to win the series with a game to&nbsp;spare.<strong> </strong></p> \n<h2>South Africa v Australia, 2006<strong>:</strong> Gibbs’ piece of greatness</h2> \n<p>Thanks to Ricky Ponting’s 164, and with the five-game series tied, Australia posted the first 400-plus score in 50-over cricket. Few imagined South Africa would have a chance of going close with their chase but up stepped Herschelle Gibbs to smash 175 from 142 balls to lead his team to a one-wicket win with one ball left. Gibbs said: “I don’t know where that innings came from, I don’t think I’ve played better.”</p> \n<h2>England v India, 2002<strong>:</strong> Ganguly goes wild</h2> \n<p>Needing 326 and after losing their previous nine ODI finals, India looked finished at 146 for five in this NatWest series climax. However, Yuvraj Singh and Mohammad Kaif scored 121 in 18 overs before Zaheer Khan notched the winning runs with three balls to spare. Sourav Ganguly, in response to Andrew Flintoff’s exuberant celebrations in India five months previously, whipped off his shirt and made his way on to the turf to celebrate. “I would still say it was just an instinctive, spur-of-the-moment act,” Ganguly said.<strong> </strong></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/19/1434732215878/South-Africas-Herschelle--008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"South Africa's Herschelle Gibbs hit 175 in the fifth one-day international against Australia in 2006.

Should Wimbledon follow Queen’s power-serve suit, Murray has shown himself well able to cope.</p> \n<p>The man from Luxembourg put Murray on the back foot from the off, converting the first break point in the match to lead 3-1.</p> \n<p>The 32-year-old then underlined his tenacity by fighting off two immediate break points to hold and cement control of the set. Given power serving has been the theme at Queen’s so far this week, it was wholly appropriate that M&uuml;ller completed that vital hold with an ace.</p> \n<p>Murray saved a break point in the next game before producing a lovely sliced drop shot to hold serve and hint at a comeback. But M&uuml;ller seized the chance when serving for the set, converting the first of three set points by holding to love.</p> \n<p>The second set stayed with serve throughout, Murray again unable to gain any headway when receiving. Once it came to the tie-break though, the two-times grand slam champion’s class finally started to tell. Murray eased through 7-2 to claim the set and level the match.</p> \n<p>Finally in the groove, Murray struck first blood in the final set, converting the second of two break points for an immediate lead.</p> \n<p>The 28-year-old was now able to read M&uuml;ller’s otherwise bewitching serve and did not look back thereafter. M&uuml;ller saved a match point with that trusty serve but could ultimately not recover, leaving Murray to serve out the match.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434740346374/Andy-Murray-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray came from a set down to beat Gilles Müller at Queen's.

Instead, there was a reminder that several more members of the global riding elite are in action this week, as Christophe Soumillon swept through the field on Ervedya to catch Moore and his mount Found a few strides from the post.</p> \n<p>Soumillon has had a somewhat troubled relationship with Ascot in the past, even in victory. His success in the 2006 King George on Hurricane Run was followed by a gesture involving a finger and his backside, which was variously seen as a message for the jockeys behind him, the Ascot crowd, or perhaps just anyone who had ever done him wrong. Controversy also followed his win on Cirrus Des Aigles in the 2011 Champion Stakes, when he was initially fined his &pound;55,000 cut of the prize money for one stroke of the whip above a strict new limit.</p> \n<p>In the end, Soumillon got his money, though not before he had made it plain in a television interview that he felt those responsible for the rules were unhinged, and the stewards little better than muggers in smart suits. But then, Soumillon has always enjoyed a touch of theatre in a winning performance, and famously threw his helmet and whip into the crowd after winning the 2008 Arc on the unbeaten Zarkava. Ervedya’s victory in the same colours of the Aga Khan was another achieved with a flourish.</p> \n<p>Surprisingly, it was also Soumillon’s first success at the Royal meeting at Ascot itself, since his only previous win, aboard Valixir in the 2005 Queen Anne Stakes, was recorded when the meeting switched to York during the Berkshire course’s redevelopment. Given the length of his career and the quality of the horses he has ridden, it was an odd gap to be outstanding on Soumillon’s record, but at least it was finally closed with a typically well-judged Soumillon swoop.</p> \n<p>“I came many times with horses with nice chances, but you need to come here with a champion to win,” Soumillon said. “And sometimes you ride a champion but he’s not in great shape. I knew she had a good turn of foot so I just wanted to try to follow one or two good fillies to bring me to the final furlong. At the entrance to the straight, I saw that Ryan was going very easily on Found and that around her everybody was a bit [tired] and I thought that I’d find a gap. When I came through, she gave me the turn of foot to make it right on the line.</p> \n<p>“Irish and English horses are very tough when you have to fight, so I prefer with a French filly like her to come one time and at the latest moment.”</p> \n<p>Ervedya beat Found by a neck to give Jean-Claude Rouget, her trainer, his first Royal Ascot winner in one of the Group One feature events of the meeting.</p> \n<p>“After she won the [French] Guineas, I had only this race in mind,” Rouget said. “I wanted to win a Group One at Ascot and now it’s done.”</p> \n<p>The first running of the Group One Commonwealth Cup, a six-furlong sprint for three-year-olds, looked a more competitive event than the Coronation Stakes on paper, but Charlie Hills’s Muhaarar routed the field by three-and-three-quarter lengths to establish himself as the leading sprinter of his generation.</p> \n<p>“He’s the best horse I’ve trained,” Hills said afterwards. “Chriselliam [a juvenile winner at the Breeders’ Cup meeting] was very good but this horse is just improving and improving. This is a Group One and it looked a proper race as well, any one of eight or 10 could have won. But he did it in such great style. He’s got the world at his feet.”</p> \n<p>Muhaarar is now 6-1 joint-favourite for the July Cup at Newmarket next month, the season’s all-aged sprint championship event.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434734648874/Soumillon-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Christophe Soumillon explains to owner the Aga Khan how he won the Coronation Stakes on Ervedya.

Perhaps there is a horse in the field for Saturday’s Diamond Jubilee who is so superior to the rest that he can overcome whatever bias there happens to be, but that, for me, is not the way to bet.</p> \n<p>Some of the most interesting horses are drawn high and will therefore at least start the race towards the stands’ side, notably the Australian runner Brazen Beau in stall 15 of 15. Pearl Secret and Due Diligence are others in high stalls but <strong>Mustajeeb (4.20)</strong> has got lucky in stall four and appeals most at odds of 5-1.</p> \n<p>The winner of the slightly longer Jersey Stakes at last year’s Royal Ascot, he has twice run well in Group Ones at a mile. But sprinting could be his game, judging by the way he won over six furlongs last time, beating an Abbaye winner.</p> \n<p><strong>2.30 Ascot</strong> Ballydoyle ran a fairly promising debut and the fact that she has been named after the owners’ stable suggests she is highly rated but the available odds are too short. The more experienced <strong>Tonkinese</strong> won easily at Leopardstown last time and the form of his debut third has worked out well. He wouldn’t want very fast ground but rain is forecast.</p> \n<p><strong>3.05 Ascot</strong> Mahsoob is an entirely convincing favourite who is probably passing through handicaps on his way to Group races but a best price of 2-1 is ridiculous for a competitive event at the Royal meeting. At 16-1, <strong>Ayrad</strong> makes each-way appeal for his handicap debut, as he gives the strong sense of a horse whose best remains unrevealed. He goes well on a sound surface and his latest effort was his best yet.</p> \n<p><strong>3.40 Ascot</strong> It has been a poor week for Sir Michael Stoute but if any race can rescue him it is this one, which he has won five times in the past decade and in which he fields three of the seven runners. It is possible that one or two others may have potential for progress but his <strong>Telescope</strong> is the standout quality here and can repeat last year’s success.</p> \n<p><strong>5.00</strong> <strong>Ascot</strong> As already discussed, a low draw seems likely to be an advantage here and <strong>Gamesome</strong> is of most interest among those in the right half of the starting stalls. He caught the eye running on strongly after plenty of trouble in running at Newmarket last month and looks the sort of progressive type who could be a force in a fast-ground sprint handicap. Watchable, third in a slightly longer race here last year, could also run above his odds.</p> \n<p><strong>5.35 Ascot</strong> Willie Mullins has won this twice in three years and there is really no getting away from his Wicklow Brave, a classy Cheltenham Festival winner who should be fine on fast ground and has Ryan Moore on board for the first time.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434750867268/Horse-Racing---7-Jun-2015-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dermot Weld is the trainer of Mustajeeb, fancied to win the feature race on the final day of Royal Ascot, not least due to a favourable draw.

While many of those commenting underneath his statement on Facebook were clearly fans, urging him to fight on against what they saw as damaging slurs, the wider public reaction on Twitter emphasised the scale of the challenge facing the Farah camp and those close to it.</p> \n<p>His exhortation that he had taken hundreds of drug tests and never failed one was met with weary references to Lance Armstrong. The cynicism on show from a sporting public let down one too many times by their heroes was almost the polar opposite of the mood of giddy optimism that reverberated around the Olympic Stadium and the nation as a whole in the summer of 2012.</p> \n<p>Rewind to August of that year and it was one of the biggest months in the life of not only Usain Bolt and Farah but also of their agent Ricky Simms and his burgeoning company Pace Sports Management. As Bolt stood atop the podium doing Farah’s “mobot” and the British double Olympic champion struck the Jamaican dancehall stance that has become the trademark of one of the biggest sporting stars of his generation, it confirmed the London Games as a triumph for all three in not only sporting but commercial terms.</p> \n<p>Farah’s wife, Tania, who had been with Mo since they were at school and exerts a strong hold over his career off the track, was entitled to feel a swell of pride too as she walked the track with their family.</p> \n<p>Alberto Salazar, the coach with the golden touch who had taken Farah’s career to the next level since he joined his Project Oregon team, exuded satisfaction as he chalked up a golden double and his training partner Galen Rupp, the American now at the centre of doping allegations that he and Salazar strenuously deny, picked up a silver in the 10,000m.</p> \n<p>And for the UK Athletics executives looking down from among the 80,000 crowd, Farah’s golds were vital. Even with them they failed to hit the medal targets set before the Games, but they provided the vital magic moments prayed for by everyone from UKA to London 2012 chairman, Lord Coe (another man now wearing multiple hats, including chair of the British Olympic Association, Nike advisor, IAAF presidential candidate and avowed friend of Salazar, amid the fallout from this mess).</p> \n<p>Three years on Farah finds himself engaged in a very different battle – not for medals but for the trust of the public – and pulled in every direction by the competing advice and priorities of all four. While Salazar has gone to ground, unfairly or not increasing suspicion with every day he stays silent and prepares his defence against the claims by the BBC’s Panorama, Farah has appeared to have been left twisting in the wind.</p> \n<p>After initially bolting from Birmingham and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/mo-farah-flies-us-confront-alberto-salazar-doping-allegations\" title=\"\">returning to Oregon</a> to “seek answers” from Salazar, he is now in the south of France preparing for his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/17/mo-farah-return-track-monaco-diamond-league\" title=\"\">return to the track in Monaco</a> next month.</p> \n<p>Simms, who handles other members of the Nike-sponsored Project Oregon team including Rupp, cannot help but have been conflicted. In all there are at least five athletes on Pace’s books who currently train with Salazar or have been linked with the project – Mary Cain, Matthew Centrowitz, Shannon Rowbury, Jordan Hasay and Rupp among them.</p> \n<p>It is Simms, hands-on with his charges even as the sums they can attract in the form of sponsorship and appearance fees has soared, who appears to have been advising Farah to stay silent until Salazar has said his piece.</p> \n<p>But every day that has gone by since that initial Panorama was broadcast has made Farah appear less sure of his ground. That impression only intensified in the wake of this week’s revelation that he <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/18/mo-farah-fresh-questions-missed-drug-tests\" title=\"\">missed two tests within one 18-month window</a> during the run-up to London 2012.</p> \n<p>The amateurish video that then emerged of Simms trying to prove to UK Anti-Doping that Farah could not hear his doorbell when testers came to call in 2011 will not do wonders for his reputation.</p> \n<p>Farah’s loyalties to Simms, Salazar and, of course, Tania run deep. It was Simms who acted as coach, mentor and agent at various points in Farah’s development from callow prospect to late-flowering world beater, in 2006 famously moving him into a house in Teddington with some of his Kenyan charges.</p> \n<p>According to Farah folklore it was the moment he realised he had to get serious if he was to challenge the best. “Mo has seen that their life is running, sleeping, running,” said Simms at the time, before also playing a pivotal role in the decision to move to Oregon and join Salazar in 2011 before the Games.</p> \n<p>Pace now has more than 50 clients listed on its website but Simms prides himself on maintaining his hands-on approach. His priority is his athletes to the exclusion of all else but that can sometimes appear to blind him to the fact that, in Bolt and Farah in particular, he now has two names that transcend their sport and, particularly in the wake of London 2012, have become fair game for the front half of the newspapers as well as the back.</p> \n<p>A series of avoidable missteps dulled the golden post-2012 glow: the six-figure fee that Farah took home for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/apr/18/mo-farah-london-marathon-criticism\" title=\"\">running half of the London marathon</a> in 2013, which could have been mitigated by simply taking the full amount the following year; the spat with the Daily Mail over a story about his family; the Twitter rows with fellow athletes; that bizarre episode where he refused to reveal the names of his newborn twins but then unveiled them in an exclusive interview with a celebrity magazine.</p> \n<p>All those incidents drew on a well of goodwill that had once seemed inexhaustible and now leave Simms in a tricky position as he attempts to reconcile responsibilities to Farah, to Rupp, to Project Oregon and to his business. He is not the only one conflicted. As noted several times in the past fortnight, UK Athletics – which is currently conducting a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/12/uk-athletics-mo-farah-alberto-salazar-review-relationship\" title=\"\">review of its relationship with Salazar</a> – has its own questions to answer too.</p> \n<p>The one thing that is clear at the end of a week that leaves more questions than answers for Farah, despite his belated and welcome statement, is that all of this could have been handled so much better from the start. And that the next six months will define the way that Farah is remembered by a generation for whom his immortality once seemed inviolable.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/19/1434730351148/Mo-Farah-Usain-Bolt-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mo Farah and Usain Bolt on the podium at the Olympic Stadium in 2012, headier times for the British athlete.

Over the course of my career I have taken hundreds of drugs tests and every single one has been negative. I’ve fully explained the only two tests in my career that I have ever missed, which the authorities understood, and there was never any suggestion that these were anything more than simple mistakes.”</p> \n<p>As revealed by the Guardian yesterday, Farah has recruited crisis-management specialists from the public relations agency Freuds after being put on the back foot by a BBC Panorama <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/sport/2015/jun/03/mo-farah-training-camp-documentary-alleged-drug-use-alberto-salazar-\" title=\"\">documentary</a> which accused his American coach, Alberto Salazar, of administering the banned steroid testosterone to his training partner Galen Rupp, along with a variety of other offences that either bent or broke anti-doping rules.</p> \n<p>Freuds advised Farah to state his case more vigorously after his initial plan to focus on his training and ignore the rash of headlines about his coach became untenable when the Daily Mail revealed details of his two missed tests this week. And this statement, which has Freud’s fingerprints all over it, is a marked attempt to respond directly to the negative headlines while also reminding people of Farah’s human side.</p> \n<p>He explained: “The last two weeks have been the toughest of my life – with rumours and speculation about me that are completely false – and the impact this has had on my family and friends has left me angry, frustrated and upset. In particular, the media pressure on my young family and my wife, who is five months pregnant, is extremely painful, especially as I’m away training for some important races.”</p> \n<p>Farah, who has not spoken in public for nearly a fortnight, since a press conference before the Birmingham Grand <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/sport/2015/jun/06/mo-farah-angry-frustrated-allegations-alberto-salazar\" title=\"\">Prix</a>, during which he pledged to get answers from Salazar, also confirmed that he had spoken to his coach.</p> \n<p>“I went to Portland to speak to Alberto and demand answers,” he added. “He reassured me that the claims are false and that he will soon be providing evidence to make that clear. Until then I will not be commenting further on the allegations.”</p> \n<p>He is not likely to speak again until Salazar releases his long-awaited riposte to Panorama. That was expected on Thursday, but has been repeatedly pushed back with opinion split on whether it will now come before or after the US Trials which begin on Thursday. Salazar and Rupp deny all the accusations made by the BBC, while Farah was never accused of wrongdoing.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Salazar has insisted Farah is still under his tutelage despite moving to France to train. “Mo is on a different training cycle, as he always is at this time of year,” he told the Oregonian newspaper. “So I send him to Europe to get accustomed to the time zone.

Blue skies and sunshine bathed the riders as they sat on the start line in Oundle.

The high speeds made it difficult for a breakaway to get clear; there was a brief split in the bunch as they went through the first intermediate sprint but it soon came back together. Emma Johansson (Orica-AIS), who started the day third in the classification, took the top spot to add three points to her tally.</p> \n<p>The attacks continued to come including a concerted effort from Bigla’s Vera Koedooder, who spent 100km out front on stage two but it was not to be. The high pace and rolling roads took their toll and the peloton split into two groups after 55km of racing. The gap went out to 15sec before the chasers finally regained touch.</p> \n<p>It was not until Chloe McConville (Orica-AIS) made a move after the first climb that a break began to take shape and after 70km of racing they had 38sec on the peloton. As the peloton jostled behind before the second intermediate sprint and QOM, the two riders were allowed to build an advantage of 1:30. In between the leaders and the peloton, Sharon Laws of Bigla set off in chase. Lex Albrecht (Optum p/b Kelly Benefit Strategies) would follow suit but after some time.</p> \n<p>After a lengthy pursuit, Laws finally joined forces with the two riders out front as they neared the 100km mark. Albrecht would get within 20sec of the leading trio but could not bridge the gap. With less than 40km remaining the escapees had a 3:30 advantage on the peloton. That would be the most they were allowed to have with many teams interested in a bunch sprint at the finish.</p> \n<p>The escapees were finally reeled in with 3km of racing and the expected sprint finish came to fruition with Majerus sealing the win by a substantial margin.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/19/1434734620839/Christine-Majerus-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Christine Majerus celebrates as she crosses the finish line in Kettering to win of stage three of the Women's Tour.
