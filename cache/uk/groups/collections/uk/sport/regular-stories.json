It’s as if you can’t mention him. I’m the one everybody wants to pretend never lived. But that will not be the case for ever because it can’t be the case forever. That won’t work, people aren’t stupid. I mean, I tried to make it right with every one of those people … I can only do so much.”</p> \n<p>Asked about the federal court case pending against him, Armstrong told his interviewers: “The whistleblower case is a $100m case. We would not be sitting at this table any more. We wouldn’t be sitting in this home any more. We wouldn’t be sitting in any home. I don’t have $100m.</p> \n<p>He added, though, that he “likes” his case. “In a whistleblower case you have to show real tangible harm. The Postal Service commissioned studies in 2004 that showed it made $100m. There were years when it was making upwards of $20m a year in new business, before we had even started to race. So when you start to add all these things up, here is the question: ‘Where are the damages?’”</p> \n<p>He insisted he will tell all. “Certainly in my depositions and hearings in the trial for the federal case, at this point in my life, I’m not lying, I’m not going to jail. I’m not leaving what I got going on. And they would. If they found out I had lied, they would absolutely move for that. They would love it, love it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/mar/27/lance-armstrong-geoff-thomas-tour-de-france-leukaemia\">High time Lance Armstrong realised that only humility earns redemption | Richard Williams</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Armstrong also took aim at cycling’s world governing body head Cookson, who branded the Texan “completely disrespectful” for looking to ride the Tour de France route this summer for charity. Cookson suggested Armstrong ”would be well-advised not to take part” in the former England footballer Geoff Thomas’s charity fundraising mission.</p> \n<p>Thomas has convinced Armstrong to take part in his charity event, riding the Tour route one day ahead of the professional peloton. Cookson said the UCI has no authority to stop Armstrong’s bid, but urged the American to think again.</p> \n<p>Armstrong said: “I mean, I don’t know Brian Cookson. I don’t know what his vision is for the sport. I don’t know if he is even able to form a vision. But I do know that me and Geoff riding in France is the least of his problems. If he is making public comments – and this is as strong as I’ll go – he needs to be talking about other things because this sport is not in a good place for a variety of reasons. A lot of it has to do – perhaps some would say – with me. But he doesn’t need to worry about this.”</p> \n<p>And as he prepares to ride in France again, Armstrong is resolute that he will not get a frosty reception.</p> \n<p>“People think I have this bitter relationship with the country, with its people,” he said. “I like going there. I love France … I could be wrong, I’ve been wrong plenty in my life, but I’ve been to France since all this happened and if you walk into a cafe or a restaurant or walk down the street that [negativity] is not the reaction I get. God forbid the reaction is positive.

The chief scout, Graham Carr, and club ambassador Bob Moncur have also been given seats on the board, in a move the club feels adds strength to its football operation. Newcastle will be the only Premier League club with its head coach also a presence at board meetings and the managing director, Lee Charnley, described the move as a positive step forward.</p> \n<p>“I am delighted that Steve, Graham and Bob will be joining me on the board,” Charnley said. “It was particularly important to make the head coach a board member in order to gain a full understanding and appreciation for the club as a whole, not just the football side. In Steve, we have an individual willing to embrace that responsibility.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/10/steve-mcclaren-newcastle-mike-ashley-buys-players\">Steve McClaren can revive Newcastle if Mike Ashley buys him the players | Louise Taylor</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While Ashley appears willing to step aside and let the football board deal with the day-to-day running of the club, there is no suggestion he intends to relinquish any personal power or responsibility. He was never the most enthusiastic attender of board meetings in the past and is expected to continue to exert the same level of control over the club’s commercial direction. While the reshuffle may be partly to appease fans who resent his position as a figurehead, it could also be seen as a tacit admission that Ashley got a big football decision horribly wrong last season, in deciding not to replace Alan Pardew and almost suffering relegation as a result.</p> \n<p>The long-expected appointment of McClaren is much more straightforward. The coach sacked by Derby County after failing to reach the play-offs has signed a contract for an initial three years, which could be extended to eight. The club has made advances to McClaren before, notably in his Middlesbrough days in 2004 and as recently as January after Pardew left, but in both cases he felt loyalty to the clubs that employed him and decided the timing was not right. This time the 54-year-old was available and he claimed his interest in Newcastle was revived as soon as Ashley made his promise at the end of last season to stick around until the club won something.</p> \n<p>“I am privileged to be appointed head coach of Newcastle United, this is a big club with a wonderful heritage,” McClaren said. “There is a lot of work to do but the club has made it clear about wanting success and I would not have come here if I didn’t believe they were serious. I know how important Newcastle United is to the city and the region. The supporters are some of the most loyal, passionate and devoted in the world. This club has waited far too long to win a trophy, we owe it to the supporters to do everything we can to reward them with success. I am determined to give the supporters a team they can be proud of. I have already won trophies as a manager and a club the size of Newcastle should be winning cups and finishing in the top eight of the Premier League.”</p> \n<p>McClaren has, indeed, won trophies as a manager, the League Cup in 2004 and the Dutch title with Twente in 2010, although whether that makes him the sort of saviour who can guide Newcastle to their first silverware since Kevin Keegan’s side came up from Division One as champions in 1993 is a moot point. Newcastle have not won anything at the top level since the FA Cup in 1955, or the Uefa Cup – when it was still known as the Fairs Cup – in 1969, and managers of the calibre of Keegan, Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness and Sir Bobby Robson are among those to have endured that drought.</p> \n<p>McClaren left Middlesbrough after modest success to manage England, an episode that did not end well, and although he showed courage and application in rebuilding his career in the Netherlands, he was subsequently dismissed from posts at Wolfsburg and Derby and resigned as Nottingham Forest manager after taking only eight points from his first 10 league games.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Newcastle’s managing director called him an “innovative and forward-thinking coach”, a description that seemed to skip several recent events and settle instead on the reputation McClaren enjoyed around the time he joined Manchester United as assistant to Sir Alex Ferguson. “He can develop and improve players, which was a key quality we sought,” Charnley said. “He has been tasked to secure a top-eight finish and heavily incentivised to try to win a cup competition but the immediate focus will be assessing the squad and appointing his backroom staff.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433957066126/Steve-McClaren-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Steve McClaren has signed a three-year deal with Newcastle which could be extended to eight.

The confirmation that the Open Championship’s live television rights in the United States have been renewed – adding to the hundreds of millions of dollars this will mean for one of golf’s ruling bodies over a 12-year period – was a nod to NBC’s desperation to land a deal which ESPN was indifferent towards. However, TV executives are not devoid of all sense: the deal also illustrated the appeal of golf in the long term, when Woods will no longer be a factor.</p> \n<p>While there is no precise time frame for the end of the Woods era, his struggles on the course mean competitively Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth and their peers dominate the narrative. For all those who believe golf cannot prevail without Woods, or even someone approaching his status, there is regular evidence to the contrary. The sport, just like any, evolves, as it did when Jack Nicklaus edged into retirement.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/tiger-woods-us-open-poor-form\">Tiger Woods takes the positives before US Open despite his poor form</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There may not be anyone like Woods soon, there may never be, but golf need not vanish from the sporting radar because of that. Other features, such as the time it now takes to complete rounds and the cost of equipment, are more damaging to golf’s evolution than the regression of a marquee figure. The trouble is people seem scared to admit as much, both in fear of writing off Woods and examining the broader subjects golf must battle.</p> \n<p>Scrutiny of Woods’s game is increasingly uncomfortable. At the Memorial last weekend, a venue where he used to be able to prevail for fun, the 39-year-old followed up a Saturday 85 with a Sunday playing on his own, <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2488964-tiger-woods-at-memorial-tournament-2015-sunday-leaderboard-score-reaction\" title=\"\">the odd man out at the tail end of the field</a>. He was unable to progress from that position. Four rounds, 302 shots – 29 worse off than the play-off competitors, Justin Rose and David Lingmerth. For the first time in his career, Woods made six double bogeys or worse in a single event.</p> \n<p>Discussion of Woods before the US Open, which next week he will seek to win for a fourth time, at Chambers Bay in Washington state, is of the freakish kind. But he will seek to win it: despite every blow to his confidence, the mindset of chasing success apparently never wavers. Onlookers, meanwhile, are left asking whether he may make the cut and how badly he might score on a venue which, if the USGA is true to form, will not be even close to forgiving.</p> \n<p>If you are fond of betting on the ludicrous scenario, Woods is priced between 40 and 66-1 to end his major-winning wait on the outskirts of Seattle. The sad thing is, this is not exaggeration. And it is sad; the fall from grace of a once magical sportsman cannot be regarded as pretty viewing.</p> \n<p>Woods probably felt compelled to end an absence from competitive action, as was the case at this year’s Masters. He seemed to feel a form of duty, not only to himself, but to golf. It is also admirable that he is willing to perform under the scrutiny which surrounds his every move, amid a realisation that only tournament play will reveal his current level.</p> \n<p>The problem, though, is there is no clear sign of improvement. After eight months with another coach, Chris Como, and despite regular utterances to the contrary, you would struggle to pinpoint any area of technical progression. If disastrous stretches of holes were offset by routine brilliance, there would be cause for optimism. But they are not.</p> \n<p>Woods gives the impression of being technically muddled – a strange scenario for someone so naturally gifted. Extended breaks, whether through fitness ailments or a desire to have his golf “tournament ready”, have made no material difference at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-85890e46-b1bd-4d2d-a657-68ad5eca5fbe\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433941356774/d0657884-b6c5-40d0-a12e-3a72dd078a10-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"tiger woods\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tiger Woods during the final round of the Memorial, where he played the final round on his own and remained in 71st and last place.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas J. Russo/USA Today Sports</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nick Faldo has asked how much more Woods, now ranked 181 in the world, “can handle all of this”. Brandel Chamblee, a respected analyst for the Golf Channel, pointedly added that: “Time hasn’t done this to Tiger. He has done this to himself.” The latter point is a nod towards Woods’s desire to constantly remodel what was already a dominant golf game. In his defence, injury was a mitigating factor.</p> \n<p>As he lurches from embarrassment to embarrassment, the logical question to ask is how long Woods might give himself to get it right. His greatness is undeniable, but so too is the fact Woods cannot call on his once imperious touch any more. This process of making up the numbers in tournaments he used to win will torture Woods, one of the most ferociously competitive players who has ever lived.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/06/tiger-woods-worst-round-career-85-memorial\">Tiger Woods slumps to worst round of career with 85 at Memorial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That is all as relevant to those confidently predicting some sort of imminent return to winning form as to Woods himself. In a season and a half, Woods is a combined 51 over par in PGA Tour events. He insists rankings are not a fair reflection of where he is. Bare facts show the likes of Inhoi Hur, Troy Merritt, Benjamin Herbert, Scott Pinckney and Wade Ormsby ahead of him. The list goes on and on.</p> \n<p>So for how long does he persist? This US Open promises to be a footnote. The Open Championship at St Andrews already bears resemblance to a line in the sand. In 2000 and 2005, he won, by eight and five shots respectively, at the Old Course. Even Woods himself will inevitably glance back to the peak of his powers when returning to Fife next month.</p> \n<p>At a venue he could at one time have successfully negotiated using hickory-shafted clubs and tennis balls, further failure would be a cruel blow. History, that great ally of this 14-times major champion, warns us against writing him off. The trouble is, that past is being constantly outweighed by a reality that cannot go on for ever and, in the wider sense, does not need to.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433941310678/e5dff3b8-1d25-4d3a-bd99-717b2420dae8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sam Greenwood/Getty Images","altText":"A solemn Tiger Woods acknowledges the crowd on the 18th hole during the final round of The Memorial Tournament.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sam Greenwood/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/10/1433940885810/tiger-woods-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tiger Woods during the final round of the Memorial, where he played the final round on his own and remained in 71st and last place.

For the first time since 1995 the global tournament will be going ahead without him and he is starting to appreciate just what he is missing. Back at Twickenham as a tournament ambassador on Wednesday he even used the word “torture” to describe his current emotions as the 2015 edition looms.</p> \n<p>As Wilkinson was swift to stress, however, the mental state of England’s current squad is a more pressing priority. The 2003 World Cup-winning fly-half was among those who witnessed things unravel at first hand in New Zealand four years ago and has also watched from afar in recent weeks as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/15/manu-tuilagi-rugby-world-cup-assautling-police-officer-england\" title=\"\">Manu Tuilagi</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/29/england-dylan-hartley-world-cup-squad\" title=\"\">Dylan Hartley</a> have removed themselves from contention.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/02/danny-cipriani-arrest-stuart-lancaster-world-cup-england\">Danny Cipriani arrest gives hard-line Lancaster new World Cup dilemma | Robert Kitson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It has merely heightened his belief that self-discipline is the key to World Cup success if England wish to be as successful on home soil as they were in 2003. “Mental investment” is the phrase he now uses and, notwithstanding recent events, he senses the vast majority of Stuart Lancaster’s squad are prepared to make the kind of sacrifices he famously did.</p> \n<p>“When I speak to these guys I see people that care a hell of a lot about what they are doing,” said Wilkinson, who was helping Prince Harry and his fellow 2003 winner Will Greenwood launch the trophy tour in which the Webb Ellis Cup will visit more than 300 destinations in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and, finally, England between now and mid-September.</p> \n<p>“You build your own path and every brick in that is important. To do things just because they’re written down doesn’t really mean anything. Anyone can do that.”</p> \n<p>While sympathising with those missing out – in addition, Danny Cipriani is awaiting the result of a blood test after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/02/danny-cipriani-arrest-england\" title=\"\">being arrested on suspicion of drink-driving</a> – Wilkinson sounded like a man who would have adopted a similar stance to Lancaster’s had it been up to him. “The Manu and Danny situations is one of those where I’m sure these guys will look at it and say: ‘What was I doing? What was I thinking?’ For Stuart it’s tough as well … he doesn’t want to be making these decisions.”</p> \n<p>In his own mind, it also brought back memories of the embarrassment he felt when, untypically, he let his standards slip momentarily in 2002. His lapse was simply being a couple of minutes late for a team meeting but he still winces at the shame. “I remember sprinting across the hotel because I was going to be late. I’ve never run so fast in my life and it was only a Monday.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t get there in time and the meeting door was closed. I was outside, panting. I went to knock but then went down on my haunches thinking: ‘I don’t want to knock, I don’t want to walk into that meeting room because I’ve let them down.’ It wasn’t that I thought the guys are going to give me a bollocking. I just didn’t want to be the one [to let the team down]. You talk about guys doing stuff on the field … just being late for one meeting destroyed me.”</p> \n<p>If England need a moral guardian they need look no further. Informal requests to help out have already been made by the national management and Wilkinson, who now spends a large chunk of his time coaching Wales’s Leigh Halfpenny at Toulon, would hardly be the worst person to mentor Owen Farrell and George Ford, whom their predecessor believes may both start at 10 this autumn depending on the opposition.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/08/chris-robshaw-england-players-early-fitness-work\">Chris Robshaw among England players called in for early fitness work</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Wilkinson, though, says he would prefer to help out individuals rather than be wheeled in to lecture the entire squad on how to win a World Cup in the dying seconds. “I’ll tell them that, if they want to do that, that process needed to start a long time ago. Sometimes I come across Catty [Mike Catt] or Andy Farrell who have said it would be great to have me in, even just to watch some of the preparations and tell them what they think. But that’s just us being mates, really. I’m so aware that it’s about them [the current players].</p> \n<p>“I don’t know what this generation want. If they said they wanted me to help them one on one I’d be there like a shot but I don’t want to come in and interfere. Some things I can help with but some things I can’t.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/10/1433958965909/Jonny-Wilkinson-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jonny Wilkinson at the launch of the Rugby World Cup trophy tour.

Ritchie, however, does not think the image of English rugby has been tarnished and believes the squad’s culture has improved significantly under Stuart Lancaster.</p> \n<p>“I don’t feel let down, I feel disappointed for them and they must feel that as well,” said Ritchie, commenting on the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/15/manu-tuilagi-rugby-world-cup-assautling-police-officer-england\" title=\"\">removal of Tuilagi</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/02/dylan-hartley-quit-international-rugby-england-world-cup\" title=\"\">Hartley from</a> Lancaster’s squad. “This is the moment of a lifetime for them so to miss it is extremely sad. The over-arching position, however, is a good one. I don’t think we have an image problem at all.”</p> \n<p>Ritchie, talking at the launch of the RWC trophy tour 100 days before the tournament’s opening game, also revealed he had spoken to people involved in England’s ill-starred 2011 campaign in New Zealand, including Lancaster’s predecessor, Martin Johnson, to try to ensure there is no repeat this autumn.</p> \n<p>This time the impact of social media, particularly camera phones, will be significantly greater as will the expectation on England as the hosts. “We have spoken to and learnt from those people who were involved in 2011 and are still involved in the England team,” said Ritchie.</p> \n<p>“Stuart, the coaching team ... we have all sat down with the players. I think they’re very clear on their responsibilities as we get nearer to the event. They all recognise its importance and the opportunity it presents for them. I think they get that very clearly and I’m confident we’re in a good place. I have no doubts about the culture, the discipline and the way in which the squad will deal with all the pressures over the next few weeks and months. They will be significant but again that has been planned for.”</p> \n<p>Ticket sales for the tournament have now exceeded 2m and the organisers are confident they will deliver the most financially successful World Cup in history. Ritchie also remains bullish about the host country’s chances on the field. “There is only one focus and that is to make sure we deliver on the pitch. You start off with the belief and the objective that we want to set out and win the World Cup. Will we do it? It is going to be a very hard job but we will give it our best shot.”</p> \n<p>England’s World Cup shirt, meanwhile, will be launched on 6 July and Ritchie has defended the high cost of the latest special-edition jerseys. “People will buy them if they want to buy them. If nobody wants to buy the one at &pound;120 that is the call of the consumer. Nobody is forcing anybody but we think it is a very special shirt and all the funds go back into the game.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433961268776/Chris-Robshaw-Joe-Marler--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chris Robshaw, right, Joe Marler, left, and James Haskell offer a glimpse of the shirt England will wear at the Rugby World Cup.
