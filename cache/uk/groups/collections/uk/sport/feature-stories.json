Wimbledon, though, is the scene of his most emphatic win over the Serb, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/07/andy-murray-wimbledon-2013-novak-djokovic\" title=\"\">in three nervy sets</a>, to break the stranglehold of history that was choking the life out of British tennis since Fred Perry’s pre-war glory days.</p> \n<p>Murray will have his reasons for not gorging on sentimentality but would only say: “That is one of the matches, I don’t know why, that I have hardly watched at all. I’ve watched bits of the match but not extended periods.</p> \n<p>“It’s more the Olympics. I’ve watched my match with Novak at the Olympics a couple of times, and the final with Roger [Federer] quite a few times, rather than Wimbledon.”</p> \n<p>Amateur psychologists may say it was such a nerve-racking experience, it brings more trauma than comfort to revisit. Whatever, Murray looks and sounds in fine shape after recovering from a virus that temporarily closed his left eye after Roland Garros.</p> \n<p>“I spent time with the dogs, watched a bit of TV and stayed off the internet,” he said. “I just got away from everything, a few days at home being with Kim. Since we got married, I spent maybe one or two days at home after I got back from Rome. It was nice not to have to do anything for those few days.”</p> \n<p>For the nation, summer is an exercise in cloud-watching and luxuriating in the sporting excellence of others. For Murray, summer properly starts at Queen’s on Tuesday when, in pursuit of his fourth Aegon Championships title, he plays the Chinese Taipei outsider Lu Yen-hsun, a match that offers the extremes of cakewalk or disaster.</p> \n<p>While it is unthinkable he world No3 could lose for a second time to a 31-year-old qualifier who caught him off-guard in two quick sets <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2008/aug/11/olympics2008.olympicstennis1\" title=\"\">at the Beijing Olympics seven years ago</a>, grass is a slippery assignment in more ways than one – even if the current dampness in the air will surely disappear by the time they get on court.</p> \n<p>Lu beat the Uzbek Denis Istomin 7-6, 7-6 on Sunday to go through to the main draw here. He and the rest of the reduced field of 32 will not lack for financial incentive.</p> \n<p>A tournament upgraded to ATP 500 status has attracted eight of the world’s best 14 players, with prize money pretty much doubled to €1,574,640 (&pound;1,140,000). The winner gets €1,221,760.</p> \n<p>Rafael Nadal will be among the main contenders, having rejuvenated his flagging season with a first win on grass since winning Wimbledon five years ago by beating Victor Troicki in an hour-and-a-half <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/14/rafael-nadal-stuttgart-title-grass-wimbledon\" title=\"\">in the Stuttgart final on Sunday</a>.

I also was with the team and John Stiner at the altitude camp he spoke about in Park City, and believe his report as well.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/03/mo-farah-training-camp-documentary-alleged-drug-use-alberto-salazar-\" title=\"\">In the BBC Panorama documentary </a>Kara Goucher alleged Salazar had coached Rupp to get a therapeutic use exemption for an intravenous drip before the 2011 World Championships. Under Wada rules, such drips are prohibited and anyone caught manipulating the TUE process to get one would be liable for a ban. She also claimed Salazar tried to get her to take prescription thyroid medicine to lose weight after the birth of her son.</p> \n<p>Stiner was the masseur who alleged he saw a bottle of Androgel, a testosterone gel, in Salazar’s training camp in Park City in 2008. And it was Magness who made the most serious allegation of all, telling Panorama he had documented evidence that Salazar had given the banned steroid testosterone to Rupp when he was 16.</p> \n<p>“I have never met Steve but from all accounts believe him to be an honest individual. I firmly believe that any and all performance-enhancing drugs activity within the NOP while I was there was limited to Galen Rupp,” Rohatinsky said.</p> \n<p>Among the charges against Salazar are that he gave the banned steroid testosterone to Rupp when he was 16, coached Rupp to get a TUE so he could use an intravenous drip before the 2011 World Championships and flouted several other doping rules. Salazar and Rupp deny all charges and there is no suggestion that Farah has done anything wrong.</p> \n<p>According to the American news website ProPublica, at least 17 people who have worked with Salazar have now spoken out against him. Rohatinsky, the latest person to come forward, said he had become particularly suspicious seeing Rupp win a 10,000m silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics behind Farah.</p> \n<p>“Watching that race live was surreal,” he said. “Seeing someone I had trained with consistently for two years not too long before – and beaten several times in races in the years prior to that in college – push through that last lap and accelerate on the homestretch to beat the likes of the Bekele brothers was incredible. And when I say incredible I mean it in the literal sense of the word. How does that amount of progress happen in that short a time frame? Supporters always point to hard work but we all worked our butts off. It reminds me of the Lance Armstrong commercial, What Am I On?</p> \n<p>“The entire time I was with the group there was always what I would call a wall of separation between Alberto/Galen and the rest of the group. Galen was very much Alberto’s son while the rest of the group were his athletes. In saying this I will give credit to Alberto, he worked his butt off for all of us and was very dedicated to taking care of the needs of everyone in the group. But that wall was always there and the level of secrecy and seclusion was definitely palpable.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile tThe chair of UK Athletics Ed Warner has told the BBC’s Sportsweek that his organisation had spoken to Farah “very frequently” over the past week and had no fears that he would return to top form later in the summer. “All things considered I think he’s in a good frame of mind in difficult circumstances,” he said. “He is going to get out there and show the great athlete he is in the summer, I am convinced of that.”</p> \n<p>But Lord Coe, who is running for the presidency of the IAAF, global athletics’ governing body, agreed it had “not been a good period” for the sport. He also admitted he would “probably not” sever ties with Salazar if he was in Farah’s shoes.</p> \n<p>“If Mo is satisfied that there’s nothing to answer then he will want to keep what has been an extremely good coaching and training relationship,” he said. “I’m sure he will be weighing all that up but dependent upon the answer Mo gives. We have to be very sure that the testimony that has been given stands scrutiny.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434311524106/Alberto-Salazar-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The pressure on Alberto Salazar intensified when another of his former athletes backed the full extent the allegations made against the coach.

That is why I think it is clearly indispensable to follow through with the initiated process of president’s change as it has been announced,” Scala said on Sunday.</p> \n<p>His comments came after a Swiss newspaper reported an unnamed source close to Blatter as saying he had received messages of support from Asian and African associations asking him to rethink his decision and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/sepp-blatter-stay-fifa-president-swiss-newspaper\" title=\"\">had not ruled out staying on</a>.</p> \n<p>Fifa insiders swiftly branded the suggestion “nonsense” and in a statement world football’s governing body, in crisis since US prosecutors charged 14 officials, nine of whom are current or former Fifa executives, over widespread <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/27/several-top-fifa-officials-arrested\" title=\"\">bribery and fraud</a>, pointed to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/02/sepp-blatter-fifa-president-resigns\" title=\"\">Blatter’s announcement </a>on 2 June.</p> \n<p>In that statement, he said he would carry on until an extraordinary elective congress to be held between December and February next year. A Fifa executive committee meeting on 20 July will set the exact date. But Blatter was clear in his intention to “lay down my mandate” and stated: “I shall not be a candidate.”</p> \n<p>Scepticism from those insistent on fundamental reform is inevitable since Blatter also promised in 2011 that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2011/mar/22/sepp-blatter-fifa-president-2015\" title=\"\">his fourth term as president would be his last</a> before performing a U-turn and declaring <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/sep/08/sepp-blatter-fifa-fifth-term-re-election-confirms\" title=\"\">his “mission” unfinished</a>.</p> \n<p>Since Blatter announced his resignation, just four days after being re-elected as president, there has been great speculation within football as to his motives.</p> \n<p>Some have suggested he was buying time to find a way to cling on as president. Others believe that, despite the fact that some of his closest lieutenants are among those indicted by US authorities, he planned to use the time until the new election to ease a favoured successor into the post.</p> \n<p>Since Blatter’s announcement, made amid the fallout from the FBI investigation that alleged a “World Cup of fraud” going back two generations, world football’s power brokers have been circling one another and calibrating their next moves. The Uefa president, Michel Platini, has held meetings with the Kuwaiti Fifa executive, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/03/sheikh-al-sabah-fifa-powerbroker-sepp-blatter\" title=\"\">Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah</a>, who supported Blatter at the last election and is seen as the key powerbroker in Asia. Sheikh al-Sabah is also believed to have met with Issa Hayatou, the head of the Confederation of African Football.</p> \n<p>In his speech promising to stand down, Blatter referred to “far-reaching, fundamental reforms”, but he appears to be mainly focused on limiting the powers of the confederations around the executive committee table.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, there will be continued pressure on Blatter to stand down immediately, from within Fifa and without. Further revelations are expected as more US court documents are unsealed and the arrest and extradition process continues</p> \n<p>The Tory MP Damian Collins, a prime mover in the New Fifa Now campaign, said on Sunday: “We know Blatter will do all he can to try to retain influence over Fifa to protect himself and his cronies. He needs to go now.”</p> \n<p>However, even if Blatter were to stand down immediately, under Fifa rules his place as president would be taken by Hayatou, who has been closely associated with his regime for more than two decades, as the most senior Fifa vice-president until an election could be held.</p> \n<p>Adding to Fifa’s troubles last week, Interpol cancelled its relationship with the governing body and is, <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/fifa-money-no-longer-wanted-at-interpol/\" title=\"\">according to a report by the newspaper Politico</a>, set to return some of the money it received from Fifa to help fight corruption in sport. Interpol had been pledged &curren;20m over a 10-year period and has said it will pay back the unspent &curren;3m (&pound;2.2m) of the &curren;11m it has already received.</p> \n<p>The Interpol spokesman Pietro Calcaterra rejected suggestions that the full sum should be repaid and said the money already spent “has been used for the purpose for which it was intended”.</p> \n<p>In addition Fifa’s director of communications, Walter de Gregorio, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/11/fifa-communications-head-walter-de-gregorio-resigns\" title=\"\">left the organisation</a> days after he told a joke about Fifa’s travails on television, but the Swiss report claimed he had clashed with Blatter because he was adamant he should quit as president.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434280414838/Domenico-Scala-left-shake-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Domenico Scala, left, shakes hands with Sepp Blatter after the president announced his resignation.

But the four trainers who have made the journey to take part at Ascot this week are also likely to have one eye on events back home, where the furore of alleged doping with cobalt is a story that has preoccupied racing professionals for months on end.</p> \n<p>The latest development came on Thursday when five people were formally charged by the stewards of Racing Victoria after a lengthy investigation. Among them was the trainer Danny O’Brien, whose Star Witness was placed in two different races at Royal Ascot in 2011. He now faces questions over four samples taken from his horses from October to December showing unusually high levels of cobalt, much higher than the permitted threshold introduced in April last year. Along with the others accused, he protests his innocence.</p> \n<p>Charges may yet be laid against Peter Moody, known in Britain as the trainer of the superstar sprinter Black Caviar, the sensation of Ascot in 2012, when she scrambled home by a head after her jockey stopped riding prematurely. One of Moody’s horses returned a high level of cobalt in a sample in October and stewards are still considering whether it would be appropriate to take action. A decision on that and a final hearing on the charges already laid are both thought to be some weeks away.</p> \n<p>Matters have proceeded at a stately pace but that seems appropriate, since cobalt doping is a very new phenomenon. Regulators in Australia and elsewhere are patently feeling their way toward the right way to deal with it.</p> \n<p>Unlike many other substances used to enhance performance, cobalt is naturally occurring in horses, so simply being able to detect its presence proves nothing. The suspicion is that some racehorses have had extra cobalt introduced into their systems because it is supposed to stimulate red blood cell production, leading to an EPO-like effect of delaying fatigue.</p> \n<p>At this early stage in our understanding of cobalt doping, even that outcome appears open to question. Unlike humans, greyhounds or racing camels, horses have the capacity to increase the percentage of red blood cells in their blood during strenuous exercise. In a racehorse at rest, that would typically be 40% to 45% but racehorses after exercise have shown levels of 65% to 70%. As a result, Dr Colin Roberts of Cambridge University, an expert in equine sports medicine, questions whether boosting the proportion of red blood cells still further would actually be helpful in racehorses, since the consequent increased blood viscosity may have adverse effects on the circulation.</p> \n<p>The general belief in racing is that cobalt doping does improve performance, although it is also thought to lead to long-term health problems for the horse involved. So far, the issue has been a live one only for regulators in Australia and parts of the US – but the racing world is small and, if someone has tried to gain an advantage by such means in those countries, it is thought likely to be a matter of time before someone tries it here.</p> \n<p>None of the trainers racing at Royal Ascot this week are involved in the Australian investigation but all are likely to be concerned. “It’s a very significant case,” says Robert Smerdon, whose Shamal Wind runs in the King’s Stand Stakes on Tuesday. “With the profile of those involved, it’s one of the biggest things we’ve seen in racing for a long time.”</p> \n<p>Smerdon’s understanding is that at least part of the defence offered by one or more of those charged is that high readings of cobalt can be triggered by the use of commercially available supplements which were not thought to pose an integrity risk at the time of use. “The scientific argument is beyond my capabilities but it will take a while to run.</p> \n<p>“Because it’s something new that we’ve never heard of before, the science has to be substantiated. How that defence stands up, we’re only speculating, looking in from the outside. Everyone is interested in seeing how it plays out.”</p> \n<p>Asked if he had any sense that others in Australian racing might be gaining an illicit edge, Smerdon said: “Not particularly. Every time a stable has a good run of success, there’s mutterings but then the horses from that stable reach the limits of their potential and someone else is winning.</p> \n<p>“I think [the sport] is very well governed and this is evidence of that. They are rigid, strict and regular in their testing and if they were head in the sand and negligent, those things would still be going on and there would be no accountability.”</p> \n<p>David Hayes, whose Criterion runs on Wednesday in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes, says of cobalt: “It’s definitely been about. I have great confidence in the regulators, they’re working very hard. What’s taken so long is that they’ve followed absolute procedural fairness. These guys are all innocent until proven otherwise and they’ll be given every chance to prove that they didn’t use it.”</p> \n<p>Jane Chapple-Hyam, from Melbourne but now long established as a Newmarket trainer, has been watching the story from afar but does not expect something similar to happen here. “English trainers would never even think of using cobalt,” she says. “I just don’t think it would ever enter their thinking. Why it crept into Australian racing, I’m led to believe it came in through trotting.</p> \n<p>“Australian racing has had phases with things like milkshakes and elephant juice, which, I don’t really know what that is but those things never seem to creep into English racing. Here, what you see is what you get in the final furlong.”</p> \n<p>The British Horseracing Authority hopes that is true but is nevertheless organising its defences. Robin Mounsey, the BHA’s spokesman, says that its testing regime and intelligence reports do not yet suggest that cobalt is being abused here but no one is assuming that will remain the case forever. Work is going on, in consort with other European regulators, aimed at establishing a threshold for cobalt by the end of the year.</p> \n<p>“It’s a serious potential threat to integrity,” Mounsey says, “which is why we’re taking it seriously and treating it as such.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434310421938/Spectators-watching-a-rac-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Spectators watching a race during the AAMI Victoria Derby Day at Flemington racecourse in October 2009.
