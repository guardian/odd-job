It is understood he chose to undergo surgery on the finger as part of his recovery from the injury. Sources told ESPN his return could come “sooner than people think” and he will play in the upcoming season.<br /></p> \n<p>Whether Pierre-Paul will be able to return to his best – he has been named to the Pro Bowl twice – remains to be seen. Pierre-Paul’s position at defensive end requires him to use his hands to get away from opposing offensive linemen. The Giants withdrew their $60m offer to the player earlier in the week, although Pierre-Paul was unlikely to sign the deal anyway and is technically not under contract with the team at the moment.<br /></p> \n<p>In a bizarre coincidence, Tampa Bay Buccaneers cornerback CJ Wilson is reported to have lost two fingers in a separate fireworks accident over the holiday weekend. Wilson’s hometown newspaper, <a href=\"http://www.lincolntimesnews.com/2015/07/08/c-j-wilson-injures-hand-in-fireworks-accident/\">the Lincoln Times-News said the incident occurred at a family party</a>. </p> \n<p>“We are aware that CJ was involved in an accident that occurred over the July 4th holiday,” the Buccaneers said in a statement. “It is our understanding that the injury occurred to one of his hands, and our primary concern at this moment is for his long-term health. We have been in contact with CJ and are continuing to monitor the situation.”</p> \n<p>The injuries to both players are not necessarily career-threatening. Hall of Fame safety Ronnie Lott had part of a finger amputated in 1986 and played eight further seasons in the NFL.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436402130844/296d6faa-9b52-4b3e-ab77-e511d6be1658-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":342,"width":570,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Al Bello/Getty Images","altText":"Jason Pierre-Paul","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Al Bello/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T00:36:35Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T00:39:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":17,"contributors":[{"name":"Guardian sport","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/guardian-sport"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["New York Giants","NFL","US sports","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/new-york-giants","webTitle":"New York Giants"},{"id":"sport/nfl","webTitle":"NFL"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Guardian sport","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/guardian-sport"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/new-york-giants-jason-pierre-paul-has-finger-amputated-after-firework-accident","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agxd","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/08/new-york-giants-jason-pierre-paul-has-finger-amputated-after-firework-accident","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/08/new-york-giants-jason-pierre-paul-has-finger-amputated-after-firework-accident"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436402130844/296d6faa-9b52-4b3e-ab77-e511d6be1658-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":342,"width":570,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jason Pierre-Paul helped the Giants to a Super Bowl victory in 2012.

games</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tottenham, who will relocate for a season while the work is completed, have completed a 10-year deal with the NFL to host a minimum of two games a year.</p> \n<p>“We have an opportunity now to deliver one of the most unique sports, leisure and entertainment venues in the world, bringing together the EPL [Premier League] and NFL for the first time,” said the Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy.</p> \n<p>“The socio-economic benefits this will bring to the area will be immense and demonstrates our commitment to the regeneration of this priority borough in London.”</p> \n<p>Wembley has already hosted 11 NFL fixtures, with three more scheduled for later in 2015, with the sport proving popular in Britain with 10 crowds of over 80,000 already recorded.</p> \n<p>Tottenham, who could yet spend the year away from their ground at Wembley, will be hoping to tap into that popularity when they begin hosting matches from 2018 onwards.</p> \n<p>Both Spurs and a potential London-based NFL franchise were unsuccessful in bids to take tenancy of the Olympic Stadium – soon to become the new home of West Ham – but the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, believes more fixtures in the capital could lead to a franchise following soon.</p> \n<p>“Anyone who has seen American football at Wembley Stadium cannot fail to have been thrilled by the spectacle,” he said.</p> \n<p>“The wise heads that run the NFL have clearly not missed the fact that Londoners are going absolutely gangbusters for gridiron.</p> \n<p>“We are already working very closely with the NFL, including on plans to get more Londoners involved in the sport, and we believe that building on the success of NFL at Wembley by staging more games in an area of the city that has been earmarked for a massive programme of economic regeneration and investment makes perfect sense.</p> \n<p>“Touchdowns in Tottenham can only add to our reputation as a global sporting powerhouse, and help us take another step towards our goal of having a permanent NFL franchise here in London.”</p> \n<p>The deal is not exclusive and NFL games can take place at other venues in the UK – with Wembley issuing a statement shortly after the Tottenham link-up was announced, detailing their hopes of a continuing relationship with the sport.</p> \n<p>“Wembley has enjoyed a unique and successful relationship with the NFL since the International Series commenced in 2007,” it read. “American Football has been embraced by fans in the UK and Europe and has grown year-on-year.</p> \n<p>“Amongst the numerous successes has been the growth of the Jacksonville Jaguars whose community engagement and annual appearances have given a sense of the NFL’s long-term commitment to the sport in the UK.</p> \n<p>“Wembley Stadium has a proven record of hosting some of the world’s biggest events, from record-breaking concerts, Uefa Champions League finals, to the upcoming Rugby World Cup fixtures and the Uefa 2020 European Championship semi-finals and final and we look forward to the NFL remaining part of this iconic venue’s annual schedule.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/8f34e5278bdf31303ab43979f6c9deba5391f1e1/6_0_963_578/963.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":578,"width":963,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tottenham

for a fee of &pound;11.4m. The Belgium defender becomes the north London club’s third signing of the summer and he joins in spite of a dispute between Atl&eacute;tico and Southampton, the club at which he played last season on loan.</p> \n<p>Southampton wanted to make Alderweireld’s transfer permanent and they took up the contractual option to do so at the cost of €8m. Atl&eacute;tico were able to over-ride the clause by paying €2m to Southampton – but they missed the deadline for the payment, according to the south coast club. Southampton are aggrieved and they feel that they ought to be compensated. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/southampton-toby-alderweireld-atletico-madrid\" title=\"\">They continue to consider their options</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/07/toby-alderweireld-friends-spurs-atletico-madrid-southampton\">Tottenham agree Toby Alderweireld deal with Atl&eacute;tico Madrid and player</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tottenham, though, have said that the dispute is nothing to do with them and they have pressed ahead with the signing. They maintain that they have acted in good faith, having been promised by Atl&eacute;tico that Alderweireld was available for transfer on the open market.</p> \n<p>Tottenham believe that they have signed the ideal central defensive partner to Jan Vertonghen, who is Alderweireld’s team-mate at international level. The pair currently occupy the full-back positions in their national team – Alderweireld on the right; Vertonghen on the left – but Mauricio Pochettino, the Tottenham manager, intends to play them together in the middle.</p> \n<p>Pochettino, the former Argentina centre-half, was alarmed at the defensive frailties of his team last season – only four clubs conceded more goals in the Premier League – and he taken steps to restrengthen.</p> \n<p>His other options in central defence are Federico Fazio, Eric Dier, Kevin Wimmer – the new signing from Cologne – Youn&egrave;s Kaboul and Vlad Chiriches, although the last two have been made available for transfer. It will be interesting to see whether Pochettino uses Milos Veljkovic, the 19-year-old Serbian centre-half, who was part of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/20/serbia-world-under-20-champions-after-beating-brazil-final\" title=\"\">his country’s Under-20 World Cup triumph last month</a>.

The club are expected to loan out the right-back, DeAndre Yedlin, who they signed from Seattle Sounders in January.</p> \n<p>Alderweireld says that he had heard plenty about Tottenham from Vertonghen and the other Belgians at White Hart Lane – Mousa Demb&eacute;l&eacute; and Nacer Chadli – plus Christian Eriksen, the Denmark international with whom he previously played at Ajax. He also played alongside Vertonghen at the Dutch club.</p> \n<p>“I know the players from the national team and I played with Jan at Ajax, we had a central defensive partnership,” Alderweireld said. “It’s nice when you join another club that you know a couple of players.

The company’s fine reputation is not quite so gleaming, this being the fourth error which can be laid at its door in the past eight months, the only consolation being it was not so widely noticed as the previous three.</p> \n<p>Insiders at the British Horseracing Authority, responsible for hiring Weatherbys to carry out racing’s admin, view the company as having “a bad run” and are keen for it to find a way of improving its luck. The hope is that a large-scale project to reduce manual data entry will cut down the chance of more mistakes in future.</p> \n<p>Human error was apparently to blame for the Newbury clanger, when the first colours of Hamdan al-Maktoum were declared to be carried by Aleef and the second by Kitaaby in a maiden race. Someone at Weatherbys mixed them up and the colours appeared the wrong way round in pre-race media. Punters and spectators were spared a lot of confusion only when, by chance, Aleef became a non-runner.</p> \n<p>Last month’s Derby was also affected by human oversight at Weatherbys, when a tongue tie was correctly declared for the French runner Epicuris but was not included in pre-race data released to the media. As with the Newbury race, that necessitated a hurried formal announcement to explain the true state of affairs.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/nov/08/the-young-master-wincanton-british-horseracing-authority\" title=\"\">Weatherbys’ bad run began back in the autumn, when its system failed to spot that The Young Master was not qualified to run in a valuable, televised handicap chase at Wincanton</a>. He duly won and the result had to be altered by the BHA when someone noticed the relevant rule. Soon after that Weatherbys published an incorrect distance for a Saturday race at Towcester and, although a correction was issued, it did not reach all sections of the media.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/nov/10/bha-computer-flaw-the-young-master-badger-chase-wincanton\">BHA blame computer failure for The Young Master farce at Wincanton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“There has been the occasional error in the last few months and it is unfortunate that on occasion those errors have been quite high-profile,” said the BHA’s Robin Mounsey. “ There is a manual element to many of the processes Weatherbys use, which mean that it is inevitable that on occasion human error can occur.</p> \n<p>“Such mistakes are taken very seriously, as we are well aware of the potential implications of any such mistakes for horsemen and the betting public alike. In every such instance we seek an explanation as to how the mistake has occurred and how a repeat can be prevented.”</p> \n<p>Mounsey pointed out that Weatherbys has correctly processed “hundreds of thousands” of data items during the past eight months. He said the BHA’s service-level agreement with the firm requires a very high percentage of accuracy, which has not been breached by the recent lapses.</p> \n<p>Weatherbys’ communications director, Nick Craven, said: “When these things happen, we feel it as much as anyone. We want to get it right every time. We do know how important it is and we appreciate the potential significance of a mistake.</p> \n<p>“But, without wanting to sound defensive, we are dealing with hundreds of thousands of transactions. We have been working for some time on a very large project to overhaul our systems, which will cut out as many of the manual processes as possible and that work is continuing.”</p> \n<p>Craven said the system for distinguishing between an owners’ first and second set of colours had been in place for a very long time and he could not recall a single precedent for last week’s mistake.</p> \n<p>Connor Beasley was said to be “groggy” after surgery to his fractured skull was required, following the jockey’s fall at Wolverhampton on Tuesday, but the procedure was said to have gone well and hopes are high for his recovery.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436373298843/Newbury-Hamdan-al-Maktoum-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Leading owner Hamdan al-Maktoum's colours are a regular feature on Britain's major racecourses.

I have had so many injuries and issues that now I have learnt to just move forward from them and not even be worried about them.”</p> \n<p>Day’s doctor has advised the Queenslander he could still have an attack but the medication should bring those chances well down.</p> \n<p>The diagnosis is a welcome one for the 27-year-old as he tries to change his less than stellar performances at the Open. While he has eight top-10 finishes in majors in 19 starts including three seconds, a third and a fourth, but none of them have come in the Open where his best finish is a tie for 30th in 2011.</p> \n<p>And while he faded from the lead at Chambers Bay last month to finish ninth he is taking confidence from the performance. “I played well at Chambers which was closer to a links-style course so that gives me huge confidence that I can play on them,” he said.</p> \n<p>“I have a good feeling that I am ready to play well over there. I have prepped well away from competition since the US Open, mentally and now physically it is coming together.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e02016677febb0b4190a47fc053b44ba6b0a120e/0_142_4432_2657/4432.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2657,"width":4432,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"BPI/REX Shutterstock/BPI/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Jason Day struggles with vertigo at the US Open on 19 June 2015.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: BPI/REX Shutterstock/BPI/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-08T07:47:18Z","lastModified":"2015-07-08T07:47:19Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":5,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Golf","US Open","Australia sport","Sport","PGA Tour","US Open Golf 2015","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/golf","webTitle":"Golf"},{"id":"sport/usopengolf","webTitle":"US Open"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/pga-tour","webTitle":"PGA Tour"},{"id":"sport/us-open-golf-2015","webTitle":"US Open Golf 2015"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/golf-jason-day-us-open-vertigo-down-to-ear-infection","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4af2z","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/08/golf-jason-day-us-open-vertigo-down-to-ear-infection","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/08/golf-jason-day-us-open-vertigo-down-to-ear-infection"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e02016677febb0b4190a47fc053b44ba6b0a120e/0_142_4432_2657/4432.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2657,"width":4432,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jason Day struggles with vertigo at the US Open on 19 June 2015.
