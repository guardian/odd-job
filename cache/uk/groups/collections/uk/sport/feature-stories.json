But the release on Friday of a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/mo-farah-statement-denies-taking-performance-enhancing-drugs\">carefully calibrated statement</a>, drafted by his recently appointed crisis-management PR team Freud’s, has eased the pressure – for now. After another week of revelations and rumours, it is time to take stock of the key players in this saga:</p> \n<h2>Mo Farah</h2> \n<p>Crucially, Farah has now addressed the main issues head on, explaining that he had not missed any other tests in his career and had never taken performance-enhancing drugs. He also offered a glimpse of his human side, insisting: “The last two weeks have been the toughest of my life – with rumours and speculation about me that are completely false – and the impact this has had on my family and friends has left me angry, frustrated and upset.”</p> \n<p>It is understood by the <em>Observer </em>that Farah, who has never been accused of taking a banned substance, intends to stay out of the public eye until he races in Monaco on 17 July, although he will release a statement after his coach, Alberto Salazar, has responded to the doping allegations made by <em>Panorama</em>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/mo-farah-witch-hunt-steve-cram\">Mo Farah looks like the victim of a witch-hunt, says Steve Cram</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Alberto Salazar</h2> \n<p>Despite rumours that Farah was in the process of separating from the coach who turned him into the best 5,000m and 10,000m runner in the world, Salazar remains very much in charge. For while Farah is now training at altitude in Font Romeu in France, the American coach is still setting his daily programme and calling the shots. “Mo is on a different training cycle, as he always is at this time of year,” Salazar told the <em>Oregonian </em>newspaper. “So I send him to Europe to get accustomed to the time zone. This is how we’ve always done it.”</p> \n<p>On Friday Farah revealed that Salazar has also “reassured me that the claims [against him] are false and that he will soon be providing evidence to make that clear”. But it is nearly two weeks since Salazar asked for a “short time” to deliver his riposte to the allegations made by <em>Panorama</em> and the ProPublica website and we are still waiting. The rumours are he will do it before the US trials which start on Thursday.</p> \n<h2>UK Athletics</h2> \n<p>UK Athletics believes that missed doping tests are a matter for the UK Anti-Doping Agency and so remained silent over Farah’s two missed drugs tests. Indeed, there has been little publicly from the governing body since Ed Warner, chair of UKA, appeared on Radio 5 Live’s <em>Sportsweek</em> last Sunday to talk about the independent review it has set up to investigate its relationship with Salazar. Privately, however, it is understood some in the organisation are happy that Farah is now training in Font Romeu under the guidance of UK Athletics’ head of endurance, Barry Fudge, rather than in Portland, where he was being chased by paparazzi when he tried to train.</p> \n<p>Publicly they remain firmly behind Salazar, who serves as an unpaid consultant, with Warner urging people to “wait for a few weeks to see all the facts and see how things settle, and that is what we are doing”, adding: “Alberto is innocent until proven guilty. The right thing is to be swift but not hasty.”</p> \n<h2>UK Anti-Doping Agency</h2> \n<p>Usually when Ukad speaks to the media it is dry and procedural. But that was not the case in the wake of the revelations about Farah’s missed tests in midweek, with the chief executive, Nicole Sapstead, admitting it was “not common for athletes to have two missed tests” and the director of legal, Graham Arthur, explaining: “We have got a pretty detailed protocol for doping control officers to follow when they conduct an in-hours test – and they include ringing the doorbell every 10-15 minutes or so, knocking and staying there for the full hour.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/mo-farah-testing-period-ricky-simms-alberto-salazar\">Mo Farah faces testing period that could snuff out golden glow of 2012</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It has been suggested that Ukad should be more open about how often it tests athletes – the US Anti-Doping Agency has a searchable database of athletes which shows their tests each quarter – but Ukad says this would be difficult to achieve in the UK because of data privacy issues and it “would add significantly to our workload”.</p> \n<h2>Galen Rupp</h2> \n<p>Mo Farah’s training partner has not spoken publicly about the allegations against him, including that he took testosterone from the age of 16, since emailing a short comment on the morning after the Panorama programme to a handful of journalists – including the <em>Observer</em>. In it he claimed: “I expressly told these reporters that these allegations were not true and their sources admit they have no evidence, yet they print ‘suspicions’ attacking me and sullying my reputation. That is inexcusable, irresponsible journalism.”</p> \n<p>Since then Rupp has stayed out of the limelight but in the past week confirmed he would be running the 5,000m and 10,000m at the US world championships trials, which start on Thursday. Inevitably there will be a huge amount of focus on him – and pressure, too. Rupp is likely to speak to the media but how will he cope with the most pointed questions?</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434810575616/Mo-Farah-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mo Farah, who has never been accused of taking a banned substance, is now training in Font Romeu in France.

Farah issued a statement on Friday defending his reputation in the wake of a BBC investigation that alleged his coach, Alberto Salazar, had practised doping techniques with the American athlete Galen Rupp. It emerged this past week that Farah had missed two drugs tests in the buildup to the 2012 Olympics.</p> \n<p>Cram, the 1983 world 1500m champion, told the BBC: “It has begun to look like a bit of a witch-hunt against Mo. It seems as if some people are deliberately going after him and that is a shame.”</p> \n<p>Farah won gold in the 5,000m and 10,000m in London three years ago, with Cram commentating on his successes for the BBC. The <em>Panorama</em> documentary about Salazar did not accuse Farah of any wrongdoing but Thursday’s revelations regarding his missed tests led to further questions being asked and Cram sympathised with the 32-year-old. “We have gone off on a couple of different tangents from the original set of allegations,” Cram said. “The allegations were against his coach. Now Mo has also had to come out give an explanation about the two missed tests. We need clarification on that.</p> \n<p>“Some sections of the media seem keen to make out that a missed test means avoiding a test, which it does not. There is an individual here being targeted around his credibility as an athlete. In some quarters people are now saying he is a cheat. I can understand why Mo is annoyed and frustrated and all the other words he used in his statement.”</p> \n<p>Farah used Facebook to address his missed tests in 2010 and 2011, writing: “I have never taken performance-enhancing drugs in my life and I never will.</p> \n<p>“Over the course of my career I have taken hundreds of drugs tests and every single one has been negative. I’ve fully explained the only two tests in my career that I have ever missed, which the authorities understood, and there was never any suggestion that these were anything more than simple mistakes.</p> \n<p>“The last two weeks have been the toughest of my life – with rumours and speculation about me that are completely false – and the impact this has had on my family and friends has left me angry, frustrated and upset.”</p> \n<p>Salazar has denied the allegations against him, and Farah revealed he had travelled to his base in Portland, Oregon to speak to the American about the allegations. “As I made clear, I went to Portland to speak to Alberto Salazar and demand answers,” Farah added. “He reassured me that the claims are false and that he will soon be providing evidence to make that clear. Until then I will not be commenting further on the allegations.”</p> \n<p>Farah is training in France ready for a planned return at the Diamond League meeting in Monaco on 17 July. “Running is the one thing Mo can control at the moment and the one place where he can be Mo Farah and get away from this to some extent,” said Cram, a former world record holder over 1500m and the mile. “It can’t be easy but until something is proved against him we want to see him on track and racing because we don’t have many medal hopes. I bet he can’t wait to get back to racing.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434831642186/Mo-Farah-and-Galen-Rupp-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mo Farah celebrates winning the London 2012 10,000m final with the silver medallist, Galen Rupp. Steve Cram commentated on the race for the BBC.

He then needed further work done on his gearbox after coming to a standstill in FP3, incurring a further drop of five places.</p> \n<p>The rules state that four engines must last the entire season.</p> \n<p>The severity of the penalty is decided by the number of changes made, with 10 places for one component and a further five places for each subsequent replacement. But it was all a little too much for a frustrated Alonso, who has not scored a single point this season. “I would probably change many things – better not to say. The technology is too complex, especially for the people at home,” the Spaniard said.</p> \n<p>“They want to see cars crashing and overtaking each other and fighting for position, not saving tyres and saving fuel, and talking about DRS and tokens and penalties. The penalties we have are very difficult to understand.

He does not give much away. Steven Finn, a Middlesex and England colleague, reckons to be one of Morgan’s best mates but even he says: “When he walks into the dressing room, you wouldn’t know if he’s had a bad day or a good day. He’s one of he most flatlined people I’ve ever met. That’s a huge strength of his, especially as a captain.”</p> \n<p>Now Morgan, despite Saturday’s duck, is more firmly established as a captain than ever before. He would have been nervous (without showing it) after the World Cup. His own form had been no better than that of his predecessor as captain, Alastair Cook, and that World Cup campaign had been a dreadful, constipated disappointment. Yet after England’s early departure from the tournament Morgan stared at the microphone planted in front of him and said: “We have no regrets,” before adding: “We have the right calibre of squad, the right personnel.”</p> \n<p>Ah well, that was then. Now Morgan has acknowledged that England were “terrible” in the World Cup and that the current team selection, which constitutes something of an overhaul, “reflects how we want to play”. England are playing a new, free game and Morgan says that the new crop of players “find my ideas easy to relate to”. Perhaps the old dogs really could not get the new tricks, though that seems an oversimplification of the mini-metamorphosis of the England ODI team.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/england-new-zealand-fifth-odi-cricket\">Jonny Bairstow blasts England to thrilling series win over New Zealand</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Finn remains mildly bewildered by the change since March. “We talked about what we wanted to do in the World Cup. We sat in front of you guys [the press] and said we wanted to play with freedom and with smiles on our faces. We didn’t do it. I can’t put my finger on why.” But there has been a change. “Even when we walked off the field after going for 350 at the Ageas Bowl,” he says, “we felt as though we were in the game. It is really exciting.</p> \n<p>“The World Cup hurt everyone and it would have hurt Eoin especially, being the captain. We know he is such a proud man and such a good guy, so everyone wants to be behind him and respect him as captain. He is in the form of his life. I’ve never seen him hit a cricket ball like he has in the last few weeks. It’s great to be playing under him – it’s brilliant”.</p> \n<p>Finn has highlighted a critical change. In recent times England have not had a one-day captain capable of leading by example. Cook was tormented before he was sacked just before the World Cup, so, too, was Morgan throughout the tournament.</p> \n<p>Even Mike Brearley felt diminished when short of runs, so it’s hardly surprising that the authority of Cook and Morgan should wane when they were struggling for runs.</p> \n<p>Morgan finds it hard to explain why everything is suddenly clicking so well at the crease. “The only change I can see is to do with the IPL,” he says. “I came back from there striking the ball really well. That has happened before.”</p> \n<p>Like most of the England ODI players, Morgan is a fan of the IPL, not just for the obvious financial reasons but because they believe the experience can enhance their games. Morgan is less a technical batsman than an intuitive one so when the force is with him anything is possible. It has been a while but we have all been reminded of this during the current series. Most importantly of all, however, the newcomers to the England ODI squad cannot fail to be impressed.</p> \n<p>Two other factors help to explain England’s improvement. For one, the players have had more leeway to fail. The series against New Zealand, however enjoyable it has been, is not the World Cup. The pressure to produce has not been so intense.</p> \n<p>Moreover, the timing has been right. Throughout the ODI series the outstanding contributions have not come from the real rookies. The key men have usually been Morgan, Joe Root and Jos Buttler, along with handy interventions from Finn, Ben Stokes and Alex Hales, before Jonny Bairstow’s effort on Saturday. The first four mentioned have been around a while now. Morgan may be the grandad with 145 ODI appearances, but Root (58), Buttler (59) and Finn (61) know the ropes by now.</p> \n<p>It seems that this quartet was ripe for greater responsibility and has been enhanced by their elevation. That space was created when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/02/england-drop-jimmy-anderson-stuart-broad-ian-bell-odi-squad-new-zealand-cricket\">Ian Bell, James Anderson and Stuart Broad were dropped</a>. Now the tone of the dressing room is being set by a fresh brigade of cricketers. The new breed will make mistakes – indeed, the great thing is that they are quite prepared to – but they have also introduced a zest for the game plus a sense of enjoyment, which have made watching England rather exciting again.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434745008816/Eoin-Morgan-England-New-Z-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Eoin Morgan looks skywards upon reaching his century during his side’s win in the fourth ODI against New Zealand at Trent Bridge.

That match also featured Mark Footitt, Derbyshire’s left-arm fast bowler, who was included in that training squad.

England’s decision to leave Ali out of the one-day squad was taken with the hope that he bowled plenty of overs in the championship ahead of the Ashes to try to find some form after he had a difficult Test against New Zealand at Headingley. Worcestershire got pulverised by Warwickshire within two days in the last round and that did not give Ali much opportunity to get more overs under his belt. Uxbridge is traditionally a pitch that is good for batting but that turns on days three and four – so he may well be able to have a good long bowl in the second innings.</p> \n<p>Three of the possible Ashes squad will be in action at Headingley starting on Monday, when Stuart Broad will play for Nottinghamshire, who find themselves in the relegation zone of Division One. Yorkshire will feature opener Adam Lyth and Gary Ballance. The latter will be feeling under some pressure after scoring just 36 runs in four innings in the recent Test series. He also made just 30 runs in his only first-class match since.</p> \n<p>Of the other England players going to the training camp, Liam Plunkett is still injured and Ian Bell will not have a chance for any more first-class cricket, before the Ashes starts, with Warwickshire not in championship action this week.

Laura Robson began what promises to be a long journey back toward the top of the women’s game on Saturday when she played her first competitive match for 17 months following surgery on her dominant left wrist. The qualifying event of the Aegon International at Eastbourne was a relatively low-key way to return and though she was beaten 6-1, 6-0 by the world No41, Daria Gavrilova, just the fact that she was back on court and pain-free should be regarded as a big step in the right direction.</p> \n<p>The customary Eastbourne wind did not help as she tried to shake off some of the inevitable rust and her serve was particularly affected, with seven double faults. As Andy Murray, who has suffered wrist problems a couple of times during his career, said earlier in the week, it will take her time to get back to her best. But providing there are no setbacks, she will improve as she regains match fitness and crucially, confidence.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/18/andy-murray-laura-robson-comeback\">Andy Murray warns returning Laura Robson must deal with mental baggage</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“In a way I think it was a victory to just finish a match, be back on court, back playing tournaments and for that I’m very happy,” Robson said. “I’m not expecting to play my best tennis right now, it’s going to take a while, it’s going to take a lot more matches and a lot more practice and I’m very, very willing to do that. I’m not even at the level I was before I was injured yet so I’ve got a long way to go to get there and to then improve.”</p> \n<p>In an era when players are hitting the ball harder and with more spin than ever, the wrist is taking ever more strain. Robson’s return came at the end of a week when the former US Open champion Juan Mart&iacute;n Del Potro announced that he is to have a third wrist operation, an injury that has already cost him around two years of his career.</p> \n<p>Both Robson and Del Potro were operated on by Dr Richard Berger at the Mayo Clinic in the United States and the renowned surgeon told the <em>Observer</em> that he believed wrist injuries were becoming more common due to the increasing demands on the range of motion players require. Players who have had wrist injuries say it takes about as long as the time they are off the tour to get back to top form and while he would not comment on Robson directly, Dr Berger said recovery is likely to be a lengthy process.</p> \n<p>“I think that’s a pretty fair rule of thumb,” he said. “It really does take that long and sometimes longer to come back to the level they were playing before the injury. The ultimate [goal] is to be able to play an entire tournament without even thinking about it or remembering that they had the injury. But it can be an extremely long road to recovery and that can be difficult for a player. There’s a lot of frustration and impatience.”</p> \n<p>With the exception of a bit of TV work for the BBC during last summer’s Wimbledon, Robson kept a pretty low profile as she tried to deal with the physical and mental scars involved with recovering from surgery and being off the tour. In the gym, she worked hard to get in the best possible shape, mostly in Florida at the IMG Academy, where the legendary coach Nick Bollettieri had a bird’s-eye view of her rehabilitation.</p> \n<p>“She’s been working diligently,” Bollettieri told the <em>Observer</em>. “I believe she is in her best ever shape. She was working two to three hours in the gym every day [six days a week] and she never complained one bit. A few years ago, people were questioning her physical ability, not her tennis, but she has worked hard.”</p> \n<p>Bollettieri said the hardest thing for Robson, as for any player coming back from injury, will be overcoming the fear factor. “The doctor can say it’s all clear and you can say it doesn’t hurt but when you get on the court, your mind plays tricks,” he said. Berger agreed. “These are strong individuals … and I think there is a feeling of: ‘What if it happens again? What if I have to go through this all over again?’”</p> \n<p>Robson’s talent has never been in question. A former junior champion at Wimbledon, the left-hander has a big game and a head for the big occasion, as she has shown on a number of occasions. At the US Open in 2012, she beat Kim Clijsters and Li Na on her way to the fourth round and at Wimbledon the following summer she also made the last 16, a run that helped her to a career-high ranking of 27.</p> \n<p>Lengthy absences can make a player feel like the game has passed them by but Bollettieri believes the break could actually help. “I think this time off is going to be an asset for her because when you take something away from someone, it can make them think, Holy mackerel, I have another chance,” he said. “I think if she can come out and play loose as a goose, then she can do well.”</p> \n<p>Robson said she had not heard yet about whether she would be given a wildcard into Wimbledon but it seems certain she will be given a place. “I would obviously love to play,” she said. “It’s my home tournament and it’s my favourite tournament of the year for sure so I would love to get a chance to play but we’ll see, I haven’t heard anything.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434813478788/Laura-Robson--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Laura Robson could only win one game during her comeback match, which lasted only 58 minutes.

Sometimes, I never thought I’d get the uniform back on.”</p> \n<p>Out of baseball last season while serving a drug suspension, Rodriguez wasted no time, connecting in the first inning on a first-pitch, 95mph fastball from Tigers ace Justin Verlander.</p> \n<p>“I was happy to get it out of the way,” Rodriguez said.</p> \n<p>The solo homer made him the 29th player in major league history to reach 3,000 hits. He was the first to do it since Yankees great Derek Jeter homered from the same batter’s box in 2011.</p> \n<p>“It’s a magical number,” Rodriguez said. “I’m very happy to be in the club.”</p> \n<p>A-Rod turns 40 next month. The three-time AL MVP launched his 13th homer of the season and has enjoyed a productive year as a designated hitter after returning from his suspension. Rodriguez hit his 667th career home run after beginning the day with a .299 lifetime average in 21 seasons.</p> \n<p>The 37-year-old Hample, meanwhile, has some experience in this area. He describes himself as a pro at catching home run balls, has written books about the art and has snagged a whopping 8,161 baseballs at stadiums around the country.</p> \n<p>“Got 12 tonight. Got 11 in batting practice and one during the game by some guy,” he said, laughing.</p> \n<p>Hample is a New Yorker and a Yankees season-ticket holder. He was in his favorite spot – section 103, row 12, seat 24 – in right field when Rodriguez connected for a solo shot off Justin Verlander in the first inning. Hample raised his Rawlings glove, but the crowd surge pushed him forward. Good fortune was on his side, however.</p> \n<p>“I looked down and the ball was at my feet. It ricocheted, and it was almost touching my shoe,” he said.</p> \n<p>Hample snapped up the ball and posted a picture of it on Twitter. Quickly, the Yankees visited him and tried to see what it would take to make a deal. It was not an easy negotiation, either.</p> \n<p>A day earlier, Hample tweeted about Rodriguez: “That man deserves favours from no one, least of all a fan.”</p> \n<p>After talking to the Yankees, Hample posted that he “told the Yankees I’m keeping it”.</p> \n<p>Rodriguez later mentioned the fan who snared Derek Jeter’s home run ball for his 3,000th hit in 2011. That man was all too eager to return it to the former Yankees star.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/st-louis-cardinals-chairman-hacking-scandal-roguish-behaviour\">St Louis Cardinals chairman blames hacking scandal on 'roguish behaviour'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Where’s Jeet’s guy? That’s the guy I needed,” Rodriguez said. “I wasn’t so lucky.”</p> \n<p>In the late innings, it appeared to be a lost cause. Yankees spokesman Jason Zillo said efforts to have the man deal directly with team president Randy Levine didn’t work.</p> \n<p>“As far as we’re concerned, we have done everything we could to engage this guy in some type of discussion about some type of exchange. He had none of anything we were saying. He wouldn’t engage at all,” Zillo said. “He is not intending to give it to us.</p> \n<p>“This guy is pretty well-documented. A professional home run catcher,” Zillo said.</p> \n<p>Hample has returned balls in the past. He said he gave back the first home runs hit by Mike Trout and Didi Gregorius, free of charge.</p> \n<p>“This is something more special,” Hample said.</p> \n<p>But Hample ended up watching the ninth inning with Levine and chief operating officer Lonn Trost, and said he was considering what to do.</p> \n<p>“They were so nice, and that made me think about what I want to do,” Hample said. “There’s no right or wrong in this.

Since the London Olympics helped bring women’s cycling into the mainstream, there has been a quiet revolution on our roads. In January, the <a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/about/article/20150129-about-bc-news-100-000-increase-in-regular-cyclists-since-October-2012---cycling-participation-targets-on-track-says-British-Cycling-0\">Sport England Active People survey</a> revealed that 100,000 more people have got out on their bikes in the last three years. As <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/15/britain-olympic-legacy-london-2012\">participation in sport as a whole continues to fall</a>, the Olympic legacy is still alive and kicking on two wheels.</p> \n<p>Hit the Surrey Hills – the centrepiece of the Olympic road race – any weekend of the year and you’ll find the roads thronged with an informal, kaleidoscopic peloton of amateur riders all eager to benchmark their performances against Marianne Vos. And that’s where women riders have a distinct advantage – by logging into <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/about\">Strava</a>, they can measure their performance precisely against that of the queen of cycling. Because <a href=\"http://totalwomenscycling.com/road-cycling/sportives/vos-the-queen-of-strava-24855/#jjqbFq8GmL2qllJy.97\">Marianne Vos is also a Strava user</a> who uploads her segments for other riders to have a tilt at. With staunch anti-doping activists such as <a href=\"http://velonews.competitor.com/2013/07/news/lemond-calls-for-froome-others-to-release-power-data_295268\">Greg Lemond calling for data release</a> as a way of ensuring transparency in professional cycling, it’s one area where the women’s sport is way ahead of the men’s.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2013/jul/31/strava-app-cyclists-racers-smartphone\">Strava – the app that turns cyclists into racers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.strava.com/\">Strava</a> is the simple idea that is revolutionising cycling. Riders record their performance on a GPS device or through the mobile app and then upload their times and routes to compare them with friends or professional cyclists. Strava can be anything from a simple performance tracker to a motivational tool to, in the words of women’s cycling advocate, Trek’s <a href=\"http://dirtmountainbike.com/features/interviews/chris-garrison-interview-endtroducing.html#M8me2V0ZrxX7UvBq.97\">Chris Garrison</a>, “active social media”. The figures bear her out. With an 82% uptick in UK women members in the last year alone – responsible for a staggering 20% of the global female mileage – 30% of the rides being logged are group rides.</p> \n<p>Beth, who uses Strava for both running and cycling, says it’s motivating to be able to track her progress “and to connect to other rides – both friends and others in my cycling club”. Keira, a relative newcomer to cycling, says she loves the “inspiring” sense of community: “I find it a really positive and encouraging environment in which everyone shares a passion even if performance varies vastly between many of us.”</p> \n<p>Women are using Strava for a wide range of reasons - from casual users such as Catrin, who motivates herself to break her personal bests on routes and distance when commuting to work, to triathletes such as Ange, whose coach uses it to build training programmes. She says she finds it hard just to go for “an easy run” after using Strava: “I constantly feel I have to be keeping my average speed up! I need to find the willpower not to use it on those days.” </p> \n<p>Then there are women such as Fiona, who describes herself as a social rider and occasional time-trialist, who love the competitive aspect of Strava. Though she says she’s not a “segment hunter”, she does hold a few <a href=\"http://blog.strava.com/womens-tour-preview-2015-10048/\">Queen of the Mountains</a>. “I think it’s great that pros post segments,” she says. “It makes you feel good if you get anywhere get near them.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhOQxkbvanU\">Garrison</a> uses Strava for personal reasons – tracking her mileage, as part of the 44m kilometres ridden by women in the UK last year, and participating for Trek’s company team in the National Bike Challenge – but she is evangelical in encouraging women who attend her popular “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/482934771856460/\">Ladies Nights</a>” to join the community. “It’s a way to connect and communicate with other people who ride, some of whom you may know, others maybe not.” She gives the example of planning a 30-mile ride with women from all over the world and then having the ability to discuss and compare your personal experiences, even if you’ve been riding alone. As she points out: “It’s only competitive if you allow it or want it to be.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/bike-blog/2014/jan/14/confessions-of-a-strava-cycling-addict-app\">Confessions of a Strava cycling addict | Trevor Ward</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Women’s cycling is having another moment in the sun this week with the second edition of the <a href=\"http://www.womenstour.co.uk/\">Aviva’s Women’s Tour</a>.

They say it is “up there with Twitter” as a tool for fan engagement: “It’s a lot of fun, and great way for race fans to engage with the Pro riders.”</p> \n<p>Like Strava, Aviva’s involvement with the promotion of women’s cycling has been another success story. With their head office nestled almost at the foot of Britain’s Alpe d’Huez, Box Hill, they will have seen with their own eyes the burgeoning popularity of cycling in the UK. That they have moved from sponsoring women’s cycling to the men’s sport is a rare example of sponsorship cross-pollination between the two disciplines driven by the success of female athletes. Who says that women’s cycling doesn’t bring new sponsors into bike racing? In a sport that’s working hard to professionalise and provide an attractive return for sponsors, the Women’s Tour has proved a stunning showcase for all that’s good in the sport.</p> \n<p>Simon Klima, Strava’s UK manager, says they’re also proud to be sponsoring the Women’s Tour for a second year. It’s a win-win situation with a ready-built audience of millions waiting to share the “grit, determination and passion” of the elite Women’s Tour riders. </p> \n<p>Klima is proud of the community Strava has built, particularly for women. It seems that there may also be a direct correlation between the visibility of professional cycling on our roads and Strava uploads, with the most popular counties for female Strava members including Greater London, Manchester, West Yorkshire, Hampshire and Surrey. Women who see great cycling first hand at Yorkshire’s Grand Depart or the Women’s Tour are inspired to hit the roads and try the sport themselves. He also points out that roughly 50% of cycling uploads in London are commutes, so it seems that “transport as well as recreation is a definite factor in the explosion in cyclists on our roads.”</p> \n<p>The Strava platform is evolving still further. The introduction of Strava Photos is encouraging runners and cyclists to explore the link between social connection and fitness tracking. Klima also says they’re working hard on the “in-activity experience, giving data in real-time when an athlete is out there riding or running.” </p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.strava.com/local\">Strava Local</a> – data-driven, athlete-curated city guides for athletes in 12 major cities – has just landed, so the day when amateur cyclists can compare their efforts in real time to those of Dani King on Caerphilly Mountain will be here soon.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/100-tours-100-tales/2015/jun/16/cycling-needs-to-lose-its-podium-girls\">Cycling needs to lose its 'podium girls' | Suze Clemitson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>No “norms” have been picked up as a result of their Strava performance – yet . But as the community expands and continues to quietly revolutionise the way women experience cycling, it surely can’t be a long time coming? For now, Klima says, they’re happy that “many of the top riders are uploading their race activity each day and receiving kudos [the Strava equivalent of a Facebook “like”] for their efforts.”</p> \n<p>Maybe one day an unknown rider will match the kudos of Marianne Vos (63,292), Dani King (13,632) or the Australian Wiggle-Honda rider, Peta Mullens (11,787), who all uploaded their rides from each stage of last year’s Women’s Tour. Any Strava users who can match those achievements might just find themselves with a professional tour contract, if savvy teams start using the app as a talent-spotting tool. The “if it’s not on Strava it didn’t happen” factor might just be the key to unlocking the next generation of great Queens of the Mountains.</p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://100tours100tales.wordpress.com/\">This article appeared first on 100 Tours 100 Tales</a><br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/festinagirl\">Follow Suze Clemitson on Twitter</a><br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">Follow Guardian Sport on Facebook</a></strong></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434725348389/4fc6013d-34dd-40cd-bb18-a518841c842a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Bryn Lennon/Getty Images","altText":"Women's Tour","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-20T09:30:01Z","lastModified":"2015-06-20T09:30:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Suze Clemitson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/suze-clemitson"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Cycling","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Suze Clemitson","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/suze-clemitson"}}],"series":{"title":"Guardian Sport Network","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/series/guardian-sport-network"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/100-tours-100-tales/2015/jun/20/womens-tour-strava-cycling-2015","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avny","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/100-tours-100-tales/2015/jun/20/womens-tour-strava-cycling-2015","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/100-tours-100-tales/2015/jun/20/womens-tour-strava-cycling-2015"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434725348389/4fc6013d-34dd-40cd-bb18-a518841c842a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Want to compare your times with Women’s Tour cyclists?
