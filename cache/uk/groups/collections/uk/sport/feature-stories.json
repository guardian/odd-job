Only the detonator cap exploded. The rest of it, mostly a mixture of chapatti flour and cheap hydrogen peroxide, failed to ignite. At that very moment, and just a couple of miles away, England <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/jul/21/ashes2005.ashes9\" title=\"\">took their fifth wicket of the first morning</a>. Michael Clarke lbw to Simon Jones for 11. While the players ate lunch, a second bomb went off at Oval and a third at Warren Street. Twenty minutes into <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/jul/21/ashes2005.ashes11\" title=\"\">the afternoon session</a>, so did a fourth on board the No26 bus on Hackney Road. Like the first, all three malfunctioned. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/jul/21/ashes2005.ashes13\" title=\"\">By stumps</a> England were 92 for seven, 88 runs behind, and London’s public transport network was pretty much up and running again. Leaving the ground, spectators experienced what Wisden described as “minor transport disruption” travelling home.</p> \n<p>The failed attacks and their aftermath filled the front pages as the Ashes did the back. During the first Test English police were in the middle of the largest manhunt in their history. On the second day Jean Charles de Menezes was shot dead at Stockwell tube station. All this in the wake of the 7/7 attacks, which themselves had come the day after the city had been chosen as the host city for the 2012 Olympic Games. Australia’s fast bowler Jason Gillespie spoke about his unease. “If another bomb did go off here in England there’d be serious questions asked about the tour.” If there was another attack, he said, he would fly back to Australia. Behind the scenes the ECB’s support staff met the police to make plans for tighter security around the grounds.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/06/ashes-2015-a-to-z\">Ashes 2015: the A to Z of Ashes history</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The attacks would have a direct effect on the shape of the Ashes summer, as we shall see. But they had a diffuse influence on it too. The euphoria so many people felt in August and September can be seen, in a small way, as a reaction to the horrors of July. On the weekend of the fifth Test at The Oval, more than 20,000 people gathered in Regent’s Park to watch the match on a big screen. A pair of tickets for the second day’s play were sold on eBay for &pound;1,115, and a penthouse flat with a view of the ground was let for the week for a fee of &pound;20,000. Much as we reminisce about the series, it is easy to forget just how extraordinary the summer was; how, when it was all over, the England team became the first identifiable living people outside the Royal Family to be depicted on a set of stamps. Or that the manufacturer Danilo reportedly had 100,000 advance orders for its official Andrew Flintoff calendar.</p> \n<p>There were a lot of reasons for all this lunacy: the brilliance of the contest, the charms of the players, the fact it was all on free-to-air TV and the 16-year wait for a win. But on top of all that, perhaps Britain needed a source of pride, something to celebrate, an excuse to have a party. On the eve of the Oval Test, Brendan Barber, general secretary of the Trade Union Congress, urged employers to “make arrangements” to allow employees to watch the cricket. People, Barber explained, had to be allowed “to follow their heroes”.</p> \n<p>The crowd at Lord’s on the first day of the series was the largest to have gathered at the ground in 60 years, since, in fact, England played the Dominions in August 1945, the very first first-class match at the ground after the war. England lost then too.</p> \n<h2>Second Test, Edgbaston, 4-7 August, England won by two runs</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bfea61ac351c50d1ce868b3bb64013eb33b7b08\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436137276635/58cfdc9c-cb5f-4a50-a1b0-e909de05a099-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The picture of the series: Andrew Flintoff and Brett Lee shake hands after the second Test.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The picture of the series: Andrew Flintoff and Brett Lee shake hands after the second Test.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I remember on my way to the ground that morning, thinking ‘This shouldn’t take long’,” says Tom Jenkins, the Guardian’s chief sports photographer “just half an hour or something.” England <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/aug/07/ashes2005.ashes6\" title=\"\">needed two wickets</a>, Australia needed 107 runs to win. Once he was there the first task was to pick a spot. He had one in mind, on the low bench behind the boundary hoardings in front of the pavilion. The idea being that from there he could get a shot of the players coming back into the dressing room after they had completed their victory. Tom Shaw, a snapper working for Getty, had the same idea, and the two of them sat side by side.</p> \n<p>The shot they both got, the one that came to symbolise the 2005 Ashes, was not exactly an accident but it was not taken by design either. “The one thought I’d had in my head all morning was ‘I hope Fred takes the last wicket’,” Jenkins says. “Because it would have suited the occasion so well. He had such an amazing match.” So he had. Flintoff scored 68 runs in England’s first innings, 73 in their second. In between he had taken 3 for 52. And then, the previous evening, he had dismissed Justin Langer and Ricky Ponting in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2UnMxR3IM\" title=\"\">the space of a single extraordinary over</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2UnMxR3IM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH2UnMxR3IM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  An extraordinary over by England’s Andrew Flintoff\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jenkins, along with everyone else, made the inevitable comparison. “I was thinking about Botham in ’81 and how, after he had bowled Terry Alderman to win the Test, he had run down the pitch and stooped <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">to pick up a stump as a souvenir</a>. In my head I had a vision of a similar thing happening with Flintoff. He was bowling towards me and I had this vision of him sending Kasprowicz’s stumps flying.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjSDvdgTOzg\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjSDvdgTOzg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Ian Botham is not stumped in a choice of souvenir after his magical Ashes performance in 1981\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The crowd had been raucous throughout the match, especially in the Hollies Stand. On the Friday a group of drunken fans threw an inflatable shark at Sir John Major. Major gamely tossed it right back at them. And on the Saturday two more were evicted after a stewardess complained that she found their outfits offensive. They had come dressed as bunny girls. But as Sunday wore on, the ground fell quiet. “People were terrified of what was going to happen. And I knew that, if I had been watching at home, I would have been an absolute wreck too. But because I was working, I had to keep focused.”</p> \n<p>When <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/aug/07/ashes2005.ashes7\" title=\"\">the last wicket fell</a>, the first thing Jenkins thought was: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr-4F_SFWxA\" title=\"\">“Oh, that wasn’t great.”</a> From a photographer’s point of view, “it was a mess, with Kasprowicz fending off a bouncer down the leg side.” And then everyone went absolutely bonkers. “And I immediately started thinking, ‘Where’s Flintoff? What is Flintoff doing?’” He found him just in time. “Flintoff had broken away from the pack and was over by Brett Lee. He dropped down and held out his hand to him. It lasted only a second and I didn’t think that much of it at the time” – or later, when he was looking through his photos on his laptop, trying to decide which to send through to the Guardian. “I looked at it and thought, ‘It’s quite nice but I’m sure the desk will want something more celebratory.’” He was right. The Guardian ran a shot of Marcus Trescothick jumping on top of a pile of his team-mates.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr-4F_SFWxA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hr-4F_SFWxA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Not the best moment from a photographer’s point of view but delight for England in 2005.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was only after the Ashes was over that the photo was resurrected. “I still find it strange because it wasn’t a revolutionary picture or a revolutionary act. It was just one guy shaking another by the hand and saying ‘bad luck’. And so it’s surprising to me that that picture seems to have come to symbolise so much.” People often tell Tom that it reminds them of another famous photo, of Bobby Moore hugging Pel&eacute; after England’s defeat by Brazil in the 1970 World Cup. “One thing, now I think about it,” Jenkins says. “Is that TV didn’t get a good shot of it. The picture was fresh. People hadn’t seen it before.”</p> \n<p>What TV did get, however, was enough to fill a DVD. Jeff Foulser was, and still is, the chairman of Sunset + Vine, who were producing the coverage for Channel 4. Almost as soon as the match was over, Foulser got a text message from Gary Franses, his executive producer. “There’s a DVD in this match – The Greatest Test”. The ECB agreed. They wanted it ready ASAP. “Editing, production, distribution, it all had to be done by the end of that same week,” says Franses. “No one had ever done anything like that for cricket before.” By the time the next Test started The Greatest Test was in the shops. It sold 55,000 copies.</p> \n<h2>Third Test, Old Trafford, 11-15 August: match drawn</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dc6daba9cacd48e2c307ef7c1d234c02c272981\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436137495536/f4060a17-55c9-46dd-a30c-92f7844b37a0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A packed Old Trafford watches on with thousands of ticketless fans locked outside.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A packed Old Trafford watches on with thousands of ticketless fans locked outside.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On 15 August Ken Grime was up shortly after the sun. Usually he worked in the marketing department at Lancashire Cricket Club but during Tests he doubled up as the match manager. He had to start early, to make the drive in to Old Trafford from his house in Bury. By 6.30am he was on his way. When he passed a bus stop, they saw a lad waiting for a ride. He was wearing an England top. ‘He’s keen,’ Grime thought. Then he passed the next bus stop, and saw two more teenagers, both in England shirts. At the third stop there were two men, obviously cricket supporters, you know the type, in hats, holding plastic bags full of food and clutching flasks. “And it was at that point,” Grime says, “that I got a sudden lurch in my stomach.”</p> \n<p>The day before, while England were still batting in the third innings, Grime had been in a meeting with his colleague Peter Ash, and Lancashire’s chief executive, Jim Cumbes. “It was a very brief conversation,” remembers Grime. They had to decide on the ticketing arrangements for the final day since tickets had not been sold in advance. They agreed they would charge &pound;10 for adults, half that for children, cash on the door, gates open 9am. They put an announcement out around the ground, on TV and radio.</p> \n<p>“It was almost a goodwill gesture, really,” Grime says. “The one thing about that meeting I’ve never forgot was that somebody said, ‘Do you think we’ll sell out?’ No one knew. So I said, “I think we’ll get about 14,000.” That would have been two-thirds capacity. At stumps on day three, Australia were 24 for 0, needing a record 423 to win, or to bat out 98 overs to draw the match. At 4am that night, Lancashire’s head of security, Pat McCabe, was woken by a phone call. It was the nightwatchman down at the ground. “Pat,” he said. “You’re not going to believe this, but there are people camping out down here, waiting for tickets.”</p> \n<p>Grime pulled on to Brian Statham Way at 7.30am. Ash had made the same journey an hour earlier. “I remember driving along Talbot Road thinking, ‘Have I overslept?’” Ash says, “because there were all these people walking towards the ground, more and more and more of them. I was sure my watch was broken.” By the time Grime arrived “the ground was absolutely surrounded. I will never forget it. I thought, ‘Oh My God! What have we done?’”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/05/michael-clarke-captain-australia-ashes-england\">Michael Clarke has evolved into a captain Australia has finally learned to love | Geoff Lemon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ash was already inside. “We got a load of market trader aprons and reels of tickets, the old ones where you rip the stubs off, and opened up early, at 8am. Thing was we were letting more and more people in but the queues weren’t going down, they were getting bigger and bigger. People kept appearing from all over.” The queues finally stretched all the way back to the metro station and it was then that the police stepped in. They shut the tram stations in town, to stop more people boarding. “We knew by then we couldn’t get everyone in. But people were shoving their money at us and shouting, ‘I’ll pay more than the person in front!’”</p> \n<p>Colin Gibson was the ECB’s head of communications. “I remember I had to do an interview with BBC radio Five Live, on the breakfast show with Victoria Derbyshire. And she said, ‘What’s your message to people who are planning to come today?’ and I had to say ‘Please, please don’t, because you’ll never get into the ground.’” Even the players were struggling to get to the ground. Andrew Flintoff was actually staying at his own home for that match, and the traffic was so bad that he had to skip the wrong way down a one-way street. “I got stopped by the police and had to say, ‘Please, I really need to get there.’ They just waved us through.”</p> \n<p>By 9am the ground was full. Around 20,000 people were stuck outside. “I remember we got a call saying, ‘You can only do 20 more people,’” Ash says. “And it was quite frightening, because I was thinking, ‘These people have been in the queue for that length of time and we’ve got to turn them away. So we sort of retreated back inside and had to push the gates across. And I just remember seeing all these hands coming through the gates clutching their 10-pound notes, people shouting, ‘Please, please will you let me in.’ It felt awful but you just couldn’t do anything about it. I’ve been here 21 years, and it is the most memorable day in all that time. The only thing that could have made it any better was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/aug/15/ashes2005.ashes11\" title=\"\">if England had taken that last wicket</a>.” Australia, 371 for 9 at the close, survived by one wicket. Lee ended the match on the ground again, this time pounding it in triumph after surviving the final 24 balls with Glenn McGrath for company.</p> \n<h2>Fourth Test, Trent Bridge, 25-28 August: England won by three wickets</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be4485f5e79447b123314c241e6dad0be1fe66f3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436137686373/be69f2a3-4baa-4d92-92e9-7438265b4b87-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The partnership of Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles, pictured here between Ian Bell Geraint Jones, at the Oval, was crucial in the fourth Test.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The partnership of Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles, pictured here between Ian Bell Geraint Jones, at the Oval, was crucial in the fourth Test.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Finn-Kelcey/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of the least well known of the many accomplishments of Mark Nicholas is the fact that he is the man who made Mambo No5 a hit in Britain. In 1999 the production team at Sunset + Vine were struggling to find a piece of music for their new gig producing Channel 4’s cricket coverage. “We were all sitting around thinking, ‘What the hell are we going to do for opening titles?’” says the executive producer Franses. “Until one day Mark came in and stuck this track on. And after a second we all thought, ‘Thank you!” First time around that year, Mambo No5 stalled at No31 in the UK chart. Re-released in August, it shot to No1 and stayed there for a fortnight.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCEHREGc6yY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bCEHREGc6yY?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  One of the flops of the series … but at least it was off the field of play.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The ECB wanted the soundtrack to the summer of 2005 to be Jerusalem. In the end the long (and best) forgotten <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCEHREGc6yY\" title=\"\">official version was one of the team’s few flops</a>, peaking at No19. But for most cricket fans it is almost impossible to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRNaKp0hUg8\" title=\"\">listen to Mambo No 5</a> without a) thinking of Michael Vaughan’s pull shot and b) smiling at the memory. Which is odd, since, as Bega explains, his song is really about “sitting in the English Gardens in Munich, watching all these lovely ladies walk by”. (Turns out Jessica, Sandra, Rita and Monica were all real people.) Bega is German “and, as you know, cricket isn’t really a sport we follow in mainland Europe”. But his record company did arrange for him to visit a match. “I liked it because to me cricket seemed like baseball without all the spitting. And besides, I’d say that I’m, like, at least 50% of the reason why England won.”</p> \n<p>Sunset + Vine’s coverage was designed to make the sport accessible to people who were not necessarily experts. “Connoisseurs watch all the time, win or lose,” Franses explains. “But we hoped that at some point it would catch on with the general public so that a few uncommitted people might get into it.” They bought in the Snickometer, Hawk-Eye and the pitch mat, all designed to make the game easier to understand. They gave over the little breaks between to Simon Hughes, to explain the tactics and terminology of the game. “By 2005 we’d been doing it for six years by then so we knew what we were doing.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRNaKp0hUg8\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MRNaKp0hUg8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The new sound of cricket in 2005\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In previous years Channel 4’s coverage had been pulling in “two million viewers on a good day”. In 2005 “the ratings were sensational. I think there were more than five million people watching on average each day. Which is unheard of.” Compared with the 2001 Ashes, the proportion of female viewers was up by just under 10% and the proportion of under-15s by almost 75%. At first the cricket had to fight for screen time with the horse racing, and there were often a lot of complaints that it cut into Channel 4’s evening programming. Later in the summer the executives stopped worrying about that. “Racing hardly got a look in, because the cricket was delivering,” says Foulser. “Never mind the number of times Hollyoaks got cancelled because the cricket was over-running!”</p> \n<p>The ratings peaked late on the fourth day at Trent Bridge, as Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/aug/28/ashes2005.ashes8\" title=\"\">eked out the runs England needed to win</a>. 8.4m people tuned in to watch. “It became prime time,” says Franses. “You felt the whole country was watching that. We realised then that this was bigger than anything we had been before. And to be honest, I think it was probably bigger than anything that has happened in cricket since.” Foulser agrees. “That was the one. That was when it began to feel like a national event.” By the end of the year Sunset + Vine’s boxset of the series had become the biggest-selling sports DVD of all time. “We shifted 635,000 units.”</p> \n<p>Shame was the success felt bitter-sweet. “We’d been told the previous December that Channel 4 had lost the rights, so we knew it was going to be our last summer,” says Foulser. “When they saw the ratings, people at C4 were asking, ‘Have we made a bit of a cock-up here?’ But they were just outbid. Sky paid a lot of money for the rights and everything has a price. But I remember C4 had very mixed feelings about it, because the cricket had really over-delivered for them.”</p> \n<p>“We connected with an audience probably as much as anybody has ever done,” Foulser says. “On the last day at The Oval the camera guys got a shot of some fans holding a banner saying ‘Thanks 4 the memories’, with the C4 logo. And that sort of summed it up for us, because it meant we had done something that had really got into people’s minds and homes. It was the perfect time for cricket and the perfect time for Sunset + Vine. Best summer of our careers, we always say.”</p> \n<h2>Fifth Test, The Oval, 8-12 September: match drawn</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7bbd9ee85c78b89d74cc0034ad9f2d791f221d6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436137750242/7f0f5780-7d7b-43e8-bc47-de2c360bb4d9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"England's Kevin Pietersen acknowledges the applause of the crowd as he walks off having scored 158 runs during the final day of the fifth Test .\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Kevin Pietersen acknowledges the applause of the crowd as he walks off having scored 158 runs during the final day of the fifth Test .</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieran Doherty/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On the last day it felt as if everything stopped, because so much actually had. Trading on the stock market was down by 20%. Trafficlink, the firm providing real-time traffic information, reported that in London the roads were “a lot quieter than usual as people stay home or stay on longer in the office to watch the cricket”. Tony Blair, taking a tour of the City of London Academy, had to apologise for dragging his audience away from the small television set in the corner of the hall and ended his speech with an update from The Oval.</p> \n<p>At Southwark Crown Court, a clerk opened the proceedings in a complex fraud trial by offering to provide a series of display cards through the day to show the latest scores. The Confederation of British Industry approved. They advised employers that “on an occasion as exciting and as big as this week’s Ashes” employers should “be flexible in allowing staff to keep tabs on the score”. Even The Queen, we were told, was watching at Balmoral. Certainly <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/sep/12/ashes2005.ashes12\" title=\"\">when the match was drawn and the Ashes won</a>, she sent her “warmest congratulations” to the two teams.</p> \n<p>By then it was all over, except for one little group who were just beginning the longest night of the summer. On the Sunday evening of the fourth Test, a handful of ECB employees gathered together to work out what to do if England won. They called it Operation Victory. It was top-secret. England’s coach, Duncan Fletcher, insisted that the players could not be allowed to find out about it, which was why the ECB denied the story whenever journalists got wind of it.</p> \n<p>The plan, pushed by the team’s sponsors, was to stage a “people’s parade” in Birmingham, ending at Edgbaston. “Because of the bombings we had always thought that, if England won the Ashes, it would be very unlikely we would do a street parade,” says Gibson. “Because there was so much nervousness about doing it.” But on Monday 5 September, three days before the start of the final Test, the ECB got a call from the Mayor of London’s office. Ken Livingstone was adamant that, if there was going to be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/sep/13/ashes2005.ashes12\" title=\"\">a victory parade</a>, it had to be in London and specifically in Trafalgar Square – the same spot, of course, where there had been a party when London won the Olympic bid. “He really wanted the world to see that London was open for business and he thought that this was the way to do it.”</p> \n<p>On the Tuesday the ECB was given the green light. Its event manager, David Clarke, popped along to the mayor’s office for a meeting. “I was expecting there would be about five people around a table and there were about 30, including the river police and the man in charge of wastebins on the route, all sorts.” The ECB had to organise the stage, the security and the broadcasting arrangements with all four of Sky, ITV, the BBC and Channel 4. Everyone wanted live coverage. Then it had to negotiate with the City of London, the mayor’s office and its own sponsors. There was a late twist to the plan when another call came through from the prime minister’s office, explaining that Blair would be keen to host the team after they had left Trafalgar Square.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/ashes-2015-mitchell-starc-australians-england-tail\">Ashes 2015: Mitchell Starc and Australians plan to sting England’s tail</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And then the ECB had to wait. No one knew whether any of this was actually going to happen and, as the fortunes of the two teams fluctuated through the final day, the parade was on, then off, then on, then off, then on again. England were 127 for 5 at lunch, with a lead of only 133. “It was only in the last hour of the last day of the last Test that we knew for sure,” Gibson says. The ECB had two buses ready in a depot in Hertfordshire, waiting to be painted in the sponsor’s colours. “Those buses were going in and out, and in and out, of the garage. At 6pm I remember someone asked me, ‘Do you think it’s safe we can get the bus painted now?’” By 6am the next day the buses were outside the team hotel at Tower Hill. So were several crates of champagne sent by Elton John, one reason why Flintoff had to be poured off the bus into Trafalgar Square.</p> \n<p>Everyone had been so busy making the last-minute arrangements that no one had really stopped to ask how many people were actually going to turn out. “That morning we all wondered, ‘Will anybody actually come out?’” says Gibson. “And then when we left the hotel and the bus turned the corner, we saw all these people lining the road up Tower Hill. It was packed at nine o’clock.” Clarke was already in Trafalgar Square. “I got there at 5.30 that morning and there were people already there,” he says. At one point he got a call from a steward asking if he knew who Brian Lara was “because there was a man claiming to be him down in the crowd and he wanted to get through to see the team.” It really was Lara, who had stopped off on his way to the airport.</p> \n<p>Best estimates are that around 50,000 came out to cheer on the team. “And I remember thinking,” Clarke says, “‘All this? Over a bloody cricket series?” A cricket series and so much more.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436137142814/91ae44d3-697f-41dc-8b4f-3efc6ab8007a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Philip Brown/Getty Images","altText":"Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff celebrate with the urn after winning the greatest Ashes series.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436137278017/58cfdc9c-cb5f-4a50-a1b0-e909de05a099-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The picture of the series: Andrew Flintoff and Brett Lee shake hands after the second Test.

Or when Allan Border lost his cool with Craig McDermott in ‘93? Glenn McGrath’s 8-38 at Lord’s and Jason Gillespie’s 7-37 at Headingley? What about Adam Gilchrist’s blazing 152 at Edgbaston in 2001?</p> \n<p>It’s always been a dodgy premise for Australians, that “where were you when…” Ashes question, because unless you paid some exorbitant amount of money to get sunburnt and drunk on the hill with Jeff Thomson and 25 balding men in matching polos, we all know exactly where we were; half-asleep and huddled under blankets on the sofa.</p> \n<p>Personally I remember each Ashes series by the houses I was living in when they happened; 1989-2001: tucked up in bed at Mum and Dad’s listening to the radio with the ABC cricket guide opened on my chest; 2005: in a squalid share house surrounded by empty pizza boxes and the stench of stale beer; 2009: in a slightly less squalid share house surrounded by empty pizza boxes and the stench of stale beer; 2013: co-habitation with its fancy non-Ikea furniture and proper meals cooked on stoves, but at the end of play still dozing off on the sofa for that deep, doomed three-and-a-half-hour Ashes micro-nap.</p> \n<p>As a child, the former ABC cricket broadcaster Neville Oliver got his Ashes fix listening to radio descriptions and rode the resultant waves of emotion each morning after. “Defeat at the hands of England [was] such a desolate happening as to be worth a day off school,” he said. “Victory was as good as the end of school year.” </p> \n<p>To remember each series better we also have all those creaking shelves-worth of Ashes themed books; The Ashes Crown the Year; Fight for the Ashes; Operation Ashes; Botham’s Ashes; Boony’s Ashes; The Ashes Retained; The Ashes Thrown Away; Aussies and Ashes; Ashes to Ashes; Martin McCague’s Bumper Book of Ashes Anecdotes. Okay, the last is a slight embellishment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/06/ashes-2015-a-to-z\">Ashes 2015: the A to Z of Ashes history</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Maybe Australia’s mood isn’t quite as cricket-dependent these days but knowing glances will be shared by those yawning into smart phones and scrolling through the Cricinfo app on the train. That meeting can definitely be shifted back to 10am, by the way. Your tax return? Do it in September. We’re all in this together. Except for my sister-in-law. I don’t think she realises yet the true reason that my brother just took six weeks of long service leave. I guess she will soon. Good luck Pete.</p> \n<p>In actual fact no-one should get too worried about prolonged sleep deprivation or major marital conflict this time because the 2015 Ashes series will fly past us rapidly; 25 days of cricket crammed into just 48 days of svelte schedule. Now Australia’s standby players make do with a three-day tour match wedged between the 2nd and 3rd Tests and one other following the 4th, by which time their input might be irrelevant. Covering the languidly-paced 1953 series, former Australian Test opener Jack Fingleton also had time to take in the coronation of Queen Elizabeth, the climactic stages of a thrilling Ryder Cup at Wentworth and also met England’s executioner. If he’d been assigned to this one he’d be lucky to see much more than press boxes and hotel rooms.</p> \n<p>The stage has been set well for this series thanks to the now-compulsory verbal wars, which have established a new benchmark in pre-Ashes nonsense; English paceman Mark Wood almost inventing his own rivalry with fringe all-rounder Shane Watson, Watson replying quite predictably that encounters with net bowlers aren’t prominent among his great cricket anecdotes; <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/joe-root-david-warner-interview-2013-walkabout-punch\">Joe Root’s disappointment</a> over David Warner’s disappointment over their mutually disappointing behaviour at a nightspot we can probably all agree was a particularly disappointing choice of drinking venue; Ben Stokes preemptively stating <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/england-ben-stokes-australia-intimidation-cricket\">he could handle any sledging</a> that comes his way; <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/29/ashes-england-wont-come-close-steve-smith\">Steve Smith kicking off all of that sledging stuff </a> before the Australians even arrived; Stuart Broad’s suggestion that run-machine Smith <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/graeme-swann-england-no1-steve-smith-ashes-australia-icc-test-rankings\">might in fact be a bit shaky</a>, presumably in the way that Bradman was often susceptible once he’d passed 200. By the time the first ball is bowled today in Cardiff, hopefully we’ve also established which of Root and Warner’s fathers is fastest and strongest.</p> \n<p>Amid all this froth, a few important events have also transpired. Ryan Harris has sadly succumbed to injury, dead level with Bruce Reid in claiming 113 wickets from 27 Tests and the source of universal lament that the game couldn’t have had him for one last bone-grinding burst of energy. With no small amount of irony Harris has been replaced in the Australian squad by the unfortunately-nicknamed Pat ‘Cummo’ Cummins, star of as many <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DjEpLnUbD0Y/UTgagZcaASI/AAAAAAAAAcU/FPx6U9fLMNE/s1600/BUPA+Cummins+Hussey+Haddin.jpg\">health insurance advertising campaigns</a> as Test matches. </p> \n<p>That’s not the only upheaval within Australia’s ranks either. The internal battle for almost half the positions in the Cardiff Test XI paints a far murkier picture of the side’s likely fate in this series than they like to project. The buoyancy of Smith’s batting and World Cup success only partially obscure the fact that Watson, Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin and Chris Rogers are all creaking towards the finish line in Tests. Those who sit at the fringes could at any point be thrown into the fray. </p> \n<p>And England? If Australia gets it emphatically right we might see the dethroning of an Alastair Cook as captain, giving the series a retro dash of Athertonian (Gowerian? Goochian?) dread. The greater joy for Australians is that England’s 13-man squad for Cardiff boasts five players – dynamic keeper-batsman Jos Buttler, opener Adam Lyth, spinner Adil Rashid, all-rounder Moeen Ali and paceman Wood – who’ve yet to feature in an Ashes Test and so provide the series most of its novelty allure.</p> \n<p>History tells us that lamentably few Ashes series’ in recent memory have been tight run and recent form dictates that Australia enter this one with favoritism. But let’s be honest, this is a rivalry in which the cocky favourite has so often found comeuppance and for that, Australians should remain alert and awake.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4e69017c0f983453577f8f08924755f62f2745ec/0_79_3018_1812/3018.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1812,"width":3018,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jason O'Brien/Action Images","altText":"Glenn McGrath Australia Ashes","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jason O'Brien/Action Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T05:00:02Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T05:26:05Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Russell Jackson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/russell-jackson"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Ashes 2015","The Ashes","Australia cricket team","England cricket team","Cricket","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/ashes-2015","webTitle":"Ashes 2015"},{"id":"sport/ashes","webTitle":"The Ashes"},{"id":"sport/australia-cricket-team","webTitle":"Australia cricket team"},{"id":"sport/england-cricket-team","webTitle":"England cricket team"},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Russell Jackson","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/russell-jackson"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/07/watching-the-ashes-from-the-other-side-of-the-world-late-nights-and-stale-beer","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aex3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jul/07/watching-the-ashes-from-the-other-side-of-the-world-late-nights-and-stale-beer","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/07/watching-the-ashes-from-the-other-side-of-the-world-late-nights-and-stale-beer"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4e69017c0f983453577f8f08924755f62f2745ec/0_79_3018_1812/3018.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1812,"width":3018,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Glenn McGrath’s scorching spell of bowling at Lords in 2005 will live long in the collective memory.

The squad will be cut by five on Friday. “I have no side-effects and it all seems to be behind me now,” said Brown at the launch of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/england-rugby-new-kit-world-cup-120-jersey-rfu\" title=\"\">England’s World Cup jerseys</a> at Twickenham on Monday.</p> \n<p>He said: “I had not been out of the game for such a long time since I was 18 and there were days when you worried. It is difficult when you have an injury that is open-ended rather than having a start and finish date. All you can do is wait. I did not take a specific knock against France and it was more a case of my body telling me I was not ready to come back and needed time to recover. Now I am back to where I was before and will be confident going into contact because it is something I love.”</p> \n<p>Brown’s main symptom was a headache and he was ordered to go home, do nothing and try not to think about why he was not helping his club, Harlequins, at the end of a difficult season. “When you are sitting at home, there is little to think about other than why you were there,” he said.</p> \n<p>“It was difficult not being able to do what I love and am paid for. I tried to keep busy and did some household chores and eventually I was able to start some light fitness work. The mornings and evenings were the worst for the headaches, which were not significant but always seemed to be there. “I did not want to mask it with medication and only once did I have to lie down.”</p> \n<p>A few years ago, before firm protocols were established for players to observe before returning to play after concussion, Brown would probably have spent no more than a few weeks out. “Rugby is a macho sport and it is still quite hard to deal with the subject,” he said. “But you cannot keep pushing with your head – you have to listen to your body.

The &pound;50 cost of the junior jersey is also sure to attract criticism, although the figure is around the market standard when compared with the equivalent for the England football team.</p> \n<p>Speaking at the 100 days to go until England 2015 event at Twickenham on 10 June, the RFU chief executive, Ian Ritchie, defended the cost of the shirts.</p> \n<p>“The higher priced shirt is a special, different, commemorative model for the World Cup. The routine shirt, if I can put it that way, is normally priced,” Ritchie said. “We have had to bring out different shirts for the World Cup. It’s wrong to look at a special edition shirt and compare that to the routine shirt, which I think is in the normal area.</p> \n<p>“People will buy them if they want to buy them. If nobody wants to buy the one at 120 that is the call of the consumer. Nobody is forcing anybody to buy it, but we think it is a very special shirt. All the funds from it go back into the game.”</p> \n<p>The symbols of the Victoria Cross that were present on the rubber grip areas of the previous jersey have been removed. The inclusion of the imagery of the military medal caused controversy when the shirt was unveiled last September.</p> \n<p>“I saw a lot of correspondence from the medal associations that didn’t have any problem with it,” Ritchie said. There were statements put out afterwards that said they didn’t see any issues with it. We worked closely with them and they put out statements.”</p> \n<p>Chris Robshaw was among the players to model the kit at Twickenham. “It’s truly an honour to have the World Cup shirt on. Over the last three-and-a-half, four years there’s been a lot spoken about the tournament,” the England captain said. “Of course a lot of rugby is judged on the World Cup and those are the games that people remember. To be part of one in England puts us in an extremely privileged position.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436189270808/England-Rugby-World-Cup-K-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Manufacturers Canterbury insist that the new kit, which includes 'contoured ball-deadening grip placement' is their lightest to date.

Milner, who will wear the No7 jersey at Anfield, turned his back on Champions League football with the deposed Premier League champions plus a more lucrative contract extension at the Etihad Stadium to become Liverpool’s first summer signing on a &pound;150,000-a-week deal.</p> \n<p>Milner agreed to the Anfield move after being assured Rodgers would remain Liverpool manager following an end-of-season review conducted by the club’s owner, Fenway Sports Group. And the 29-year-old has admitted he was convinced to leave City by Rodgers’ willingness to hand him the central position that Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini could not offer on a regular basis at the Eithad.</p> \n<p>“City are a great club and I had five great years there and enjoyed every minute,” said the former Leeds United, Newcastle United and Aston Villa midfielder. “The fans were brilliant with me the whole time there, and that made the decision difficult.</p> \n<p>“I was lucky enough to win trophies and be part of a good squad there but, speaking to the club about what their plans were and where they saw me over the next few years at the club, and then speaking to the manager here and his plans going forward and for myself, I just thought it was the right thing for me to hopefully go and get more game time and be part of something special.</p> \n<p>“I want to play football and play more centrally if I can – and that’s where the manager said he sees me playing. That’s a big thing for me coming to the later stages of my career. I want to play as much football as I can. When I’m sat at 45 and retired, I want to look back and see what I’ve done and that I’ve played games, rather than having come to the end of my career and tailed off.”</p> \n<p>Rodgers wanted to sign Milner last summer when he first rejected City’s offer of a contract extension worth up to &pound;165,000-a-week. The midfielder’s decision to join Liverpool in principle was announced after the manager had survived FSG’s inquest into last season’s poor sixth-placed finish in the Premier League. Milner says Rodgers was another telling factor in the transfer.</p> \n<p>The midfielder added: “He was a massive part, to be honest. The club doesn’t need a lot of selling about what a great club it is, with all the history, the support and the squad they have. But speaking to the manager and what his plans were for me, things I’ve heard about him from other players – I was speaking to Stevie[Gerrard] at England and people like that – and what he said to me made me want to come and play for him straight away.”</p> \n<p>Milner was followed into Anfield by Danny Ings and it appears increasingly likely that an independent tribunal will have to decide on the transfer fee payable to Burnley for their former striker. Liverpool and the Turf Moor club remain poles apart in their valuation of the England Under-21 international.Burnley want almost double the &pound;5m that the Premier League side are prepared to pay.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436218077023/James-Milner-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"James Milner will wear No7 shirt at Liverpool after being unveiled officially on Monday.

That offer was rejected but Southampton, who are prepared to make a formal complaint to Fifa if Atl&eacute;tico Madrid sell Toby Alderweireld to Tottenham Hotspur, are prepared for a second bid.</p> \n<p>United want to secure Schneiderlin before their tour to the United States and for which they depart on 13 July but will have to up their bid to nearer &pound;27m to stand any chance of securing the 25-year-old midfielder. “Every player has his price and we have experience as a club of selling players,” Koeman said.</p> \n<p>“Last season we sold some players, and if there is interest in Morgan then OK. But it has to be at the price the club wants. He is one of the key players or our team, an international player. And I don’t think is a problem for Manchester United.”</p> \n<p>Asked if he was planning for the campaign ahead with Schneiderlin in the ranks, Koeman said: “No. I know the situation. I have spoken a lot with Morgan. Last season we finally said: ‘Stop all this business because we are not selling any more players’ [after Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert had been sold]. That was difficult for him but he came back after a few days with good motivation and had a great season. But we know the situation now. There is a lot of interest in the player. With a club like United, we know it’s difficult to keep the player. But if they pay, then OK, we can make the transfer.”</p> \n<p>Koeman has already pinpointed the Feyenoord midfielder, Jordy Clasie, as a replacement for the Frenchman should agreement be struck with United. “He’s a good player, a young player and a Dutch international who is ready to make a step up and show his qualities at a higher level than we have in the Dutch league,” he said. “He’s growing in his leadership qualities too and, if Morgan goes, we’ll need a player in that position. He is one of them [on the list of potential replacements].”</p> \n<p>While Southampton hope to conclude a deal for the versatile FC Twente defender Cuco Martina in the next few days, the situation with Alderweireld remains complicated and, potentially, fractious. The Belgium defender spent last season on loan at St Mary’s from Atl&eacute;tico, a deal that had been struck with a view to a permanent &pound;6.8m move. The Spanish club could cancel the buyout clause written into the deal by paying a fee of &pound;1.5m to Saints, but the deadline for the payment was missed.</p> \n<p>Tottenham Hotspur have subsequently moved for Alderweireld, offering the player a five-year contract while indicating a willingness to pay Atl&eacute;tico nearer &pound;11.5m for his services. Yet, according to the original agreement between Southampton and the Spanish club, Spurs are technically not yet entitled to speak with the player or put him through a medical.</p> \n<p>The Saints’ executive director, Les Reed, has travelled to Spain to speak directly with Atl&eacute;tico and the club are prepared to lodge a formal complaint with the Football Association and Fifa should Spurs be permitted to sign the player.</p> \n<p>Alderweireld had informed Southampton of his desire to return permanently to St Mary’s at the end of last season, though his head appears to have been turned since by Tottenham’s pursuit. “Of course there will be interest in the player,” said Koeman. “He is a good, strong defender and he had a good season with us. But we had a contract and Atletico were too late in paying back the option. It’s difficult. Maybe, at a certain moment, you say ‘yes’ but then, afterwards, there are other offers and it’s difficult...</p> \n<p>“But still I believe Southampton is the best place for the player. Why? Ask the player why he told me that he was very comfortable. Very happy. He was missing playing football when he was a player at Atletico Madrid. At Southampton normally he starts every game ,and he did well. His family was happy. OK, that’s all football business. But let’s wait and see what happens in the next few days.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436199809002/Morgan-Schneiderlin--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Morgan Schneiderlin missed trainign with southampton on Monday and has indicated he could leaveteh club in the coming days.

That was one of his most emphatic victories.</p> \n<p>Another win on 26 July would see him move from strength to stranglehold in this year’s championship after winning the British Grand Prix and extending his lead over his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to 17 points.</p> \n<p>“It has been a great track for me in my career, and I’m excited about that, and then we have the break,” Hamilton said. “I will be training like crazy over the break to make sure I am strong for the next part of the season. Generally in my career the second part of the season has been the stronger part for me.”</p> \n<p>It has not been lost on Hamilton that when he previously won at Silverstone, in 2008 and 2014, he went on to take the title.</p> \n<p>“That’s the plan,” he said. “That is what I am working towards. It is five out of nine now and I have had eight out of nine poles. I am told it’s been as strong a year performance-wise from me personally. Last year was exceptional for me and to think that I am doing it just as much as that but a little bit better this year, I didn’t think I could do that.</p> \n<p>“So I am overall really happy with that and now as I go to Hungary. I am happy, it has come together since last year but I am definitely enjoying it more now. I am enjoying life and racing more than ever.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton will go there given further confidence after his brilliant call to come in for fresh rubber on the 43rd lap at Silverstone just as rain and Rosberg closed in on him. He is an outstanding natural driver, but not necessarily renowned for the quality of his calls to the pitwall.</p> \n<p>“I never felt that was a strength of mine in Formula One, making those calls,” Hamilton added. ”Generally because the driver only has one view of everything and the guys outside have a better view, and so generally I would rely on the team. And definitely in the past there were times when they got it right and some times when they got it wrong.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton said the only other time he made a call at Silverstone was in 2008, and even though he was right he was overruled by his McLaren team. “That was the only other time I got the decision right apart from today. I don’t know how the future is going to go with that but I am glad I have ticked that one off.</p> \n<p>“I trust my judgment and I trust myself and all the decisions that I am making inside and outside of the racing world. There are opinions for and against those things but I am still driving the way I am driving, I am enjoying the racing and you can see it is all paying off.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton went to Silverstone knowing that Rosberg had won three of the previous four races, but he said: “The last race [in Austria] was the first time I felt he was particularly quick in the race.” Rosberg’s win in Monaco followed a mistake by the team on a weekend in which Hamilton had been totally dominant.</p> \n<p>The world champion added: “I knew how many people were going to be [at Silverstone], I knew the pressure, I’d been here before, I knew how important it was for me to really deliver.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436220980438/Lewis-Hamilton-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lewis Hamilton knocks back the bubbly after winning at Silverstone.

For much of the season grands prix are played out at empty, white elephant tracks in countries that know nothing about F1. On Saturday there was a crowd of 110,000 and on Sunday there was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/silverstone-britsh-grand-prix-formula-one-motor-racing\" title=\"\">a capacity 140,000</a>.

As <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/05/f1-british-grand-prix-live-lewis-hamilton\" title=\"\">Sunday’s race</a> showed all that is needed is a bit of real racing. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/05/williams-silverstone-british-grand-prix-f1-felipe-massa\" title=\"\">Williams showed up</a> at the weekend and that made all the difference.</p> \n<p>With better tactics – they should have allowed Valtteri Bottas to attack Felipe Massa sooner – they would have been even stronger, although the rain finally did for them. Williams are terrible in the wet. Now it is up to Ferrari and Red Bull to come to the party. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/british-grand-prix-mclaren-f1-fernando-alonso-jenson-button\" title=\"\">We can give up on McLaren</a>, for this season at least.</p> \n<h2>3) Manor start to find their way</h2> \n<p>Manor are on the way up and on this form might give McLaren a contest in the battle to avoid the wooden spoon. In October, Manor – then Marussia – became the second F1 team <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/oct/27/marussia-administration-formula-one-us-grand-prix-caterham\" title=\"\">to be placed in administration</a> within days, following Caterham. When they reappeared as Manor this year some people suggested they had only pitched up to collect last season’s prize money. At Silverstone they had their best weekend of the year to finish 12th and 13th. OK, that meant they were last and last but one. Their upgraded MR03B looked competitive and Will Stevens would have done better if his team had been ready for his pit stop when he went in to collect intermediate tyres – he was in there for 14 seconds.</p> \n<h2>4) Aston Martin could return to F1</h2> \n<p>Aston Martin could be on the way back to Formula One. It is thought they have had talks with Red Bull, Williams and Force India.

We hope Madrid facilitate his departure,” Casillas’s agent Carlo Cutropia <a href=\"http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/Porto/interior.aspx?content_id=960361\" title=\"\">told Portuguese media</a>.</p> \n<p>Madrid have not yet accepted the bid but they are determined to move Casillas on this summer. The pursuit of David de Gea was designed not only to bring in a goalkeeper destined to be the future of the Spanish national team but also to encourage the captain to finally depart. Finding a way of managing that has not been easy. Although names emerged periodically, few clubs were truly interested in paying significant money for Casillas.</p> \n<p>Real had agreed with the player that they would make good the salary shortfall between the amount he receives at the Bernab&eacute;u, which is around €7.5m, and what he is offered elsewhere. The goalkeeper’s initial preference was to have the final two years of his contract paid off in full and walk away as a free agent. Madrid are reluctant to cover all the costs, although Porto were hopeful that his signing would not be costly.</p> \n<p>“Iker is very interested in going to Porto,” Cutropia told the newspaper Record. “Madrid have an offer and they know what Casillas wants.”</p> \n<p>Casillas was first called up to the Real Madrid first team squad <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/nov/03/iker-casillas-real-madrid-spain-liverpool-european-cup\" title=\"\">while still at school</a>, and has played 725 games for the club across 16 years, winning three European Cups.
