As the Guardian reported last Saturday, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/robin-van-persie-transfer-manchester-united-fenerbahce\" title=\"\">the player had finalised terms </a> over the move, and the two clubs have been locked in talks all week.</p> \n<p>The Fenerbahce sporting director, Giuliano Terraneo, travelled to England to hold final discussions with United this week and the clubs expect the move to be completed before the end of the week.</p> \n<p>On Thursday Fenerbahce released a statement to the Istanbul stock exchange confirming the talks with United. Van Persie, who is expected in Istanbul on Sunday, has been offered a three-year deal with an option for a further 12 months and will be the third forward United have lost this summer after the confirmation that Radamel Falcao, who spent last season on loan at Old Trafford, will play for Chelsea next season. &Aacute;ngelo Henr&iacute;quez has joined Dinamo Zagreb on a permanent deal after playing there on loan last season.</p> \n<p>Wayne Rooney remains at the club, as does James Wilson, and United have already signed Memphis Depay from PSV Eindhoven. Javier Hern&aacute;ndez was loaned out last season and it is uncertain whether he will be given a chance now.</p> \n<p>Van Persie, meanwhile, will replace Dirk Kuyt as Fenerbahce’s only Dutch player and the striker will become the highest earner at the club. The developments are similar to the Nani deal, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/06/fenerbahce-nani-manchester-united-transfer\" title=\"\">which was completed on Sunday</a>.</p> \n<p>An agreement in principle with the 28-year-old winger was already in place before Terraneo flew out to Portugal to hold final talks with the player’s agent, after which he struck a &pound;4.3m deal with United. Terraneo was among the crowd that welcomed Nani to Istanbul and the Portuguese international said the Italian had been influential in the transfer process. “I am delighted to be here and want to thank the president and Terraneo for bringing me here,” he said.</p> \n<p>Nani’s comments underline how important Terraneo has been in the club’s flurry of transfer activity since the start of the window and marks a complete change in the club’s footballing policy.</p> \n<p>The Fenerbahce president, Aziz Yildirim, and the board have handed the 61-year-old Italian the reins on transfer policy. Traditionally Turkish presidents and boards have had a far more hands-on approach in the transfer process, with sporting directors serving merely as figureheads holding limited sway.</p> \n<p>The former Lazio and Internazionale man became the first foreign sporting director at the club when he took charge at the end of last season but has already become a cult figure among the club’s fans.</p> \n<p>Fenerbahce have also completed the signings of the Lille centre-back Simon Kjaer, the Brazil international Josef de Souza from S&atilde;o Paulo, last season’s Super Lig golden boot winner Fernand&atilde;o and the Turkish international Sener Ozbayrakli.</p> \n<p><em>Emre Sarigul is the editor of </em><a href=\"http://www.turkish-football.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Turkish Football</em></a><em>.

I’ve come in and looked at the plan, looked at the calibre of players we’re targeting and said ‘wow’.”</p> \n<p>It was the first time the former England coach <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/10/newcastle-united-accused-by-reporters-over-steve-mcclaren-interviews\" title=\"\">had spoken to the majority of the north-east media</a> since the farcical press conference which marked his arrival at St James’ Park last month when, at the insistence of the club, McClaren spoke to only one national newspaper, the Daily Mirror, which has been discussing a so-called “preferred media partnership” arrangement with Newcastle.</p> \n<p>Whatever the outcome of those negotiations, McClaren has subsequently made it clear to Mike Ashley, Newcastle’s owner, and Lee Charnley, the managing director, that excluding the wider media access to the club would be a retrograde step.</p> \n<p>Acutely aware the relationship between Newcastle and many of their supporters has suffered several severe fractures in recent seasons, the 54-year-old feels open communication with journalists can help begin the process of reconnecting those supporters with the team.</p> \n<p>Accordingly, he invited north-east-based reporters to lunch at the training ground on Thursday to shed some light on Ashley’s latest, newly ambitious, blueprint.</p> \n<p>“We’ve talked a lot about the next three transfer windows being huge, massive, for us,” McClaren said. “Let’s make sure we get the right players. If we do, then, in a year’s time – after the third window – we should have a damn good team and the squad should be on a different level to where we are now. That’s purely because we’re looking at players above a certain [price] bracket.</p> \n<p>“We’ve put our objectives on the line and Mike Ashley has said: ‘Go on, fulfil it’. We’re looking for a calibre of player to improve what we’ve got. But when you go &pound;10m-plus – to Europa League and Champions League players at top clubs – competition is high.</p> \n<p>“So, no, I’m not in the least frustrated at the length of time it’s taking to get the first player in. Sometimes the right ones take a little bit of extra time. And we need to get the right ones.</p> \n<p>“We have got one or two positions we need to fill desperately, so we might need to buy about four or five players this window. That would be great. I think everybody would be happy if we could do that.”</p> \n<p>A big part of McClaren’s remit is getting more out of what was widely perceived as an under-achieving squad last season. Significantly, discipline has already been tightened appreciably, with two players sent home for minor transgressions in recent days as he and staff strive to implement a “no excuses” culture.</p> \n<p>Unusually among managers – or head coaches – he has a seat on Newcastle’s board. So is he more a coach or director? “A bit of both,” said McClaren, who has not abandoned hope of signing Charlie Austin from QPR. “But the majority of my time – 90 per cent – will be spent on the training field. That’s the job, improving, coaching the players, getting them organised, getting them fit and also helping with recruitment.”</p> \n<p>He will be assisted by Ian Cathro, the former Valencia No2. For a man so young – he celebrates his 29th birthday on Saturday – Cathro demonstrated extraordinary poise and assurance as he put first-teamers, including Moussa Sissoko and Fabricio Coloccini, through their training ground paces on Thursday.</p> \n<p>“We want to give the players a chance to enjoy it here,” said McClaren. “But we also want to give them a job to do.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/9/1436468635139/Georginio-Wijnaldum-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Georginio Wijnaldum won the Dutch league title with PSV Eindhoven last season.

Credit to Leeds; they’re a fantastic team and they’re quite rightly sitting at the top of Super League. But I genuinely thought the better team won – we bombed some chances but I’m very happy to get the win.”</p> \n<p>As for Leeds, they will sit back and reflect on this defeat and wonder what might have been. That late penalty and a controversial disallowed try in the first half proved the difference on a night where they just weren’t quite at their best. The Leeds coach Brian McDermott said: “I’ve no complaints with the loss. We were flat in the first half; there were some tremendous periods but defensively we didn’t have enough bite about us – that’s where the game was won and lost really.”</p> \n<p>The hooker Paul Aiton put Leeds into an early lead after 10 minutes when he dived over from dummy-half courtesy of some uncharacteristically slack Wigan defending, but two tries in three minutes from Liam Farrell and the captain Sean O’Loughlin turned the game.</p> \n<p>Yet the impressive Adam Cuthbertson then fired a superb pass for prop Brad Singleton to barge over for Leeds, with Kevin Sinfield’s second conversion levelling it up at 12-12. Leeds then felt they should have gone back in front when Danny McGuire crossed after more sensational play from Cuthbertson, only for the video referee to chalk the try off due to obstruction. Wigan took advantage, and subsequently the half-time lead courtesy of a try from Matty Bowen.</p> \n<p>A pinpoint kick from Smith 10 minutes after the restart allowed Josh Charnley to touch down and extend Wigan’s lead, but Leeds showed spirit and guile to fight their way back into the contest. However, they could only produce a solitary try from Ash Handley in a dominant 20-minute spell.</p> \n<p>They kept pressing late on, and after plenty of pressure on the Wigan line, it finally told when Rob Burrow exploited some tired defending. Sinfield’s conversion then made it 24-24 with just three minutes left.</p> \n<p>Leeds looked the more likely to claim the win, but when Aiton was adjudged to have obstructed a Wigan defender to enable Carl Ablett to break, the referee Richard Silverwood pulled the play back and gave Smith the simplest of opportunities to win it for Wigan. He did not miss, and there was barely enough time for Leeds to kick off before the hooter sounded to hand Wigan a potentially huge victory come the season’s end.</p> \n<p><strong>Wigan </strong>Bowen; Charnley, Bateman, Sarginson, Burgess; Williams, Smith; Flower, McIlorum, Crosby, Tomkins, Farrell, O’Loughlin.

Stadium","byline":"Aaron Bower","body":"<p>Tim Sheens has refused to rule out a return to club coaching but insists that his only focus at the moment is his new role as the director of rugby at Salford.</p> \n<p>The 64-year-old, who is the current Australia coach, has not worked at club level since 2012 but has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/23/australia-coach-tim-sheens-director-rugby-salford\" title=\"\">joined the Red Devils</a> until the end of the season to help try and transform the club’s fortunes, a deal which is likely to be extended for another two years if both parties are happy.</p> \n<p>But with the club understood to be in discussions over a severance deal for the current coach <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/iestyn-harris-sacked-salford-head-coach\" title=\"\">Iestyn Harris after another season of struggle</a>, Sheens says his job is to help establish Salford as a force in Super League as their director of rugby as opposed to the head coach, and he will not get involved with the coaching setup any more than he is asked to.</p> \n<p>“At the moment I’ve been given a role as director of rugby and we’ve got to see how far that goes,” Sheens said. “I’m not looking at coaching or that type of thing here; I’m here to assist the current staff and work with them to improve the club. We’ve worked on things already and the coaches have allowed me to give them some input on the training field. I definitely won’t jump over the top of them in that regard.</p> \n<p>“You never say never in this game about coaching; just as players get to a certain stage in their careers, so do coaches. You never know what will happen, all you do is work hard in the role you’re in and it’s funny how the phone can sometimes ring. I’ve been in the game long enough to not worry about my future – I’m here to do a job with Salford as director of rugby, and that’s my focus.”</p> \n<p>He added: “My role is just to support the coaching staff; it’s a role which includes recruitment and the overall planning for the club – everything from staffing to recruitment of players right through to how it is run and managed.</p> \n<p>“As I understand things, we are still drafting up what the role will be completely, it will grow as it goes along. Director of rugby is not a common thing in rugby league, and it’s a role that will expand as we go along.”</p> \n<p>Sheens added that his future as the coach of Australia, whom he led to World Cup success in 2013, is currently undecided and may not become clear for some time. “That position still hasn’t been sorted out; the way it works in Australia is it’s an invited position by the NRL on a one-year contract basis.</p> \n<p>“I’ve had seven one-year contracts, but the way it’s done in the future may change, and they may go with a contracted role and have someone full-time. However, those kinds of decisions don’t get made until around November, especially with Australia not having any fixtures to compete in at the end of the year.”</p> \n<p>Sheens spent a month with the Red Devils working in an advisory role earlier this year but has returned in a permanent capacity following a spell back in Australia, and he revealed he has used that time to try and examine potential recruits for Salford for 2016 and beyond.</p> \n<p>“As soon as we agreed for me to come back over I was into all the agents in Sydney and got the official list of players out of contract,” he said. “There’s an unofficial list, too; there’s players who clubs may release before the end of their contract – but that doesn’t mean they’ll come and play in England.</p> \n<p>“We’ve got to look at the salary cap and then there’s the marquee player card, which you may or may not want to play –you’ve got to be sure. There’s lots of things to be looked at for us.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436448199251/Australian-Kangaroos-Trai-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tim Sheens, the Australia coach, is also director of rugby at Salford Red Devils.

In a tough field, he shrugged off his recent worries and, beaming with delight, set off on a lap of honour after crossing the line at the Athletissima meeting in Lausanne.</p> \n<p>“As an athlete all I want to do is what I do best and that’s to run and to represent my country and to win medals, enjoy training and enjoy racing,” he said.</p> \n<p>He admitted that recent weeks, since the allegations against Salazar and Galen Rupp that changed his world, had been “hard” but insisted he “just wanted to run”.</p> \n<p>Farah did not choose an easy place to make his comeback to the track after the doping allegations that have engulfed his coach and, in his words, dragged his name “through the mud”.</p> \n<p>In a world-class field, Farah faced the strong Ethiopian duo of Imane Merga and Kejelcha, the prodigious 17-year-old who won in Rome in a world-leading time of 12:58.39. The Kenyan, Caleb Ndiku, is also an obvious threat to Farah’s world championship hopes next month.</p> \n<p>With eight laps to go Farah, in the black Nike Project Oregon kit that has become indelibly associated with his travails, began to move through the field and hit the front with three left. After the bell, he and Kejelcha began to race down the back straight. But Farah expertly held off his challenge to prove that the media storm that has engulfed him has not damaged his chances at this summer’s world championships.</p> \n<p>It was Farah’s first race since pulling out of a meeting in Birmingham in the wake of allegations broadcast by the BBC’s Panorama early in June and on the US website ProPublica against Salazar and Rupp. The double Olympic champion has been training in Font Romeu in the Pyrenees since returning from Portland, where he said he challenged Salazar. He publicly backed Salazar after the coach released a 11,000-word rebuttal challenging the allegations. Amid the fallout, it was also revealed that Farah missed two drug tests in the build-up to the 2012 Olympic Games at which he won double gold.</p> \n<p>Last week, he went on the offensive, challenging his doubters to prove he was not “100% clean”. “It’s killing me, it’s killing my family,” he said.</p> \n<p>The organisers hoped the focus would be on the 10 reigning Olympic champions who converged on the cramped, charming Stade de la Pontaise for one of the most atmospheric meetings in the Diamond League calendar. But the spectre of the doping scandals that echo down the sport’s recent history, and are likely to foreshadow August’s world championships in Beijing, were never far away.</p> \n<p>The American Justin Gatlin, unbeaten in 25 races, took on his compatriot Tyson Gay and the Jamaican Asafa Powell, all three of whom have served doping bans of varying lengths. Gatlin prevailed in 9.75sec, almost equalling his season’s best, from Powell and Gay.</p> \n<p>Among the British hopes, there was a hugely encouraging personal best to win the 200m by Zharnel Hughes. The teenage sprinter, who recently obtained British citizenship, has become the latest to be blessed – or cursed – with the “new Usain Bolt” tag.</p> \n<p>Bolt, who Hughes ran close this season, was absent from the race amid ongoing injury concerns and the 19-year-old came home comfortably in 20.13.</p> \n<p>“I feel really good about my race. My season has been going better with each race and now as British champion I look forward to doing well at the world championships,” he said. “For me the goal is to get into the final and then aim for the podium.”</p> \n<p>Hughes is free to compete for Britain as the Caribbean island of Anguilla is a British overseas territory and is not recognised by the International Olympic Committee. He will now be considered a genuine medal contender in an increasingly open 200m field.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436472328080/Mo-Farah-5000m-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mo Farah beat a strong 5,000m lineup on his return to the track, including the 17-year-old Ethiopian Yomif Kejelcha.
