In the Italian town of Cremona on Saturday evening, Charlie Ewels and his team-mates will be seeking to secure a third successive junior world title, an achievement that really would signpost a rosy future for the national team.</p> \n<p>Of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jun/23/england-wales-under-20-world-cup\" title=\"\">the 2013 side who triumphed in France</a>, Jack Nowell, Anthony Watson, Henry Slade and Luke Cowan-Dickie are already in England’s World Cup training squad.

As this year’s crop are fully aware, the gap between youthful promise and a senior cap is significantly less wide than it used to be. Hence the excited pre-match mood in Italy, described by the head coach, Jon Callard, as “like kids in a sweet shop”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/world-rugby-under-20-final-new-zealand-england\">World Rugby Under-20 Championship final: New Zealand v England who’s who</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Their opponents New Zealand have at least two outstanding individuals in their winger Tevita Li and back-rower Akira Ioane but the strong performance of England’s pack in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/15/england-south-africa-under-20-world-championship\" title=\"\">the semi-final win over South Africa</a> suggests another gripping final could be in prospect.</p> \n<p>In the shape of Paul Hill, Jack Walker and the captain, Ewels, who has already played European rugby for Bath against a Toulouse pack including Louis Picamoles and Thierry Dusautoir, England have some highly effective young forwards and the Saracens centre Nick Tompkins is a further name to watch, having captained England at under-16 and under-17 level.</p> \n<p>For some context, it is interesting to note that when these two sides last met in a final in Italy, in 2011, the likes of Brodie Retallick, Beauden Barrett, George Ford, Owen Farrell and Joe Launchbury were involved. Four years later all of those players will be at the World Cup proper, which suggests England’s squad for the 2019 World Cup will include a handful of this summer’s crop.</p> \n<p>Physically, as Callard is quick to confirm, the modern young player bears scant resemblance to his old-school predecessors. “When I played for England I think I was 89kg and 5ft 10in tall. The average size of a full-back now is 6ft 3in and 16 and a half stone. It’s just the way society is growing. In terms of preparing for and recovering from games, everything has gone up a notch.”</p> \n<p>Add to that the sheer weight of numbers and financial muscle at England’s disposal and it could be argued England should have been dominant at this level years ago. “It was always said in the past that if England get it right they’d be a hell of a force,” said Callard, who credits Stuart Lancaster, the England senior team’s head coach, for his efforts to reconnect English rugby’s various strands.</p> \n<p>“There are a lot of people doing some fantastic jobs in terms of developing the game at all levels. Stuart has re-emphasised the principle of having pride in the shirt and, having seen the likes of Jack Nowell and Anthony Watson break through, these guys know they’re not a million miles away.</p> \n<p>“I think this team is ahead of last year’s because the players are getting technically and tactically better year on year. Everyone knows what’s expected and how to operate in these circumstances.”</p> \n<p>As if to underline the point, Lancaster and Graham Rowntree have been in regular phone contact with Callard and his forward lieutenant, Ian Peel, throughout the tournament, during which England have beaten Japan, Wales and South Africa but lost 30-18 to France in the pool stages.</p> \n<p>In hindsight that setback might have been a blessing. “It was no secret we underperformed against France,” admitted Callard. “We were very disappointed and want to show we’re better than that.”</p> \n<p>It also helps that England have no injury concerns, allowing them to stick with the same combination that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/15/england-south-africa-under-20-world-championship\" title=\"\">upset a formidable Springbok side</a> 28-20 in Calvisano. There are six survivors from last year’s final and, assuming they can neutralise New Zealand’s pace out wide, Callard is quietly hopeful.</p> \n<p>“We’ve got a lot of selflessness in our side which helps others to shine. They’re not thinking about themselves, they’re thinking about the team.”</p> \n<p>Wales, meanwhile, will tackle Australia in a play-off for seventh place while Ireland and Scotland contest ninth.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/19/1434720177060/Charlie-Ewels-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Charlie Ewels celebrates after England's win in the Under-20 World Cup semi-final against South Africa.

His speed, fitness and tireless work ethic in sevens carries over to the U20 side</p> \n<p><strong>Anton Lienert-Brown, centre, Waikato</strong></p> \n<p>A late arrival in Italy, Lienert-Brown has played a regular role in the Chiefs’ run to the Super Rugby play-offs this season. Having added plenty of bulk to his frame following the 2014 tournament, Lienert-Brown has moved to another level, mainly thanks to his decision making</p> \n<p><strong>Tinoai Faiane, centre, Auckland</strong></p> \n<p>Faiane was a bit-part player for New Zealand in 2014 as an 18-year-old but has been one of the stars of the 2015 team.

It’s hard to believe that Li was lacking in confidence heading to Italy. All that is behind him after grabbing the record for most tries at this level in the semi-final win over France.

Not flashy but Black leads the team around the park with assurance and accuracy. One of New Zealand’s most accurate goal kickers</p> \n<p><strong>Te Toiroa Tahuriorangi, scrum-half, Taranaki</strong></p> \n<p>Union and league scouts have been after his signature. Why? He’s been described as a “mini Sonny Bill Williams”</p> \n<p><strong>Ricky Riccitelli, prop, Hawke’s Bay</strong></p> \n<p>Typically a hooker, Riccitelli has slotted in as prop for the New Zealand side to help form the best pack the country has had at U20 level in the past four years. Like all New Zealand forwards, Riccitelli has good skill on the ball but his work rate is what sets him apart from other props</p> \n<p><strong>Liam Polwart, hooker, Auckland</strong></p> \n<p>It has not taken long for Polwart to catch the eye of Super Rugby franchises in New Zealand. He played for the Chiefs’ development side in 2015 and could make the move to the full squad for the 2016 season. Still a work in progress at set-piece time but a solid performer in Italy</p> \n<p><strong>Atunaisa Moli, capt, prop, Waikato</strong></p> \n<p>New Zealand’s captain, Moli, demands huge respect, or mana, from team-mates and coaches. Moli was part of New Zealand’s 2014 squad and was taught a lot in two losing encounters against South Africa that time around. A future All Black</p> \n<p><strong>Joshua Goodhue, lock, Canterbury</strong></p> \n<p>Playing alongside his twin, Jack, in the New Zealand team, Joshua made his debut for the Canterbury national provincial championship side in 2014, featuring alongside players such as Adam Whitelock. His older brother, Cameron, plays as a flanker for London Welsh</p> \n<p><strong>Hamish Dalzell, lock, Canterbury</strong></p> \n<p>The cousin of the All Blacks lock Sam Whitelock, Dalzell has many of the same qualities on the rugby field. A proven ball-winner at lineout time, Dalzell is part of the Canterbury rugby academy and could soon be playing alongside his All Black cousin at provincial level</p> \n<p><strong>James Blackwell, flanker, Wellington</strong></p> \n<p>At first sighting, coaches struggle to name one thing Blackwell does well. The main reason being he does everything exceptionally. One of New Zealand’s most accurate players, he’s also one of their smartest. He is capable of playing lock and is strong in the lineout</p> \n<p><strong>Blake Gibson, flanker, Auckland</strong></p> \n<p>The question that often comes up in New Zealand is, quite rightly, who will be the next Richie McCaw. Enter, Blake Gibson. With four Super Rugby caps for the Blues already, Gibson has earned high praise for his work ethic and ball-pilfering abilities</p> \n<p><strong>Akira Ioane, No8, Auckland</strong></p> \n<p>Another from the New Zealand Sevens team, where he was a breakout star in 2014.

I happened to be at Taunton when Matthew Carter of Nottinghamshire <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/15/matt-carter-nottinghamshire-somerset-collapse\" title=\"\">took seven for 56</a> against Somerset this week – there would be three more expensive wickets in the second innings. He is a tall, willowy off-spinner, who still manages to loop the ball as well as spin it and in that magical first outing his control was excellent. <strong>Vic Marks</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Verdict </strong>Give him half a decade to learn his craft and a chat or two with Graeme Swann along the way and there may be possibilities here</p> \n<h2><strong>Zafar Ansari, Surrey</strong></h2> \n<p>Ansari can open the batting, bowl left-arm spin, play the piano and explain international politics, potentially all at once. The 23-year-old has flourished with red and white ball alike for Surrey. Ansari is a mature cricketer and taking 22 Championship wickets in May is not to be scoffed at. Skilled at bowling defensive and attacking lines, he gives the ball flight and remains remarkably calm under pressure.His batting is another positive, with two first-class centuries to his name. <strong>Amy Lofthouse</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Verdict </strong>Early promise but needs to be tested against higher-quality batsmen</p> \n<h2><strong>Tom Westley, Essex</strong></h2> \n<p>A part-time off spinner, yes, but England see something of substance in Westley’s party trick, particularly in limited-overs cricket. They sent him to Sri Lanka as part of a batting and spin bowling camp in the winter, where he worked with the ECB national spin bowling coach Peter Such. He stayed on to play for Bloomfield Athletic and Cricket Club where he was captained by the Test off-spinner Suraj Randiv who gave Westley a lot of advice. Sadly, his joints were not supple enough to learn the doosra. <strong>Vithushan Ehantharajah</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Verdict </strong>A work in progress and a slim to none England pick for spin alone right now</p> \n<h2><strong>Scott Borthwick, Durham</strong></h2> \n<p>At Arundel on Thursday, Borthwick provided a reminder of why he is a capped England spinner. After a crucial second-innings 74 for Durham against Sussex, he took <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/18/durham-sussex-county-championship\" title=\"\">four for 46 to seal a 178-run win</a>. Not possessing of a big bag of tricks, what he does have is a great stock leggie and the confidence to give it flight and decent turn upon landing. Arguably the best wrists – whether batting, bowling or fielding – in the county game. <strong>Will McPherson</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Verdict </strong>Remains a better batter and catcher than bowler, but must not be forgotten, and must bowl more</p> \n<h2><strong>Arron Lilley, Lancashire</strong></h2> \n<p>At the start of 2015, mentioning Arron Lilley and England in the same sentence would have drawn quizzical looks from even the most ardent Lancashire supporter. An off-spinning all-rounder with more white-ball experience than red, Lilley, 24, was behind the left-armers Simon Kerrigan and Stephen Parry at Old Trafford, but has played two Championship matches alongside Kerrigan, taking nine wickets and scoring two fifties. Ashley Giles now has a selection headache. They call him the Big Show. <strong>Graham Hardcastle</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Verdict</strong> Lots to learn, but Swann was also a late bloomer.</p> \n<h2><strong>Ollie Rayner, Middlesex</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>Extremely tall for an off-spinner and therefore able to create extra bounce, the 29-year-old has had something of a feast-or-famine career to date. Called up to England’s holding camp in Abu Dhabi as far back as November 2008 as the squad debated whether or not to return to India following the Mumbai terror attacks, that early promise blossomed most fruitfully when he bagged an eye-catching 15 wickets in a match against Surrey at The Oval in September 2013. However, his 2014 County Championship wickets then cost more than a hundred apiece. Currently in the Middlesex team due to injury to the slow left-armer Ravi Patel, he dismissed England lefties Adam Lyth and Gary Ballance during a decent fourth-innings display at Headingley earlier this month. <strong>Richard Gibson</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Verdict</strong> Different to his peers but England Lions level might be his ceiling.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/19/1434716248985/Matt-Carter-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The 19-year-old Nottinghamshire spinner Matthew Carter can loop the ball as well as spin it.

The visitors had a new half-back pairing in Declan Patton and Chris Bridge in the absence of Gareth O’Brien and Richie Myler but they were no match for Maurice Blair and Albert Kelly, who combined superbly, while Kieran Dixon made the most of his recall by producing a dazzling performance at full-back for the hosts.</p> \n<p>There was little hint of the one-sided second half early on, however, when powerful surges from Warrington’s front-row pair Ashton Sims and Chris Hill got the visitors on the front foot and they combined for the game’s first try after the hooker Daryl Clark had created the position by charging down Kelly’s attempted clearance. Sims’ short ball got his fellow prop charging into a gap for his third try of the season, converted by Patton.</p> \n<p>Rovers relied on the dashing runs of the ever-willing Kelly as they initially struggled for creativity in Campese’s absence but they found a spark just before half-time to turn a 6-0 deficit into a 10-6 lead.</p> \n<p>Kelly’s cut-out pass enabled the centre Liam Salter to release Ken Sio and the winger evaded Stefan Ratchford’s last-ditch tackle to cross at the corner five minutes before half-time for his 15th try of the season.</p> \n<p>The home side, however, needed a touch of good fortune for their second try, with Warrington’s captain Joel Monaghan safely gathering Kelly’s high kick but then losing the ball in Kris Welham’s thunderous challenge, which enabled Blair to collect and release the winger Josh Mantellato for the score.</p> \n<p>Mantellato kicked his first goal to open up a four-point interval lead and the home side emerged for the second half with a spring in their step.</p> \n<p>Dixon demonstrated fine footwork to cut through the Wire defence before wrong-footing Ratchford on his way to the line. Rovers then stretched their lead on 53 minutes when Sio palmed back Kelly’s high ball for Salter to touch down.</p> \n<p>Mantellato kicked both conversions to make it 22-6, before Gene Ormsby took Ratchford’s pass to go over at the corner for his side’s second try. It proved only a minor irritation for Hull KR, however, as they cruised through the final quarter.</p> \n<p>Another mazy run from deep from Dixon got them back on the attack and the acting captain, Tyrone McCarthy, chased Kelly’s grubber kick on the last tackle to touch down against his former club before Welham went over on the crash ball for his side’s sixth try.</p> \n<p>Mantellato kept the scoreboard ticking over with two penalties, taking his goal tally to six from eight attempts to put the seal on a fine win.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434751331479/Kieran-Dixon-of-Hull-KR-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kieran Dixon of Hull KR marks his recall to the side diving in to score his side's third try against Warrington.
