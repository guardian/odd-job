From the frequency with which Ashes series come around you might think that this entertainment has been commissioned by the same people who bring us Strictly, MasterChef or Downton Abbey. Find a winning formula and squeeze it dry.</p> \n<p>We are about to embark upon the third Test series between these two countries in the past two years, in part a consequence of rejigging the international schedule so that England’s winters in Australia no longer coincide with the World Cup, a measure, we can safely say, that did absolutely nothing for the ECB’s recent pursuit of glory in 50-over cricket. After all the changes of itinerary England ignominiously <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/mar/09/england-crash-out-cricket-world-cup-bangladesh\" title=\"\">failed to make the quarter-finals</a> of the World Cup.</p> \n<p>Yet despite the recent saturation, the fascination with those cricketers with the baggy green cap endures. Go to Canterbury or Chelmsford and the crowds have flocked in.</p> \n<p>The games have not been particularly special. There have been runs aplenty as the Australians enjoy the most cordial of welcomes from counties so grateful for their presence and their ability to generate income way beyond any other cricketing nation. Like Tom Jones, Dolly Parton or Lionel Richie, the old bunch of troupers from down under (has there ever been a tour party with 10 of the 17 aged over 30?) can still pack them in. We all remain remarkably curious and excited by the prospect of the Ashes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/26/alastair-cook-captaincy-england-ashes-spain-camp\">Alastair Cook declines to say if he will drop England captaincy after Ashes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The mood is very different from two years ago. Australia were the underdogs and how they deserved that role. There was disarray in the wake of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/mar/12/weekly-sport-diary-england-italy\" title=\"\">“homework” fiasco in India</a> when none of the senior citizens of Cricket Australia could persuade Mickey Arthur, the coach, or Michael Clarke, the captain, to change their obstinate, blinkered determination to drop four of the team. Australian cricket was a laughing stock, with one of their best batsmen, David Warner, sidelined for the first Test against England after the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jun/12/cricket-australia-david-warner-incident\" title=\"\">incident at the Birmingham Walkabout involving Joe Root</a>.</p> \n<p>This was followed by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/21/england-win-second-ashes-test-australia\" title=\"\">a crushing defeat in the Lord’s Test</a>, Australia’s sixth consecutive loss, the same sequence that prompted Kim Hughes to resign in tears in 1984. One journalist said to Clarke: “I presume that won’t happen this time.” Clarke replied: “Presume nothing.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Alastair Cook was being pilloried by Shane Warne for his defensive captaincy, but not by many others. Kevin Pietersen was batting at four and hit his last Ashes century (at least, I presume there won’t be another one) and England won the series 3-0. It might have been 4-0.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/aug/25/england-australia-fifth-test-match-report\" title=\"\">Clarke’s funky declaration at The Oval</a>, which had senior Australians snorting with fury, took his team to the brink of defeat, whereupon the umpires decided to take the players off for bad light. Yet today Clarke is heralded as one of the great captains and – with justification after the Phillip Hughes tragedy – a wonderful ambassador for the game. Now it is not only Warne who is eager to point out the shortcomings of Cook the captain, especially since the decision to ostracise Pietersen.</p> \n<p>The Warne factor will be an interesting sideshow throughout the series. Warne is Clarke’s “biggest mate” and how gratifying it must be for Australia’s captain to have the world’s greatest wrist-spinner, who has always been blessed with a fertile cricket brain, in his corner. However, there is a downside here if the captain is more inclined to follow the advice of his old mate than his coach. This has been a source of friction within the Australia camp, even during the successes of the Darren Lehmann era.</p> \n<p>Warne’s relationship with Cook has never been quite so warm. On the eve of the Headingley Test in June 2014 it became apparent that Warne’s frequent criticisms had got to the England captain. Speaking with more candour than good sense, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jun/19/alastair-cook-scene-last-test-century\" title=\"\">Cook admitted as much, saying that the criticism was personal and that “something should be done about it”.</a> This was a bullseye for Warne, who sometimes still appears to be preoccupied by winning the Ashes rather than just talking or writing about them. He had rattled the England captain.</p> \n<p>The general perception is that Clarke’s captaincy is vastly superior to Cook’s: the statistics do not entirely back that up. Clarke has won 22 and lost 13 of his 42 Tests as captain, a good record; Cook has won 14 and lost 10 of his 33 Tests in charge, which is not too bad either. There is not a huge disparity in the figures. What they may tell us is that we can overestimate the impact of the captain, whether he be funky or pragmatic, provided he has his team four-square behind him.</p> \n<p>It is more important how the two captains bat. Both are titanic run-scorers of the modern game. Cook has 9,000 runs at 47 from his 114 Test matches, Clarke 8,511 at 51 from 110 games. It will not come as a major surprise that when England win Test matches Cook averages 60, when they lose he slumps to 29. Clarke averages 56 when Australia win and 31 when they lose.</p> \n<p>Those runs are usually more influential than any funky field/bowling changes. A prime objective for both players in the hullaballoo that precedes an Ashes series is to get their own games in order. In recent times Clarke has managed this better than Cook, who has averaged 26 in his last 10 Tests against Australia and who has barely seen a ball that can be cut or clipped on the leg-side. In this series look to the captains rather than the coaches.</p> \n<p>There are plenty of other compelling duels. Eighteen months ago Mitchell Johnson reintroduced the fear factor to Test cricket. There was the mesmerising sight of certain batsmen quaking in their boots. Can he repeat that on slower English pitches? It was instructive that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/27/englands-stuart-broad-puts-up-his-dukes-as-he-relishes-villainous-role\" title=\"\">Stuart Broad hoped for “slow seamers”</a> this summer, an odd request for an opening bowler. Johnson is unlikely to be given the new ball, which is now in the possession of Mitchell Starc, an ominous development for England.</p> \n<p>Of the two wonderkids of international cricket, who will come out on top? Steve Smith at No3 or Root at No5? The chances are that when the next Ashes series comes around this pair will be tossing up together. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/england-ben-stokes-australia-intimidation-cricket\" title=\"\">How will Ben Stokes react to a little bit of goading from behind the stumps?</a> How much will Australia miss the inspirational Ryan Harris after his sad and sudden retirement? Will England be able to control Warner, potentially the most destructive batsmen in the series? Will the Aussies? Will anyone bother to defend against the spinners?</p> \n<p>There are intriguing questions everywhere, which start and end with the captains. And now, traditionally, comes a prediction: no, not the outcome but the observation that whichever captain ends up on the losing side will relinquish their job at the end of the series, not necessarily of their own volition.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435922768329/Michael-Clarke-and-Alasta-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Australia's Michael Clarke and England's Alastair Cook face each other as Test captains for the third time in two years.

It was Hatton, the European Indoor 60m hurdles silver medallist, who had warned Ofili she was “not taking my spot” for Beijing. Only now she had. With only the top two at these UK trials being automatically selected – provided they have the qualifying standard – Hatton will have to rely on the selectors’ grace for the one remaining place.</p> \n<p>And so once again the debate over so-called plastic Brits – which began when Porter and others moved to the UK to benefit from lottery funding before London 2012 – was reignited. Porter and Ofili have an English-born mother, and so are fully entitled to represent the UK. Both are talented too, as they hinted at while finishing first and second in 12.83sec and 12.96 respectively, with Jessica Ennis-Hill third in 13.10. Yet it was hard not to feel sympathy for Hatton, a 20-year-old who has improved enormously this season, but is now crossing fingers and toes as she waits to discover whether she will make the world championships.</p> \n<p>Afterwards, as Hatton was being treated for a back spasm, Porter and Ofili expressed their delight at their one-two. Porter said: “It was really special. This was the first time we’ve ever raced each other over 100m hurdles. I’m just so proud of her and the way she executed.” Ofili, meanwhile, praised her new supporters, adding: “It’s nice being in front of the GB crowd and representing them.”</p> \n<p>But when Ofili was asked about Hatton’s comments last week, which included a suggestion that she had come to Britain because “America’s a bit too hard for her at the moment”, she clammed up, saying: “Every time I race I just focus on myself and executing the cleanest race possible and running well.”</p> \n<p>In the men’s 200m Zharnel Hughes – another recent transfer, this time from the British colony of Anguilla – insisted there was much more to come after winning the final in a modest 20.42sec, with Danny Talbot second in 20.61 and James Ellington third in 20.62.</p> \n<p>The likeable Hughes, who turns 20 next week, claimed he was only running at “85%” and reckons he is in shape to smash his personal best of 20.15 later this season. “That time is going lower man,” he said smiling. When he was asked whether dipping below 20 seconds for the 200m was on he replied: “Definitely, I’m in shape for it right now, because I’ve been running 20-flat in training so I know I can go sub 20.”</p> \n<p>In the women’s 100m heats, Dina Asher-Smith looked a class apart as she qualified fastest for Sunday’s semi-finals easing down in 11.31sec ahead of Asha Philip (11.47) and Desiree Henry (11.51). “It was decent,” she said. “My start was a bit iffy so I’ve got bits to improve on. But I was happy. It felt comfortable.” The men’s 100m heats also went as expected with James Dasaolu, CJ Ujah and Harry Aikines-Aryeety showing the ravine in class between elite and club level.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere on the second of three days at these British Athletics Championships, Isobel Pooley equalled Katarina Johnson-Thompson’s British high jump record with a leap of 1.97m, while Holly Bradshaw made a welcome return after injury in winning the women’s pole vault in 4.50m. Several World or European Championship medal winners also went through to Sunday’s 22 finals, including Christine Ohuruogu in the 400m, Eilidh Child in the 400m hurdles and Lynsey Sharp in the 800m.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/4/1436030680148/Cindy-Ofili-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Cindy Ofili, centre, finished second to her sister Tiffany Porter – a result that guarantees her a World Championships spot.

But the 36-year-old made no such mistake with a flawless performance on Saturday, holing three birdies on the front nine and four more on the back nine, the last coming from a matter of inches on the 18th.</p> \n<p>“Today was really a phenomenal round,” said Van Zyl, who fired a hat-trick of birdies from the 9th for the second day running. “I felt really comfortable from tee to green and made a couple of nice ones [putts]. I was in a similar position yesterday and finished in an ambulance. It’s the sort of golf course where you can’t let your guard down and have to stay on top of things.”</p> \n<p>Van Zyl is chasing a first European Tour title but believes he will benefit from the experience of 13 victories on the Sunshine Tour. “I think it will play a big role. It’s the same situation, the stage is a bit bigger. I have been in this situation a couple of times so hopefully tomorrow I can pull it through,” he said.</p> \n<p>“I had surgery on both knees last year, which wasn’t great. You just don’t quite know what to expect coming out here but luckily I got off to a nice start at the beginning of the year and got the confidence building a little bit.”</p> \n<p>At 10 under par, Van Zyl leads by two from Germany’s Max Kieffer, who birdied four of the last seven holes in a flawless 65, with Austria’s Bernd Wiesberger another shot back after a 66. Kieffer has not missed the cut in any of his 17 events this season and has recorded four top-10 finishes, but is also seeking a first European Tour title.</p> \n<p>The former US Open champion Martin Kaymer and home favourite Victor Dubuisson, who began the day in a share of the lead, both shot 69 to lie four off the pace alongside England’s James Morrison, who shot a 68 despite a three-putt bogey on the last.</p> \n<p>“I think tomorrow I will need a very good start if I want to have a chance,” Dubuisson said. “I think you need to be two or three under par after six or seven holes because when you start the back nine, from 12 to 18 it’s really difficult to make birdies.”</p> \n<p>Kaymer, who won the title in 2009 and shares the course record of 62, said: “I probably played better than the first two days but the putter was fairly cold today. I didn’t make any putts the first 10 or 12 holes but I gave myself many, many chances, so I have to build on that.</p> \n<p>“I’ve shot low rounds on this golf course before. If I play the same way and the putter is the same as the first two days, then I have a chance.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/4/1436047640429/Jaco-van-Zyl-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jaco van Zyl made up for a profligate second-round performance with a superb 64 to put himself in sight of winning the Open de France.

Ultimately, Trevor is in position now and we hope he has a long and productive association with English cricket.</p> \n<p>“I’ve got confidence he will do a great job but Farby is a fantastic guy and everything we’ve seen suggests he could do the job really well, too.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/3/1435937276643/The-England-director-of-c-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The England director of cricket, Andrew Strauss, left, helps to promote the Cricket for Heroes match, which will take place at The Kia Oval in September.

The colt, last seen winning the Derby, is now unbeaten in five runs and racing fans will have been thrilled to hear his jockey suggesting he is a laid-back animal who should be able to stand plenty of action.</p> \n<p>Dettori, now 44, was winning his third Eclipse but this, his first for 11 years, will have been the most significant to him by a long way and not just because it cements his association with such an exciting young horse.</p> \n<p>Two years ago, the Italian had become so unfashionable that an end to his career seemed on the horizon and even at the beginning of this season there was no reason to imagine that the future could be so bright.</p> \n<p>“I started in March with nothing,” he said in the winner’s enclosure, hamming it up for the cameras, “and now I’ve won the Eclipse, Derby, Prix de Diane, Diamond Jubilee, it’s mad, absolutely mad. What a horse. Superstar. I’ve got no words to describe how good he is.</p> \n<p>“You’re a monster,” he roared at Golden Horn before pointing out the webbing that was holding his left boot together. “I wore these for the Derby, ripped them on day one of Royal Ascot, wore them all through Ascot and retired them after the Diamond Jubilee. Then yesterday I called my valet and said, ‘Get them back.’”</p> \n<p>It is unlikely that the rather more sober Gosden participates in such acts of superstition but the Golden Horn camp may have felt their luck had run out when their horse was drawn in stall one for this race, right against the inside rail. The obvious risk for a hold-up horse in a small field of five was that he could be boxed in, crawling along behind the leader with two horses on the outside, penning him in.</p> \n<p>Gosden and Dettori felt the only possible response was to bounce out and make the running and it is some testament to the trainer’s openness that he said so in public on Friday, at a time when many another man would have been inclined to keep quiet or perhaps even offer some misleading statement. There were those who imagined Gosden might actually be planning to use his other runner, Western Hymn, as a pacemaker.</p> \n<p>When the stalls opened, and after only a short hesitation, Golden Horn did indeed go to the front and there he stayed throughout. His only challenger at any point was The Grey Gatsby, who deserves plenty of credit for making a proper race of it.</p> \n<p>Jamie Spencer, riding the grey, is firmly associated in the public mind with extreme hold-up tactics but there was no danger of him leaving it too late this time. The Grey Gatsby moved up alongside Golden Horn at the top of the straight and seemed to be travelling the better for about a furlong.</p> \n<p>“Jamie rode a great race,” Dettori said, “because he knew what I was up to. He took me on three-out, got upsides at the two and my horse had a chance to give in but he showed what a true champion he is, he knuckled down. It’s the sign of a very, very good horse.”</p> \n<p>The next chance to see the colt could come as soon as Ascot’s King George in three weeks’ time, a race apparently favoured by his owner, Anthony Oppenheimer, whose family sponsored it for decades. Dettori also pointed towards the King George, for which his mount is now no bigger than 6-4, but Gosden, who also has Eagle Top entered, was more reserved.</p> \n<p>“A day at a time, a week at the time, the horse’ll tell me. I watch, I listen, that’s my job. It’s up to the horse.”</p> \n<p>Gosden, who is a long way down the road towards a second champion trainer’s title, is making a habit of doing unprecedented things. Having become the first trainer to win the English and Irish Derbys with different horses in the same year, he has helped Golden Horn become the first to complete the Dante-Derby-Eclipse treble.
