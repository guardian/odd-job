Finn’s dismissal of McCullum all but stopped the chase in its tracks even given the potential of Martin Guptill’s hitting&nbsp;prowess.</p> \n<p>It certainly provided an ideal environment for Rashid with his leg-spin. He bowled very nicely, showing deceptive variations and some decent spin, and with his runs was a plausible candidate for man of the match. But the clamour that is already there for his instant inclusion in the Test side is heaping too much expectation on him and getting way ahead of the game.</p> \n<p>It is four years since I found myself writing an optimistic piece about Scott Borthwick perhaps having the potential to become the first English wrist-spinner since Tommy Greenough, in 1959, to take five wickets in a Test innings. That prospect fizzled out and last season he managed only 13 wickets for Durham at more than 58 runs apiece: his batting has become his forte instead.</p> \n<p>As an aside, the most prolific wrist-spinners for England since Doug Wright (108 wickets), the left-armer Johnny Wardle (102) and Eric Hollies (44), all in the decade after the second world war, have not been the obvious ones (Robin Hobbs, Ian Salisbury and Chris Schofield, all of whom were selected specifically as spinners) but the opening batsman Bob Barber, who took 42 wickets, and Ken Barrington, who managed 29.</p> \n<p>In Ian Peebles (45), Len Braund (47), Walter Robins (64) and Tich Freeman (66) you have the only wrist-spinners to have taken more wickets for England than Barber. As a contrast there are 25 finger-spinners with more than him, of whom 15 have more wickets than Wright. A lack of quality wrist spin is scarcely a new phenomenon.</p> \n<p>Even back in the Caribbean, where Rashid was selected for the Test tour but did not play, it was felt by some of the management that he could have a stronger part to play in England’s limited-overs cricket. For spinners, particularly those who can turn the ball either way, have tended to thrive in the format, largely because of the imperative for batsmen to attack and the preponderance of boundary fielders.</p> \n<p>On the other hand Test cricket – as New Zealand and most recently England have shown – can be adventurous, but it still remains a world away from the white-ball game. Unless there was a pitch that was so obviously going to turn significantly (the UAE in October might be a case in point) then, particularly in this country, the bowling is always going to be dominated by seamers, with a spinner largely required to play a holding role until the latter stages of the match.</p> \n<p>There is certainly a case for saying he could play a part in winkling out the tail, something that has eluded England for several years now, but technically, in terms of his default pace, he may allow Test match batsmen too much time. He really cannot play as a single spinner and in general, unless the seamers would be largely redundant once the new ball had gone, he would unbalance the team as a second spinner.</p> \n<p>For now, best to enjoy what Rashid is doing in the happy environment in which he finds himself. Test cricket is no longer the only benchmark by which a cricketer should be judged.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945187320/Adil-Rashid-England-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The clamour for England to include Adil Rashid, left, pictured high-fiving with Chris Jordan at Edgbaston, in the Test side is heaping too much expectation on him and getting ahead of the game.

Having agreed to provide the prize money, the Qataris immediately set about trying to win some of it back by purchasing two horses fancied for races at Royal Ascot next week, including King Of Rooks, an impressive winner of Sandown’s recent National Stakes.</p> \n<p>Those behind the sponsorship deal repeatedly declined even to hint at the sum of money involved but one report has guessed at &pound;50m and that is not being criticised. The deal runs until 2024 and a simple process of adding up the prize money for the races involved over that time suggests that figure may even be on the low side.</p> \n<p>The deal is between Ascot, Newmarket, British Champions Series and Qipco, which is the investment vehicle of Qatar’s ruling Al Thani family. Since 2011, Qipco has been the backer for the Champions Series of 35 top British Flat races as well as an increasing number of the races themselves and the total prize money for those contests has, according to a BCS press release, risen 50% to &pound;17.4m over that time.</p> \n<p>The parties involved have stated a couple of early prize money ambitions in light of the new deal. Their plan is for Champions Day at Ascot in October to be worth &pound;5m by 2024, while the 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket will be made up to &pound;500,000 from next year, an increase of almost 25% in the case of the fillies’ race.</p> \n<p>Qipco became Ascot’s first official partner last year as a result of its investment at the royal track and that status has now been extended to 2024, entitling the firm to branding rights during two days of the Royal meeting each year. Nick Smith, Ascot’s spokesman, put the benefits of this deal in context when he described it as “unprecedented for both us and the wider industry”.</p> \n<p>Having such a long-term and well-funded commitment would, Smith said, “give us the confidence to be able to plan ahead. We’re going to look in the round at where we stand and have a think, over the rest of the year, about the way we should be using this investment.</p> \n<p>“Of course there will be prize money increases on the back of these deals and we have to find the balance between investing in prize money and our facilities. Prize money is not the whole deal but it is fundamental.”</p> \n<p>As news of the deal was released, Deloitte simultaneously published a report on the various means by which Qipco has invested in British racing in recent years. Again, the writers fought shy of reaching a global figure but mentioned 95 people employed, directly and indirectly, as well as capital investment of more than &pound;10m at the two stables owned by the firm.</p> \n<p>Al Shaqab, the name under which Sheikh Joaan al-Thani owns horses, has purchased a pair of promising two-year-olds, it emerged on Wednesday. King Of Rooks is the 5-4 favourite for next week’s Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot, while Easton Angel is third in the betting for the Queen Mary Stakes at 11-2.</p> \n<p>The pair are expected to stay with their current trainers, respectively Richard Hannon and Michael Dods. Only 50% of Easton Angel was sold and Paul Mulrennan keeps the ride as part of the deal.</p> \n<p>Cirrus Des Aigles will miss what would have been a keenly anticipated clash with Treve at Saint-Cloud later this month after discovery of what his trainer, Corine Barande-Barbe, described as “a little bump and a bruise” on one leg. She mentioned the Irish Champion Stakes in September as a possible target.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433956676822/Ascot-Races-QIPCO-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The plan is for QIPCO Champions Day at Ascot to be worth at least £5m by 2024.

He was accompanied by a fellow centurion, Joe Root, and Adil Rashid, who made 69. England’s innings of 408 for nine was their best ever one-day total.</p> \n<p>It was a performance in stark contrast to their display at the recent World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, where they failed to advance from the group stage. That campaign resulted in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/09/andrew-strauss-confirmed-director-england-cricket-ecb\" title=\"\">Peter Moores’ dismissal as coach</a>, although his assistant Paul Farbrace has remained in the interim before the arrival of Trevor Bayliss.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/england-new-zealand-first-odi-match-report\">England break records and New Zealand with crushing victory in first ODI</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Buttler, the Lancashire wicketkeeper, produced a stunning knock and reckons his side’s performance was the result of all those involved in English cricket demanding an attacking style. “If we weren’t going to go out and have a swing when everybody in this room wanted it, English cricket, the paying public and everybody who watches this sport, we couldn’t have had more of a licence to go and get bowled out for 150 in 20 overs,” he said.</p> \n<p>“I think that is a big change – everyone has accepted that English cricket can do that and I think if we were bowled out for 200 in 30 overs we would not have been criticised that much. So we had a real lease of life to go and play that way. It wasn’t through lack of trying before, it’s not as if we wanted to play [badly].”</p> \n<p>England gave Sam Billings a one-day debut while Surrey’s Jason Roy opened the batting. However, the new faces were not the ones who contributed significantly to the remarkable win, Roy being caught from the first ball of the match and Billings adding only three down the&nbsp;order.</p> \n<p>Instead Buttler, Root and Rashid scored at a rapid rate, the latter taking four wickets, as did Steven Finn, as New Zealand toiled to 198 all out. Buttler revealed his excitement at the new names in the squad, saying there is a vibrancy and freedom that will help England in good stead as they attempt to make progress on the one-day stage.</p> \n<p>“There’s a huge potential,” he said. “We don’t want to get carried away at one performance and think English ODI is fixed and we’re going to win the World Cup. But I think just looking round – the two training days were really exciting, watching what some of these guys can do in the nets, the energy they have brought to the group just through being new to international cricket, how exciting it is and how much fun it is.</p> \n<p>“There’s definitely been an extra buzz. Everyone has seen in county cricket how guys like Jason Roy and Sam Billings have played innings that make people stand up and take notice. When they do that in international cricket there will be a wider audience taking note. When we realise the potential of everyone as a group and can all do that at the same time, it will be a really exciting place to be.”</p> \n<p>New Zealand rested Tim Southee, and all their bowlers with the exception of Trent Boult were brutally punished by England. Southee could return at The Oval on Friday and the Kiwis’ coach, Mike Hesson, admitted his side must now fight to regain form for the four remaining ODIs. “I think it’s a different group,” said Hesson. “This English side naturally are quite attacking players. If you bowl poorly to them, they’ll punish you. The way Joe played initially and then Jos, and, to be fair, Adil Rashid batted beautifully as well at a critical time. They certainly gained some momentum and we’ve got to look to get it back in the next couple of days.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/10/1433949582536/jos-buttler-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Jos Buttler flat-bats another bounday in his 129 against New Zealand at Edgbaston.

James controlled the tempo, the team hit the boards and again the Cavs played tenacious defense against the top-scoring team in the NBA this year.</p> \n<p>James was stunning again, with 40 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists. His first six made shots came in the paint, as he backed his way in for lay-ups and short turnarounds. It was obvious that James, who has not shot the ball well from the outside in the playoffs, was determined to move into the paint.</p> \n<p>James said afterwards: “I’ll do whatever it takes to win. I’m living in the paint. I did that tonight because that it what we needed tonight. I’ve never played where two all-stars were out. I know you guys hate to hear me elaborate about whatever it takes, but that’s all that matters right now.”</p> \n<p>While the first two games ended in overtime with the teams splitting, this one was just down and dirty basketball. The Cavs imposed their will on the Warriors and never let up.<br /></p> \n<p>Aside from a 13-2 run which found the Warriors just down by one with about five minutes to go, the Cavs dominated and had a determination that was evident from the get-go.</p> \n<p>And once again, the gritty and undrafted Aussie guard Matthew Dellavedova continued to play his game of diving for loose balls, hitting floaters in the lane, and hitting James on a crucial alley-oop fast-break dunk in the fourth quarter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40ffbfe7fd83c7080c52619ac07a34a51981debf\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/40ffbfe7fd83c7080c52619ac07a34a51981debf/0_47_4710_2825/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steph Curry scored 27 points but Golden State’s rally came too late.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steph Curry scored 27 points but Golden State’s rally came too late.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Golden State scored 37 points and shot just 34% from the field in the first half, and that bad start was just too much to overcome. The Cavs shut down the Warriors’ Splash Brothers, Klay Thomson and Steph Curry, in the first half, and the scoring duo had just nine points together at the half, and combining for just one of six three-pointers.</p> \n<p>The Cavs had a seven-point, 44-37 lead at half time, but they went on a 13-2 run in the third quarter that gave them an 18-point lead (68-49). James and Dellavedova found their range in the third, scoring 13 and ten points respectively. Through the third quarter, Golden State had managed just 55 points.</p> \n<p>The Warriors made several runs in the fourth – one being a 15-3 run – cutting the lead to three points at about the five-minute mark. But a key exchange came when Curry missed a three-pointer, and then Delladedova took the rebound on a fast break and tossed a lay-up to James. The lead was back to five. If Curry had hit that shot, the game would have been tied and the end might have been different.</p> \n<p>Curry did hit a three-pointer to cut the lead to one, but Delladevova hit a falling down prayer shot from the lane that banked in, and he hit the foul shot for a stunning three-point play with 2:20 to go. James then cam back on the next possession after holding the Warriors scoreless, and hit a three with 1:40 left to stretch the lead to 87-80.</p> \n<p>Curry said afterwards: “On the road we have to play free have fun and be the aggressors. We just have to stay sound fundamentally and especially not make mistakes down the stretch. LeBron is making some crazy plays … we just have to match their intensity.”</p> \n<p>Delladedova finished with 20 points on 7-17 shooting. Curry scored 24 points in the second half to finish with 27.</p> \n<p>The game was not pretty for the Cavs, and they did seem disjointed in the fourth quarter as they allowed the Warriors to score 36 points. James did miss 20 shots on 14-34 shooting. Maybe complacency set in after they got their big third-quarter lead. But every time the Warriors got within shouting distance, the Cavaliers gave the ball to James and he controlled the game. James scored 27 points in the second half, and 14 in the fourth quarter.</p> \n<p>James now has 123 points in the first three games of the finals series.</p> \n<p>But the game was won with defense on the part of the Cavaliers, and it was about blocking shots and diving for loose balls and putting bodies on bodies. The teams were close in rebounds (the Warriors led 46-43 there), they were equal in turnovers (14), and the Warriors had more assists (21-15). But the Warriors shot just 40% from the field, while the Cavs shot 46%.</p> \n<p>Cavs coach Dave Blatt said afterwards that his team “just a group that plays as hard as they can. We had [the Warriors] broken – they didn’t break. We played the way we wanted to play, and it wasn’t always the best but I’ll take it every day.”</p> \n<p>Blatt also called Dellevedova the “most Cleveland-like Australian you’ll ever seen. If you’re from Cleveland, this blue-collar town, you know exactly what I mean.”</p> \n<p>James said: “It’s great to have someone out on the floor who is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of the team.”</p> \n<p>Andre Iguodala acknowledged that the Warriors had not played well. “Small things are really biting us in the ass,” he said. “Loose balls, they are getting all of them. We’re playing against a very good team that is very underrated.”</p> \n<p>Steve Kerr, the Warriors coach, thought his team lacked something. “Steph never loses confidence. I just thought he lost a little energy, and, I don’t know, life,” he said. “We just need life from everybody, We need emotion from everybody.”</p> \n<p>Game four will be in Cleveland on Thursday.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3b92a96874c02504ee1b0a71ac05763b396b17d6/0_31_1920_1151/1920.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1151,"width":1920,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jason Miller/Getty Images","altText":"LeBron now has 123 points in the first three games of this series.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jason Miller/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/40ffbfe7fd83c7080c52619ac07a34a51981debf/0_47_4710_2825/4710.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2825,"width":4710,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Steph Curry scored 27 points but Golden State’s rally came too late.

Dellavedova has been starting in place of All-Star Kyrie Irving, who broke his kneecap in Game 1 and was just discharged from the Cleveland Clinic following surgery.</p> \n<p>Dellavedova received an IV at Quicken Loans Arena after the game then was taken by ambulance to the hospital for further treatment but says he is feeling better after some rest. “I felt like a pushed the limit a few times,” Dellavedova told ESPN. “That’s the most tired I’ve been. I’m feeling good now, though.”</p> \n<p>There were also concerns about Iman Shumpert’s left shoulder, which he bruised in the first quarter. But Shumpert said he hopes to play in the next game. “I’m all right, this isn’t the regular season,” Shumpert said. “It would take a lot for me not to play, there would have to be structural damage.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457115955__\n</div> \n<p>As is his style, Dellavedova came up with several loose balls in Game 3 by diving on the floor, and he flattened a chair while soaring over Cleveland’s bench while hustling on one play.</p> \n<p>“He’s going to throw his body all over the place,” LeBron James said. “He gave everything’s he’s got.”</p> \n<p>Dellavedova’s medical issues are nothing new to the Cavs, who are playing without Irving and forward Kevin Love. Love is also out for the season after hurting his shoulder in the opening round against Boston.</p> \n<p>Shumpert hurt the same shoulder he dislocated earlier this season that sidelined him for six weeks.</p> \n<p>Shumpert ran into a clean screen set by Golden State’s Draymond Green in the first quarter. He was taken to the locker room for treatment, returned but played with virtually one arm for the rest of the game.</p> \n<p>James said it was inspiring to see Shumpert keep playing.</p> \n<p>“When he came back on the floor with his shoulder wrapped and knowing that he wasn’t at 100%, it means everything to the team,” James said. “It means everything to me. It means everything to him as well. But we just can’t afford any more injuries.

I will document and present the facts as quickly as I can so that Galen and Mo can focus on doing what they love and have worked so hard to achieve.”</p> \n<p>The BBC and ProPublica also claimed that Salazar, who is regarded as the best endurance coach in the business and has worked as a consultant for British Athletics since 2013, is said to have mentored Rupp to help him flout strict rules about using intravenous drips.</p> \n<p>Kara Goucher, the 10,000m world championship bronze medallist who trained at the Oregon Project until 2013, said that Salazar had coached Rupp to try to get a therapeutic use exemption for an intravenous drip before the 2011 world championships. Under Wada rules, such drips are prohibited and anyone caught manipulating the TUE process to get one would be liable for a ban.</p> \n<p>An unnamed athlete also claimed that Salazar told him to get supplemented with testosterone and thyroid when his blood levels were low. That athlete claimed: “I did a blood test at Nike and my thyroid was low and testosterone was low. Dr Loren Myhre [the Nike lab’s head physiologist before he died in 2012] suggested that I go and see an endocrinologist that Alberto and most of the athletes work with, to get testosterone and thyroid.</p> \n<p>“He said: ‘This is what Alberto does. You’ll feel better and you’ll be able to train better’, and so then I said: ‘Well, isn’t that cheating?’ And he goes: ‘Well no, Alberto does it.’”</p> \n<p>The documentary claimed that six other people who were associated with the Oregon Project have spoken privately to the United States Anti-Doping Agency with concerns about alleged illicit practices and unethical behaviour.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/08/mo-farah-ed-warner-uk-athletics-alberto-salazar\">Mo Farah’s blood record to be examined in wake of Alberto Salazar claims</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A former Nike Oregon Project coach, John Cook, while not accusing any athlete directly, has warned that athletics is losing the war on drugs. “I think it’s pretty obvious that drug testing can be circumvented in pretty much every corner,” he told Runners World.</p> \n<p>“The chemists are getting so good that some of the efficacy [of performance-enhancing drugs taken in small doses] can leave [the bloodstream] in less than 90 minutes.

I’ve been turned off pretty much.</p> \n<p>“The average fan remains ignorant in terms of it wanting it be Chariots of Fire. They think if [athletes] test negative, they’re as clean as white snow.

And he is one of the best people to work with that I have ever come across.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/08/mo-farah-ed-warner-uk-athletics-alberto-salazar\">Mo Farah’s blood record to be examined in wake of Alberto Salazar claims</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As Black went on to explain, in the four years that UK Athletics and Salazar’s Nike Oregon Project training group had worked together to polish Farah into the world’s greatest middle-distance runner, there had not been one falling out. “There are more than 10 different people, not just in the same country but across the Atlantic, involved,” he continued when speaking at the IE Sports Analytics Innovation Summit in London. “An eight-hour time difference, five different training bases, constant variable travel and so on. But nobody has ever had a crossed word.</p> \n<p>“The reason why is to do with this: total trust, total belief, total respect. Alberto is so respectful of everyone else in the team, so knowledgeable of their contributions to the ultimate performance of the athlete that it becomes seamless. We have never had a challenge in all of the years we have been working together.”</p> \n<p>They do now. For while Panorama’s allegations about Salazar – and remember, they are only allegations – suggested no wrongdoing on the part of Farah, or anyone involved in UK Athletics, they have inevitably been caught in an almighty backdraft following revelations that Salazar was accused of giving testosterone to Farah’s friend and training partner, Galen Rupp, as a 16-year-old – along with other alleged misdemeanours.</p> \n<p>Did UK Athletics miss any warning signs? Was it tone deaf to the whispers that Salazar might have stretched ethical and moral boundaries in the pursuit of medals? That is what a Performance Oversight Management Group, comprising of the former sprinter Jason Gardener, the sports scientist Dr Sarah Rowell and the former Paralympian Anne Wafula Strike will investigate in the coming weeks.</p> \n<p>As the UK Athletics chief executive, Niels de Vos, explained: “Neil and our head of endurance, Barry Fudge, have the utmost confidence in Alberto. What our audit team is doing is to find that confidence is not misplaced.”</p> \n<p>The group’s terms of reference will be announced shortly. But it would be a surprise if they did not consider whether there has been too cosy a cat’s cradle between Salazar, Nike, Farah and those at the top of UK Athletics.</p> \n<p>Black visits the Nike Oregon Project at least six times a year while Fudge has spent a year out of the past four living and working directly with Farah on a daily basis. Of course that makes absolute sense. Both men will be judged on the basis of the Olympic and world medals they bring, and in the past three major athletics championships – the 2011 and 2013 World Championships and the 2012 Olympics – Farah has won five of Britain’s eight gold medals.</p> \n<p>The change has been staggering. Before Farah moved to the US he hovered just under super-elite level, finishing sixth in the 5,000m at the 2007 world championships and seventh in the same event in 2009. Since then he has won 38 of his 51 races, including five golds and a silver medal at Olympics and world championships. But did the friendships between UK Athletics and Project Oregon lead to Salazar not being as closely scrutinised as he should have been?</p> \n<p>Both Black and Fudge would fiercely deny that, of course. On the surface Black seems easy-going but those close to him insist he is firm and quietly determined. When he was appointed as performance director after London 2012 the former heptathlete Kelly Sotherton said he was “tougher than a conker soaked in vinegar”. Fudge, meanwhile, spent more than three years in Kenya for his PhD looking at the factors leading to the success of elite East African runners and is regarded as one of the sharpest sports scientists in the business. They admire Salazar but they would not roll over for him.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/08/christine-ohuruogu-sides-mo-farah-doping-claims-alberto-salazar\">Christine Ohuruogu sides with Mo Farah amid doping claims over Alberto Salazar</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There are also questions about the due diligence process that took place before Farah joined Salazar in 2011, under UK Athletics’ previous performance director Charles van Commenee and the head of endurance Ian Stewart.</p> \n<p>Especially given that a quick Google search suggests that Salazar appears to have been coaching Mary Decker, who is best remembered in Britain for being tripped by Zola Budd at the 1984 Olympics, when she tested positive for testosterone in 1996.</p> \n<p>UK Athletics’ relationship with Nike will also come under more scrutiny. The ruling body in the UK has never revealed how much its seven-year deal is worth, but reports when it was signed in 2013 suggested a figure of around &pound;15m in cash and ‘value in kind’ of supporting GB kit to athletes – roughly double that of the previous deal with Adidas. That said, it is understood that Nike played no part in UK Athletics’ and Farah’s decision to remain with Salazar.</p> \n<p>There are the deeper ethical concerns over whether British athletes may have been offered thyroid medicine which – while not illegal – may have stretched the elastic boundaries between right and wrong. Many of Salazar’s group have been treated for an under-active thyroid, allowing them to take medicine that may have helped them enhance performance. Some British athletes have said it was suggested they do the same.</p> \n<p>Lisa Dobriskey, who won 1500m bronze at the world championships in 2009, admitted that she was concerned when a UK Athletics doctor suggested she might use thyroid medication to lose weight.</p> \n<p>As she told the Daily Mail last week: “It wasn’t something I wished to pursue because I didn’t feel that I was ill and I was well within the normal range. I don’t agree in taking it as a supplement or performance enhancer, that would be cheating … and for the health side it can be incredibly dangerous.”</p> \n<p>Emma Jackson, an 800m runner, told the Sunday Times that her health had been damaged after a UK Athletics official had recommended her unnecessarily high doses for two years in order to test the performance-enhancing abilities of the medication.</p> \n<p>Their comments beg the obvious question: how many more British distance runners were offered thyroid medication as a performance enhancer?</p> \n<p>While everyone waits for Salazar to hit back at the Panorama claims – a fierce and comprehensive response is expected in the next couple of days – there is at least one thing that all sides can agree on: what Black calls “genius” of the coach has turned Farah into a world beater.</p> \n<p>Whether he might also unfairly tarnish Farah’s reputation remains to be seen.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433785504698/Alberto-Salazar-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Salazar directs Cam Levins, Mo Farah and Galen Rupp during a track session in Oregon.
