The wait is over after a topsy-turvy, tooth-and-nail women’s doubles final in which the 34-year-old Swiss and her partner, India’s Sania Mirza, defeated the formidable Russian pairing of Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina.</p> \n<p>The match started on Centre Court in bright sunshine and finished under the roof and floodlights, two and a half hours later, with Hingis and Mirza finally prevailing 5-7, 7-6, 7-5. Hingis may have won bigger individual prizes but the way that she and Mirza bunny-hopped around the court after coming through match point, finishing with a celebratory arse-bump, suggested that few victories have given her such satisfaction.</p> \n<p>“It feels like it was in another life,” said Hingis, reflecting on those previous titles. “But 17 years, usually you’re lucky to win it once or happy to be out here and play on the Wimbledon grounds. It’s above my expectations.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/sep/05/us-open-martina-hingis-doubles-final-retired-flavia-pennetta\">Martina Hingis reaches US Open doubles final eight years after retiring</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Mirza was making history of her own: she became the first Indian woman to win a grand slam event. “It means everything to be here today,” she said. “To come out at Wimbledon Centre Court and have the whole crowd behind you is pretty incredible. But I think for me, as an Indian, I’m in Little India here. There are so many Indians in England. Thankfully there are a lot of us everywhere, but in England especially I’ve always had amazing support.”</p> \n<p>It was, to be frank, a match that Hingis and Mirza, the No1 seeds, rarely looked like winning. For most of it Makarova and Vesnina, the No2 seeds, were powerful and merciless. Vesnina, who announced each involvement in a rally with a glass-shattering shriek, smashed volleys as if they had personally insulted her, while Makarova served faultlessly, at least until she had to do so to win the match at 5-3 in the final set.</p> \n<p>Doubles tennis, by its nature, is collaborative but it was hard for this final not to be dominated by the narrative of one person with a long, complex history at SW19. Almost inconceivably, Hingis won her first Wimbledon prize, the girls’ singles title, as a precocious 13-year-old in 1994. She first claimed the senior doubles title two years later, aged 15, and then won her one and only singles championship here the following summer. Her last significant victory at Wimbledon came in the women’s doubles in 1998, when she was partnered by Jana Novotna.</p> \n<p>It has certainly been an eventful decade and a half since then. Hingis retired, for the first time, in 2003, aged 22, after a pair of ankle surgeries, first on her right, then her left. She announced she wanted to spend more time horse riding, maybe even patch up an education fractured by an adolescence on the tennis circuit. Hingis returned in 2005, rose to the world’s top 10 again but then <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2008/jan/04/tennis.seaningle\" title=\"\">tested positive for cocaine</a> at Wimbledon in 2007. The amount was minuscule – and she still denies taking anything – but she was banned for two years.</p> \n<p>The third coming of Hingis – “no longer a spring chicken,” as she said recently – has been as a doubles specialist since 2013. And she has clearly lost none of her skill at the net and astute reading of the game: with Flavia Pennetta, she reached the final of the US Open in 2014, losing to Makarova and Vesnina; she then won the mixed doubles final of this year’s Australian Open with India’s Leander Paes.</p> \n<p>“I had one comeback when I came back in singles, now another one in doubles,” said Hingis. “I always believed in it. Without that you can’t come out here and play and compete at this level. I always felt like I had one of the best volleys in the world, one of the best backhands in the world, so you got to believe in something if you want to win.”</p> \n<p>Hingis, who was obviously drained by a long fortnight at Wimbledon, will be reunited with Paes on Sunday afternoon in the mixed doubles final against Austria’s Alexander Peya and Hungary’s Timea Babos. One of the most unexpected stories in tennis is set to have another chapter.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436650763006/Martina-Hingis-left-and-S-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Martina Hingis, left, and Sania Mirza celebrate with their women's doubles trophies after winning against Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina.

Watch Broad from afar enough times and you start to see the signs, little hints that England’s streakiest, delicately engineered, match-winning new ball bowler could be about to clank into high gear.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/england-win-ashes-opener-as-stuart-broad-breaks-australias-top-order\">England win Ashes opener as Stuart Broad breaks Australia’s top order</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For a long-time England observer the feeling can be similar to watching one of your own offspring in action. You get to know – or at least imagine that you know – the ticks and tells, each little gathering hint of spring and snap that suggests the rifle sights narrowing, torpedoes locked in, the force beginning to crackle.</p> \n<p>On a day of passing cloud and tepid high summer heat, Broad bowled with wonderful urgency and precision, in the process turning this first Test decisively England’s way. There is an ease to his approach at his best, this great slender conifer of a man leaning forward at first, ears pinned back, then gradually, almost bashfully unfurling himself to his full height at the point of delivery. Not so much a wrecking ball, he was instead a relentless, suffocating presence running in from the Cathedral Road end.</p> \n<p>Broad bowled fast and full here, finding enough nip and bounce in the fourth-day pitch to discomfit every batsman who faced him. The first hour brought him the wicket of Chris Rogers, caught by Ian Bell at second slip as Australia lost their first wicket at 19.</p> \n<p>Most compelling of all was Broad’s duel with David Warner, a pedigree attacking opener but a man in need not just of a way into this series, but of a start in England, a method of playing in a country where he averages 22 after six Tests, against 46 elsewhere. England won here in part because they batted with new-found brio and aggression. But also because of the same-old same-old, England’s most prolific fast-bowling pair performing as required in occasionally helpful conditions. That it was Broad rather than Jimmy Anderson who produced the decisive spell on day four might have come as a surprise to some.</p> \n<p>Only Broad will know for sure if he really was irritated by the pre-series talk of Australia’s greater fast bowling hand, a strength offset, the assumption was, by the presence of Anderson. Broad barely got a mention in the previews, despite that going back to March 2013 his record reads 120 wickets at 26 with seven five-fors, just about edging Anderson’s own 118 at 27 with five five-wicket hauls.</p> \n<p>This is not to downplay Anderson’s influence here. Between them in the first two hours, England’s new-ball pair produced a sublime, high-pressure period of sustained accuracy from around and over the wicket that, while it didn’t quite skittle the Australian top order, established a hand on the throat that was never relaxed.</p> \n<p>With the crowd still fluttering into place Anderson produced an in-ducker with the second ball of the day that hit Rogers square in what we might perhaps now call the Alastairs. Rogers grinned and walked it off. Ten minutes of leave-and-prod later he was dropped by Joe Root off Anderson in a close third slip position. It was, though, the action at the other end that defined the morning’s play, and which will perhaps leave the greatest impression on the rest of the series. Either way Broad versus Warner was box office.</p> \n<p>First Warner was beaten by a full ball that seamed away, inducing a spasm of a short-arm drive, the batsman playing the line then furiously reeling his hands back in. A shorter ball zipped past a narrow defensive prod. Then Warner was struck on the pad, producing an appeal from Broad that while loud and prolonged, was still a little short of the full jazz-hands. To his credit Warner stuck at his methods, playing not just late but too late at times, staying compact at the crease and enjoying a little good fortune too.</p> \n<p>He is not just a fine batsman but a fascinating one, Australia’s frontiersman of the new world and a player who for all his runs, his uncluttered method and his thrilling talent is still learning this longer game on the job.</p> \n<p>If Warner was to provide a match-turning hundred here it would simply arrive in the flow of things, incidental to the unchanging methods of a man who seems to keep playing the same, unceasing innings across every format, offering not a selection of gears and modes but another draught whatever the weather of pure unadulterated David Warner.</p> \n<p>He spent 23 balls toying with the idea of playing like a Test opener in England, scoring one run in the process and hanging in against three straight maidens from Broad. In all Broad beat Warner’s outside edge eight times through a combination of nip, bounce and simple accuracy.</p> \n<p>In between times Broad fielded at close funky-mid-off for his new-ball partner, diving full length to take a bunted drive from Warner almost hand in hand with the bowler, a move completed with a mutual pat of the rump, confirming the impression of two bowlers working, as was said of Braque and Picasso, “like two men roped together on a mountain”.</p> \n<p>Warner fought on, reaching 50 off 72 balls, with six fours and one six, periodically stretching out to thrash or pummel a loose ball to the fence, crouched very deep in his crease, reminiscent at times of Gary Ballance’s much more frightening Australian cousin.</p> \n<p>Mark Wood bowled well, producing some genuine skimming pace off that somersaulting tumbler’s run-up. But it was Moeen Ali who finally got Warner just before lunch with a straight ball that scuttled into his pads.</p> \n<p>Broad returned after lunch to remove Australia’s captain and vice-captain. His three wickets for 39 might easily have been five.</p> \n<p>More encouraging for England will be the unrelenting skill and urgency of their senior fast bowlers; not quite the pace like fire of the last Ashes series, but a more carefully-wrought, English-style destruction through high-pressure movement and accuracy that Australia must now look to counter.</p> \n<p><strong>Most wickets in fourth innings in winning Tests for England </strong></p> \n<p><strong>37 at 20.91 </strong>Stuart Broad</p> \n<p><strong>36 at 24.22</strong> Jimmy Anderson</p> \n<p><strong>35 at 15.77</strong> Bob Willis</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436641805405/Stuart-Broad-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Stuart Broad celebrates with Jos Buttler after the dismissal of Steven Smith.

In May 2014 Keyte passed the club for &pound;2 to an east London property developer, Tommy Agombar, whom fans discovered to be not “fit and proper” having been convicted of lorry theft and spent time in prison.</p> \n<p>During a fractious and occasionally deeply unpleasant period the club was passed to a company, Alpha Finance, specialising in “distressed debt,” and the most public director became Andrew Lonsdale, a partner of Agombar’s with a patchy record himself. Bankrupt in 2007, disqualified in 2006 from acting as a company director for six years, convicted in 2008 of illegal waste dumping, Lonsdale as the owner of Feltham FC had moved the club out of its arena then dumped five times more than the permitted quantity of soil and rubble on it, and it fell derelict.</p> \n<p>Although Lonsdale and his partners insisted they wanted to revive Hereford, supporters who had dug up all that baggage opposed them absolutely, foresaw that their club might collapse and that the future lay in a fresh start. After repeated adjournments of the winding-up petition, in December Hereford United’s time ran out when Lonsdale failed to produce a required &pound;1m proof of funding, complaining he was stuck in traffic on the way to court.</p> \n<p>HUST, which had already prepared plans to form their own club, greeted the liquidation with a promise to rebuild, which they have eagerly fulfilled. The Edgar Street ground, site of Radford’s goal and the landmark scenes of delirious boys in parkas swarming on to the pitch, is owned by Herefordshire county council, which repossessed it after the club was liquidated.</p> \n<p>In February, two months after the liquidation, <a href=\"http://newsroom.herefordshire.gov.uk/2015/february/council-announces-a-lease-for-edgar-street.aspx\">the council agreed a lease with the new club</a>, thereby fulfilling its own promise to ensure Edgar Street would remain a home for football. The fans, living their dream of owning and running their club after the years of indignity, found the ground itself a rackety distance from being a field of dreams. Decay, disrepair, dodgy electrics and asbestos meant around &pound;200,000 was needed to restore it to safety and decency, so the trust did a deal with four local people, described as “benefactors”, who funded the works.</p> \n<p>Watson says the trust willingly agreed to this dilution of the original plan for complete supporter ownership and that, although the benefactors want to remain unnamed publicly, he is confident they are long-term supporters who have financially assisted in the past. For their &pound;200,000 the benefactors are currently majority owners. The trust has put in &pound;25,000 so far, with fundraising amassing the best part of a further &pound;25,000, and the supporters hope ultimately to raise &pound;200,000 and own an equal 50% stake.</p> \n<p>“We are comfortable with this because of the people the benefactors are,” Watson says. “To have them in a more formalised role is actually comforting. We haven’t run a club before and they have bucket loads of experience we can call on.”</p> \n<p>The board will have three elected trust representatives on it, alongside four appointments by the benefactors, under the chairman, Jon Hale.</p> \n<p>The match with supporter-owned FC United of Manchester, now of Conference North, was arranged after Hereford’s head of volunteering, Ken Kinnersley, inquired how FCUM organise their famed battalions of volunteers. Peter Beadle, Hereford’s newly appointed manager, used the FC United game and a friendly last week against Malvern to assess more local triallists to add to only seven signings at that point.</p> \n<p>“The support has been amazing,” Beadle said. “It shows how passionate people are here and how important football is to people in Hereford. Our job is to aim to be successful but to run the club properly, sustainably, so they never again end up in the position they were last year – and ensure there will always be a Hereford football club.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436688547450/be759546-02cc-4f7a-9919-5af149418d34-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andy Hall for the Observer","altText":"FC United put pressure on the Hereford defence at Edgar Street.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-11T19:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-12T08:09:51Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":43,"contributors":[{"name":"David Conn","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733736896/DavidConn.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/davidconn"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Hereford","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/hereford","webTitle":"Hereford"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"David Conn","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/davidconn"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/11/hereford-fc-rose-from-ashes","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ahy8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jul/11/hereford-fc-rose-from-ashes","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/11/hereford-fc-rose-from-ashes"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436688547450/be759546-02cc-4f7a-9919-5af149418d34-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"FC United put pressure on the Hereford defence at Edgar Street.

Recent history suggests that planning is wise. The last four winners of the Claret Jug have featured on one of the European Tour’s most prominent events on the previous weekend. Golfers take note of such trends.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/11/jordan-spieth-all-american-hero-golfing-greatness-the-open\">Jordan Spieth: the all-American hero predestined for golfing greatness | Ewan Murray</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Phil Mickelson is one of that group, having triumphed at Castle Stuart in 2013 and proceeded to win the Open for the first time, at Muirfield. Mickelson had bemoaned his putting struggles during days one and two this time around but was more content on Saturdayyesterday, despite a level par 70 providing his worst score of the tournament. It was also noticeably calm; Mickelson’s round over the links at Gullane featured 16 pars.</p> \n<p>“I had a nice day,” he said. “And my putting was much improved on the first two days. That was pleasing, especially as the wind was blowing more than it has been. So it was a good test. I didn’t really do much wrong, but I didn’t really do much great either.</p> \n<p>“One birdie and one bogey is not exactly what I’m known for. But my ball striking wasn’t as good as it’s been. That was the big reason why I didn’t make many birdies. I was never really close enough to give me a chance to make that happen. I was making putts for pars. This has been great preparation for next week’s Open at St Andrews, though.”</p> \n<p>At three under, Mickelson almost certainly will not win. Yet there is still hope of a high-profile winner, with Rickie Fowler once again endorsing his love for the links. Fowler carded 66 for a 10 under aggregate. In what is a tightly-packed leaderboard, a sprint finish looks inevitable.</p> \n<p>The most striking round of the day came from the Frenchman Rapha&euml;l Jacquelin, who signed for a 64, defying testing conditions. At 11 under, Jacquelin has not dropped a shot in his last 27 holes here. Going into the final day, he is one behind the leader, Basildon’s Daniel Brooks.</p> \n<p>There remains hope of a home winner, with the Florida-based Scot Russell Knox carding 66 to move to nine under par. Knox is seeking to round off one of his better weeks, after earning an Open Championship place from first reserve because of Rory McIlroy’s enforced withdrawal. “This means everything,” Knox said. “Golf is hard. We all know that. In this game, to be a pro is a dream come true and getting to play in my home Open is unbelievable. To play well is just a huge bonus.</p> \n<p>“Growing up and playing links golf, I can cut it through the wind pretty easily. So just a little more breeze really benefits me.”</p> \n<p>There was a strange tale of woe for the highly-rated American Ryder Cup player Jimmy Walker, though. Walker collapsed completely in returning a round of 78. He had opened the tournament with a 65. The young Englishman Matthew Fitzpatrick matched Walker’s dismal score, having started promisingly with back-to-back 67s.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436654002408/Phil-Mickelson-on-the-1st-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Phil Mickelson on the 1st during the third round of the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open at Gullane.

Woods, in fact, knew of McIlroy’s woe days before it was revealed to the public.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/rory-mcilroy-the-open-ankle-injury-playing-football\" title=\"\">McIlroy ruptured left ankle ligaments</a> during a kickabout with friends on the outskirts of Belfast last Saturday. No timescale has been placed on the 26-year-old’s return to competitive golf but he will be the notable absentee when the 144th Open begins at St Andrews. His ability to defend the US PGA Championship next month is, for now, in doubt.</p> \n<p>Woods took to the Old Course on Saturday, where he disclosed McIlroy had been in immediate contact. The 14-times major winner’s career has been hampered by serious injury in the past.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/rory-mcilroy\">Rory McIlroy pulls out of Open title defence at St Andrews through injury</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“He sent me a photo the day he did it,” Woods told ESPN.</p> \n<p>“We talked about it for a little bit. He said: ‘You’ve been through a lot of injuries over the years.’ So he picked my brain a little bit. We had a good talk.</p> \n<p>“He’s doing the right thing, taking care of his body first before he gets back out here. No doubt he’s frustrated that he’s not going to be able to play in the Open Championship, especially here at St Andrews. And how well he’s been playing of late, and this golf course really does set up well for him, too.</p> \n<p>“That’s the way it goes. We all get injured at one point in time. Sometimes it’s through the sport or sometimes it’s through fun activities. You just never know.”</p> \n<p>Woods insists his own game is well placed to compete for the Claret Jug, despite a major drought which has stretched to more than seven years. Woods has not won an Open since 2006 but other strands of history are on his side; he won by eight and five shots respectively when St Andrews hosted the third major of the year in 2000 and 2005.</p> \n<p>“This is my favourite course on earth,” he insisted. “I love it. And just to return here with all the memories I have, it never gets old. I love coming back. All the memories come rushing back.”</p> \n<p>This time around, he admitted to surprise over course conditions which are unusual for links in summer. “I was shocked,” Woods explained. “I had seen photos of it a month ago. It was bone dry. It looked like it was going to be one of those dust bowls again; hard, fast, like the years I’ve played St Andrews. It’s changed. They got big rain and a lot of sun. It’s totally changed.</p> \n<p>“I’m going to have to do a little bit of feel around the greens, my putting. I wasn’t expecting the firmness to be that soft. We made ball marks on the greens. I don’t ever remember making ball marks around this place.”</p> \n<p>Woods spent half an hour offering range advice to, and played the closing three Old Course holes, with a group of five specially selected teenage amateur players.</p> \n<p>The golfer’s main sponsor, Nike, was behind the scene which saw a crowd quickly swell to around 300 by the time the group appeared on the 18th.</p> \n<p>Afterwards, Woods reaffirmed the confidence he exuded after he closed with a bogey-free 67 at the Greenbrier Classic last Sunday.</p> \n<p>Prior to that, his year had been one marked only by struggles, including at the US Open where he missed the cut at an aggregate of 16 over par after rounds of 80 and 76.</p> \n<p>“I feel good,” he said. “Sunday at Greenbrier is probably the best I hit it in two years. That was fun.</p> \n<p>“It sounds crazy when I told everyone at Greenbrier that I felt close, after the scores I shot at the Memorial and the US Open, I just didn’t quite have the feel yet. I shifted the baseline so much I just didn’t quite have the feel yet.</p> \n<p>“I put it together at Greenbrier and hit it really good. [Woods’s coach] Chris [Como] told me it was the first time I led the field in proximity to the hole with my iron game.</p> \n<p>“I feel like everything’s coming around. I still need to get a feel for how this golf course is chasing. I wasn’t expecting it to be this soft.</p> \n<p>“The shot selections I was working on last week and some of the trajectories I was envisioning on certain holes and certain winds and the ball chasing and what I need to do to make it move on the ground. It’s going to be different. It’s going to be more forced carries than I was expecting coming into the event.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436637995167/Rory-McIlroy-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rory McIlroy with the Claret Jug after winning the Open last year.

Unlike Brian, who returned home to Australia after two previous spells in England with Hull and Bradford, Tony has remained in the country ever since taking charge at Huddersfield in 2000. He even became a British citizen in 2008.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/warrington-sims-leeds-hardaker-banned-one-game\">Warrington’s Ashton Sims and Leeds’ Zak Hardaker banned for one game</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tony, younger by 13 years, grew up watching Brian coach on television in the 1980s, before playing under him and then becoming his assistant before branching out as a coach on his own.</p> \n<p>When Tony’s Warrington take on Brian’s Wakefield – the first meeting between the sides marked probably the lowest point of the season for Wakefield as they capitulated 80-0 at the Halliwell Jones Stadium in April – their parents are expected to tune into the game from their house in Maclean, a small town near Australia’s Northern Rivers.</p> \n<p>Tony does not hide the fact that he idolised his brother. “He left home when I was starting school to go to Sydney,” he says. “We’re 13 years apart so I’d only see him once or twice a year, up until when I went to play for Illawarra when he was head coach. I didn’t know him much, but I idolised my brother.</p> \n<p>“As a little boy you loved all rugby league players, and he played for a couple of teams and then went on to coaching. I looked up to him in my adolescence and then I had the opportunity to play at Illawarra with him. I joined up with him a few years later again at St George and played under him there, and a few years after I’d retired I joined up with him as a coach at Parramatta.</p> \n<p>“I’ve worked with him in three blocks throughout my life and learnt a whole lot, mostly of how to do things well.”</p> \n<p>Brian is equally complimentary of Tony, who has won every domestic honour in the English game during spells with Leeds and Warrington – but was quick to try and cool the furore surrounding Sunday’s meeting. “Neither Tony or I am going to play in this game,” he says. “I understand it’s a story because we have the same parentage, but we’ve got jobs to do.</p> \n<p>“Tony’s career is a tremendous coaching success story. He lost his first 15 games at Huddersfield but look at what he’s gone on to achieve. His dedication and toughness is tremendous. The fact he’s my younger brother makes me immensely proud. He’s done a great job everywhere he’s gone, which shows he’s a phenomenal coach.”</p> \n<p>As for Tony’s view on the fanfare? “I understand the interest in it – it’s pretty unique in world sport and it’s not a common occurrence. But if my team wins I won’t be punching the air because I’ve beaten Brian Smith and I consider myself a better coach than him though – that’s not how it works.”</p> \n<p>Yet despite their firm stance on the matter, you get the feeling there will be plenty of sibling rivalry floating around come kick-off.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436572047190/Warringtons-coach-Tony-Sm-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Warrington's coach Tony Smith has never faced his brother Brian's team before this weekend.
