Woods won the last of his 14 majors, the US Open, in 2008 and has arrived in St Andrews for this week’s Open having not lifted the Claret Jug since 2006. A once dominant figure, Woods is now a rank outsider with bookmakers for golf’s biggest events.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/rory-mcilroy-tiger-woods-rupturing-ankle-the-open-us-pga\">Rory McIlroy sought advice from Tiger Woods after rupturing ankle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A routine Woods motivator, though, is proving people wrong. When asked if he accepts the Nicklaus target looks a step too far, the 39-year-old Woods replied: “No, not at all. I’m still young. I’m not 40 yet.</p> \n<p>“I know some of you guys think I’m buried and done but I’m still right here in front of you. I love playing, I love competing and I love playing these events.</p> \n<p>“I’m always nervous. That first tee shot, I’m nervous. I care about what I do and when I’m not nervous is the day I quit. That means I really don’t care what I’m doing out there. I want to feel the rush, I want to feel the nerves. It’s just a matter of how do you handle it. I think I’ve done a pretty good job over my career of handling it and winning events here and there. I just enjoy playing tournament golf and I enjoy competing at the highest level against the best players in the world. It’s exciting for me to get up there on that first tee knowing that it’s time to go, and let’s try and go beat these guys.”</p> \n<p>Woods was equally bold when pressed on whether he had ever contemplated quitting since early 2014, when he underwent nerve surgery and suffered a subsequent and serious dip in form.</p> \n<p>“Well, retirement? I don’t have any AARP [Association of American Retired People] card yet, so I’m a long way from that,” Woods added. “I feel like my body is finally healed up from the surgery. They say it takes you about four to six months to get back but I’ve heard a lot of guys on Tour who have had the surgery, and other athletes, say it takes over a year to get back. I think they were probably closer to being right, it being a full year to get back.</p> \n<p>“It would have been one thing if I would have gone through the procedure and then had the same golf swing, but I’ve changed the golf swing, too, on top of that, and so that was kind of a double dipper there where I had to fight both at the same time.</p> \n<p>“I’m hitting the ball much, much more solid. I’m controlling my flights. I am coming in here being able to shape the golf ball not only both ways but also having changed my trajectories, as well, and being very comfortable changing my trajectories. That’s something that I feel you have to do here on this golf course.</p> \n<p>“The previous majors [last year] were a little bit more difficult. I was still learning a new golf swing. Last year coming off surgery on my back and trying to get back and trying to get my feel back, meanwhile trying to make <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/16/tiger-woods-swing-changes-committed-winning-majors\" title=\"\">a swing change</a> all at the same time, was very difficult. I had some pretty apparent flaws in my technique. That’s one of the reasons why I shut it down and consequently I was able to turn things around. I had a chance to win the Masters this year.”</p> \n<p>The eventual <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/13/jordan-spieth-masters-augusta-justin-rose-phil-mickelson\" title=\"\">and runaway victor at Augusta</a>, Jordan Spieth, arrived at the Old Course on Monday having never sampled the Fife links in a competitive round. Part of Spieth’s Open buildup involved playing the venue on a simulator in his home. Woods, however, hinted at the drawbacks of such preparation.</p> \n<p>“He’s playing well, obviously,” said Woods of Spieth. “He’s won two major championships and just <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/13/jordan-spieth-j-deere-classic-open\" title=\"\">won [the John Deere Classic] last week</a>. Obviously he’s in great form. It’s just a matter of going out there and executing his gameplan.</p> \n<p>That’s what he talks about a lot, formulating a gameplan and executing it, and this is a golf course in which you have to do that.</p> \n<p>“It’s about understanding how to play the golf course under various winds. You can see the golf course on a simulator and it’s fantastic. I’ve seen it. But playing in the different winds and having to hit the different shots, shaping shots completely differently from one day to the next on the same hole, it does help seeing the golf course under different winds. This is my fifth Open here, I’ve seen a lot of different winds.”</p> \n<p>Of St Andrews, Woods added: “Obviously it’s the home of golf, we all know that. But to me it’s brilliant, how you can play it so many different ways. I’ve always wanted to play it backwards, one time before I die. I want to play from 1 to 17, 2 to 16, so forth and so on. I think that would be just a blast because I can see how certain bunkers – why would they put that there? And then if you play it backwards, you see it. It’s very apparent. That’s totally in play. That one day would be a lot of fun to be able to do.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/13/jordan-spieth-open-2015-sir-nick-faldo-st-andrews\">Jordan Spieth’s ‘high golfing IQ’ key at Open 2015, says Nick Faldo</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436876115628/f59ebbc4-65ba-4cd6-bb2e-0f6201990bff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christer Hoeglund/EPA","altText":"Tiger Woods during a press conference at St Andrews on Tuesday.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Christer Hoeglund/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-14T11:04:49Z","lastModified":"2015-07-15T00:00:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ewan Murray","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/26/1401131130466/Ewan-Murray-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ewanmurray"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Tiger Woods","The Open 2015","The Open","Golf","Sport","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/tigerwoods","webTitle":"Tiger Woods"},{"id":"sport/the-open-2015","webTitle":"The Open 2015"},{"id":"sport/theopen","webTitle":"The Open"},{"id":"sport/golf","webTitle":"Golf"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ewan Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ewanmurray"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/14/tiger-woods-play-old-course-backwards-open","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ajyg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/14/tiger-woods-play-old-course-backwards-open","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/14/tiger-woods-play-old-course-backwards-open"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-457493843","source":"SNTV","durationInSeconds":56,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/14/150714TigerWoods.m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/14/150714TigerWoods_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/14/1436886025093/KP_354338_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Tiger Woods feeling confident ahead of St Andrews - video","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Tiger Woods feeling confident ahead of St Andrews - video","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Tiger Woods feeling confident ahead of St Andrews - video"}}},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"Golf"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[{"title":"Golf / García declares that British crowds are the best in the world","rawTitle":"García declares that British crowds are the best in the world","item":{"type":"article","id":"sport/2015/jul/14/open-2015-sergio-garcia-british-crowds-best-world","title":"The Open 2015: Sergio García declares British crowds are world’s best","trailText":"Sergio García, searching for his first major title, has described his joy at playing at the Open and how he relishes being in front of British crowds who carry him ‘in the palm of their hand’","standFirst":"<span class=\"bullet\">•</span> World No10 insists fans ‘carry him in the palm of their hand’\n<br />\n<span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Spaniard called it ‘sad’ that others can cheer against players","byline":"James Riach at St Andrews","body":"<p>Sergio Garc&iacute;a believes British crowds at the Open are the best in the world and criticised those spectators elsewhere who make noise against players to put them off.</p> \n<p>Garc&iacute;a was the subject of vociferous heckling at the Players Championship earlier this year at Sawgrass, a tournament where he <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/11/rickie-fowler-holds-nerve-win-playoff-players-championship\" title=\"\">lost out in a play-off to Rickie Fowler</a>. Sympathy for the Spaniard is sometimes absent in America, following controversial remarks two years ago that he would invite Tiger Woods to dinner and serve him “fried chicken”.</p> \n<p>The world No10, searching for his first major title, described his joy at playing the Open and how he relished being in front of British crowds who carry him “in the palm of their hand”.</p> \n<p>“I’ve always said it – and it’s not just for me – that the British crowds are the best anywhere,” said Garc&iacute;a. “I understand if you are a European playing in the US trying to win a tournament against one of their favourite Americans, there is always going to be people that try to make it tougher on you.</p> \n<p>“It’s sad but it’s normal. Personally, I think in golf I’m all for cheering for someone as hard as you can but cheering against them doesn’t seem right.</p> \n<p>“I’ve always been very thankful for the way the British crowds have treated me. They have always been amazing. They’ve always carried me in the palm of their hand. I don’t know what I did but I’m glad I did it and that’s one of the reasons why I love the Open so much.”</p> \n<p>Garc&iacute;a, 35, came close to victory at Carnoustie in 2007 but eventually lost a play-off against P&aacute;draig Harrington.

It is special. It is just amazing. I’ve always said that this is the best championship we have in golf, no doubt about it – for everything it means and everything it stands for.</p> \n<p>“It would be amazing to win it. Put it this way, if I could stand here and say I could only win one tournament for the rest of my life, I would obviously choose the Open.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436909353778/Sergio-Garcia-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sergio García pumps his fist during the third round of the Players Championship but eventually lost in the play-off to Rickie Fowler.

Treve, the winner for the past two seasons, and Golden Horn, an outstanding Derby winner, are among Erupt’s possible opponents on the first Sunday in October but he remains unbeaten after four starts and showed courage as well as class to win at Group One level for the first time.</p> \n<p>Golden Horn’s Derby form was represented by Storm The Stars, who was third home at Epsom, in Tuesday’s race, which is the most prestigious 12-furlong prize for three-year-olds in the French calendar. Balios, an impressive winner of the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot, was also in the field, along with Ampere, unbeaten in two starts for Andr&eacute; Fabre.</p> \n<p>It was the two unbeaten colts who emerged in front. Ampere could probably have finished closer than the two lengths that separated him from Erupt at the line had Micka&euml;l Barzalona, his jockey, not been forced to wait for running room as the winner came past him approaching the final furlong. Yet if Erupt got first run on Ampere, he more than made the most of it and stayed on strongly to ensure that the race did not become a battle to the line.</p> \n<p>Erupt was saddled by Francis-Henri Graffard, who was recording his first success in a thoroughbred Group One. A former assistant to Alain de Royer-Dupr&eacute;, he left to train on his own account in the autumn of 2011 and has already attracted several leading owners including the Niarchos family, whose silks were aboard Erupt. The winner was quoted at around 16-1 for the Arc by British bookmakers immediately after the race and there was never any doubt that it would be named as the colt’s principal target this autumn.</p> \n<p>“The [Prix] Niel [on Arc trials day in September] and the Arc,” Alan Cooper, racing manager to the Niarchos family, said afterwards. “We always thought he was a nice horse in the making and he’s bred on the dam’s side to get a mile and a half while Dubawi is an excellent sire. He’s won on very fast ground at Chantilly and it was fast at Lyon when he won a Listed race there. Today it was good safe ground but soft ground will help him.”</p> \n<p>Storm The Stars came out narrowly in front in a blanket finish for third, ahead of Silverware and Balios, while Archangel Raphael, ridden by Joseph O’Brien for his father Aidan, dropped out to finish last after setting a steady early pace.</p> \n<p>Maureen Haggas, representing her husband William, the trainer of Storm The Stars, was as positive as possible after seeing the colt finish placed in a Group One for the third time in a row without ever looking a likely winner.</p> \n<p>“He’s probably not run quite up to his previous form. He’s not the easiest and it’s difficult here with lots of horses everywhere, including fillies,” Haggas said. “His mind wasn’t quite on the job and he didn’t enjoy the parade much but he’s still been third in a Group One so we can’t be too downhearted. We’ll give him a bit of a break now and maybe come back for York or the Leger. He’s had a lot of racing but he’s tough and he’s taken it and this was too good an opportunity to turn down.”</p> \n<p>Balios finished with a cut on his right foreleg while David Simcock, his trainer, was frustrated that the race had turned into a sprint in the straight.</p> \n<p>“It was a messy race for him, very stop-start and it turned into a sprint, but at the same time he’s run well,” Simcock said. “He’s right on the tail of the Derby third, so no complaints, there’ll be races that suit him better.”</p> \n<p>The Grand Prix de Paris dates back to 1863 and was the most important event in the French racing calendar for more than half a century until the inauguration of the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in the 1920s. Its distance has varied over the years, from around 15 furlongs for much of its existence to 10 furlongs in the late 1980s, before settling at 12 furlongs in 2005, the same year that the French Derby was cut from 12 furlongs to 10. As a result, it is a ideal target for impeccably bred middle-distance colts that are not ready in time for the Classics in May but will be reaching a peak in October.</p> \n<p>Rail Link, who was the 9th of 13 winners of this race for Andre Fabre back in 2006, was the last colt to win both the Grand Prix de Paris and the Arc, but 16-1 is a fair price about Erupt at this stage while Ampere too could yet enter the reckoning. Ampere received an odd ride given the steady early pace, settled four or five lengths off the lead by Barzalona, and the race was as good as over by the time he was able to set off after the winner in the final furlong.</p> \n<p>A crowd of a few thousand was scattered around the grand expanse of the racecourse in the Bois de Boulogne for the last running of the Grand Prix at the course in its current incarnation. The bulldozers are due to arrive on 5 October, the day after the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, to begin a major redevelopment, which will see many of France’s major events moved elsewhere in 2016.</p> \n<p>The Poule d’Essai des Poulains and the Poule d’Essai des Pouliches, France’s equivalent of the 2,000 Guineas and 1,000 Guineas respectively, will be run at Deauville next year, while the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe is booked in for Chantilly, France’s main training centre, a 40-minute train ride from the Gare du Nord. A new location for the most historic race of all, however, has yet to be decided.</p> \n<p>Curvy, the winner of the Ribblesdale Stakes at Royal Ascot, is the new ante-post favourite for the Darley Irish Oaks at The Curragh on Sunday after she was added to the field at the supplementary stage on Tuesday by David Wachman, her trainer.</p> \n<p>Covert Love, who has won three times for Hugo Palmer this season including a Listed event at Newcastle last month, was also supplemented for the Classic, but Aidan O’Brien’s Diamondsandrubies, who had been expected to start favourite after winning the Pretty Polly Stakes, was not among the 16 fillies still engaged at the five-day stage.</p> \n<p>O’Brien is still responsible for seven of the possible runners, including Qualify, the winner of the Oaks at Epsom, Words and Together Forever. Words, a daughter of Dansili out of the 2008 Irish Oaks winner Moonstone, beat a field that included Qualify when successful on her debut in a maiden at The Curragh last June and also won her only subsequent start, a Group Three event at Cork last month.</p> \n<p>Other possible runners from Britain include Forte (trained by Ralph Beckett), Gretchen (John Gosden) and Speeding Boarding (James Fanshawe).</p> \n<p>Curvy is top-priced at 5-2, ahead of Words on 7-2 and Pleascach, the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner, on 7-1. Qualify is a 9-1 chance with Covert Love next at 10-1 and it is 12-1 bar.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, French jockey Olivier Peslier will be on board Telescope in the King George VI And Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on July 25.</p> \n<p>The Sir Michael Stoute-trained five-year-old has been partnered by Ryan Moore on 12 of his 14 career starts but the rider is on the sidelines after a stalls incident at Newmarket last week.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.highclereracing.co.uk/news\" title=\"\">A statement on the Highclere website</a> posted on Tuesday read: “Sir Michael Stoute has confirmed that Telescope will have the King George VI And Queen Elizabeth Stakes as his next target.</p> \n<p>“Telescope is a very strong travelling horse and needs a proper Group One pace to be at his very best, so hopefully with the King George hotting up with entries such as Golden Horn, this year’s contest will be a truly-run race.</p> \n<p>“Golden Horn has shown himself to be head and shoulders above all his rivals so far this season, winning the Dante, Derby and Eclipse, but Telescope has been knocking on the door in Group One company for a while and heads to Ascot with as a good a chance as he had last year.

Last season’s match between Middlesex and Sussex was completely washed out but, thanks to a lively pitch and some inventive captaincy from Middlesex’s James Franklin, 236.5 proved enough overs to take this game to the wire.</p> \n<p>After a washed-out Monday and overnight rain, followed by an early-morning downpour and lunchtime drizzle (that gobbled up 22 more overs), a result – with 22 wickets standing – should have been beyond even the most willing captains and generous batsmen.</p> \n<p>As it was, with an excellent Nick Compton catch off a skied Tim Groenewald drive and Eoin Morgan’s smart run out of Michael Bates, Middlesex docked Somerset’s tail quickly and the game was moving. That they then defied the pitch to rock along at a rate in excess of 4.5 an over either side of that stoppage (which was elongated by light and logistical issues – lunch was not ready) to set Somerset a target of 219 in 40 overs, said plenty for their enterprise.</p> \n<p>A fluctuating final session followed, without the dreaded – and once near-inevitable – early handshake. Middlesex came up three wickets short but only when Jim Allenby – the sixth wicket – departed did Somerset look truly buried.</p> \n<p>With a first-innings lead of 86, Middlesex bristled with intent. Both openers fell to beauties; Sam Robson feathered an inside edge off Groenewald and Joe Burns nicked Peter Trego to second slip.</p> \n<p>Then the rain came and hope abated before Jamie Overton chopped Dawid Malan in half with a wondrous yorker and forced Nick Compton – immediately after taking 13 from a Trego over – to edge to slip. Bowling with fearsome pace down the hill, Overton softened up Morgan, who nicked Trego to slip for a sorry pair.</p> \n<p>Franklin’s own heave-ho preceded his declaration, which dangled just enough before Somerset to tempt a chase. And as Marcus Trescothick compiled a second 50 and James Hildreth sent the otherwise excellent Tim Murtagh for four fours in an over, it looked possible. Such was their belief, Somerset sent Overton in to pinch-hit.</p> \n<p>Wickets continued to fall but not quite regularly enough for Middlesex. When Overton skied to James Harris, they needed five in 10 overs; when Jim Allenby was caught brilliantly by Morgan at deep point, four from 7.5; when Robson snaffled Trego as the third of six slips, three from three. Alas Bates and Groenewald, the pair who had started the day 19 wickets earlier, were there at the end, stoically raging against the dying light, with more rain falling.

Within four overs from the Lumley end he had removed the hosts’ best three batsmen Mark Stoneman, Paul Collingwood and Scott Borthwick. Durham were nine for four and no longer dictating terms.</p> \n<p>When the 26-year-old incurred the first of his 2015 injury problems – a stress reaction in his foot followed by a meniscal tear in his left knee – he held an England place across all three formats. So it has been with mixed feelings that he has witnessed the exploits of the national team this summer.</p> \n<p>Here, having sent down 13 overs on day one after coming on second change, he took the opportunity to impress the national selector, James Whitaker, with some high-class swing and seam, albeit in helpful conditions. One of three morning wickets to fall as Durham secured a 116-run lead on first innings, Woakes dispatched Stoneman with a delivery of extra bounce, had an aggrieved Collingwood lbw and then jagged one sharply across Borthwick.</p> \n<p>Woakes said: “Coming through everything with no problems is the main thing. For my first outing I feel things have gone pretty well. My knee is still pretty sore on an evening, after a day’s play, but I will take that because I am pulling up on mornings fine.”</p> \n<p>Durham did not pull up so well on the third morning: Keaton Jennings had his stumps splayed by Rikki Clarke, who also terminated Michael Richardson’s cameo when Laurie Evans plucked a third-slip catch high above his head.</p> \n<p>A lunchtime score of 34 for five regressed to 55 for seven soon afterwards, as Clarke took eight wickets in a first-class match for the first time courtesy of Gordon Muchall’s back-foot waft and John Hastings succumbing to the best delivery sent down by Oliver Hannon-Dalby in either innings.</p> \n<p>So it took a major tail wag to swell Warwickshire’s target to 265 – Jamie Harrison last man out, one of two innings-ending successes for the New Zealand off-spinner Jeetan Patel.</p> \n<p>With grey cloud morphing into sunshine after tea, conditions improved for batting considerably and it took a leg-side strangle for Durham to make their first inroad as the luckless Chopra flicked at Graham Onions. The other two dismissals – Jonathon Webb’s middle-stump cartwheeled and Ian Westwood’s outside edge tickled – were rather more comprehensive.</p> \n<p>But with Laurie Evans’s strokeplay equally decisive – his half-century came from 64 balls – Woakes’s comeback contribution could yet play a decisive part in the result.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436902485252/Chris-Woakes--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chris Woakes was playing in his first competitive match since England were knocked out of the World Cup by Bangladesh in March.

Kyrgios cut short his session after feeling tightness in his right thigh but captain Wally Masur says the 20-year-old will be ready to take on Kazakhstan in this week’s quarter-final tie in Darwin starting on Friday.</p> \n<p>“He’s fine,” Masur said. “He played over three hours of tennis yesterday. He played a bit of basketball this morning. He’s got an opportunity to get on that match court tomorrow. No dramas there.”</p> \n<p>The injury scare comes 24 hours after Masur scoffed at suggestions Kyrgios has become a liability, saying Australia’s second ranked men’s player is a spearhead capable of doing his country proud. Masur also said he is hopeful Bernard Tomic will be able to patch up his rift with Tennis Australia and resume his Davis Cup career in the near future.</p> \n<p>Kyrgios has become a human headline this year, with his brash on-court antics and demeanour off the court drawing plenty of criticism. The world No41 even weighed into Tomic’s rift with TA last week, accusing director of player performance Pat Rafter of being “negative”.</p> \n<p>Tomic has been banned for the upcoming Davis Cup tie but Kyrgios will headline an Australian outfit also featuring Lleyton Hewitt, Thanasi Kokkinakis and Sam Groth.</p> \n<p>During Tuesday’s media conference, Kyrgios was asked whether his recent controversies – including a turbulent Wimbledon campaign where he was accused of tanking – had made him a liability.<br /></p> \n<p>But Masur quickly jumped in to defend his star charge. “Nick a liability for the Davis Cup? Absolutely not,” Masur said. “He’s here, he’s got the green and gold on, he’s one hell of a tennis player. That doesn’t make him a liability, it actually makes him the spearhead.”</p> \n<p>Tomic was axed from Davis Cup duties after accusing TA of abandoning him after he underwent double hip surgery last year. The world No25 also claimed that Rafter had no idea how to control the budget for player funding and was merely a “mask” for chief executive Craig Tiley.</p> \n<p>The rift took a comical twist on Monday when TA distributed an email listing Tomic as having an upcoming appearance at the “Hall of Shame Tennis Championships”. TA insist the matter was no more than a typo, and that the email should have read: “Hall of Fame Tennis Championships”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/14/bernard-tomics-family-consider-legal-action-over-hall-of-shame-email\">Bernard Tomic's family consider legal action over 'Hall of Shame' email</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tomic and his dad are exploring their legal options over the issue, with the matter an unwanted distraction as Australia attempt to power their way into the Davis Cup semi-finals.<br /></p> \n<p>“I hope this [whole feud] can be resolved down the track, so Bernie can take his rightful place in the team,” Masur said.<br /></p> \n<p>Australia’s infighting hasn’t escaped the attention of Kazakhstan, who have reached the quarter-finals in four of the past five years but are yet to make the final four.<br /></p> \n<p>“We’re reading the papers and at times it’s entertaining, but of course we understand Tennis Australia is experiencing maybe some current challenges before this important match,” Kazakhstan captain Dias Doskarayev said.<br /></p> \n<p>Masur said the Kazakhs’ 3-2 dispatch of Italy in the first round “certainly sets off alarm bells”, and praised their positive attitude and respect for the competition.<br /></p> \n<p>World No63 Mikhail Kukushkin is Kazakhstan’s highest ranked player, while the visitors are expected to use world No115 Aleksandr Nedovyesov for the second singles rubber.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/82441b4e772362d6ed69c2ef799792ce733f144b/0_487_3117_1872/3117.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1872,"width":3117,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Neda Vanovac/AAP","altText":"Nick Kyrgios, flanked by Thanasi Kokkinakis and Wally Masur, fields questions from the media on Tuesday, including one about whether he has become a liability for the team.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Neda Vanovac/AAP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-15T06:40:54Z","lastModified":"2015-07-15T07:51:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Davis Cup","Nick Kyrgios","Tennis","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/daviscup","webTitle":"Davis Cup"},{"id":"sport/nick-kyrgios","webTitle":"Nick Kyrgios"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/15/australias-nick-kyrgios-fit-to-play-davis-cup-quarter-final","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4akf8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/15/australias-nick-kyrgios-fit-to-play-davis-cup-quarter-final","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/15/australias-nick-kyrgios-fit-to-play-davis-cup-quarter-final"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/82441b4e772362d6ed69c2ef799792ce733f144b/0_487_3117_1872/3117.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1872,"width":3117,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nick Kyrgios, flanked by Thanasi Kokkinakis and Wally Masur, fields questions from the media on Tuesday, including one about whether he has become a liability for the team.
