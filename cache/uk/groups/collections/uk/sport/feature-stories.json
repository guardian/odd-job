The restaurant is Michelin-starred. There is a choice of six pillow types. Some bathrooms have Jacuzzis that take eight people. Yet when England’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/may/19/england-training-squad-rugby-world-cup-stuart-lancaster\">50-man training squad</a> for the Rugby World Cup gather at their purpose-built gym at the hotel on Monday, a “grim” experience is promised by Stuart Lancaster.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/10/jonny-wilkinson-england-rugby-world-cup\">Jonny Wilkinson says England’s World Cup hopes rest on self-discipline</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The England head coach claims his squad can be 10% fitter and stronger, and he will spend the next few weeks trying to prove it. He also believes his squad has the quality to lift the Webb Ellis Cup. But he knows there is a third factor – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2013/apr/28/referees-home-team-sean-ingle\">home advantage</a> – which might just make the difference.</p> \n<p>Before every Rugby World Cup you hear worrisome claims about the pressure that is supposed to come from being the hosts. Don’t believe it. The home team have lifted the trophy three times and been runners-up twice, which is not a bad return from seven tournaments. Meanwhile the academic research is emphatic: home advantage in elite rugby union is worth around six to eight points.</p> \n<p>Ask why that is the case, and you will receive a dozen answers. Among the most common: the influence of crowds on players, the effects of travel on the opposition, and player familiarity with their home venue. I am also struck by research from Professor Alan Nevill, who led a study in which 40 football referees were asked to judge 47 incidents from a match in the 1998-99 season between Liverpool and Leicester. Half watched with crowd noise, the control group in silence. Intriguingly, those viewing the footage with crowd noise awarded 15.5% fewer fouls against the home team compared with those watching in silence.</p> \n<p>But there is something else that researchers have focused on in the past decade: the effect of home and away games on a player’s hormones. In hockey and football, for instance, researchers have discovered significantly higher pre-game salivary testosterone levels and self-confidence before a home game as opposed to playing away. And now a study, led by Dr Brian Cunniffe, a sports scientist with the Lions on their 2013 tour to Hong Kong and Australia, has unearthed another potential reason for the home-advantage effect: stress levels are lower and less variable across a home team.</p> \n<p>Due to a quirk of the fixture computer, Cunniffe and his fellow researchers were able to track an elite Welsh rugby union club over four consecutive matches in which they played the same teams – their local rivals and the Irish league leaders – home and away for a study that has just been published in the Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance.</p> \n<p>Their methodology was simple and straightforward: 90 minutes before each game, as well as on a control day, every starter and substitute was asked to spit into a saliva tube and to answer a few questions to assess their sleep, training and confidence levels. Their testosterone and cortisol levels were then analysed. As Cunniffe explains in the paper ‘Home vs Away’ Competition: Effects on Psychophysiological Variables in Elite Rugby Union, cortisol – a stress hormone – was not only higher when teams played away but more variable among players in the team.</p> \n<p>That is not good, for two reasons. First, heightened cortisol is energy-sapping, which can affect physical and cognitive performances. Cunniffe explains: “You can’t differentiate the psychology from the physiology, so if you do become stressed that does have physiological repercussions down the line.” Second, if cortisol levels vary wildly within a team it can affect their tactical cohesion and game plan. Interestingly, against the Irish league leaders the Welsh team being researched lost by 33 points, which coincided with their pre-game stress hormone response being highest.</p> \n<p>There was another element to the study which is worth noting: substitutes had much lower levels of pre-game testosterone than starters. Cunniffe explains that has repercussions for coaches on game day. The answer is not to name the team late, because if someone is unsure whether they will play it could lead to a heightened cortisol response. Instead, naming your team early so they can practise together and telling a substitute they are likely to feature is probably a better strategy.</p> \n<p>Of course there are limitations to the research given that it is based on only four games, not a full season. It would be fascinating to examine with greater rigour the psychophysical responses for different positions – especially key decision-makers, like the scrum-half and fly-half. It would also be worth looking at how a referee’s pre-game cortisol levels – and subsequent decision making – change depending on the importance of the game. Even so, it does at least suggest – in a modest way – another reason why England’s players should benefit from playing at home when the World Cup kicks off in September.</p> \n<p>Cunniffe explains: “Familiarity with pressure and surroundings are crucial. And when you are in a high-pressure occasion the importance of routine becomes amplified. So, having control on the simple things that can affect player hormone levels – such as the look and feel of a hotel, food choices, travel time to the venue – are all key. It will give them a massive sense of security in that World Cup bubble.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434958929478/Sean-Ingle-column-illustr-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Matt Johnstone/Guardian","altText":"Sean Ingle column illustration","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Matt Johnstone/Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-21T16:22:54Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T07:43:08Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":31,"contributors":[{"name":"Sean Ingle","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733748340/SeanIngle.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/seaningle"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["England rugby union team","Rugby World Cup 2015","Rugby World Cup","Rugby union","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/england-rugby-union-team","webTitle":"England rugby union team"},{"id":"sport/rugby-world-cup-2015","webTitle":"Rugby World Cup 2015"},{"id":"sport/rugby-world-cup","webTitle":"Rugby World Cup"},{"id":"sport/rugby-union","webTitle":"Rugby union"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sean Ingle","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/seaningle"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/21/england-players-rugby-world-cup-home-advantage","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a234","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jun/21/england-players-rugby-world-cup-home-advantage","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jun/21/england-players-rugby-world-cup-home-advantage"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434958929478/Sean-Ingle-column-illustr-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Could home help give England the edge at the Rugby World Cup?

Their Under-20 team have scaled a couple of peaks themselves recently by winning the last two world junior titles. But in the northern Italian town of Cremona it was the young New Zealanders who reached loftier heights.</p> \n<p>The Baby Blacks were favourites to win the final and deserved their victory but Jon Callard’s team were more than honourable in defeat. Maro Itoje, the Saracen who was last year’s victorious Under-20 captain, has already forced his way into the senior squad and will be on that flight to the United States and one or two England forwards here suggested they may be stepping up themselves soon.</p> \n<p>Paul Hill, the 20-year-old Yorkshire Carnegie prop who moves to Northampton this summer, is England’s most experienced player. He was rock-solid in the front row while the flanker Lewis Ludlam, who will be a club-mate of Hill at Franklin’s Gardens, was outstanding at the breakdown alongside the Harlequins No8 James Chisholm.</p> \n<p>England can count themselves unlucky that a try that might have turned the game 12 minutes after the break was disallowed. Ludlam brilliantly turned the ball over and the wing Howard Packman showed his turn of pace to kick on and deliver a pass to Piers O’Connor but the Wasps replacement was judged to be just ahead of Packman before he received his pass and dived over. Charlie Ewels, the England captain, had no illusions, however. “We let ourselves down a bit tonight. Hopefully we can learn from this defeat but we were not at our best”</p> \n<p>England made the perfect start when the Bath centre Max Clark took a pass from Rory Jennings to use his strength to slice through the New Zealand defence for the first try of the evening. The fly-half Jennings, another Bath player, converted and England were on their way.</p> \n<p>The English pack, lighter than their New Zealand counterparts whose captain prop, Atunaisa Moli, at over 19st is the heaviest player in the tournament, were competing well at the breakdown and New Zealand took some time to get into their stride. The Manawatu fly-half Otere Black and Jennings swapped penalties before New Zealand lost two players to early injuries.</p> \n<p>Their other prop, Ricky Riccitelli, left the field, although he returned before the break and the highly rated centre Tinoai Faiane was then injured in a collision with England’s full-back Aaron Morris. Faiane played on in pain before being replaced by Vince Tavae-Aso, who had been on the pitch for seconds before he received his first touch.</p> \n<p>He wriggled clear of two weak tackles before outsprinting Morris to touch down in the corner. Black missed the touchline conversion but his penalty four minutes before the break gave New Zealand the lead for the first time.</p> \n<p>When Akira Ioane powered over for New Zealand’s second try just after the interval the writing was on the wall for England. Ioane, though, was harshly given a yellow card for a foul tackle on Jennings, who punished his indiscretion with a second penalty. Jennings and Black continued to exchange penalties as fireworks lit up the night sky but England were unable to find that extra spark for a third successive title.</p> \n<p>Earlier in the evening, the power of the South African forwards helped secure the bronze medal with a 31-18 victory over France. But New Zealand were overwhelmingly the best side in this year’s tournament. England will look for a comeback when Manchester hosts the tournament next year.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434832364485/Max-Clark-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Max Clark scores the opening try of the match for England but New Zealand hit back to clinch a five-point victory in Cremona.

He had been having throw-downs and was almost an hour late for his first press conference of the tour, which is no way to get onside with impatient hacks waiting to get back to their Father’s Day pint and lunch.

For now, though, the only delivery that had any lift or movement on it was to seek a response to a criticism of the age of his team that had come earlier in the week from Clarke’s former international colleague Jason Gillespie, who had plucked out the generic “Dad’s Army” label that is used for any sporting team containing players of a certain vintage.</p> \n<p>Clarke metaphorically stood up on his toes and turned it round the corner for an easy single, saying that he had “copped it all my career”, Dizzy could “join the queue” and that they might add the Yorkshire coach to “the long list of people that we have proved wrong”. In terms of hitting out, it was hardly the Walkabout bar in Birmingham.</p> \n<p>Although Clarke said that he had not watched a ball bowled of the recent enthralling one-day series between England and New Zealand, and had viewed only a little of the Test series that preceded it, he must be acutely aware of the groundswell of optimism that the results, and in particular the manner of their achievement, have created in this country.</p> \n<p>There is tendency here to teeter from one extreme to the other when it comes to our sport, with little room for the shades in between, but there is no question that the confidence engendered in one format can have an effect in another.</p> \n<p>Clarke, though, is a skilled operator, articulate and as quick on his feet with his answers as he is when dancing down the track to the spinners. He does not buy into any game of predictions, either considered or outrageous. What about Graeme Swann, who tosses the verbal ball up invitingly now he is part of the media, and who suggested that Steve Smith, currently the world’s top-ranked batsman, might get found out in English conditions? He laughed at this. “I reckon Swanny is a beauty. I’ve always liked him and loved playing cricket against him. I am sure he is trying to get under the skin of a few of the players but it’s not about what you say, it’s about what you do. We will find out in five Test matches time whether Steve Smith is good enough to have success over here.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2013/jun/12/david-warner-australia-joe-root\">David Warner's dropping by Australia is latest chapter in unusual tale | Vic Marks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>OK, then, what about the spirit in which the games will be played? The matches against New Zealand have been noteworthy for the smiles on the faces of the protagonists, and the manner in which that evident enjoyment was conveyed to the spectators. Will there be calls for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/nov/24/ashes-alastair-cook-war-clarke-broken-arm-sledge\">“broken fucking arms” </a>and in-yer-face David Warner? “I am confident it will be played in the right spirit,” he said, although not entirely without caveat. “On the field both teams will play hard and I know I probably say this every series but we will respect there is a line you cannot cross. Both teams might head-butt that line but I am confident we will not overstep the mark. For us I believe it is important we keep an aggressive approach.”</p> \n<p>He was curious on the subject of Warner however, who has expressed a desire to calm down a little on the field. In a recent article on ESPN Cricinfo, Warner is quoted as saying that “in the past I’ve been someone who’s been told to go out there and do this and do that, but at the end of the day I’ve got to look after myself. If I don’t want to be that instigator, I don’t have to be that instigator.” The implication is that it is Clarke and Darren Lehmann, the coach, who have given him instruction to be the chief attack dog on the field.</p> \n<p>“As his captain I can guarantee I’ve never asked him to go and sledge somebody,” Clarke replied. “I think I can speak for the coach as well, that he’s never done that. The environment I try to create around this group is encouraging them to play the way they can play their best cricket, so for me, for example, being sledged or sledging someone else has never really impacted on me. It’s never affected me if I’ve copped it and it’s never helped me if I’ve opened my big mouth. Davey’s his own man – what is he 28 or 29? – and he can make his own choices. I want to see him perform as well as he possibly can. He’s a big part of this team, he’s in tremendous form and has batted well in all formats of the game for the last four months and we need him to be successful here. If he feels he’s said a lot in his career and he wants to say less now to help his game then I’m all for it.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434904252847/Australia-captain-Michael-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Australia captain, Michael Clarke, taking media questions at Old Merchant Taylors School about the Ashes series.

Last week the former Australia pace bowler Jason Gillespie, an Ashes winner himself and now coach of Yorkshire, labelled the visitors’ squad a “dad’s army”, containing as it does two 37-year-olds in Brad Haddin and Chris Rogers, a 35-year-old bowler in Ryan Harris, and Clarke himself, who is 34 and has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/dec/13/australia-captain-michael-clarke-leaves-field-with-suspected-hamstring-injury\" title=\"\">a long history of back trouble</a>.</p> \n<p>But at his first press conference of the tour, following team training at Merchant Taylors’ school near Watford, Clarke hit back at his former international colleague who at one time had been <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/22/jason-gillespie-ecb-england-dream-coach\" title=\"\">tipped to become head coach of England</a>, a job that has gone instead to the captain’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/25/trevor-bayliss-england-cricket-head-coach\" title=\"\">former coach at New South Wales, Trevor Bayliss</a>. “Jason’s entitled to his opinion,” Clarke said. “Join the queue. I’ve copped criticism my whole career. There’s a long list of people who’ve criticised this team. We might just add ‘Dizzy’ to that list of people we continue to prove wrong.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/australia-steve-smith-ashes-england-no1-test-batsman\">Australia’s Steve Smith stands on top of the world as the Ashes approach</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Clarke also played down the idea that the appointment of Bayliss, whom he knows well, gives England an extra advantage in the forthcoming series which starts in Cardiff on 8 July. “I don’t think so,” he said. “Not these days. Maybe when I first started my career, but not now with all the information and technology you can get on every player. If you’re smart you know every player’s strengths and weaknesses that you play against. And if you’re smart you know your own as well.</p> \n<p>“I think Trevor is a lovely guy and I wish him all the best. I think he’ll be great for England and for any team he coaches. He’s coached me a long time for New South Wales. I think he’ll bring the best out of the England players. It doesn’t matter [to us] that he is an Australian coach. You see so many players playing with and against each other with the different formats around the world these days, and the same with coaches.</p> \n<p>“Trevor coached Sri Lanka for a few years and had success there. He came back to New South Wales and now he has an opportunity with England, so I think it is great for the game and it shows a lot of respect for him that England have opened their arms and welcomed him in. He deserves that because his results certainly show how good a coach he is.”</p> \n<p>Paul Farbrace, the interim England head coach, meanwhile, sees no reason why Eoin Morgan cannot make a return to Test cricket after rediscovering his best form in the thrilling one-day series win against New Zealand.</p> \n<p>Morgan, who has been a limited-overs specialist since winning the last of his 16 Test caps in 2012, endured a poor World Cup as a captain and batsman, but led with distinction in the 3-2 victory over Brendon McCullum’s tourists.</p> \n<p>Asked whether the 28-year-old could be considered for a recall in whites following Saturday’s three-wicket win that sealed the series, Farbrace replied: “Absolutely. It’s a way of getting into the Test side by playing international cricket.</p> \n<p>“The reason we’ve played Ben Stokes in this one-day side is because the more he plays international cricket, the better for him – and that applies to everybody. They should all want to play Test cricket, and if they keep putting in performances they’ll be getting very close to it. There’s absolutely no reason why Morgan can’t play Test cricket.”</p> \n<p>New Zealand’s tour-ending Twenty20 international at Old Trafford on Tuesday will be Farbrace’s final match in charge before he returns to the role of assistant under the incoming Bayliss. The team’s first interaction with their Australian head coach will come on a four-day camp in Spain, starting on Saturday, in readiness for their final preparations for Cardiff from 8 July.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434892588451/Michael-Clarke--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Michael Clarke cut a relaxed figure in his first press conference before the Ashes in England and said Jason Gillepsie would join a long list of people who had criticised Australia.

Brennauer ran in fourth to seal her second stage race win of the season.</p> \n<p>In taking the most important win of her career, Barnes sealed the transition the former British under-14 omnium champion from being the queen of British town centre racing – she was involved in a diverting dispute with Olympic champion Laura Trott over victory in the London Nocturne in 2013 – into an all-round athlete who can use her speed to good advantage at the end of demanding road races.</p> \n<p>“I’ve been focusing on my climbing quite a lot this winter and I just made sure I was in a good position going into the bottom of the climbs,” said the 22-year-old, who began her racing with Buckinghamshire’s Team Keyne and has ridden since 2014 for the US-based United Health Care squad.</p> \n<p>“I always made sure I was on the right side of the split. [The peloton] spilt twice but it came back together, but I always knew it was going to be hard around here. It is the Chilterns so I knew what sort of climbs to expect. It wasn’t the Alps but I knew it was going to be four- or five-minute efforts as hard as I could.”</p> \n<p>As might be expected in Hemel Hempstead – the home of one of the most notorious gyratory systems in the UK, the Magic Roundabout – the run-in to the finish on Leighton Buzzard Road was tricky, according to Barnes. “It was just crazy, really difficult. There were quite a few roundabouts and traffic islands that we all had to contend with. I got boxed with about 300 metres to go but thankfully it opened up for me and I was able to open up my sprint.” But the time bonus for her victory sealed fifth place overall, along with the best young rider’s jersey and best Briton award.</p> \n<p>A few metres behind Barnes in the lead group was Brennauer, the reigning world time-trial champion, who had finished second on day one in Aldeburgh, then taken the race lead on day two after Armitstead departed from the race after her stage one crash. The 27-year-old German, a regular medallist on the track and a prolific winner on the road, relinquished the race leader’s jersey to Armitstead’s Boels-Dolmans team-mate Christine Majerus, but made up for it on a rainy Saturday in Stevenage.</p> \n<p>“The first day I wore [the jersey] it felt weird as I hadn’t been the winner on the first stage,” she said. “I worked hard yesterday to fight back for it and the team have been working so hard for me all week so I just wanted to get to the point that I could give them back for all their hard work. It was a tough stage with all the hills and a lot of hard attacks going on so they brought me back so we could take the yellow jersey.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434910819952/Hannah-Barnes-far-left-wi-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Hannah Barnes, far left, wins the fifth stage of the 2015 Aviva Women's Tour with the event's overall winner Lisa Brennauer, second left.

The guy has had his ankle twisted in the tackle and in desperation to not have it broken, he kicks out and gets sin-binned for it. It worries me that the game has just got that all wrong.”</p> \n<p>As for Hull, they can prepare for the rematch on Friday with the genuine belief they can end Leeds’ reign as Challenge Cup holders. They remain in the top eight despite the defeat but, with the result not confirmed until Carl Ablett’s try on the final hooter, they showed enough to suggest they will cause Leeds more problems when they meet again.</p> \n<p>“Our effort and commitment for each other was never in question,” said their coach, Lee Radford. “It’s been our skill and execution that is not giving us chances to win games. Mentally, we’ve just got to be better at stuff like that, and be more clinical.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8064781f1b68e52e61194aaccbf1fd0c11150de3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434910853322/aff811c4-5921-41d4-aacc-7620d19d7eb4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Curtis Naughton\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Curtis Naughton scores in the corner for Hull FC.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>To their credit, Hull could have folded when trailing 16-6 at the break through tries by McGuire, Joel Moon and Jimmy Keinhorst to one for Hull by Jordan Thompson. But, when Curtis Naughton crossed for the visitors three minutes after the restart, it kicked off a tit-for-tat half of action.</p> \n<p>Leeds responded when Keinhorst laid on a second score for Moon before Hull’s Danny Houghton scampered away to reduce the gap to six points and set up an enthralling final quarter.</p> \n<p>But then came the game’s major talking point: McGuire pounced on a loose kick from Jordan Abdull but was hauled down by Sneyd. He conceded a penalty for the tackle, before McGuire kicked out in retaliation, with both men shown yellow cards by the referee, Robert Hicks.</p> \n<p>After the resulting m&ecirc;l&eacute;e Kevin Sinfield kicked two penalty goals to nudge Leeds closer to victory before Hull again gave themselves a chance when Fetuli Talanoa grabbed a late try.</p> \n<p>However, it proved to be nothing more than consolation, as Ablett put the seal on the win with another Leeds score. But given the grim injury prognosis from McDermott on McGuire after the game, this could turn out to be a pivotal afternoon in Leeds’ season in more ways than one.</p> \n<p><strong>Leeds</strong> Hardaker; Handley, Moon, Watkins, Hall; Sutcliffe, McGuire; Singleton, Aiton, Leuluai, Keinhorst, Ward, Ablett. <strong>Interchange</strong> Sinfield, Walters, Cuthbertson, Peacock</p> \n<p><strong>Tries</strong> McGuire, Moon 2, Keinhorst, Ablett <strong>Goals</strong> Sutcliffe, Sinfield 5</p> \n<p><strong>Hull FC</strong> Shaul; Naughton, Sa, Talanoa, Michaels; Pryce, Sneyd; Watts, Houghton, Paea, Ellis, Minichiello, Thompson. <strong>Interchange</strong> Paleaaesina, Abdull, Whiting, Green</p> \n<p><strong>Tries</strong> Thompson, Naughton, Houghton, Talanoa <strong>Goals</strong> Sneyd 2</p> \n<p><strong>Referee</strong> R Hicks</p> \n<p><strong>Attendance</strong> 16,203</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434903394131/Leeds-Rhinos-v-Hull-FC-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Leeds' Joel Moon scores his first and his side's second try, despite the efforts of Hull FC's Leon Pryce in the Super League match at Headingley.
