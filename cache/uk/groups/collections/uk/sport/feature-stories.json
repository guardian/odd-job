She stepped off the bench to devastating effect in the quarter-final against Australia, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/27/womens-world-cup-japan-find-late-flourish-to-send-australia-crashing-out\" title=\"\">scoring Japan’s 87th-minute winner</a>. Norio Sasaki, the coach, must now be strongly tempted to start Iwabuchi, originally from Tokyo, against England. “She is a killer player,” he said. “She has very good ability to create opportunities in front of goal. When she was preparing to come on against the tired Australian players I told her she was going to decide it.”</p> \n<h2>2 Shinobu Ohno</h2> \n<p>The 31-year-old, 5ft 1 inch forward is well known to the Lionesses after enjoying a stint with Arsenal last year. Now back home with INAC Kobe she commands respect among Mark Sampson’s squad. “Shinobu’s a very good player,” says England’s Arsenal goalkeeper Siobhan Chamberlain. “We’ll have to be aware of the threat she poses.” Yukari Kinga, likely to start on the bench against England in Edmonton, is also a familiar face after starring alongside Ohno at Arsenal in 2014 before departing for Kobe with her compatriot.</p> \n<h2>3 Nahomi Kawasumi</h2> \n<p>Along with the captain and key midfielder Aya Miyama, Kawasumi, Japan’s menacing forward, is arguably one of her country’s two best-known players. “We have got to be careful against England,” cautions a 29-year-old currently playing her club football at Seattle in the United States. “They are fast and they are very good at playing long balls so we will be taking that into consideration.”</p> \n<h2>4 Norio Sasaki</h2> \n<p>Japan’s 57-year-old coach has been a resounding success since his appointment in 2007. Renowned as one of the top coaches in the women’s game, he has not only led the <em>Nadeshiko</em> to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2011/jul/18/japan-usa-womens-world-cup-final\" title=\"\">World Cup victory in 2011</a> but also the 2014 Asian Cup and a silver medal in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2012/aug/09/usa-japan-womens-football-final\" title=\"\">London 2012 Olympics</a>.

He is hoping the World Cup semi-finalists will continue to serve as exemplary ambassadors for the national game at a time when they are experiencing unprecedented and, quite possibly, unexpected scrutiny.</p> \n<p>As increasing numbers of journalists descended on Edmonton, where England face Japan in the semi-finals of Canada 2015 at midnight BST Wednesday, Sampson cautioned his squad against posting injudicious comments on social media.</p> \n<p>“We’re in the spotlight,” the manager said. “My players are under scrutiny now, more than they ever have been and they have to accept the responsibility that accompanies it. They’re in a privileged position and greater demands come with it.”</p> \n<p>Steph Houghton and company find themselves cast as not merely role models but figureheads of a game on the verge of a long-awaited breakthrough moment in England.</p> \n<p>“It’s fantastic that we’ve managed to put the women’s game in a place where there’s such interest,” Sampson said. “There are so many people in England who have done so much work over the years to put the game in this place. All they needed was an extra catalyst. Now, by reaching the semi-finals, we’ve had the catalyst.</p> \n<p>“People are suddenly aware of women’s football and I’m really hopeful this won’t be a flash in the pan. I’m hoping the nation will stay with this team and also the wider women’s game after the World Cup is over. These England players are almost all playing regularly across the country in the FA Women’s Super League so people can easily go along and watch them.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/28/england-women-world-cup-semi-final\">England’s success at Women’s World Cup sets new standards for others</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The hope is crowds will surge when they return home and the league resumes. “That will be the test of this World Cup,” Sampson said. “We will see if it creates a genuine base for the women’s game in England for years to come.”</p> \n<p>He cautions there can be no complacency, no treading water. “The whole women’s community has a responsibility to keep developing the game in every area so we produce more players and better players. We’ve got to make sure this tournament is a platform to give the game the exposure it needs and to make sure the girls keep being the ambassadors they’re becoming.”</p> \n<p>Doing so may demand discretion in certain areas but it will also require openness. “We need the media to stay with the game,” Sampson said. “To keep involved, to keep giving us stories which allow the public to connect with the players. But there’s still a long way to go. I still feel there’s more to come in terms of coverage of women’s football in England.</p> \n<p>“I think women’s football has a great chance of taking off in England – people love their football at home. We’ve got to make sure we keep banging the drum and keep working as ambassadors for the game we love.”</p> \n<p>A friendly against a leading nation at Wembley this year could help sustain momentum and England’s manager would be delighted to see such a fixture announced shortly after his squad return.</p> \n<p>“I’m obsessed with planning for Japan at the moment so I’ll leave that to the powers that be, who’ve done a great job so far,” he said. “I’ll trust them to do the hard work and put the plans in place so that, when we get back, this team gets the respect that, in my opinion, it deserves.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/29/england-siobhan-chamberlain-japan-womens-world-cup-goalkeeper-karen-bardsley\">England’s Siobhan Chamberlain ready to face Japan at Women’s World Cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Although Siobhan Chamberlain, his No2 goalkeeper, is standing by to deputise once again, Sampson is optimistic Karen Bardsley will be fit to start against Japan following the eye problems which forced her substitution early in the second half of the<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/28/england-send-hosts-canada-packing-in-tense-quarter-final\" title=\"\"> 2-1 quarter-final win against Canada</a>.</p> \n<p>“Karen should be fine,” he said. “She suffered an allergic reaction to something, we don’t know what but the swelling has gone and her eyes are completely back to normal.”</p> \n<p>He was rather more circumspect about the chances of Jodie Taylor starting.

And the Australian’s qualities as a head coach continue to be talked up by the opposition.</p> \n<p>Bayliss, who has spent the past four days familiarising himself with most of his players at a training camp in Spain and arrived back in the country on Tuesday, will address the media for the first time in his new role after convening with the England selection panel in the morning to discuss their options for the first Test that gets under way on Wednesday next week.</p> \n<p>While the team who played in the 199-run defeat by New Zealand at Headingley a month ago can expect to be inked in, there are additional berths up for discussion. The fast bowlers Liam Plunkett, Steven Finn and Mark Footitt were all part of the 14-man trip to Spain but at least two could miss out. The leg-spinner Adil Rashid, whose time was deemed better served bowling for Yorkshire, may yet feature.</p> \n<p>Should a reserve batsman be required, Rashid’s county team-mate Jonny Bairstow will come into their thinking after a career-best 219 not out against Durham at Chester-le-Street in the County Championship on Monday that followed his one-day series-sealing 83 from 60 balls against the Kiwis on the same ground 10 days earlier.</p> \n<p>Despite the pre-Ashes camp at the Desert Springs resort in Almer&iacute;a, which involved golf, cycling, fielding, fitness and strategy meetings, Bayliss will still be better acquainted with the Australian team, with nine of Michael Clarke’s squad having worked under the now 52-year-old during his time at New South Wales and Sydney Sixers before accepting the England job at the end of May.</p> \n<p>The wicketkeeper Brad Haddin, who will sit out Australia’s second warm-up against Essex at Chelmsford on Wednesday, captained both of those teams under Bayliss and claims the former Sri Lanka coach will bring calm to the England set-up. “Trevor has had a massive influence on my career. It started as captain of New South Wales. He gave me the chance to do that,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Trevor is a great person and takes a lot of the anxiety out of the changing room and gets cricketers enjoying the game. He will never rant and rave, is pretty even-tempered and encourages his players to learn about the game. He is a really good appointment and the bottom line with Trevor is he is a good man.”</p> \n<p>Asked if the thought of his fellow Australian wearing the crown and three lions on his tracksuit bothered him, Haddin replied. “No, I could not care less. Trevor is a career coach. He has had some wonderful success with Sri Lanka and New South Wales – everywhere he has been. That is no different to players who want to test themselves at the highest level.</p> \n<p>“I called him to congratulate him on his role and said: ‘I will talk to you after the fifth Test,’” he added. “Ashes campaigns are totally different beasts to any other cricket but no matter what has happened on the pitch with the result, at the end of the fifth Test the doors of both changing rooms have been open and that has happened ever since I have been involved.”</p> \n<p>Haddin admitted he could not picture an Englishman taking charge of Australia one day, with the wicketkeeper quick to cite his country’s previous experience with an overseas coach – the South African Mickey Arthur, who was sacked 16 days before the 2013 series – as a reason to avoid repeating the experiment.</p> \n<p>The forthcoming five-Test series will be the 37-year-old’s third in England – he has lost his two previous Ashes encounters here – and his last, having already retired from one-day international cricket after winning the World Cup final against New Zealand in March. <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/icc-world-cup-2015/cricket-world-cup-final-2015-darren-lehmann-defends-brad-haddin-australian-tactics/story-e6frf3ju-1227288484984\" title=\"\">That final saw Haddin criticised for his behaviour</a> behind the stumps after celebrating key wickets with unsavoury send-offs.</p> \n<p>But while the prospect of leaving the international game after a third away defeat is unpalatable, so too is the idea that the series will be played in anything but a similar vein. “They start half of it,” he said, when asked about expected animosity between the two sides.</p> \n<p>“What about Jimmy Anderson? He has called for peace, hasn’t he? He better look at himself in the mirror. We are not New Zealand. We won the World Cup final. We will play the way we play, which works for us, and, if you like it, you like it.</p> \n<p>“There is going to be times when it is uncomfortable out there with the guys we have bowling over 150kph.

dismissed Sir Richard Branson’s claim that Formula E is poised to overtake Formula One as motor racing’s elite category.</p> \n<p>Branson, who was speaking at the electric car racing formula’s season <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/28/formula-e-nelson-piquet-sebastien-buemi-sam-bird\" title=\"\">decider at Battersea Park in London</a> last weekend, said: “I think four or five years from now you’ll find Formula E overtaking Formula One in terms of number of people … there’s still going to be room for Formula One, but I would say there will come a time when Formula E will overtake it.”</p> \n<p>But while Button, the 2009 F1 world champion, acknowledged F1 is too complicated in its current format, he dismissed Branson’s suggestion that Formula E will soon become the more popular of the two categories.</p> \n<p>“I disagree with him completely,” Button said. “Formula E is a good addition to motorsport because that will be the electric series and the rest of us can get on with motor racing.</p> \n<p>“I think it is good that it is in cities and it attracts people who are not motorsport fans because it is easy to walk down to Battersea Park and see a car go round. It doesn’t disturb anyone either because it is not very loud.</p> \n<p>“I’ve watched a couple of races. The cars [and] the sound don’t do anything for me, but the drivers do. The drivers are making that series.”</p> \n<p>F1 has come under heavy criticism this season following a number of largely processional races.</p> \n<p>Mercedes’ dominance has continued, while Button and McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso were dealt a combined, and somewhat farcical, 50-place grid penalty for a raft of changes to their respective Honda power units before last month’s Austrian Grand Prix.</p> \n<p>Button said: “You take a five-place penalty for a new MGU-H [motor generator unit – heat] and MGU-K [motor generator unit – kinetic] and it is very complicated – an eight-year-old kid doesn’t want to know what that is, and some in the sport really struggle to understand what it is, too.</p> \n<p>He also criticised some of the confusing punishments handed out for breaches of the F1 rulebook: “I had a 25-place penalty in Austria and there is only 20 cars on the grid, so how is that possible? There are quite a few things that need to be looked at.”</p> \n<p>F1’s strategy group will meet on Wednesday in a bid to solidify plans for the 2017 season to make the sport more entertaining. It has already been suggested that the cars will be quicker, wider and noisier.</p> \n<p>Button said: “Criticism will be there forever but you just have to make sure it doesn’t get out of hand.”</p> \n<p>“Formula One is the pinnacle of motorsport and if a kid is not finding a Formula One car exciting then there is something wrong. When I grew up, F1 was just the pinnacle because of the smell, the speed, the personalities, and that always needs to be there.</p> \n<p>“We need to be very careful with the way the sport goes, but the changes that I see happening are positive.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435735559366/Jenson-Button-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jenson Button said F1 has become too complicated and needs to be more accessible to those unfamiliar with its technical intricacies.

I qualified fourth but then the heavens opened and I knew that it was my day. I got a great start and I just followed the lines that I took from my experience of Formula Renault days. It was a great race and everybody was standing every single time I went through Abbey, in the pouring rain with umbrellas up. That was a really special time. I won by 68 seconds.</p> \n<p>“It is difficult to say which is the greatest one because they are all so different but definitely wet races are the trickiest and that was a seriously tricky race. There was the aquaplaning and it was so difficult to keep temperature in the tyres. It was definitely one I thoroughly enjoyed.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton’s stock has never been higher. He <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/06/lewis-hamilton-british-grand-prix\" title=\"\">won his second British Grand Prix</a>, and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/nov/23/lewis-hamilton-wins-f1-title-nico-rosberg\" title=\"\">another world title</a>, last year and was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/dec/15/lewis-hamilton-rory-mcilroy-bbc--sports-personality-award\" title=\"\">voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year for 2014</a>. At a time when the sport is being talked down by so many people, he remains its solitary superstar, helped by a certain absence of shyness away from the track.</p> \n<p>The Spoty award clearly moved him. “I was shocked at how many fans called in. I really didn’t think I had that kind of support. I knew I had a lot of fans but I thought Rory McIlroy was going to win, so I was really shocked.”</p> \n<p>Silverstone holds an immense appeal, for Hamilton and the reception he receives there evokes the Nigel Mansell mania from the halcyon days of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost.</p> \n<p>Speaking at a Petronas event, Hamilton said: “Silverstone is where you have the biggest turnout of support. For me and Jenson Button [who has never won a podium place there] it is particularly special. You have all of the British flags there and all the people who have literally only just turned up to support you.</p> \n<p>“It’s the biggest buzz, definitely. I felt it for the first time when I got pole position in 2007. I was like: ‘Wow.’ I could see everyone but I couldn’t hear them. Then, watching the replay, I was really surprised.”</p> \n<p>For Hamilton, however, Silverstone means more than the race itself. “It is just the whole week really,” he says, “knowing that you are going to be seeing the fans, seeing the messages on social media, so you know that it is going to be a big turnout during the weekend.</p> \n<p>“I remember my first time there. It was a British Go-Kart GP when I was about eight or nine. It was a straw bale track many years ago. Then I did Formula Renault there. Then I remember standing at the back of the garage at McLaren thinking: ‘One day I want to be in one of those. I want one of those driver’s seats.’</p> \n<p>“Now to go there, even though I have been going there for a long time, I still particularly remember that day, standing at the back of McLaren.”</p> \n<p>Mansell’s name still fires Hamilton’s imagination. “I remember watching Nigel holding the union flag in the car. It was like the Olympics, like a gold medal, having the flag in the car after winning the grand prix. It is the closest thing I can imagine to having a gold medal.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton says he is surprised by the increase in the support he receives at Silverstone each time he returns. “It is huge. I hope that I can go there and make people proud.”</p> \n<p>He just wishes trophies, like the cars, could receive upgrades. “Last year they gave me this plastic thing and I’m like: ‘This is not the trophy. It’s like a GP2 trophy not the Formula One trophy.’ It would be great if each country had a real trophy with character that grew over the years because of the history. The last one in Austria was wooden. The whole thing was wooden. The base was like lead, I mean, what? It was supposed to be silver!”</p> \n<p>With the title race looking tight again, however, Hamilton would probably settle for another “plastic thing” on Sunday.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/30/1435683828166/Mercedes-Lewis-Hamilton-s-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton says the support he receives at the British Grand Prix 'is particularly special'.

His arrival as a coaching consultant on a three-month deal was announced in the home dressing room at stumps on the second evening.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/30/peter-moores-nottinghamshire-england-cricket\">Former England cricket head coach Peter Moores joins Nottinghamshire</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Newell, who served under Moores and remains an England selector, has arguably put his own position under scrutiny by drafting in the first coach to win the Championship with two different counties. The pair begin working together on Friday, with Newell retaining his hands-on duties rather than relinquishing them to sit upstairs.</p> \n<p>Explaining his rationale for the revamp, Newell said: “I’ve been doing this for 13 years now. I felt there was a need for fresh ideas and voices in the dressing room. A lot of those players have had to listen to me for a long time. You start to wonder if you’re having a positive influence on the team. We felt it was a good time to shake it up and bring someone new in. It seemed a no-brainer.”</p> \n<p>Moores’ teenage son Tom plays for Nottinghamshire’s second XI and the family live 20 minutes down the road in Loughborough, providing a perfect geographical fit. Although the new set-up will work across all cricket, it is a move designed primarily to boost the county’s flagging four-day fortunes – they began this round of matches two points from safety – and, if successful, it could develop into something permanent.</p> \n<p>“We’ll reassess at the end of September. Has it worked? How do we want to go forwards and what is best for the players? Going forward from here, I’m very much responsible for the selection of the team. He doesn’t want anything to do with that,” Newell added.</p> \n<p>“Building teams and working with players excites him as a coach. He can come here with no shackles and do what he likes doing. This team is looking for something and we hope it’s the start of something to boost us. The players were a bit surprised but I hope it inspires them. Players who want to improve will thrive under him.”</p> \n<p>Those players certainly showed improvement on the second day against Worcestershire after an underwhelming opening to the match. If application was lacking in Nottinghamshire’s first innings, there was not a bit of it on their return as they tackled adversity with such commitment that Worcestershire were able to muster a useful but, ultimately, narrow lead.</p> \n<p>Ben Hilfenhaus and Brett Hutton bowled their own overs and remarkably covered those of Luke Fletcher, who will be sidelined for a month with a hamstring injury, and Andy Carter, ruled out at the end of day one because of a side strain, and ruled back in on the second morning by himself with the aid of much strapping, too.</p> \n<p>Unable to bowl until 11.55am because of his previous absence from the field – and only able to do so at about 75% thereafter – it was fitting that Carter should finish off the innings with the dismissal of Saeed Ajmal.</p> \n<p>There appeared to be times when the Australian import Hilfenhaus simply shunned his captain’s instructions to come off. Samit Patel, meanwhile, wheeled away from the other end, denying Richard Oliver a hundred by the narrowest of margins to begin Worcestershire’s demise from 160 for two to 283 all out.</p> \n<p>One of the casualties was Alex Gidman, forced to retire hurt after being struck on the helmet by a Hilfenhaus bouncer. Gidman received lengthy treatment and initially continued before appearing to lose his balance and slumping on to his haunches after facing one more ball from Patel.</p> \n<p>It is odd in this day and age that the England and Wales Cricket Board does not have a clear directive for cases of concussion – it certainly should have – so Worcestershire will make their own call on whether Gidman takes any further part in the match. It appears unlikely.</p> \n<p>“Our policy is always to look after our players as best we can, that means getting them checked over straight away,” said the Worcestershire director of cricket, Steve Rhodes. “We took him out of the battle and don’t want to risk him. His colour is coming and going and for some periods he feels better than others.”</p> \n<p>Honours finished even by virtue of three evening-session wickets for the visitors and a hamstring injury to the unbeaten James Taylor, who will have a scan and will continue his innings with Alex Hales as his runner. That pair know Moores – removed from his second tenure as England coach on 9 May – well and events on the third day will dictate if he inherits a team inside or outside the relegation zone.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/30/1435700834059/Peter-Moores-does-not-wan-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Peter Moores does not want anything to do with team selection, says the Nottinghamshire director of cricket, Mick Newell.

Playing half of his matches at Lord’s, his duty is to hold up an end with the ball and contribute with the bat. But sometimes, when a pitch wears and he is allowed the opportunity to stitch some overs together, like he did against Hampshire on Tuesday, he can turn matches for his team.</p> \n<p>For starters, he registered a first half-century of the season to earn Middlesex a third batting point and take their first-innings lead to 154. Then he allowed James Franklin to rotate his bowlers in the 30C heat by holding the Pavilion end upon his broad shoulders for 10 overs that saw only 11 runs scored.</p> \n<p>James Harris produced a scintillating spell from the Nursery end to take the wickets of Michael Carberry (caught behind) and James Vince (bowled by a beaut) in the space of five quick, probing overs at the start of the afternoon session, to add to the pre-lunch wicket of Jimmy Adams.</p> \n<p>And just as Hampshire started to claw their way back from the brink, Rayner pitched in with three wickets of his own, each celebrated more expansively than the previous one, to gut the middle order.</p> \n<p>As Middlesex walked off for the day, trailing by 41 but with only three second-innings wickets to take, Franklin asked Rayner if he could recall the last time bowled 25-overs in a day. The sore fingers, said Rayner, said it all.</p> \n<p>“As a spinner, you’ve got to stay in the game,” he said. “At Lord’s, generally, I’m playing a holding role and pick up a couple here and there. It feels great just to be amongst the wickets. I do enjoy my wickets.”</p> \n<p>Rayner’s humour is evident, especially when discussing the tag people lazily cast his way – that of a tall German off-spinner who doesn’t impart an awful lot of spin on the ball.</p> \n<p>While the 6ft 5in cricketer was born in that country through his dad’s commitments in the army, he does not consider himself German, a fact he had to relay to a Hamburg immigration officer who looked at his passport during a cousin’s stag-do and began conversing with Rayner in the national language.</p> \n<p>And, a few of his balls turned on Tuesday – enough for Joe Gatting to play inside the line of one that continued its line up the slope and into off-stump. “Oh that? That was the doosra,” Rayner added.</p> \n<p>Adam Wheater’s counter-attacking half-century ensured Middlesex would have to bat again and with Gareth Berg more than capable of a hefty cameo, there may be a tricky, three-figure chase on a baked pitch. Middlesex will hope the new ball, only four overs old, does the trick on Wednesday to ensure the target is a formality.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435697760440/Adam-Wheaters-counteratta-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Adam Wheater's counterattacking half-century in Hampshire's second innings ensured Middlesex would have to bat again.

For Adil Rashid the trip to the North-east has been reasonably successful, although the likelihood is that the leg-spinner has not done quite enough to sway Trevor Bayliss away from starting with only the off-spinner Moeen Ali for the first Test at Cardiff.</p> \n<p>Rashid, the leading English spinner in Division One last season with 46 wickets, has taken four in the match at Chester-le-Street as Yorkshire chase an innings success. Three of those came during a hard-fought day three – one to wrap up Durham’s first innings and two more with them having been asked to follow on 349 runs behind shortly before lunch. The 27-year-old’s only five-wicket haul of 2014 came in a Roses win over Lancashire at Old Trafford and he has every chance of reaching that milestone on day four even though this Riverside pitch has not been as spinner-friendly as that one was in September.</p> \n<p>Rashid has been given plenty of work by his captain, Andrew Gale, whose side spent all day in the field. He bowled the ninth over of Durham’s first innings from the Finchale end during the latter stages of the second afternoon and struck with only his second ball, getting Keaton Jennings caught at slip. He opened the bowling on day three from the Lumley end, conceding five runs in a testing three-over spell, and then bowled a 24-over spell unchanged in the second from just before tea through to the close. He had Jennings caught at silly mid-off for 41 and Paul Collingwood caught at slip driving, to finish with two for 81 from 25 overs.</p> \n<p>“I thought Rash bowled really well,” said Gale. “To bowl like he did from one end without playing much red-ball cricket over the last month, I thought his pace was good and he turned the ball on a seamer-friendly pitch. I’ve said for some time that he’s ready to play for England. He showed in the one-day series that he’s not fazed by the big occasion. If they want a frontline spinner, he’s your man.”</p> \n<p>Rashid has always been a go-to man for Gale with the tail-enders batting, so it was no surprise to see him return to the attack shortly after Tim Bresnan had struck with successive balls in the 55th over to reduce Durham’s first innings to 169 for seven, getting Scott Borthwick (54) and John Hastings caught behind.</p> \n<p>Rashid saw Jack Brooks pick up two more wickets in the 63rd, his first of the morning, as Durham slipped to 195 for nine. Jamie Harrison was bowled and Chris Rushworth caught behind before the leg-spinner trapped Graham Onions lbw to wrap up the innings.</p> \n<p>Though this match has not provided the eye-catching haul of wickets he would have hoped for in front of the national selector James Whitaker, who was present on day two and saw the morning session of day three before heading south, it has not done anything to alter the thought that England’s limited-overs spinner will be called on for his Test debut during this series should a pitch suit two twirlers.</p> \n<p>Word from the Lions winter tour in South Africa suggested that he did not bowl as well as hoped, as was the case in the second of two Test warm-up matches against St Kitts in April. But there has been improvement on home soil. His best performance of the summer came with four wickets in each innings of his first Championship match, against Hampshire at Headingley in May, before he took four for 55 in the first one-dayer against New Zealand at Edgbaston.</p> \n<p>Although his figures here may look a touch expensive, runs are not so much of an issue for Yorkshire. He bowled with good flight and variation during his extended spell either side of tea and tested a Durham top order which was led by a second hundred of the summer for the opener Mark Stoneman, who closed unbeaten on 116.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/30/1435689591923/adil-rashid-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Yorkshire's Adil Rashid, third right, celebrates after dismissing Keaton Jennings on day three of the County Championship Division One match at Durham.

As if it was not enough that the opening set lasted a faintly embarrassing 27 minutes, Watson had to save three match points in a decider that tested the blood pressure of everyone watching on Court 12, deal with a code violation for foul language and raise herself after allowing Garcia to break when she served for the match at 6-5. She will drag herself back on court on Wednesday to face the experienced Slovakian and world No72, Daniela Hantuchova, who beat Watson in the Australian Open last year.</p> \n<p>Playing for the third time in three days will be a stiff examination of Watson’s physical conditioning, although she will surely be fresh against Hantuchova after one of the biggest wins of her career.</p> \n<p>Garcia must be mystified by her early exit. The 21-year-old, who was once tipped by Andy Murray to become the world No1, was a class above during a painful first set for Watson and she ought to have secured her place in the next round after breaking in the first game of the second.</p> \n<p>Watson was wounded and Garcia let her squirm out of her grasp.</p> \n<p>Despite Garcia’s generosity, an area where Watson must improve is her unfortunate knack of starting matches slowly. She got away with it twice in Eastbourne last week, rousing herself from early torpor to beat <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/heather-watson-varvara-lepchenko-eastbourne\" title=\"\">Varvara Lepchenko</a> and Elina Svitolina, but Sloane Stephens had her number in the third round.</p> \n<p>Maybe Watson feeds off anxiety, flat when the umpire barks “play” but able to tap dance her way out of trouble when she is standing on the edge of a cliff. Watson can throw a punch and, if she can play with more aggression on a regular basis, she will move up the rankings. Her backhand stung Garcia. The third set was an almighty battle. After a few comfortable holds, the temperature rose when Watson squandered several break points, throwing away chances to lead 3-2 and 4-3.</p> \n<p>Watson’s frustration boiled over after Garcia held in the seventh game of the set and she was given a point penalty by the umpire, meaning that her next service game began with her trailing 0-15. She was warned for racket abuse on Monday night and that one point in Garcia’s favour almost proved costly for Watson, who had to save two break points.</p> \n<p>“She gave it to me for audible obscenity,” Watson said. “She didn’t like me, that’s for sure. I say things that I shouldn’t say. I apologise to anybody that’s offended. I need to control it and I just can’t.”</p> \n<p>Garcia attacked Watson’s second serve and she earned two match points when she was leading 5-4. She missed two forehands.</p> \n<p>She had another match point; she missed another forehand. That was the difference: the winner count was 32-13 in Garcia’s favour but she also made 38 unforced errors to Watson’s 18.</p> \n<p>Watson made the most of her reprieve after holding and she broke to lead 6-5 after a double-fault from Garcia. However Watson’s serve was also falling to pieces and Garcia immediately broke back.</p> \n<p>“I was actually quite nervous,” Watson said. “Going to serve the first time, I don’t think I made a first serve to close that game out. She took advantage of that.”</p> \n<p>There was a sharp intake of breath. Watson steeled herself and Garcia, riddled with self-doubt, lost her serve again.</p> \n<p>Serving for the match for a second time, Watson led 40-0. There was a brief delay, a double-fault from Watson, but Garcia had pretty much seen enough by then and knocked a forehand return long to settle a perplexing match.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435688452954/8845c0e6-1ba1-4156-b382-0732d903fd10-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graeme Robertson for the Guardian","altText":"British No1 Heather Watson celebrates her victory over Caroline Garcia.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T15:51:49Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T23:01:41Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":7,"contributors":[{"name":"Jacob Steinberg","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/3/4/1425468993908/Jacob-Steinberg-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jacob-steinberg"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Heather Watson","Wimbledon 2015","Wimbledon","Tennis","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/heather-watson","webTitle":"Heather Watson"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jacob Steinberg","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jacob-steinberg"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/30/heather-watson-caroline-garcia-wimbledon","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a8zx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/30/heather-watson-caroline-garcia-wimbledon","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/30/heather-watson-caroline-garcia-wimbledon"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435688452954/8845c0e6-1ba1-4156-b382-0732d903fd10-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"British No1 Heather Watson celebrates her victory over Caroline Garcia.

Graham Rowntree, England’s forwards’ coach, is in no doubt that the time his squad have together now will lend them an advantage over the southern hemisphere teams, who will spend the next couple of months contesting this year’s truncated Tri Nations.</p> \n<p>“Absolutely, I would choose to do it this way,” Rowntree said, as he took time out from his squad’s conditioning programme — for which read anguish and flagellation — to assure that the hosts will be in the shape of their lives come September. The trade-off is between fitness and match hardness, with England relying for the latter on three warm-up games against France (twice) and Ireland.</p> \n<p>“We’ve planned this for two years. And those warm-up games are good. These guys need time to build sufficient base-level fitness. You can’t do what we’re doing now in a Six Nations or an autumn campaign. This way we get plenty of time to get hold of them. You can change a player, how he looks, get him as fit as possible. What we’re putting them through is very tough, the toughest I’ve seen.”</p> \n<p>The sunny terraces and dickie-bowed waiters of Pennyhill Park cut a wicked contrast with the toil Rowntree spoke of just a couple of hundred yards down a leafy lane. The Surrey hotel has been England’s base, off and on, since the Clive Woodward era, but it has been colonised by them in recent years.</p> \n<p>The press have yet to be admitted to the training centre they have built next to the full-size rugby pitch, so unspeakable are the tortures practised within. “They’re working as hard as they can,” said a deadpan Rowntree, “and we’ll continue to push them. We’ve got a horrible session lined up for them this afternoon, which is as it should be. They need that training to reach the fitness levels we aspire to.”</p> \n<p>Rowntree apologised repeatedly as he dabbed the sweat from his brow. He had been running himself in the heat a couple of hours earlier. He often referred to the meticulous planning behind England’s campaign but the coincidence of the heatwave represents a bonus to cheer any sadistic fitness coach. With all the gizmos attached to the modern rugby player in training, one can be sure that when a coach tells us this is the hardest his boys have ever trained he has the data to prove it.</p> \n<p>The All Blacks are held up as setting the standard to aspire to — indeed, to surpass. England finished the Six Nations with a try-fest against the French and they are promising more of the same this autumn. “We are aspiring to high ball-in-play minutes. There are teams around the world who are leading that at the moment and we want to be at the front of it. We’ve played New Zealand a lot recently, and the ball has been in play more against them than against anyone. Minute-wise, it’s in the late 30s. And that’s challenging. We want to get to around 40 minutes a game, ball in play, challenging teams, playing exciting rugby.”</p> \n<p>Next week the 50-man squad will be trimmed by five before leaving for two weeks of more pain, albeit with the promise of a rugby ball thrown in, at altitude in Denver. Ben Morgan, whom Rowntree described as in the shape of his life, is well on track to feature there, following the broken leg he suffered in January.</p> \n<p>After the disciplinary disruptions of the past few weeks, there is a mood of positivity in England’s camp. And, on that discipline front, they seem to have struck upon an effective policy of prevention. No one can misbehave if they do not have the energy.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435698493670/Graham-Rowntree-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The England forwards coach, Graham Rowntree, has been promising pain for the players as they attempt to get into the shape of their lives before this autumn's World Cup.

Salford</p>","byline":"Press Association","body":"<p>Dane Tilse scored his first try in the English game as the Challenge Cup semi-finalists Hull KR continued their impressive home form to haul themselves out of Super League’s bottom four for the first time since April.</p> \n<p>The prop’s touchdown 10 minutes into the second half sparked a purple patch for Rovers, who turned a 10-8 interval deficit into a commanding 26-10 lead and then held off a dramatic late fightback from Salford to secure a precious 34-28 victory.</p> \n<p>The Red Devils are now resigned to finishing in the bottom four after losing their game in hand and will be hoping the arrival of the new director of rugby, Tim Sheens, in a week’s time will provide them with a boost ahead of the Super 8s.</p> \n<p>Salford, who had Adrian Morley making the 550th appearance of his career, dominated the early part of the game but it was against the run of play when Rovers opened the scoring on 13 minutes.</p> \n<p>The scrum-half Albert Kelly caught out the Red Devils’ defence by running the ball on the last tackle and his precision kick to the corner was pounced on by the winger Ben Cockayne.</p> \n<p>The Rovers stand-off Maurice Blair then had a try disallowed for a knock-on and Salford went in front with two tries in nine minutes.</p> \n<p>Cory Paterson, one of four former Rovers players in the Salford ranks, stole the ball in a one-on-one tackle on the unfortunate full-back Kieran Dixon and fed the alert winger Mason Caton-Brown.</p> \n<p>Josh Griffin’s goal made it 6-4 and the Red Devils extended their lead when Dobson’s cut-out pass got Ben Jones-Bishop over in the other corner for the first of his two tries.</p> \n<p>When Dixon fumbled another of Dobson’s high kicks that caught in the swirling wind, it was the signal for the coach Chris Chester to switch him away from the firing line and he instantly made his mark on the wing, finishing decisively for the Robins’ second try after Kelly had provided the key pass.</p> \n<p>Josh Mantellato was again unable to master the tricky wind but Rovers were well in the contest at the interval, especially after the Salford prop Lama Tasi had been held up on his back just before the hooter sounded.</p> \n<p>If Salford shaded the first half, they went walkabout in the third quarter as Rovers turned the game on its head with three tries in a devastating eight-minute spell.</p> \n<p>The hooker Shaun Lunt got Tilse crashing over with a short pass from dummy half and two minutes later burst clear to send the centre Kris Welham over.</p> \n<p>The game was completely transformed when Blair charged through some flimsy defence for a solo try and Mantellato’s third goal made it 26-10.</p> \n<p>Before the home fans could celebrate, however, they were forced to endure a tense finish after the stand-off Theo Fages created two tries in five minutes for the forwards Jordan Walne and another former Hull KR man, Scott Taylor.</p> \n<p>Griffin converted both to cut the deficit to just four points to set up a frantic finish.</p> \n<p>Mantellato put some more daylight between the teams with a penalty but it was all square when Fages combined with Chase to get Jones-Bishop over for his second try eight minutes from the end and Griffin kicked his fourth goal.</p> \n<p>But before either side could think about a drop goal, Kelly pounced with the winning try, taking advantage of a tough bounce from the restart to regather and touch down.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435703501266/6a7de676-ae1a-4688-bbe0-ae31a3784940-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ed
