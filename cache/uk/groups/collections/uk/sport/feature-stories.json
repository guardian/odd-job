That, you may recall, was a few minutes into <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/27/several-top-fifa-officials-arrested\" title=\"\">the raid on the hotel lair of its kissing cousin, Fifa</a>, and the subsequent full spectrum dominance of that story would have been the perfect place to bury the news.</p> \n<p>Then again, why should the custodians of the Olympic flame have denied themselves the post-satirical laugh of being able to dispense moral advice to their fellow international governing body? “[Fifa] is a complete and utter mess – it may be too late,” intoned the IOC, which was last seen in the VIP seats as Vladimir Putin actually invaded a country <em>during</em> his Winter Games.</p> \n<p>Either way, the IOC picked this week to reveal it has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/bbc-loses-control-olympic-tv-rights-discovery-eurosport\" title=\"\">ended its rights arrangement</a> with a group of European public service broadcasters and sold them to Eurosport, a landmark action that can be boiled down to one simple result: far fewer people will watch the Olympics. It’s like the motto goes: Citius, Altius, Pay-for-us.</p> \n<p>With this decision, the Olympic movement has cast in its lot with the parcelling and packaging of sport, and if that seems to you the very opposite of what it should be about, rest assured you’re not looking at it right. The way to develop sport is to free it from the possibility of being sampled by kids whose parents don’t subscribe, kids whose parents can’t afford to subscribe, kids now spared the inspiration of experiencing things to which they would otherwise not be exposed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/29/olympics-bbc-sport-discovery-games\">Despite losing control of rights to the Olympics, all is not lost for the BBC</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>According to the IOC president Thomas Bach, the &pound;992m deal shows “a new broader approach to Olympic broadcasting”. It certainly shows a broader definition to the term “broad”. In fact, on these terms broad now becomes one of those words that can also means their opposite – like cleave, or trim. In 2012 the BBC showed 2,500 hours of the Olympics. Under the new deal, 200 hours will be offered on free to air. Broadly speaking, this is the new broad.</p> \n<p>And really, what could possibly go wrong? Look what this kind of model has done to cricket. Cricket is now watched by people who are already cricket fans, and by the children of bill-paying cricket fans. Unless their parents subscribe, kids can’t just turn on the cricket these days – but it is impossible to behold the giant SkyPad and not think it was all worth it.</p> \n<p>Even so, that the Olympic movement should have gone down this route feels like a particularly black form of self-parody. More than any other event, the Olympics is about the competitors, their journeys, their backstories, their struggles to compete in sports with minimal remuneration. Placing these behind a paywall radically diminishes their reach.</p> \n<p>As far as the viewership goes, meanwhile, it’s not just about convincing those who love rowing – it’s about entrancing those who have never got in a boat but might be inspired.</p> \n<p>You would have more luck convincing the majority of Olympic viewers to subscribe to Crochet Weekly than an Olympics channel in the run-up to any Games. Yet the minute it starts, something magical always happens. People who don’t even usually watch sport become obsessive about archery or handball. Watching the curling becomes a collective experience as bonkers as it is beautiful – and its being free to air is the <em>sine qua non</em> of that.</p> \n<p>Alas, this is not in line with the drive of modern sport broadcasting. Sports are now sold as “have to have”, whereas in the past their universal availability cast them as “I might just experience”. The possibility of seeing something for yourself and being able to get into it without recourse to a bill-payer is vanishing. Thus the parcelling of sport becomes another way to stratify society, to make children the products of their parents’ pockets.</p> \n<p>When the pay-TV rights holders have finished carving payment packages up into distinct sports, as the direction of travel indicates will effectively happen, how easy will it be to be part of different communities – to love cricket and football, to pony up for the Premier League and still have enough left over for the cricket or the Olympics or whatever in the past might have freely taken your fancy? The near extinction of the working-class actor is much commented on; perhaps the working-class cricket watcher will be next to go.</p> \n<p>Unless you have the funds for all of it, you will be a football household, or a cricket household, or an athletics household (and yup, there’ll be loads of athletics households). Many will be households where watching sport is not possible.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, for all the IOC waffle about how the money will benefit the athletes, only the terminally optimistic will not wonder how quickly the broadcasting tail will wag the dog, and less watchable sports will find themselves the poor relation to those deemed more bankable.</p> \n<p>Experience tells us the IOC will roll over, given its tendency always to ally naturally with the powerful at the expense of the powerless – by which we mean the athletes. Bach was punitively opposed to athletes making protests at Sochi, for instance, but apparently intensely relaxed by Putin using the entire event for political purposes.</p> \n<p>“Why did I restore the Olympic Games?” Pierre de Coubertin inquired rhetorically. “To ennoble and strengthen sports, to ensure their independence and duration, and thus to enable them better to fulfil the educational role incumbent on them in the modern world.” A vision just made for the slogan: “ONLY ON EUROSPORT”.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/7/1/1435744094873/Jessica-Ennis-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Inspired by Jessica Ennis's London 2012 triumph?

It looked to be a familiar tale for the bottom club as they fell 16-0 behind after conceding tries to Kirk Yeaman, Jordan Rankin and Liam Watts inside the first 17 minutes.</p> \n<p>But they hit back with four unanswered tries of their own through Jacob Miller, Richard Owen, Joe Arundel and Matty Ryan to win 26-16, their first league success since February.</p> \n<p>“There is a lot of relief in there,” said Smith, who was in charge of his third match. “There’s been a lot of people working for that, chiseling away and trying to get over the hump for 16 games.</p> \n<p>“ The players have been working hard to get there and they had to work the hardest way, coming from 16-0 down but they did it well in the end.</p> \n<p>We were very disappointing in those early minutes and I think I’ve got to look at myself and what I’m doing there because that’s three really sluggish starts in a row.”</p> \n<p>“So I need to review it with Stuey [Dickens] and Lee [Gilmour] and the other staff to see if we can work out a different way to start a game because that is the hardest way to play football. For a team that’s down on confidence to concede tries as softly as we did and then come back is like running uphill the whole game.”</p> \n<p>Former New Zealand international full-back Kevin Locke, one of three debutants, was named the sponsors’ man of the match but he agreed with his coach that the award flattered him.</p> \n<p>Locke, who joined the Wildcats on a short-term deal after securing a release from his unhappy time at Salford, struggled at times in his first match for two months but played a key role in two of Wakefield’s tries.</p> \n<p>Smith added: “I spoke to Kev after the game and told him they had named him man of the match and he said ’wait until I’m fit’.</p> \n<p>“He had some nice touches but Kevin was well off his game at times tonight and understandably so.</p> \n<p>“It’s been a terribly emotional time for him, it’s been a big drain on him but he’s got a smile back on his face. Hopefully we can keep him in a really positive environment and he can continue to improve his game.</p> \n<p>“His knee is not his problem it’s just general fitness and sharpness.”</p> \n<p>While Wakefield remain rooted to the foot of the table, still seven points adrift of Salford, they will head for the run-in in buoyant mood, starting with a return game against Hull at the KC Stadium on Sunday.</p> \n<p>That is now a must-win fixture for Hull, who missed the chance to climb out of the bottom four, just a week after crashing out of the Challenge Cup in dismal fashion.</p> \n<p>“I’m deflated hugely,” Hull coach Lee Radford said. “We had highlighted the importance of this fixture and what a difficult this place is to come to. Our record at this ground is terrible. It’s always a dogfight here and I expected to scrape it if we were going to get a result.</p> \n<p>“But after that 15-minute period we didn’t give ourselves a chance to get any momentum back. Our completion rate was 60 per cent again. That’s two weeks on the spin now and that’s not good enough.</p> \n<p>“Our energy looked fine at the start but a couple of calls went against us, a couple of uncharacteristic mistakes and back-to-back penalties and before you know it the game has gone.”</p> \n<p>Hull also had prop Mickey Paea placed on report for a tackle that left former team-mate Danny Washbrook concussed but Radford does not expect any repercussions.</p> \n<p>“He has got nothing whatsoever to worry about, there was nothing in it,” Radford said. “He’s not gone over the horizontal and Washy hurt his head on the floor.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435793641418/Wakefield-Trinity-Wildcat-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jacob Miller scores one of Wakefield's four unanswered tries to help his team fight back to win 26-16.
