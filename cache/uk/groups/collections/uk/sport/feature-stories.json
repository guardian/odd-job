The tournament organiser says an announcement on the new broadcasting contract is imminent and the most financially lucrative competition in the sport outside the World Cup is expected to remain available to all viewers.</p> \n<p>The contract with the BBC, which is worth &pound;40m a year, runs out in 2017. Sky had been regarded as the favourite to gain the rights after the Six Nations committee revealed that, for the first time, the bidding would be opened to pay-TV companies. It hoped the move would generate a substantial increase in the value of the tournament which the three Celtic unions have come to rely on increasingly to fund professional and amateur rugby in their countries at a time when England, especially, and France are financially buoyant.</p> \n<p>The expectation that BT and Sky would bid against each other and force up the price did not materialise. The former, which broadcasts the Premiership and has co-rights for the European Champions Cup with Sky, did not respond while the latter’s offer was deemed to be too low to justify the public outrage, and potential damage to the growth of the sport, that would follow taking the Six Nations off free-to-air television.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/mar/28/six-nations-format-rfu-chief-executive\">Six Nations format will not change, says RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The final round of bidding finished last week. The BBC’s offer was less than Sky’s, made just before the government announced that the corporation would have to pay the &pound;650m it costs to supply pensioners over the age of 75 with a free television licence, a sum that is 20% of its central income.</p> \n<p>As Sky’s bid was not substantially higher, the BBC opened talks with ITV, regular World Cup broadcasters whose only other foray into rugby is a Premiership highlights programme. ITV had no interest in bidding for the whole tournament but it was prepared to join forces to keep rugby’s oldest international tournament on terrestrial television.</p> \n<p>Their combined offer trumped that of Sky, which will lose out unless it comes back with an eleventh-hour, improved offer. It is the organisers’ hope of that which has delayed the announcement after a conference call at the end of last week but with Sky, like BT, reluctant to be drawn into bidding wars after spending billions of pounds on football rights, there has been no response.</p> \n<p>If the BBC and ITV succeed in securing the Six Nations rights it may mark a turning point in what has become a one-way flow in sport on television, with subscription stations hoovering up more and more non-protected rights.</p> \n<p>The BBC has this year lost the rights for golf’s Open Championship to Sky from 2017 while the Ashes, which starts in Cardiff on Wednesday, will be available live only to viewers who have Sky.</p> \n<p>While the Six Nations remaining on mainstream television would please politicians and supporters, the Celtic unions will be left to weigh up the cost. They had hoped Sky, which this season won the rights to screen the Guinness Pro 12, a tournament made up of sides from Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Italy, would make a significant bid for the Six Nations at a time when the three are having to find extra resources to fund professional teams below international level.</p> \n<p>One consequence of the reorganisation of the European Cup last year was that clubs in France and England now receive substantially more income from the tournament, with the proceeds now divided between the three leagues that supply the competitors rather than the six unions the teams come from.</p> \n<p>The Pro 12 attracts significantly less television income than the Premiership or the Top 14 in France and came close to losing its two Italian sides, Treviso and Zebre, before the Italian Rugby Federation last week paid money owed to the other three unions after a long stand-off.</p> \n<p>With Irish provinces no longer dominant in Europe where France, in the form of free-spending Toulon, have come to hold sway, the Celts, who have won every Six Nations since the last World Cup, are looking to maximise all revenue opportunities and while they will receive more from the Six Nations, it is set to be less than they had anticipated.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436298756396/Rugby-Union---2015-RBS-Si-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ireland's Paul O'Connell celebrates with the 2015 Six Nations trophy.

The 21-year-old has, after all, won the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/13/jordan-spieth-masters-augusta-justin-rose-phil-mickelson\" title=\"\">Masters</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/21/us-open-2015-jordan-spieth-wins-in-thrilling-finish-to-add-to-masters-crown\" title=\"\">US Open</a> already in 2015. He is now the favourite to prevail at St Andrews, on account of McIlroy’s injury.</p> \n<p>“I went into Chambers Bay as the most recent major champion and I go into this one as the most recent major champion. Why should it be any different?” asked Spieth when the subject of background noise ruining his Open tilt is raised.</p> \n<p>Spieth’s familiarity with the Open venue, the Old Course at St Andrews, stems more from computers than reality.</p> \n<p>“I have got a full swing simulator in my house,” Spieth explained. “I have played a few holes at St Andrews, made the fairways and greens firm. I was able to see some of the lines off the tees. Obviously it is not the same as being there but at least I get to see some of the holes so when I get there I’m not too surprised. I played it once but that was a long time ago.”</p> \n<p>Spieth has admitted a McIlroy non-appearance at the Old Course would “dampen” the Open spectacle. The American youngster has also been candid about the potential impact of being so strongly in pre-event focus. “I’ve been trying to get off the radar,” Spieth told the Golf Channel. “I spent some time at home, let the US Open sink in then took off with some friends to the Bahamas for the first time.</p> \n<p>“I have come back and worked hard with [Spieth’s coach] Cameron [McCormick] this last week, got my body right in the gym. All in all, it has been a perfect two weeks.”</p> \n<p>Dwelling on success wasn’t at the forefront of Spieth’s mind. “A little bit but at the same time I realise we have a chance to do something that no one has done,” he said. “So there is no reason to sit back and think too much about it versus preparing for the next goal.”</p> \n<p>Spieth’s build-up will involve an appearance at the John Deere Classic this weekend. The Illinois event is close to his heart; Spieth was afforded wildcard entry there as an amateur. The tournament also provided his maiden win as a professional. He will fly direct to Scotland after close of play on Sunday.</p> \n<p>“The best preparation for me is just getting into contention the week before the Open,” he added. “That’s what we did before the Masters, second place in San Antonio and Houston with a chance to win. I finally capitalised with everything firing at Augusta. At the Memorial, I was in contention before the US Open so this is an important week where I want to get my game right, get everything firing on all cylinders and then adjust to the conditions at St Andrews.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436288291679/Jordan-Spieth-of-the-US-w-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jordan Spieth is preparing to play at St Andrews in the Open Championship.

The first British-Asian to be appointed to the 14-strong board, he will replace Lord Morris.</p> \n<p>The drive to better connect the ECB with new players and teams, including those who might not naturally support England, will form part of Harrison’s strategic review of all areas of the elite and recreational game.</p> \n<p>In order to get people playing cricket more often, there will be continued investment into the successful Chance to Shine charity that seeks to expand the sport in schools. It is aiming to raise &pound;25m over the next five years to invest in schools and community cricket.</p> \n<p>But there is also expected to be more emphasis on ways to increase interest in the sport outside the established club structure, with an emphasis on parks, street cricket and – in particular – beach cricket. Since 2005-6, Sport England figures show that the number of adults playing cricket at least once a month has declined from 380,300 to 259,200.</p> \n<p>Even more than other team sports, it faces challenges in terms of facilities and attracting young players at a time when the amount of cricket played in state schools has historically been in decline.</p> \n<p>The ECB’s new director of participation and growth, Matt Dwyer, who was recruited from Cricket Australia, is expected to join the ECB later this month.</p> \n<p>Dwyer will have full overall responsibility for increasing participation in all aspects of the recreational game and is also expected to be involved in a drive to better connect sponsors and commercial partners with the grassroots game. In Australia he also led sales and marketing teams for a range of brands including Mars, Diageo and Nestle.</p> \n<p>Like other sports, cricket has also been disproportionately hit by cuts to local-authority budgets that have affected the maintenance of park pitches during the summer. When the former chairman Giles Clarke, now the ECB president, and the former chief executive, David Collier, initially signed an exclusive deal with Sky in 2005 to televise international and domestic cricket, they promised to use the riches to grow participation and the recreational game. But as numbers continue to decline, there is an appetite among the new ECB hierarchy for a fresh approach.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436292447199/Strauss-Press-Conference-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's director of cricket Andrew Strauss and ECB chief executive Tom Harrison will welcome Lord Patel of Bradford.

Martin Dwyer, who was unseated in the same incident, also went to hospital for x-rays on an arm.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436289763433/Nick-Rust----008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nick Rust, the British Horseracing Authority's chief executive, has established a punters' forum.

In his 200th game, the 2012 Brownlow Medallist only had nine possessions as St Kilda mauled Essendon by 110 points.</p> \n<p>That inevitably led to speculation about what effect the club’s ongoing supplements crisis was having on Watson. But it emerged on Tuesday that Watson had hurt his shoulder the previous weekend in the loss to Hawthorn.</p> \n<p>The star onballer aggravated the injury early in the St Kilda match and scans confirmed the should needs a season-ending operation.</p> \n<p>“His MRI [scan] unfortunately shows that he has an unstable shoulder and has significant damage,” club doctor Bruce Reid told the Essendon website. “He saw [surgeon] Greg Hoy this afternoon and that meeting determined he will require surgery.”</p> \n<p>Watson said it was frustrating he could not help Essendon turn around their massive form slump. Sunday was their fifth-straight loss and they are in major trouble with a 4-9 record. “When you can’t be out there to help rectify it, it’s disappointing,” he said.</p> \n<p>Watson also called on his team-mates to rally in the last nine rounds of the season. “I understand the expectations going into the year haven’t matched the output,” he said.</p> \n<p>“But we’re hoping the guys will be able to find some form and the effort we’ve shown in patches can be sustained for full games. Looking at the last half of this year, we want to hopefully see that sort of effort and sustained consistency, which will make us a lot more competitive.”</p> \n<p>Coach James Hird, who has received strong backing from Watson since the St Kilda disaster, said other players must now step up and fill the breach. “We all feel for Jobe, he is such a tremendous leader of our club, and for his season to be ended prematurely is obviously a big blow for him personally,” Hird said.</p> \n<p>“It’s certainly tough to replace a leader and player like Jobe. But given the circumstances we currently find ourselves in, it presents members of our playing group with the opportunity to showcase their leadership and ability to respond against Melbourne on Saturday.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3a1257755ec5e1495c55e5df19774d5d87111856/0_0_3358_2018/3358.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2018,"width":3358,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Adam Trafford/AFL Media/Getty Images","altText":"Jobe Watson’s 200th game for the Bombers, against St Kilda Saints at the weekend, proved bittersweet.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Adam Trafford/AFL Media/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-08T01:01:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-08T04:43:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":11,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["AFL","Essendon","Australian rules football","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/afl","webTitle":"AFL"},{"id":"sport/essendon","webTitle":"Essendon"},{"id":"sport/australian-rules-football","webTitle":"Australian rules football"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/afl-essendon-lose-injured-captain-jobe-watson-for-season","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aeqb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/08/afl-essendon-lose-injured-captain-jobe-watson-for-season","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/08/afl-essendon-lose-injured-captain-jobe-watson-for-season"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/df2d4e11226284c8bbfdbb5084a0d930e926441a/0_0_4838_2908/4838.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2908,"width":4838,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jobe Watson’s 200th game for the Bombers, against St Kilda Saints at the weekend, proved bittersweet.
