But at every club that is interested in Petr I can find a player that I like in that team, too.”</p> \n<p>Mourinho added that he aims to recruit three players this summer to ensure his Premier League-winning team do not lose their appetite. He also expressed his satisfaction that none of his key men are likely to leave. “I think [the most important business] is done, which is to keep the players I want to keep. In other seasons I was very happy to sell a few players, even good players. This season I’m not happy to sell my best players so that is the real challenge to keep them.</p> \n<p>“If I keep Hazard and Matic and Ivanovic and Diego Costa, F&agrave;bregas; if I keep all of these important players for us that’s the first target. I think then we need three players. A striker, because we lost our legend [Didier Drogba], a defender and a midfield player. Give a little bit more competitiveness to the squad, bring some new blood in, put some players a little bit under pressure. They know they have someone waiting, I need that to support my way of working. Now they’re the champions I need that. But basically [Chelsea will have] the same squad, the same team, the same manager, stability in the club.”</p> \n<p>Mourinho, speaking at BT Sport studios at an event to announce that he will provide analysis for the channel as it begins exclusive live coverage of the Champions League and Europa League, also called for the introduction of a winter break to help English sides go farther in European competitions.</p> \n<p>The Chelsea manager believes they arrive at the knockout stages of tournaments more drained than their European counterparts and would like the Premier League to pause in January, allowing players to recharge without sacrificing traditional festive period fixtures.</p> \n<p>“I love our football in December,” said Mourinho. “But the reality is that when the other teams are coming into the second part of the Champions League they are very fresh after a good rest; after a second pre-season they are not tired. We are sometimes physically and mentally tired and it is more difficult for English clubs. English clubs did it in the past and will do in the future but it is more difficult for us. We could do something after the new year. We can still play five or six matches in two weeks – amazing Boxing Day matches and so on – but after that we should do something to give the players a little bit of a break.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859495051/peter-cech-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chelsea's Petr Cech claims a cross against Arsenal in a league game at the Emirates Stadium.

It’s nothing serious, just a little bump and a bruise but it will prevent him from running in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud.</p> \n<p>“With a horse like him who gives everything in his work and racing, you have to be sure everything is 100 per cent otherwise you can have serious problems. He can only do light work for a few weeks now so I think he will be off until the end of July.”</p> \n<p>Cirrus Des Aigles has won seven Group Ones and Barande-Barbe has raised the possibility of trying to add an Irish success to his tally when he is back to full strength later in the year.</p> \n<p>She added: “It is difficult to say when he will be back and where he will go, but we have not forgotten about the Irish Champion Stakes. Maybe he will have a race before that, we will have to see, but that could be an option.”</p> \n<h2>Wednesday’s best bets, by Chris Cook</h2> \n<p>So, &pound;11m for a new all-weather track. It seems an enormous sum of money but a hard-nosed business like ARC is hardly likely to take a flier on something like that, so we must imagine they expect to make a long-term profit from their resurfacing at Newcastle.</p> \n<p>Everyone else in racing is mulling the use to which they could have put that &pound;11m. <a href=\"http://www.britishpathe.com/video/dear-old-ally-pally/query/ally+pally\" title=\"\">I wonder how much it would cost to reopen this old place</a>. I don’t suppose the idea appeals to many jockeys but I have a feeling it would attract spectators.</p> \n<p>The resurgence of Pat Dobbs continues, the veteran jockey riding a double at Salisbury yesterday, three days after the first Group One win of his 18-year career. Richard Hannon may have put him aboard another winner in <strong>Steal The Scene (3.10)</strong> at Haydock.</p> \n<p>This one won a handicap at the fifth attempt at Leicester a fortnight ago, with a degree of comfort that suggested the switch to a fast surface made a big difference for him. He’s up 8lb, although that still only puts him 3lb ahead of the initial rating he got after his maiden win in August and he looks one to stick with, so long as Haydock’s expected good to firm turns out to be just that. He’s 5-1 as I type.</p> \n<p>In the following race, <strong>Birdman (3.40)</strong> may be able to resume winning ways at 9-2. He won his first three after joining David O’Meara this year but was then beaten on soft ground at Ripon, having arguably been given a bit much to do.</p> \n<p>He’s still more than a stone below his peak rating and I can see him scoring again, now that he’s back on fast ground and the jockey is hopefully satisfied that he can trust the horse’s stamina.</p> \n<p>I’m surprised to be getting 7-1 about <strong>Ski Slope (8.10) </strong>for the familiar Hannon and Richard Hughes combination at Kempton tonight. She didn’t get a clear run and stayed on into fifth on her Salisbury reappearance, which is, I concede, not the most inspiring effort.</p> \n<p>But Hannon horses can come on plenty for their reappearance run and this filly was having her first start for 11 months. One month later, she should be quite a bit straighter and I don’t think she’s harshly weighted. She won her maiden on Polytrack, at Lingfield.</p> \n<h2>Tipping competition, day three</h2> \n<p>Our winners so far:</p> \n<p>Monday</p> \n<p>Tiger Jim 15-2</p> \n<p>Dawn’s Early Light 9-1</p> \n<p>Foxtrot Knight 7-2</p> \n<p>Tuesday</p> \n<p>Maybelater 6-1</p> \n<p>Perfect Bounty 7-2</p> \n<p>Cyflymder 11-4</p> \n<p>And our leader is …</p> \n<p>yasmin11 +19.25</p> \n<p>… who has had four winners out of six so far, including Maybelater and Cyflymder yesterday.

The plans have been held for a long time by Newcastle’s owners, ARC, but were <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/sep/02/-newcastle-flat-turf-all-weather-track\" title=\"\">frustrated last year by a technicality in racing’s rules</a>.</p> \n<p>That technicality, requiring at least one race beyond a mile on each card, has been overcome by an agreement with racing’s rulers that some twilight or floodlit cards will start earlier than normal, allowing at least one race to be run on the round course while daylight allows. Under present proposals, only the track’s straight mile is to be floodlit.</p> \n<p>Newcastle’s turf Flat track has been much praised by trainers and its loss is a cause of sadness and anger to many. Ralph Beckett was one of several who took to Twitter, saying it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RalphBeckett/status/608226493576159232\" title=\"\">“difficult to think of a more depressing announcement for the sport”</a>, while Ed Vaughan described ARC’s plan as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edvaughan1/status/608238800096129025\" title=\"\">“an act of vandalism”</a>. The Yorkshire-based Tim and Mick Easterby also expressed regret and suggested they would rather have seen an all-weather track at Catterick, where rival plans for such a development now seem much less likely to proceed.</p> \n<p>William Haggas acknowledged that trainers in the north need an all-weather track closer than Southwell but said: “Surely this isn’t the answer. The only way we can stop it is to not support it. It will have to be a desperate situation for me to go there. Never say never but I certainly won’t be leading trainer there.</p> \n<p>“Field sizes will suffer as the horse population shrinks and opportunities increase. You could be a blind man and see that. And this will impact on the all-weather tracks in the south, as the Johnstons and the Faheys won’t come down as they have done.”</p> \n<p>Of ARC, which owns or manages 15 tracks, Haggas said: “They will take fixtures there from their other tracks and they’ll close another track eventually, they won’t do it immediately. It’s tragic.”</p> \n<p>But Susannah Gill, ARC’s director of external affairs, insisted there were no plans to close any tracks. While accepting that two, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2012/jul/27/folkestone-hereford-racecourses-close-down\" title=\"\">Folkestone and Hereford, had been closed soon after ARC was created in a merger in 2012</a>, Gill said “the business is now in a stage of investment”. Some fixtures are likely to be moved from Southwell to Newcastle but Gill said Southwell would remain viable and pointed to planned investment this autumn in the Nottinghamshire track’s flood defences as a sign that it remained part of ARC’s plans.</p> \n<p>No opening date has been set for the new Newcastle, as the progress of works will depend on the severity of the coming winter. Its jumps fixtures will be moved elsewhere, with the Fighting Fifth Hurdle expected to be at Doncaster this November, but will then return to Newcastle, where the jumps turf track will remain.</p> \n<p>The Northumberland Plate, Newcastle’s most high profile Flat race, will be run on the new surface, likely to be Tapeta, and not on the turf of the jumps course, as had been suggested . Officials decided it would be too expensive to maintain the jumps course through the summer and that the necessary watering might prove detrimental.</p> \n<p>The North Yorkshire-based Richard Fahey, who trained last year’s Plate winner, stood out from his rivals in welcoming the news. “I think we need [an all-weather track] and whether that is at Newcastle or not, we had to get one sooner rather than later,” he said. “If no other course wants to take the bull by the horns and set the wheels in motion, I don’t see why it shouldn’t be Newcastle.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433869023560/Horse-Racing---Newcastle--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Newcastle racegoers will soon see only all-weather racing on the course's turf track.

We were told before the tournament we would be protected and we’re disappointed that we haven’t been in the first game.”</p> \n<p>While he was similarly dismayed by England’s latest defeat against a side they haven’t beaten since 1974, Sampson remained determined to take positives from a reverse against a team ranked third in the world.</p> \n<p>“The result wasn’t that good, not that good at all,” he said. “But we’ll take lots of positives from the game. We restricted world-class opponents to one goal. The way the team defended, the way they managed the game was outstanding. Our goalkeeper hasn’t had to make world-class saves. We have a platform on which to build momentum. We need to tidy a few things up. But this performance shows who far we’ve come. We’ll learn a lot from it.”</p> \n<p>England only had three shots all game – with just one on target – but even that statistic refused to dampen the optimism of a coach who replaced a frequently bold approach with containment tactics and a 4-1-4-1 system.</p> \n<p>“We want to score goals and be creative,” said Sampson. “And we need to find some attacking solutions. But we have to respect our opponents.

As we grow into the tournament we’ll find more rhythm.</p> \n<p>“We were disappointed to concede a goal scored during a transition when we were trying to counterattack but let’s not take away from the quality of the 20-yard finish. [Eug&eacute;nie] Le Sommer is a very good player and we’ve been punished with a great finish.</p> \n<p>“It was the first game of the tournament, it was as strong a wind as I’ve found in any international and both teams found it hard to progress up the pitch because of it. It was a game of limited chances and the wind made it very difficult. But we can improve.”</p> \n<p>Following the defeat, England’s forthcoming Group F games against Mexico in Moncton on Saturday and Colombia in Montreal next Wednesday have become all-important.</p> \n<p>Sampson said: “We’ll be prepared to face a very good Mexico team. I know my team, I know exactly how we’ll play. We’re excited and when we take on the big guns again we’ll find a way to win.”</p> \n<p>The coach also appealed for possibly underwhelmed English television audiences to “stick with us”, pointing out that England were never out of the game: “We were in it until the end. We were playing a world-class team with a very well-organised physically strong defence and they put five in midfield towards the end.</p> \n<p>“It’s disappointing because we felt we could come here and get a win but it was a high quality international. It was a strong England performance. We showed great solidarity and are in excellent physical condition.</p> \n<p>“We’ve had to answer question after question about the fitness of certain players but I think we’ve put them to bed now.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433883402315/Frances-Camille-Abily-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"France's Camille Abily, right, went unpunished after elbowing England's Laura Bassett in the face during the opening match in Group F.

On a day when the wet, windy weather proved rather too quintessentially English for the liking of Mark Sampson’s players, France also proved infuriatingly typical.</p> \n<p>England have not beaten their neighbours from across the Channel since 1974 and the slenderness of the scoreline, with the two side’s separated only by Eug&eacute;nie Le Sommer’s first-half strike, disguises the superiority of a French side now clear favourites to top Group F. Granted <em>Les Bleus</em> could have had Camille Abily sent off for a snide elbow on Laura Bassett but by then victory was all but secured.</p> \n<p>While this defeat is not exactly disastrous Sampson will be concerned by the lack of chances his team created and knows that, if they are to progress, England must up their game in subsequent group fixtures against Mexico and Colombia.</p> \n<p>The Welshman is big on surprises and true to his reputation as the great rotator of the women’s game, he chose Moncton as the venue for unveiling a brand new England formation. This 4-1-4-1 system featured Lucy Bronze, normally a right-back or central defender, stationed wide on the left of midfield, Ellen White, usually a centre forward, on the right wing and Fara Williams sitting deep in the quasi-sweeping role.</p> \n<p>Initially at least it certainly succeeded in fazing a France team deployed in characteristic 4-4-2 guise. Assiduously closed down by Sampson’s personnel, Philippe Bergeroo’s side were at first forced to resort to a series of unusually long, rather aimless, balls.</p> \n<p>If Eniola Aluko was struggling in a rather thankless lone attacking role for England, at least Jill Scott was making her presence felt in central midfield. It was largely thanks to Scott that France took time to settle into a familiar slick passing groove in front of a disappointingly small crowd in Moncton.</p> \n<p>A 13,000 sellout had been predicted but the ground looked barely half-full with locals largely opting to stay away. This bilingual city in the eastern “Maritime” Canadian province of New Brunswick had appeared the ideal venue for these teams but with dark rain clouds hovering in the humid skies and a capricious wind blowing, the residents of the French speaking suburb of Dieppe and English speaking Riverview had evidently decided to stay indoors.</p> \n<p>An initially slow start vindicated their decision but, almost imperceptibly, the entertainment value rose. As the rain shower which had greeted kick-off finally, if temporarily, cleared so France began emerging from their shells. Suddenly remembering how to retain possession, they began moving the ball around too slickly even for Scott.</p> \n<p>England’s defence received a warning when Le Sommer unleashed a left foot volley. It was deflected to safety off Alex Scott but shortly afterwards Louisa N&eacute;cib showed off a cute dummy and dispatched an awkward cross shot which had Karen Bardsley sprawling to save.</p> \n<p>Then came the sort of moment Sampson must have dreaded. Attempting to pass her way out of defence, Bassett played Katie Chapman into trouble and the midfielder swiftly conceded possession to Le Sommer. From 20 yards she proceeded to squeeze a splendid rising shot inside a post.</p> \n<p>With Scott and the outstanding Claire Rafferty in particular fighting back, all was not lost. Yet as intelligently as Rafferty, back at left-back following her recovery from a third ruptured cruciate ligament, was defending against the dangerous &Eacute;lodie Thomis her side were up against it.</p> \n<p>Although England did have one first-half scoring chance – shot wide by Chapman – they had Bardsley to thank for reacting smartly to keep Abily’s shot out.</p> \n<p>While France continued to rather hog the ball in the second half, England increasingly pacified their key players. Le Sommer, however, simply refused to be subdued and, having forced Bardsley into another decent save she soon directed a volley slightly off target.</p> \n<p>In between Gallic interchanges Scott was presented with a shooting chance but could only direct is straight at Sarah Bouhaddi, the France goalkeeper. That was a shame as with Wendie Renard excelling in central defence for her side such openings were always going to be few and far between.</p> \n<p>The moment for Sampson to switch things around had arrived and Toni Duggan came on for the selfless White.</p> \n<p>England’s coach had made much of his team’s ability to switch to Plan B mid-match and the subsequent introduction of a forward, Fran Kirby, for Alex Scott served to emphasise this.</p> \n<p>A shift to 4-3-3 ensued but England were very lucky that Abily’s menacing, seemingly goalbound volley was fortuitously deflected off course by Steph Houghton.</p> \n<p>Not that the France bench will have been too upset – it appeared that Abily had elbowed Bassett in the preamble and they were surely relieved to have escaped what could have been a red card.</p> \n<p>With Le Sommer withdrawn, France – now with five in midfield – seemed content to hold on for a deceptively narrow win. Such containment tactics can prove high risk but the only threat England could muster was a shot from Aluko which flew high and wide. It seemed entirely emblematic of their afternoon.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433876676751/Eugenie-Le-Sommer-of-Fran-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Eugenie Le Sommer of France (No9) celebrates scoring the winning goal against England in the 2015 Women's World Cup.

It was a day where records tumbled and New Zealand fumbled, a performance so majestic that – if watched in isolation – it would dupe Trevor Bayliss into thinking he has been given the easiest job in world cricket.</p> \n<p>England secured victory in this first of five one-day internationals against New Zealand <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/09/england-v-new-zealand-first-odi-live\">by a record 210 runs</a> – their biggest margin – in a swashbuckling style that was anathema to the previous regime. Morgan’s side compiled England’s best ODI total of 408 in an innings that will live long in the memory, thanks to superb centuries from Jos Buttler and Joe Root, hitting a record 14 sixes before closing the match out with ease under Birmingham’s evening sun.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/09/england-v-new-zealand-first-odi-live\">England v New Zealand: first ODI – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is perhaps too early to herald a new dawn for English one-day cricket but, at the very least, this was a significant step forward from the previous era. England batted fearlessly, looking to attack at every opportunity, yet this was no mere slog-fest, even if the boundaries flowed and the shots dazzled. Buttler and Root produced wonderfully crafted innings before the guile of Steven Finn and Adil Rashid dismissed the tourists for 198.</p> \n<p>For all the talk of new blood, it was familiar faces that flourished in the new environment. A penny for Peter Moores’ thoughts as Root and then Buttler tore New Zealand’s attack to shreds, only months after the Black Caps dismantled England so emphatically during the World Cup.</p> \n<p>Jason Roy and Sam Billings – the latter making his ODI debut – managed three runs between them, while Roy went for a diamond duck, and it is certainly a damning indictment of the former set-up that those who earlier this year played with such trepidation suddenly appeared so liberated.</p> \n<p>“You can look back and say what you want about the World Cup, but I’m looking forward,” said Morgan. “There’s about 90 games until the next World Cup and we need to get some games into this team.”</p> \n<p>Roy, playing in his second ODI, dabbed at a full ball outside off-stump and found Martin Guptill at backward point, who took a smart low catch from the first ball of the match. Yet although Roy will undoubtedly be bitterly disappointed, his early dismissal ultimately did not prove costly.</p> \n<p>With England two down, having amassed 50 runs, the prospect of such a sizeable total would have been laughed out of the ground. Instead, Root and Morgan were at the crease and Brendon McCullum, never afraid of the unorthodox, was on the attack.</p> \n<p>The England captain – and McCullum’s close friend – was his target, having endured a miserable run of form with the bat that coincided with the team’s World Cup malaise. During the early stages of Morgan’s innings here, he faced an aggressive off-side field of a slip, gully, point, short point and cover; yet under pressure he eased England forward. His 121-run partnership alongside Root was a calming influence at a decisive moment.</p> \n<p>However, it was Root and then Buttler who undoubtedly stole the show, with Rashid providing a fine cameo. These three innings were certainly polarised in stylistic terms but each contributed significantly to England’s total, as New Zealand floundered in the field where previously on this tour they have appeared so assured.</p> \n<p>Root played with stunning poise, the Yorkshireman’s timing flawless through the covers. He may have ridden his luck on a few occasions – edging wide of slip before being dropped in the deep by Ross Taylor – but his was an innings reflective of a man in tremendous form, an unflustered, almost nonchalant, exhibition of one-day batting.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/eoin-morgan-outstanding-england-new-zealand-first-odi\">Eoin Morgan hails ‘outstanding’ England victory over New Zealand</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Root’s 104 from 78 balls ended when he was caught behind off Trent Boult, the only Kiwi bowler to emerge from this defeat with any credit. But despite losing Ben Stokes for 10 before Billings’ dismissal, New Zealand – who had taken four wickets for 31 runs – could not capitalise on a brief shift in momentum once Buttler arrived at the crease.</p> \n<p>The wicketkeeper was imperious. He scored 129 from 77 balls, including five sixes and 13 fours, battering the Kiwis from one end of the ground to another. The spinners were the main victims, the debutant Mitchell Santner and Nathan McCullum unable to find a chink in Buttler’s armour, but no one was spared.</p> \n<p>Boult said of Buttler: “He’s as good as anyone on their day to take apart a bowling unit. Hits all around the ground, which the best players do. Hard to shut down, running in hot form and a significant person to scout.”</p> \n<p>He reached his century in 66 balls, the second fastest England ODI in history behind his own 61-ball record set against Sri Lanka last year. It was a devastating display of flair and by the time Buttler skied one from Mitchell McClenaghan and Rashid had added a quickfire 69, England were flying, securing a record seventh-wicket stand.</p> \n<p>New Zealand’s task was ominous and, although they began quickly, their desire to score did for them in the end. Finn and Rashid took four wickets apiece, with Taylor the only New Zealand player to reach a half-century.

You can’t get 3D-printed handlebars moulded to your own arms to make it easier for your own attempt.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/bradley-wiggins-uci-hour-record\">Sir Bradley Wiggins smashes Alex Dowsett’s Hour record</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Asked if he thought British Cycling preferred Wiggins to Dowsett, Collins said: “Oh yes, completely.”</p> \n<p>Wiggins rode titanium handlebars custom-made through a process similar to 3D printing but which others call “additive manufacturing” on the cycle produced by Pinarello, the Italian bike manufacturer.</p> \n<p>“We had to do full documentation for the UCI detailing every component; every bit of the bike and kit was approved by the UCI down to the shoes, helmet and skinsuit. The bike is fully approved by the UCI,” a source close to the Wiggins bid responded. “The handlebars are made under a new manufacturing process, but Pinarello are offering this commercially through their MOST brand. It was the first time this had been done at this level, but a full mountain-bike frame was made in this way last year, and parts for bikes have been made in this way in the US and Australia.”</p> \n<p>The Bolide HR used by Wiggins to beat Dowsett’s distance by more than 1.5km can be found on the UCI website on page 14 of its list of approved frames and forks. <a href=\"http://www.uci.ch/inside-uci/rules-and-regulations/equipment-165067/\">The entry states that the frame was registered on 21 May this year</a>.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457085126__\n</div> \n<p>In a statement, the UCI said in a statement: “Bradley Wiggins’ bike and equipment were thoroughly assessed by UCI officials before and after the UCI Hour Record attempt and were judged to be fully compliant with UCI regulations.”</p> \n<p>Custom-made titanium bars similar to those used by Wiggins can be found on the Pinarello website on page eight of a section headlined <a href=\"http://www.pinarello.com/en/news/bolide-hrs-white-paper\">“Bolide HR’s White Paper”</a>. The text reads: “Standard technologies such as CNC or carbon moulding would be excessively long and expensive to produce this particular shape, so we use an additive manufacturing method also known as 3D printing to manufacture a titanium handlebar.</p> \n<p>“The capabilities of this technology allowed to produce [sic] a small batch of handlebars, every one different from the other. This method will be used to provide a similar service to Pinarello customers via the MOST parts brand.”</p> \n<p>Heiko Salzwedel, the British Cycling endurance coach who helped Wiggins prepare physically for the hour, rebuffed Collins’ claim that the Olympic gold medallist had received preferential treatment from the governing body. “I’m a GB coach responsible for anyone with a British passport and anyone who asks me will get my support.</p> \n<p>“Brad isn’t involved with Team Sky any more, he doesn’t have the resources of a team like Dowsett’s Movistar and in his eyes this was a performance that helped him build to the [2016] Olympic Games so it was natural to help him. I didn’t reduce the time I spent with the team pursuit squad because they were training together; sometimes I spent more time with Brad but that would have been the same if it was Ed Clancy doing a record.</p> \n<p>“If Alex had asked me I’d have helped him, but he didn’t. He asked for his training times at Manchester and got them free of charge.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/9/1433843859844/Bradley-Wiggins--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bradley Wiggins gets his head down on his custom-built bike as he sets the hour record at the Velodrome.
