That is why I think it is clearly indispensable to follow through with the initiated process of president’s change as it has been announced,” Scala said on Sunday.</p> \n<p>His comments came after a Swiss newspaper reported an unnamed source close to Blatter as saying he had received messages of support from Asian and African associations asking him to rethink his decision and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/sepp-blatter-stay-fifa-president-swiss-newspaper\" title=\"\">had not ruled out staying on</a>.</p> \n<p>Fifa insiders swiftly branded the suggestion “nonsense” and in a statement world football’s governing body, in crisis since US prosecutors charged 14 officials, nine of whom are current or former Fifa executives, over widespread <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/27/several-top-fifa-officials-arrested\" title=\"\">bribery and fraud</a>, pointed to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/02/sepp-blatter-fifa-president-resigns\" title=\"\">Blatter’s announcement </a>on 2 June.</p> \n<p>In that statement, he said he would carry on until an extraordinary elective congress to be held between December and February next year. A Fifa executive committee meeting on 20 July will set the exact date. But Blatter was clear in his intention to “lay down my mandate” and stated: “I shall not be a candidate.”</p> \n<p>Scepticism from those insistent on fundamental reform is inevitable since Blatter also promised in 2011 that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2011/mar/22/sepp-blatter-fifa-president-2015\" title=\"\">his fourth term as president would be his last</a> before performing a U-turn and declaring <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/sep/08/sepp-blatter-fifa-fifth-term-re-election-confirms\" title=\"\">his “mission” unfinished</a>.</p> \n<p>Since Blatter announced his resignation, just four days after being re-elected as president, there has been great speculation within football as to his motives.</p> \n<p>Some have suggested he was buying time to find a way to cling on as president. Others believe that, despite the fact that some of his closest lieutenants are among those indicted by US authorities, he planned to use the time until the new election to ease a favoured successor into the post.</p> \n<p>Since Blatter’s announcement, made amid the fallout from the FBI investigation that alleged a “World Cup of fraud” going back two generations, world football’s power brokers have been circling one another and calibrating their next moves. The Uefa president, Michel Platini, has held meetings with the Kuwaiti Fifa executive, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/03/sheikh-al-sabah-fifa-powerbroker-sepp-blatter\" title=\"\">Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah</a>, who supported Blatter at the last election and is seen as the key powerbroker in Asia. Sheikh al-Sabah is also believed to have met with Issa Hayatou, the head of the Confederation of African Football.</p> \n<p>In his speech promising to stand down, Blatter referred to “far-reaching, fundamental reforms”, but he appears to be mainly focused on limiting the powers of the confederations around the executive committee table.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, there will be continued pressure on Blatter to stand down immediately, from within Fifa and without. Further revelations are expected as more US court documents are unsealed and the arrest and extradition process continues</p> \n<p>The Tory MP Damian Collins, a prime mover in the New Fifa Now campaign, said on Sunday: “We know Blatter will do all he can to try to retain influence over Fifa to protect himself and his cronies. He needs to go now.”</p> \n<p>However, even if Blatter were to stand down immediately, under Fifa rules his place as president would be taken by Hayatou, who has been closely associated with his regime for more than two decades, as the most senior Fifa vice-president until an election could be held.</p> \n<p>Adding to Fifa’s troubles last week, Interpol cancelled its relationship with the governing body and is, <a href=\"http://www.politico.eu/article/fifa-money-no-longer-wanted-at-interpol/\" title=\"\">according to a report by the newspaper Politico</a>, set to return some of the money it received from Fifa to help fight corruption in sport.

Under Wada rules, such drips are prohibited and anyone caught manipulating the TUE process to get one would be liable for a ban. She also claimed Salazar tried to get her to take prescription thyroid medicine to lose weight after the birth of her son.</p> \n<p>Stiner was the masseur who alleged he saw a bottle of Androgel, a testosterone gel, in Salazar’s training camp in Park City in 2008. And it was Magness who made the most serious allegation of all, telling Panorama he had documented evidence that Salazar had given the banned steroid testosterone to Rupp when he was 16.</p> \n<p>“I have never met Steve but from all accounts believe him to be an honest individual. I firmly believe that any and all performance-enhancing drugs activity within the NOP while I was there was limited to Galen Rupp,” Rohatinsky said.</p> \n<p>Among the charges against Salazar are that he gave the banned steroid testosterone to Rupp when he was 16, coached Rupp to get a TUE so he could use an intravenous drip before the 2011 World Championships and flouted several other doping rules. Salazar and Rupp deny all charges and there is no suggestion that Farah has done anything wrong.</p> \n<p>According to the American news website ProPublica, at least 17 people who have worked with Salazar have now spoken out against him. Rohatinsky, the latest person to come forward, said he had become particularly suspicious seeing Rupp win a 10,000m silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics behind Farah.</p> \n<p>“Watching that race live was surreal,” he said. “Seeing someone I had trained with consistently for two years not too long before – and beaten several times in races in the years prior to that in college – push through that last lap and accelerate on the homestretch to beat the likes of the Bekele brothers was incredible. And when I say incredible I mean it in the literal sense of the word. How does that amount of progress happen in that short a time frame? Supporters always point to hard work but we all worked our butts off. It reminds me of the Lance Armstrong commercial, What Am I On?</p> \n<p>“The entire time I was with the group there was always what I would call a wall of separation between Alberto/Galen and the rest of the group. Galen was very much Alberto’s son while the rest of the group were his athletes. In saying this I will give credit to Alberto, he worked his butt off for all of us and was very dedicated to taking care of the needs of everyone in the group. But that wall was always there and the level of secrecy and seclusion was definitely palpable.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile tThe chair of UK Athletics Ed Warner has told the BBC’s Sportsweek that his organisation had spoken to Farah “very frequently” over the past week and had no fears that he would return to top form later in the summer. “All things considered I think he’s in a good frame of mind in difficult circumstances,” he said. “He is going to get out there and show the great athlete he is in the summer, I am convinced of that.”</p> \n<p>But Lord Coe, who is running for the presidency of the IAAF, global athletics’ governing body, agreed it had “not been a good period” for the sport. He also admitted he would “probably not” sever ties with Salazar if he was in Farah’s shoes.</p> \n<p>“If Mo is satisfied that there’s nothing to answer then he will want to keep what has been an extremely good coaching and training relationship,” he said. “I’m sure he will be weighing all that up but dependent upon the answer Mo gives.

But the four trainers who have made the journey to take part at Ascot this week are also likely to have one eye on events back home, where the furore of alleged doping with cobalt is a story that has preoccupied racing professionals for months on end.</p> \n<p>The latest development came on Thursday when five people were formally charged by the stewards of Racing Victoria after a lengthy investigation. Among them was the trainer Danny O’Brien, whose Star Witness was placed in two different races at Royal Ascot in 2011. He now faces questions over four samples taken from his horses from October to December showing unusually high levels of cobalt, much higher than the permitted threshold introduced in April last year. Along with the others accused, he protests his innocence.</p> \n<p>Charges may yet be laid against Peter Moody, known in Britain as the trainer of the superstar sprinter Black Caviar, the sensation of Ascot in 2012, when she scrambled home by a head after her jockey stopped riding prematurely. One of Moody’s horses returned a high level of cobalt in a sample in October and stewards are still considering whether it would be appropriate to take action. A decision on that and a final hearing on the charges already laid are both thought to be some weeks away.</p> \n<p>Matters have proceeded at a stately pace but that seems appropriate, since cobalt doping is a very new phenomenon. Regulators in Australia and elsewhere are patently feeling their way toward the right way to deal with it.</p> \n<p>Unlike many other substances used to enhance performance, cobalt is naturally occurring in horses, so simply being able to detect its presence proves nothing. The suspicion is that some racehorses have had extra cobalt introduced into their systems because it is supposed to stimulate red blood cell production, leading to an EPO-like effect of delaying fatigue.</p> \n<p>At this early stage in our understanding of cobalt doping, even that outcome appears open to question. Unlike humans, greyhounds or racing camels, horses have the capacity to increase the percentage of red blood cells in their blood during strenuous exercise. In a racehorse at rest, that would typically be 40% to 45% but racehorses after exercise have shown levels of 65% to 70%. As a result, Dr Colin Roberts of Cambridge University, an expert in equine sports medicine, questions whether boosting the proportion of red blood cells still further would actually be helpful in racehorses, since the consequent increased blood viscosity may have adverse effects on the circulation.</p> \n<p>The general belief in racing is that cobalt doping does improve performance, although it is also thought to lead to long-term health problems for the horse involved. So far, the issue has been a live one only for regulators in Australia and parts of the US – but the racing world is small and, if someone has tried to gain an advantage by such means in those countries, it is thought likely to be a matter of time before someone tries it here.</p> \n<p>None of the trainers racing at Royal Ascot this week are involved in the Australian investigation but all are likely to be concerned. “It’s a very significant case,” says Robert Smerdon, whose Shamal Wind runs in the King’s Stand Stakes on Tuesday. “With the profile of those involved, it’s one of the biggest things we’ve seen in racing for a long time.”</p> \n<p>Smerdon’s understanding is that at least part of the defence offered by one or more of those charged is that high readings of cobalt can be triggered by the use of commercially available supplements which were not thought to pose an integrity risk at the time of use. “The scientific argument is beyond my capabilities but it will take a while to run.</p> \n<p>“Because it’s something new that we’ve never heard of before, the science has to be substantiated. How that defence stands up, we’re only speculating, looking in from the outside. Everyone is interested in seeing how it plays out.”</p> \n<p>Asked if he had any sense that others in Australian racing might be gaining an illicit edge, Smerdon said: “Not particularly. Every time a stable has a good run of success, there’s mutterings but then the horses from that stable reach the limits of their potential and someone else is winning.</p> \n<p>“I think [the sport] is very well governed and this is evidence of that. They are rigid, strict and regular in their testing and if they were head in the sand and negligent, those things would still be going on and there would be no accountability.”</p> \n<p>David Hayes, whose Criterion runs on Wednesday in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes, says of cobalt: “It’s definitely been about. I have great confidence in the regulators, they’re working very hard. What’s taken so long is that they’ve followed absolute procedural fairness. These guys are all innocent until proven otherwise and they’ll be given every chance to prove that they didn’t use it.”</p> \n<p>Jane Chapple-Hyam, from Melbourne but now long established as a Newmarket trainer, has been watching the story from afar but does not expect something similar to happen here. “English trainers would never even think of using cobalt,” she says. “I just don’t think it would ever enter their thinking. Why it crept into Australian racing, I’m led to believe it came in through trotting.</p> \n<p>“Australian racing has had phases with things like milkshakes and elephant juice, which, I don’t really know what that is but those things never seem to creep into English racing. Here, what you see is what you get in the final furlong.”</p> \n<p>The British Horseracing Authority hopes that is true but is nevertheless organising its defences. Robin Mounsey, the BHA’s spokesman, says that its testing regime and intelligence reports do not yet suggest that cobalt is being abused here but no one is assuming that will remain the case forever. Work is going on, in consort with other European regulators, aimed at establishing a threshold for cobalt by the end of the year.</p> \n<p>“It’s a serious potential threat to integrity,” Mounsey says, “which is why we’re taking it seriously and treating it as such.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434310421938/Spectators-watching-a-rac-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Spectators watching a race during the AAMI Victoria Derby Day at Flemington racecourse in October 2009.

The 30-year-old Swiss, now a mere 15 majors behind his compatriot Roger Federer, refused to declare on Sunday that he would add Wimbledon to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jan/26/stanislas-wawrinka-rafael-nadal-australian-open\">his Australian</a> and French titles – with good reason given his record there – nor would he even say he would beat the rising but injury-prone young Australian Nick Kyrgios in the first round at Queen’s on Tuesday.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/13/andy-murray-grass-season-queens-wimbledon\">Andy Murray welcomes the grass season and hopes for rub of the green</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>No, Wawrinka, who has risen from No8 to No4 in the world and is playing some of the best tennis of his life, was just happy to talk about his shorts. If an article of clothing can define an athlete, the plaid shorts he donated to the Roland Garros museum after beating the world No1, Novak Djokovic, in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/french-open-2015-stanislas-wawrinka-novak-djokovic-win\">the French Open final</a> last Sunday fit the bill.</p> \n<p>They will forever be associated with that classic match and their story is part of the Stan The Man legend.</p> \n<p>He could wear them this week, he said, but has not made up his mind. “I have some white clothes for Wimbledon, that’s for sure,” he said, with a nod to the tournament’s insistence on traditional garb.</p> \n<p>When he unveiled his now-famous shorts at Monte Carlo two months ago they were widely derided. Who goes to work in his pyjamas, the fashionistas and others asked. “[It’s] a funny story: now [the shorts] are sold out – something that no one likes … It’s a strange world.”</p> \n<p>As for his tennis, it is universally admired and he could hardly be in a better place, mentally or physically, as he attacks the short grass season over the next month. Life as the unexpected winner of the Coupe des Mousquetaires in the 114th edition of the French Open has been not much different.</p> \n<p>“It was a normal Monday in Paris, a lot of press, pictures. Tuesday I took a flight early morning to do something with Evian, my sponsor. Came back home Tuesday, late. Then on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday I was spending time with my family, with my daughter, and doing some fitness.”</p> \n<p>His <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/stanislas-wawrinka-novak-djokovic-french-open\">family life has been anything but normal</a> since the very public break-up of his marriage in April but Wawrinka seems to have compartmentalised it well enough. There are some players who would have struggled to see off Djokovic, the runaway best player in the world, in the final of a slam with such private baggage to deal with but Wawrinka looks to have found peace of mind on the court, hitting the ball harder than just about anyone in the game.</p> \n<p>He will find the next few weeks more demanding than the past few, however, moving away from the more comfortable environment of clay to a surface on which he has had only sporadic success since losing to Miguel Angel L&oacute;pez Ja&eacute;n, a Spanish clay-courter ranked 462 in the world, in the second round of a Futures event 14 years ago.</p> \n<p>This is his third visit to Queen’s, where he lost to the eventual champion, Grigor Dimitrov, in the semi-finals last year and to James Ward in the second round four years ago.</p> \n<p>As for Wimbledon, he has never much enjoyed the experience in 10 campaigns, going out five times in the first round, including a shock exit in straight sets two years ago at the hands of Lleyton Hewitt, who was an off-court admirer as he went through his single-handed backhand repertoire here on Sunday. Last year Wawrinka got to the quarter-finals for the first time, losing to Roger Federer in four tight sets.</p> \n<p>He has reached the fourth round at Wimbledon twice, the last time losing to Andy Murray in five sets in 2009. He views that record with the same equanimity as he does his gathering fame and celebrated successes elsewhere – and he retains the respect, bordering on suspicion, for any opponent that all but a few elite players know.</p> \n<p>He says of his opening match in the Aegon Championships against Kyrgios: “It’s a tough, tough first round, a big challenge. It’s going to be interesting because it’s the first time I am going to play him. He loves to play on the grass. He has been practising and he’s ready for that. He played so well last year [when he beat Rafael Nadal in the fourth round] and he loves the big matches. We will see how I adapt. If it’s not raining too much, I can practise enough and see how I get ready for this one.”</p> \n<p>So it will be a day like most others for one of the game’s most amenable characters – and one of its most devastating hitters, too.

With King John entombed beneath, Worcester has a special reason for celebrating the octocentenary of the signing of Magna Carta and, if the mathematics tell that to ring all the permutations would require 479,001,600 changes and more than 30 years of continuous ringing, then the four hours they did boom out was more than adequate to do the job.</p> \n<p>Whether, as with Quasimodo, the bells affected the batsmen of Worcestershire is a moot point. But not long after they started to sound out the scoreboard read 104 for one with Daryl Mitchell and Moeen Ali purring along at getting on for four runs per over. By the time the final change had rung, however, the last two Worcestershire batsmen were traipsing into the dressing room for a late tea, the innings having subsided to 243 all out after nine wickets fell for 139 in 37 overs.</p> \n<p>There were some well-oiled runs, though, from Moeen, who made 45 before a languid dismissal, and a maiden half-century of considerable promise from the 19-year-old Joe Clarke. A prolific presence in the second team, where he is the only Worcestershire player to make two double hundreds,Clarke is now in his second first-class match and his first at New Road.</p> \n<p>In the quiet of the evening, as some dark clouds rolled in threateningly, the Worcestershire bowlers in turn made substantial inroads into the Warwickshire innings, thanks to an incisive spell with the new ball from Joe Leach. He took the wickets of Varun Chopra, Ateeq Javid and Laurie Evans at a cost of 18 runs, with Jack Shantry claiming the wicket of Jonathan Trott for a third-ball duck.</p> \n<p>There was the later sight of Saeed Ajmal, whose arm was once as straight as Tony Soprano, now operating with it like a gun barrel, a little higher now than the prototype that was first demonstrated using a white ball against Bangladesh.</p> \n<p>This is his first first-class game since Pakistan’s Test match against Sri Lanka in Galle in August, and the test will be to see how much of his deception remains now that he is deprived of his doosra.</p> \n<p>His presence, though, will surely have an impact on the amount of bowling Moeen can get, overs he sorely needs to regain the sort of bowling rhythm he produced last summer.</p> \n<p>Warwickshire finished the day on 101 for four, with Ian Bell unbeaten on 46, and nicely placed to capitalise on the second day. With 14 wickets in the day, there is the prospect, perhaps, of a visit from the pitch inspector, although many of the dismissals owed more to carelessness than any capriciousness in the surface. Thus far Bell and Tim Ambrose, 31, have added 66 for the fifth wicket.</p> \n<p>Given the unruffled manner in which Mitchell and Moeen were progressing the collapse, which began with the Worcestershire captain’s careless dismissal right on lunch and was continued with three more wickets immediately after, was unexpected. Moeen, in particular, had looked in silky touch, driving and hitting seven boundaries with time to spare before he, like Mitchell, clipped tamely to mid-wicket.</p> \n<p>It took a sparky stand of 53 in nine overs between Clarke and Leach to revive the innings. The former was well organised and straight in defence, hitting nine fours in a 61-ball 50 before he seemed to check a short-arm pull against Boyd Rankin.</p> \n<p>He made such clean connection nonetheless that the ball just pinged from his bat straight to Trott on the deep square-leg boundary.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434306736610/Joe-Clarke-Worcestershire-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Worcestershire's Joe Clarke, 19, hit nine fours in his 50 in the first innings against Warwickshire.

His fellow Tasmanian seamer Ted McDonald took the last of his three for the county in 1930.</p> \n<p>In fact, another Tasmania player, Jack Simmons, is also on the list. “Flat Jack” played 19 first-class matches for the state between 1972 and 1979.</p> \n<p>Although Lancashire ended on top at the end of a day when 44 overs were lost to weather, it could have been better after they reduced Leicestershire to 78 for five before lunch, with Bailey taking three, including the key pair Umar Akmal (13) and Mark Cosgrove (26), and Jarvis removing both openers.</p> \n<p>The former Lancashire batsman Andrea Agathangelou was determined to prove a point, having been released from Old Trafford at the end of last season after four years with the club. Agathangelou, a South African-born Cypriot, struggled to hold down a first-team place with his first county. He scored only two 50s and one century in 21 first-class matches, and it says a lot that this composed 54 off 66 balls was his first county 50 on this ground.</p> \n<p>He shared 87 inside 21 overs for the sixth wicket with Raine, who made 26, either side of lunch to take the score to 165 for five before edging Bailey behind for his fourth wicket.</p> \n<p>Play is scheduled to start 90 minutes later each day of this match as Lancashire attempt to attract more spectators into the ground for the final session. There was always a fear that light could be an issue on overcast days such as this, and bad light accounted for 42 of the 44 lost overs.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434309469973/James-Faulkner-Lancashire-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"James Faulkner took a hat-trick as the home side reduced Leicestershire to 207 on a light-affected first day at Old Trafford.
