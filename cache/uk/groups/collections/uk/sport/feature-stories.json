After Guerrero’s early double, his striking partner Jefferson Farfan grazed a post with a low shot and then rattled the crossbar with a curling free-kick. </p> \n<p>Bolivia’s best chance came from a Moreno header which Peru goalkeeper Pedro Gallese did well to parry. The Bolivians rallied slightly in the second half and had a good appeal for a penalty turned down after Gallese appeared to bring down midfielder Pablo Escobar as he headed goalwards. </p> \n<p>There was no way back for Bolivia after Guerrero completed his treble, however. </p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/76ad7d61655207758ad263f274f9fbe642541150/0_545_4466_2683/4466.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2683,"width":4466,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Natacha Pisarenko/AP","altText":"Three goals from Paolo Guerrero were enough to down Bolivia at the German Becker Stadium in Temuco, Chile.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Natacha Pisarenko/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-26T01:56:49Z","lastModified":"2015-06-26T02:42:17Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Copa América","Peru","Bolivia","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/copa-america","webTitle":"Copa América"},{"id":"football/peru","webTitle":"Peru"},{"id":"football/bolivia","webTitle":"Bolivia"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#005689","matchStatusPre":"#676767","matchStatusDuring":"#4bc6df","matchStatusAbandoned":"#da1d1d","matchStatusPost":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"football"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/26/copa-america-peru-beat-bolivia-to-reach-semis","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a65h","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/26/copa-america-peru-beat-bolivia-to-reach-semis","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/26/copa-america-peru-beat-bolivia-to-reach-semis"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/76ad7d61655207758ad263f274f9fbe642541150/0_545_4466_2683/4466.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2683,"width":4466,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Three goals from Paolo Guerrero were enough to down Bolivia at the German Becker Stadium in Temuco, Chile.

So cue a fightback from the Dragons, who in the second half played how they usually do at their home games in Perpignan, leaving the majority of those inside the ground with barely any fingernails left come full time.</p> \n<p>But the Rovers held on to move into their first Challenge Cup semi-final since 2006, and one win away from a first Wembley appearance since 1987. Their first-half performance alone showed that few, if any, of the other three teams to make the semis would fancy Hull KR standing between themselves and the Cup final, and they showed the character required late on to edge a thrilling contest.</p> \n<p>“These blokes are going to be the death of me,” their coach, Chris Chester, joked. “The first half was so dominant; we put them under plenty of pressure but the second half was really sloppy. However in the cup only one thing matters and that’s the win and being in the next round of the competition.”</p> \n<p>Catalans left themselves with too much to do after that first-half blitz from the home side, which means their sole focus is ensuring they finish inside Super League’s top eight. Once again their form in England remains a concern, which inevitably jeopardises any chance of mounting a title challenge later in the year.</p> \n<p>“It was pretty hard to come back from, too hard in fact,” their coach, Laurent Frayssinous, said of the first-half meltdown. “I’m pretty proud because the boys had a dig to stay alive in this competition but the gap was simply too big. There were some poor things on the field from a lot of people in the first half, I watched some strange stuff in the first half. The Challenge Cup is over for us but what we can control is to ensure we finish in the top eight.”</p> \n<p>A four-try blitz in the first half from the home side ultimately gave them the cushion they needed to progress, with Ken Sio, Kieran Dixon and Albert Kelly putting them into a commanding 18-0 lead inside the first quarter.</p> \n<p>Catalans rallied and tried to assert some sort of authority on the game but they were helpless to prevent Hull KR’s fourth try through Graeme Horne soon afterwards.</p> \n<p>The impressive Krisnan Inu gave Catalans something to build on at the break with a well-worked try and tension increased among the home fans after the restart with two more tries through Zeb Taia and a second for Inu.</p> \n<p>Hull KR were on the ropes but when the impressive Kelly found Sio with a superb cut-out pass he crossed for his second and gave Hull KR some much-needed breathing space.</p> \n<p>The Dragons would not buckle, however, and tries from Ian Henderson and Elliott Whitehead either side of a penalty goal from Josh Mantellato set up a dramatic finish.

The 18-year-old from Switzerland came back to win 2-6, 6-0, 6-3 in front of her champion compatriot, Martina Hingis, who knows a thing or two about the challenges that face teenage tennis prodigies.</p> \n<p>Hingis, who won Wimbledon in 1997 when she was 16, likes what she has seen this week. Bencic had already defeated Madison Keys, the defending champion here, and Eugenie Bouchard, a finalist at Wimbledon last year, before derailing Konta.</p> \n<p>Can she win her semi-final against Caroline Wozniacki on Friday? Do not rule it out, although the world No5 was in ominous form in her 7-5, 6-1 dismissal of the 10th seed, Andrea Petkovic.</p> \n<p>There was no shame in defeat for Konta, who can be optimistic about her chances of making it past the first round of Wimbledon for the first time, and she will wonder what might have been achievable if she had been in better health.</p> \n<p>Konta called for the trainer after finding herself on the wrong end of a bagel in the second set and had her blood pressure checked in the testing heat on the south coast. She later revealed that she has been on antibiotics since Sunday.</p> \n<p>“My energy levels just got very depleted and I just wanted to check that I wasn’t going to faint out there, because that would have been embarrassing,” Konta said. “Credit to Belinda, because she really stepped up her level when she needed to.”</p> \n<p>Konta was like a rocket with a fuel leak after a cracking first set, and she ran out of gas with alarming speed before she teased the spectators with a dramatic but brief revival at the start of the decider. As much as she was willed to soar higher and higher by the crowd, gravity quickly dragged her back down.</p> \n<p>There are 115 places between Konta and Bencic in the rankings and her plummet back to earth came with a heavy thud. But what a start Konta made.</p> \n<p>She swept into a 0-40 lead in the first game and although Bencic fought back to deuce, Konta broke with a forehand winner. The omens were good: she also hit the ground running in her wins over Ekaterina Makarova, the world No8, and Garbi&ntilde;e Muguruza, the world No20.</p> \n<p>Bencic was struggling and the first set was over as a contest when she knocked a forehand wide on break point to trail 5-2. Konta was having joy with her crunching backhands, both crosscourt and down the line. Her forehand stung Bencic too and she was serving well.</p> \n<p>By the end, however, only 56% of Konta’s first serves had gone in. Konta beat Bencic in straight sets in Eastbourne last year but the Swiss has improved since then, reaching the quarter-finals of last year’s US Open and shooting up the rankings.</p> \n<p>Konta faded from view, figuratively and literally, taking a toilet break after winning the opening set and Bencic took control. The Bencic bounce began when two double-faults from Konta gifted her a break and the world No31 levelled the match with a rasping backhand return off an inviting second serve.</p> \n<p>Bencic was solid defensively, appreciating the value of making her opponent play one more shot, and Konta made problems for herself with some stinking drop shots.</p> \n<p>There was another plot twist, though, Konta rousing herself and earning five break points in the first game of the third set. Bencic was teetering again. She received a code violation for coaching and threw her racquet to the ground after netting a backhand.</p> \n<p>Yet she held on and sealed the decisive break by whipping a forehand past Konta in the sixth game of the set. There were gasps from the crowd when Bencic slipped and fell heavily in the next game, then when Konta spurned a break point. It was all Bencic required.</p> \n<p>Konta lives in Eastbourne and she would have loved to have gone further but there was honour in defeat. The 24-year-old’s win over Makarova on Tuesday was the finest of her career and she heads to Wimbledon with her confidence as high as it has ever been.</p> \n<p>But first for Eastbourne’s denouement. There is a strong look to the last four, with the other semi-final between Agnieszka Radwanska, who thumped Tsvetana Pironkova 6-2, 6-2, and Sloane Stephens, who advanced when Daria Gavrilova pulled out with an abdominal strain.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435241608115/Johanna-Konta-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Johanna Konta receives medical treatment during her 2-6, 6-0, 6-3 defeat to Belinda Bencic at Eastbourne.
