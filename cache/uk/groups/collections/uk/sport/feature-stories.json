He will be dangerous in the first week of Wimbledon if he gets a favourable draw.</p> \n<p>This, though, was Kevin’s time to talk. “I play good tennis against him. I can take a lot of confidence from that and take that same sort of belief against some of the other top guys. I’ve played these guys a lot of times. It gives me confidence knowing the guy I beat today just won the French Open – and watched him beat the best players in the world doing it.</p> \n<p>“The times I have played him, I’ve served very well. I have been aggressive from the back. But we have had close matches. When he has time setting up from the baseline, he’s very dangerous. That’s something I try to do, take time away from him. The last six slams he’s won two and Novak has two – and nobody else has that. So you can make a pretty strong case that he’s really proved himself to be one of the top four guys in the world.”</p> \n<p>Wawrinka did not play badly – he hit 11 aces of his own and scored only 10 fewer points than the 94 Anderson fashioned – but it is tough to get into a match when an opponent is trying to take your head off with every serve. Neither could break serve outside the tie-breaks.</p> \n<p>Not many players are involved in four losing tie-breaks, in singles and doubles, in one day, but Wawrinka was surprisingly upbeat after he and Grigor Dimitrov later went out to Marcin Matkowski and Nenad Zimonjic, 7-6, 7-6. And, with the self-deprecation that has marked his career, the French Open champion ranked his favourites for Wimbledon, with no mention of himself, as Djokovic, Roger Federer and Andy Murray – in that order.</p> \n<p>“Novak is No1,” he said. “I’m sure after losing the French Open final he wants to come back and win the next big one. Roger, even if he lost a few matches this year, I’m sure he’s going to be ready for the grass. And Andy because he loves grass, playing at home, already won Wimbledon. He’s playing really well this year.”</p> \n<p>For now at least, Thanasi Kokkinakis is a name tough to spell but easy to appreciate. Although the young Australian with the Murray stamp of approval went out 6-4, 6-2 against the former world top-tenner Gilles Simon, he left us with a few shots to savour, then, after his doubles defeat in straight sets with Lleyton Hewitt, looked forward to catching up on sleep after an extraordinary round-the-world hike these past few days.</p> \n<p>Asked to explain how he could not build on a blinding start before going down in flames after only 76 minutes, Kokkinakis was commendably candid. “Yeah,” he said in his Adelaide drawl, “it went all downhill from there.”</p> \n<p>Seven aces and four double faults from only nine service games told a story of a tired young man in a hurry; Kokkinakis had dashed from Rome to Australia for 30 hours with his family, who have been gathering around his ailing grandmother, and completed a 48-hour round trip when he landed in London on Monday afternoon – and went straight out and beat J&eacute;r&eacute;my Chardy 6-7, 6-2, 6-4.</p> \n<p>However, the No7 seed, Simon, proved a Frenchman too far, breaking him four times. “I started really well,” Kokkinakis said. “I was relaxed and free and played a couple of stupid points on my service game. I really needed to put the foot down at 2-0.</p> \n<p>“He started growing in confidence and I started to get negative, to get tighter with my shots, and didn’t feel like I was swinging freely at all.</p> \n<p>“I was a little bit fatigued but my ball striking wasn’t great either.</p> \n<p>“I’m not going to use that too much as an excuse. I felt bad for everyone watching really. It was a bit disappointing. It was one of my poorest performances in a while.”</p> \n<p>Oh, and he had the distraction of Jeremy Clarkson sitting not far from his box. What chance did he have?</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/770a40680a045188673274715e2f2ac79137ba06/0_0_3440_2064/3440.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2064,"width":3440,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP","altText":"South Africa's Kevin Anderson, gestures at match point against Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka, during their men's Singles tennis match of the Queen's tennis championship, in London, Wednesday, June 17, 2015.

The grass-court season remains woefully short, which explains why Andy Murray was happy to lap up some more time on the surfaceon Wednesday as he prepares to go up another level at Queen’s Club on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Murray takes on Fernando Verdasco in the second round of the Aegon Championships, a man he has beaten 10 times out of 11 but who almost ruined Murray’s march to the Wimbledon title two years ago <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/03/andy-murray-wimbledon-fernando-verdasco\" title=\"\">when he led by two sets to love</a>. A brilliant shot-maker, the left-handed Spaniard may not be as consistent as he was when he earned his one win over Murray, in the last 16 of the Australian Open in 2009, but he remains dangerous, with one of the biggest forehands on Tour.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/17/kevin-anderson-stan-wawrinka-queens-wimbledon-french-open\">Kevin Anderson does for Wawrinka at Queen’s and makes a case for Wimbledon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Having looked solid enough in his first-round win over Lu Yen-hsun of Taiwan, Murray admitted he will need time to find his top form on grass, even though it is a surface he loves and even though Queen’s is a tournament he has won three times. His form over the past few months suggests he should be able to handle Verdasco and he sharpened up by playing doubles with Dominic Inglot against the No1 seeds here, Bruno Soares and Alexander Peya.</p> \n<p>Their 6-4, 7-6 defeat will not have pleased either man but for Murray it was useful match practice and he should be sharper for it on Thursday. For Inglot, it was a first match in more than two months after a knee injury and a chance to put himself back in the mix for Britain’s Davis Cup quarter-final against France, back here at Queen’s the week after Wimbledon.</p> \n<p>Having played in the win over the USA, alongside Jamie Murray, Inglot said the Davis Cup was his main goal, a brave statement considering Wimbledon is just around the corner. Britain’s captain, Leon Smith, was keen for Murray and Inglot to play together here and the big-serving Englishman knows that a good performance at Wimbledon could put him back in pole position.</p> \n<p>“I think that position for the Davis Cup is really up for grabs,” he said, acknowledging that Colin Fleming and Jonny Marray are also in the hunt. “Because anybody can step up and if they have a good tournament it’s going to be tough for Leon to say: ‘Well, I can’t rule that guy out.’”</p> \n<p>Nine of the 16 wildcards into the main draw of Wimbledon were announced on Wednesday, with few surprises. Five of them went to Britons, one to the 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt and another to the Frenchman Nicolas Mahut, he of the 11 hours and five minutes marathon match with John Isner in the first round in 2010. It is the 11th grand slam wildcard of Mahut’s career, another record.</p> \n<p>James Ward, Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady were the British recipients on the men’s side while Jo Konta and Naomi Broady will go straight into the women’s draw, guaranteeing them at least a cheque for &pound;29,000. It is a welcome payday but, having adjusted its criteria for recommending wildcards to decide each one on a case-by-case basis, the LTA hopes to see at least a few going through to round two and beyond. Laura Robson is expected to be given one of the four remaining women’s wildcards, providing she comes through her return to action in Eastbourne this weekend without aggravating the wrist injury that has kept her out of competitive action for 17 months.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434569464175/Andy-Murray-left-and-Dom--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray, left, and Dom Inglot on their way to defeat in the doubles at Queen's on Wednesday.

The Prince of Wales’s Stakes here on Wednesday fell straight into the second category as Free Eagle, who beat The Grey Gatsby by a short-head, has just five races behind him and a wealth of possibilities in the months to come, yet it is still impossible to be sure whether he was the best horse on the day, or The Grey Gatsby was the most unfortunate.</p> \n<p>Just nine runners went to post after California Chrome, last year’s Kentucky Derby winner, was ruled out with an injury earlier in the week, and both Kevin Ryan, the trainer of The Grey Gatsby, and John Gosden, who saddled the third home in Western Hymn, suggested afterwards that his absence robbed the contest of vital pace. Without California Chrome, the gallop looked stop-start at best, and while Pat Smullen had Free Eagle ideally positioned to get first run on his field, Jamie Spencer, on The Grey Gatsby, was forced to wait for several strides while Western Hymn held him in. Once clear, Spencer and The Grey Gatsby charged after Free Eagle and were ahead a stride past the line, but Free Eagle was still a short-head in front when it mattered. </p> \n<p>It was not so much a case of Spencer getting anything wrong as Smullen doing everything right in the context of the race as a whole. Free Eagle was also racing for the first time since October having reached the track just twice in each of his first two seasons, and Dermot Weld, his trainer, had good reason to be pleased with his careful preparation of the four-year-old. </p> \n<p>“He got a brilliant ride from Pat,” Weld said, “he’s a very good horse and when you’ve a brilliant horse like him, it makes the training easy. But he has had a lot of problems. He had a heavy head cold a couple of weeks ago and I thought today was going to be in doubt, but we got him right on the day that matters. He was just underdone, you can’t force fitness.” </p> \n<p>The victory allowed Weld to complete the unusual feat of saddling a Grade One winner at Cheltenham in March and a Group One winner at Royal Ascot in the same year. He will now aim Free Eagle towards the Irish Champion Stakes and the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, two races that he has yet to win in a 43-year training career. </p> \n<p>“I’ll probably give him a break now because I rushed him a little bit for today,” Weld said. “It would be wrong to say I’d run him in the Eclipse or the King George, the worst thing now would be to run him back in two weeks and expect him to do the same again. We’ll give him a chance and train him for the Irish Champion or the Juddmonte International and then the Arc de Triomphe.” </p> \n<p>Ryan refused to dwell on what might have been. “I’m not disappointed and you probably think I should be,” Ryan said, “but I’ve got the horse back to his best and I’m looking forward to the big races ahead. </p> \n<p>“He’s in the Eclipse, the King George and the Juddmonte, but it’s unfortunate that we don’t have a pacemaker for him. Over the first two furlongs, I thought they were going a good gallop, but then they half pulled up, and my horse was locked up. Jamie would have liked to get out a lot earlier, but you can’t barge your way out and that’s the rub of the green in racing.”</p> \n<p>Frankie Dettori was forced to wait until the final race on the second day to get off the mark for the meeting, but he enjoyed the moment as Osaila’s late run snatched victory in the Sandringham Handicap and moved Dettori to a half-century of -winners at the Royal meeting. </p> \n<p>Dettori is not even halfway towards Lester Piggott’s remarkable total of 116 Royal Ascot winners, recorded in an era when the meeting was staged over four days rather than five. His delight was still obvious, however, amplified perhaps by the fact that Always Smile, beaten by a nose in a desperate finish, was carrying the blue colours of his former employer, Godolphin. </p> \n<p>“I was quite happy this morning and then everything went wrong,” Dettori said. “Euro Charline wouldn’t go in the stalls in the Duke of Cambridge Stakes and I thought it was going to be one of those days. I knew this filly had a great chance and she won brilliantly, so I’ve got it off my back. </p> \n<p>“Al Shaqab [Racing, the owner of -Osaila] saved my career, so it means a lot. Fifty, what a big number.” </p> \n<p>Harry Herbert, the racing manager for Al Shaqab, said that Dettori, who won his second Derby at Epsom aboard Golden Horn less than a fortnight ago, is “riding at the top of his game” this season. </p> \n<p>“He’s looks great, he’s hard as nails, he’s having the year of all years,” Herbert said. “It just shows that when your confidence is with you in any sport, then things will happen.” </p> \n<p>Ryan Moore, who had a treble on the opening day of the meeting, added two more winners as Acapulco stormed home in the Queen Mary Stakes and Gm Hopkins edged out Temptress in the Royal Hunt Cup. </p> \n<p>Acapulco is the latest precocious juvenile to emerge from Wesley Ward’s stable in America, and like the same trainer’s Jealous Again in 2009, she dominated her field in the Queen Mary, an event for two-year-olds. </p> \n<p>Acapulco’s physical superiority was such that before the race, she looked like an army fitness instructor amongst a platoon of raw recruits. Even Ward seemed to forget afterwards that it had been a sprint for juveniles. “I think she’s got a big, big future on the turf,” Ward said. “Certainly this is what she wants and she’s a beautiful, gorgeous filly. If you look at her, she looks like she’s four, not three.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fd61d2b1d93dac098c9052ce3eb38b3fea88f191/178_96_2862_1717/2862.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1717,"width":2862,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Hugh Routledge/REX Shutterstock/Hugh Routledge/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Mandatory Credit: Photo by Hugh Routledge/REX Shutterstock (4849285bj)\r\n(L) Free Eagle (Pat Smullen) wins The Prince of Wales's Stakes from (R) The Grey Gatsby (Jamie Spencer) on Day 2 of Royal Ascot. 17.6.15.

The four-year-old showed formidable strength from the turn for home on that occasion to power past Forever Now.</p> \n<p>It seemed a truly run contest and, on the strength of it, Mizzou seems unlikely to have any problems with the extra half-mile he tackles this time.</p> \n<p>His trainer, Luca Cumani, has masses of experience with quality stayers and felt he had a Gold Cup horse in his yard when Mizzou was progressing through handicaps. This is where we find out but odds of 11-2 are twice what you can get about Forgotten Rules.</p> \n<p>The French raider Bathyrhon is in a similar boat to the favourite, inasmuch as we don’t yet know whether he can cope with a fast surface, but his credentials are excellent in other respects. He looks a bit over-priced at 11-1.</p> \n<p><strong>2.30</strong> Trainer Richard Hannon, who won this last year in his first season with a licence, has a couple of highly talented juveniles in King Of Rooks<strong> </strong>and Log Out Island. Given that most horses from the yard, including King Of Rooks, have needed their first runs, it is greatly to the credit of Log Out Island that he was able to win a strong race here on his debut last month. But preference, even at shorter odds, is for the more experienced <strong>King Of Rooks</strong>, whose latest success at Sandown was by five lengths over Buratino, this week’s Coventry winner.</p> \n<p><strong>3.05</strong> <strong>Time Test’s</strong> victory in the London Gold Cup looks a strong piece of form and he is expected to do better for that reappearance outing. The only horse to beat him in his last three starts was Latharnach, runner-up in a Group One this week. Time Test seems to be heading towards races of that class too.</p> \n<p><strong>3.40</strong> Pleascach is a worthy favourite on the strength of her Irish 1,000 Guineas win, when she had the subsequent Oaks winner, Qualify, behind her. The main concern is that that strongly run 18-horse Classic must have taken something out of her and this is asking quite a bit, less than four weeks later, which is not accounted for her in her odds. <strong>Curvy</strong> appeals at 8-1, having turned over a Derby candidate on The Curragh last month, her third win this year. She is a half-sister to a previous winner of this race, as well as to an Irish 2,000 Guineas winner, so it can hardly be a surprise if she has the necessary quality, and there is every chance that this extra quarter-mile will suit.</p> \n<p><strong>5.00</strong> Here is a big chance for Barry Hills to get a Royal Ascot winner in his last year as a trainer, as <strong>Sahaafy</strong> finished strongly in a handicap on Newmarket’s straight mile last month and should have more to offer, despite an 11lb rise.</p> \n<p>5.35 Beaten only by Time Test at Newbury last time, <strong>Dissolution</strong> should appreciate this step up in trip and can return to winning ways with Ryan Moore back in the saddle.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434559285465/The-Royal-Ascot-Meeting-2-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The bunched finish to the Royal Hunt Cup at Ascot on Wednesday.

The pairing of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/19/toulon-leinster-european-champions-cup-leigh-halfpenny\" title=\"\">defending champions, Toulon</a>, with Leinster, Bath and Wasps in Pool 5 of the European Rugby Champions Cup could not be juicier and there is more than enough intrigue elsewhere to suggest a stirring tournament awaits from mid-November onwards.</p> \n<p>While there is the small matter of a World Cup in the interim, every Premiership club will have to brace themselves for an intense examination.</p> \n<p>Bath and Wasps may be among the best attacking sides domestically but running Toulon ragged in the Stade Mayol is a very different matter. At Twickenham last month the French side became the first team to win <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/02/clermont-auvergne-toulon-european-champions-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">three successive European titles</a> and their flanker Steffon Armitage will not be alone in relishing the prospect of a return to English soil.</p> \n<p>On top of everything else there is set to be an early reunion between Paul O’Connell and several of his Ireland team-mates when the experienced lock’s new club clash with Leinster. With the South African No8 Duane Vermeulen the latest big name to sign up for a stint beside the Mediterranean, it will require a startling effort by someone to drag Toulon – whose fitness coach Paul Stridgeon will be assisting Wales with their World Cup preparations – back into the chasing pack.</p> \n<p>The draw in Switzerland – Neuch&acirc;tel is European rugby’s organisational hub these days – has also reunited the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/30/bath-saracens-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">English champions, Saracens</a>, with Ulster, the home province of Sarries’ director of rugby, Mark McCall, and Toulouse, who beat them twice at the same stage in 2013-14.</p> \n<p>With the newcomers Oyonnax having just finished sixth in the Top 14, ahead of the likes of Bordeaux-B&egrave;gles and Montpellier, away wins are not going to come easy. One bonus for Sarries is that the French club will be operating on an artificial 4G surface next season, similar to the one McCall’s side play on at Allianz Park.</p> \n<p>Northampton and Leicester, for their part, will both be heading to Paris for crunch games, having been drawn with Racing 92 and Stade Fran&ccedil;ais respectively. Given Stade have just been crowned French champions and the Tigers’ itinerary also includes a trip to meet Munster at Thomond Park, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/nov/24/aaron-mauger-leicester-tigers-head-coach-new-zealand\" title=\"\">Leicester’s incoming coach, Aaron Mauger</a>, faces a daunting introduction to his new role.</p> \n<p>The Saints, beaten home and away by Racing this season, will be up against the Paris-bound New Zealand fly-half Dan Carter and their director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, is already predicting another tough slog for his Northampton side. “Their budget means they can afford to have two internationals in every position. Their team will be formidable, regardless of who starts.”</p> \n<p>So tight are the other pools that Exeter’s head coach, Rob Baxter, sounded almost relieved to be paired with Clermont Auvergne, Ospreys and Bordeaux-B&egrave;gles. “Looking at some of the other groups I wouldn’t say it’s the worst in the world for us,” said Baxter, whose side conceded 92 points in their two pool games against Clermont two seasons ago. The Chiefs will be forewarned this time, having further boosted their squad resources with the signing of the 22-year-old St Helens centre Josh Jones on a two-year-deal.</p> \n<p>Newcastle Falcons, meanwhile, face a potential trip to Siberia for their Challenge Cup pool fixture against the Russian qualifiers Enisey-STM. Their opponents are based in the distant city of Krasnoyarsk, although the average winter temperatures locally may lead to the fixture being moved to the Black Sea resort of Sochi. By comparison, the Russians will find Tyneside in January positively balmy.</p> \n<p>The finals of both 2015-16 competitions will be staged in Lyon’s soon-to-be-opened stadium, on 13 and 14 May, with the 2017 finals already earmarked for Edinburgh. Plus, because of difficulties in selling tickets for last month’s final in Twickenham, the gap between the semi-finals and the final has been widened from two weeks to four.<strong>Champions Cup</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Pool 1</strong> Saracens, Ulster, Toulouse, Oyonnax</p> \n<p><strong>Pool 2</strong> Clermont Auvergne, Ospreys, Exeter, Bordeaux</p> \n<p><strong>Pool 3</strong> Glasgow, Northampton, Racing 92, Scarlets</p> \n<p><strong>Pool 4</strong> Stade Fran&ccedil;ais, Munster, Leicester, Treviso</p> \n<p><strong>Pool 5</strong> Bath, Toulon, Leinster, Wasps</p> \n<p><strong>Challenge Cup</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Pool 1</strong> Connacht, Brive, Newcastle, Enisey-STM</p> \n<p><strong>Pool 2</strong> Sale, Newport Gwent Dragons, Castres, Pau</p> \n<p><strong>Pool 3</strong> Montpellier, Harlequins, Cardiff Blues, Cammi Rugby Calvisano</p> \n<p><strong>Pool 4</strong> La Rochelle, Gloucester, Zebre, Worcester</p> \n<p><strong>Pool 5</strong> Edinburgh, London Irish, Grenoble, Agen</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434550015624/Toulon-006.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Toulon raise the Europan Champions Cup trophy and will provide a tough pool group challenge for Bath and Wasps.

In my fall, I smashed the room’s night table. The shock was terrible,” he writes. “I was bleeding a lot and it hurt. My left cheekbone had exploded … I panicked.</p> \n<p>“The doctor asked me how I got the injury. I should have confessed I was drunk, but I was ashamed of my behaviour and afraid to face consequences. I was a coward.</p> \n<p>“So, instead of telling the truth and trusting management, I developed a lie. A lie, that would have heavy consequences.”</p> \n<p>Bastareaud writes that the decision to attempt to take his own life was directly related to this lie and the negative media coverage that followed it. Having returned to France after the tour he logged on to an anonymous website and read a number of posts that were critical of him. “I jumped up and walked to the kitchen. I took a big knife and slit my veins,” he writes. “I immediately collapsed on the floor, fainting.</p> \n<p>“My friends in the living room heard the noise and came in. They saw the knife, the blood, and me lying there, unconscious and they called emergency services immediately.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know if I really wanted to die. I wanted to suffer. I wanted to punish myself. When you hear everywhere all day long that you are just a loser, that you don’t deserve to be there … you try to keep a cool attitude but you begin to believe what people say … I smiled in public but, as soon as I came back home, I was alone.”</p> \n<p>Bastareaud took time in hospital to recover fully from the physical and emotional damage he had inflicted on himself. He is now benefiting from the help of a psychologist and is a part of the France squad preparing for the Rugby World Cup in England, which starts in September.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/16/1434465596536/Toulons-French-centre-Mat-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mathieu Bastareaud lied to hide the shame of having injured himself in a drunken fall in a New Zealand hotel.

The move, which implicates “persons unknown”, increases the pressure both on Fifa’s departing president, Sepp Blatter, and on the Russian and Qatari organising committees, both already well advanced in building stadiums.</p> \n<p>The Swiss criminal investigation began in November after Fifa handed over evidence relating to Garcia’s report but has now widened into an inquiry of “great complexity” as prosecutors analyse nine terabytes of data seized from world football’s governing body, the sports marketing agency Kentaro and Swiss banks that have flagged up the suspect transactions. “We are faced with a complex investigation with many international implications. The prosecution is ongoing and will take time,” said Lauber, who confirmed that investigators would question Blatter and Fifa’s general secretary, J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Valcke, if necessary. “The world of football needs to be patient. By its nature, this investigation will take more than the legendary 90 minutes.”</p> \n<p>Lauber said that the “huge and complex” investigation was likely to take months and some elements could take years. He said he was not afraid of collateral damage to either Russia 2018 or Qatar 2022. The head of Fifa’s audit and compliance committee, Domenico Scala, has already <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/07/russia-qatar-lose-world-cups-if-bribery-found-fifa\" title=\"\">reiterated that there could be a revote</a> for the Russian and Qatar World Cups if clear evidence of bribery emerges.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Fifa and Blatter attempted to distance themselves further from comments made by the president’s former adviser Hans St&ouml;hlker. The veteran PR executive, who advised Blatter on his re-election campaign, has been publicly claiming that Blatter is prepared to perform a U-turn and stand again for the presidency. He told the Guardian Blatter would stand again and win in elections likely to take place in December if no other “valuable candidate” emerged. But after he gave a further expansive interview to Russia Today, in which he said Blatter was putting the finishing touches to a “New Fifa” document, world football’s embattled governing body insisted: “Fifa and its president disassociate themselves from any declarations made by Mr St&ouml;hlker with regards to Fifa.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434566253467/Michael-Garcia-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Michael

Instead, NSW defied recent history and walked the walk, beating Queensland 26-18 down the straight to force a decider in Brisbane in three weeks’ time.</p> \n<p>In Origin’s first return to the MCG since 1997 – back when just 25,000 fans saw NSW squeak home 15-14 – NSW, holding the upper hand in the forwards, scored four tries to three to prevail in what was an open and entertaining game, in vast contrast to Game One that was so dour many wondered openly if Origin was losing its mojo.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/17/state-of-origin-queensland-to-fire-up-following-left-field-gallen-attack\">State of Origin: Queensland to fire up following 'left field' Gallen attack</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In front of 91,513 fans NSW secured the win after coming from 18-14 behind to score the final two tries of the game, the first in the 62nd minute to a hugely impressive Aaron Woods after his rumbling, defender-bumping run off the shoulder of hooker Robbie Farah from close in; the second to Josh Dugan in the 71st minute when, with NSW ahead 20-18, the full-back cut back inside off a Hodkinson short ball and carved past Billy Slater and bravely dived low to beat the approach of Matt Gillett.</p> \n<p>Dugan’s try brought an end to five minutes of exhilarating madness in which both sides thought they had scored decisive tries. First, in the 65th minute, Mitchell Pearce and NSW were celebrating a try – or at least they thought they were. After some smart midfield play Brett Morris slipped a short ball to Pearce and he wrong-footed the defence to dive over.</p> \n<p>But just as the much-maligned five-eighth was enjoying what would have been one of his best Origin moments – admittedly, such is his record in the No6, that there is not a lot to choose from – the try was disallowed due to the pass from Morris being deemed forward. If it was forward, so is almost every dummy-half pass in the game.</p> \n<p>The sense that that decision would haunt NSW was given weight when two minutes later Pearce appeared to have dropped the ball as NSW attacked Queensland’s line and Greg Inglis, who returned to something close to his best tonight, picked up the ball and galloped 90m downfield, most of the crowd cheering him on like a racehorse they had mortgaged the house on.</p> \n<p>But Queensland then had their turn to bemoan the wildly swinging scales of officialdom when the try went upstairs and was disallowed; seemingly for a slight knock-on from interchange player Michael Morgan who had stripped the ball from Pearce’s hands, just before the arrival of a second tackler in Nate Myles.</p> \n<p>It was then, as the crowd was considering how calamity tends to even itself out, that Dugan scored to push NSW out to a 26-18 lead, one they would hold until full-time by controlling the game by playing for field position.</p> \n<p>NSW had reason to hope as early as the third minute when they scored before Queensland had touched the ball. Some 20m out from Queensland’s line James Tamou spun in a tackle and though his offload found the grass. NSW shuttled the ball to Michael Jennings who put his head down and burst through the ineffective tackles of Daly Cherry-Evans and Will Chambers to score 10m in from the left touchline. Trent Hodkinson’s conversion made it 6-0 to NSW.</p> \n<p>Queensland did not have to wait long to respond. Three minutes later Johnathan Thurston got in behind the line after selling a dummy. From the resulting play the ball Cameron Smith passed inside to Corey Parker and the veteran found Matt Scott running off his left shoulder. Scott hit the gap and burst through the tackle of Beau Scott to crash over under the posts.</p> \n<p>Those opening 11 minutes set the scene for a game in which both teams were willing to offload and test the opposition out wide. It brought both Inglis into the game as well as Jennings who tormented Queensland’s right side all night</p> \n<p>Ironically, given the pre-game niggle, and his casting as the man in the black hat, the game’s first sign of unrest came when Blues captain Gallen was off the field receiving attention for a rib injury. It followed a contretemps between James Tamou and Billy Slater; Slater throwing the ball at Tamou in retaliation to Tamou resting both his hands on Slater’s face, as if he were molding clay. As the two shaped up, players flew into the fray but fists remained in their holsters and Queensland got the penalty.</p> \n<p>It was the first but not the last melee of the night but they only truly untoward moment was the swinging arm Justin Hodges laid across the chops of Ryan Hoffman.</p> \n<p>NSW went ahead again in the 27th minute following more good work from Jennings, and Brett Morris, on the left. A good NSW passage ended up in the hands of Pearce, who put in a pinpoint cross-field kick that Josh Morris climbed high to claim between Darius Boyd and Thurston. He began to lose his purchase on the ball as he fell from space and though he still had his hand on the end of it as it touched the grass in the Queensland in-goal one might debate how much control he had over it.</p> \n<p>But after the on-field referee awarded it there was hardy conclusive evidence to overturn it. NSW went ahead 12-6 after Hodkinson landed the extras. Queensland fought back as they do, and with 10 minutes to go before half-time, Inglis made a destructive bust and seemed certain to score until Josh Morris got a fist on his jersey and, with the help of Hopoate, wrestled him to earth like a rodeo steer.</p> \n<p>But just three minutes later Queensland claimed their try and it was through a move Queensland patented years ago. Running left from just inside their own half, Thurston found Slater doubling around him and the full-back hit the line hard and slipped a lovely ball to Greg Inglis, who had a head of steam. He found Boyd on his left and the winger then returned the pass to Inglis when Dugan loomed. Thurston failed to convert and after NSW added a late penalty they went to the half-time break 14-10 ahead.</p> \n<p>Queensland hit the front for the first time early in the second half after a close-in try by a nimble-footed Gillett and a 56th-minute penalty bumped their lead up to 18-14. However from that point onwards NSW showed Queensland they were not about to relinquish their Origin crown without a fight.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434550363385/State-Of-Origin-game-two-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Queensland's Billy Slater, right, can't stop Josh Dugan scoring the decisive try for New South Wales Blues to set up a State of Origin deciding game.
