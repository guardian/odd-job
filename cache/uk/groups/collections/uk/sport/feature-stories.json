Their plan, one trusts, is not “to chat a matador” or “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7aPp-4z-uw\">meet se&ntilde;oritas by the score</a>” (rest assured that research was required to recall these lyrics). The goal is a little more mundane than that: to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/18/england-announce-training-squad-ashes\">meet the new coach, Trevor Bayliss,</a> and no doubt to chat at length between a few physical jerks.</p> \n<p>The names of the fortunate 14 are obviously significant. The England hierarchy is sticking to the same batsmen, which means that Gary Ballance is still on board. However, there are interesting additions to the bowling attack and one notable absentee (though Chris Jordan is not currently fit). Steven Finn is back and Derbyshire’s Mark Footitt is in for the first time.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/18/england-announce-training-squad-ashes\">England call up paceman Mark Footitt for Ashes training camp in Spain</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It has taken a long time for Footitt to get this far. When he was a teenager at Nottingham, taking wickets for England Under-19s, he was one to watch. He is now 29 and after almost a decade of cricketing torment only in the past two seasons has he resurfaced as a potential international. There had been the injuries, loss of form and release by Nottinghamshire before the discovery of a happy haven at Derbyshire.</p> \n<p>Footitt is fast and left-arm and traditionally England have struggled to unearth bowlers of that type at the highest level. In the game’s history no left-arm paceman has taken 100 Test wickets for England. The top three, a wonderfully contrasting trio, comprises Bill Voce (Harold Larwood’s partner in the 20s and 30s), Ryan Sidebottom and JK Lever. Left-armers offer welcome variety and the good ones can take wickets in clumps when everything clicks and the ball swings late in the air.</p> \n<p>Think Trent Boult or Mitchell Starc. Theirs is a mercurial art and Footitt is not the first cricketer to note: “If I had known what I know now when I was 20 I think the world would be my oyster.”</p> \n<p>Graeme Welch, his mentor at Derby, is more unreservedly cheerful: “He’s international class. I’ve run out of breath speaking to them about him.” Certainly the ingredients are there. Footitt is pacy – quicker than David Willey, for example – and on the good days the ball swings late. However, a touch of realism is also in order. He is not the reincarnation of Wasim Akram.</p> \n<p>Footitt is still uncapped; Wasim began playing Test cricket at 18. Wasim could bat; Footitt cannot. In this discipline he is worse than Alan Mullally, England’s fourth most prolific left-arm paceman.</p> \n<p>Finn is far more familiar and has demonstrated his rehabilitation in the ODIs, which has not been a comfortable series for bowlers. “Nowadays an ODI is like playing a long T20 match,” says Finn, who has stood up to the barrage better than most. He would, however, like to grip a red ball for England again.</p> \n<p>“I’d love to play in the Ashes. That is the pinnacle of what you can achieve as an England cricketer and my last Test was against Australia two years ago,” says Finn. He was a gloomy passenger when England toured Australia 18 months ago but has worked hard to get back into contention.</p> \n<p>“When I came back from that tour we stripped everything back and went right back to basics. I learned a lot about my bowling and my action in that time.” He says that he has never been as consistent as he is now; he acknowledges that he has bowled faster. “I’d love to get that high-end pace back 100% all the time, which I had when I was taking wickets a few years ago.” However, Finn is smiling again, enjoying his cricket and much more dependable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/18/reece-topley-james-vince-england-twenty-20-squad-new-zealand\">England call up Reece Topley and James Vince into Twenty20 squad</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The probability is that he will be competing with Mark Wood for the final bowling slot at Cardiff unless Footitt or Liam Plunkett, the other paceman in the squad, makes a huge impression in Spain and beyond.</p> \n<p>Clearly Moeen Ali remains the first-choice spinner despite poor early-season form and a shortage of bowling even when he returns to county cricket. He exceeded expectations for England in that role last summer; a bit more patience may be required in 2015. For certain the Australian batsmen will be minded to be very aggressive against whichever English spinner is selected on the basis that they are all vulnerable and can be hit out of the attack.</p> \n<p>The notion of replacing Moeen with Adil Rashid is unlikely to have detained the selectors for long. Currently there may be a good argument for Rashid to play as a second spinner but not as the solitary one.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/18/1434649218690/mark-footitt-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Derbyshire's Mark Footitt has taken 32 first-class wickets this season and took 106 in all competitions of the county in 2014.

For two weeks in a row Castleford have beaten the team at the top and they are now fourth, only four points adrift of St Helens.</p> \n<p>The hero for Castleford was the full-back Ben Roberts but, given the tight nature of this game, he could just as easily have been the villain. With the game all square at 24-24, Roberts spilled the ball in his own half with 90 seconds remaining. However, Saints themselves dropped the ball and Castleford charged up the other end to allow Roberts the chance to win the game with a drop-goal on the hooter.</p> \n<p>In edging out the defending champions Castleford not only narrowed the gap to top spot but also ended a hoodoo the Saints held over them. The last time they beat St Helens the disgraced sprinter Dwain Chambers was halfway through his infamous trial with the club in 2008. On 14 occasions since then Castleford have failed to beat St Helens and the fact they did so on Thursday suggests they are on track to challenge the status quo in 2015.</p> \n<p>“It was an incredible finish,” said Powell, a man who is probably on the way to earning freedom of the town at this rate. “We’re pleased to be on the right end of the result; belief is growing all the time and we’ve gone to another level defensively.”</p> \n<p>For St Helens their first defeat in five games plus serious-looking injuries to Adam Swift and Shannon McDonnell mean they will have to regroup quickly before a Challenge Cup quarter-final at home to Widnes on 28 June. “We got what we deserved,” said their coach, Keiron Cunningham. “We did our best to lose that game from minute one.”</p> \n<p>After Castleford broke the deadlock through the returning Justin Carney, St Helens fought back with tries from Luke Walsh and Alex Walmsley. Cas showed why they are one of Super League’s great entertainers when Denny Solomona scored a breathtaking solo try, before the visitors retook the lead when Joe Greenwood crossed.</p> \n<p>Leading 18-10 at the interval, St Helens were then put under siege and that pressure led to the home side taking the lead again when Jake Webster and Matt Cook crossed. Mark Percival converted Shannon McDonnell’s try to put Saints two points in front and set the scene for the grandtsand finish.</p> \n<p>Percival was sent to the sin-bin for holding down, leaving the visitors a man light for the final eight minutes. Castleford levelled with a penalty from Luke Gale before both teams missed a desperate attempt to win the game with a drop-goal. Roberts however, would not fail.</p> \n<p><strong>Castleford </strong>Roberts; Solomona, Webster, Shenton, Carney; Finn, Gale; Lynch, Moore, Millington, Holmes, McMeeken, Massey.</p> \n<p><strong>Interchange</strong> Milner, Cook, Moors, Bailey.</p> \n<p><strong>Tries</strong> Carney, Solomona, Webster, Cook. <strong>Goals</strong> Gale 4. <strong>Drop-goal</strong> Roberts.</p> \n<p><strong>St Helens</strong> McDonnell; Swift, Turner, Percival, Dawson; Burns, Walsh; Amor, Roby, Walmsley, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Wilkin, Jones.</p> \n<p><strong>Interchange</strong> Masoe, Richards, Flanagan, Greenwood.</p> \n<p><strong>Tries</strong> Walsh, Walmsley, Greenwood, McDonnell. <strong>Goals</strong> Percival 4.</p> \n<p><strong>Referee</strong> R Silverwood. <strong>Attendance</strong> 6,086</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434668696478/Castleford-celebrate-beat-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ben Roberts, right, celebrates after his drop-goal gave Castleford a one-point victory over St Helens in the Super League.

This victory, their sixth from eight games, leaves them 29 points clear at the top of Division One before home matches against Yorkshire and Warwickshire, who sit third and second respectively.</p> \n<p>Whatever the conditions, whatever the circumstances, Durham seem to find a way. That a margin of 178 runs scarcely did their dominance at Arundel justice tells of the efficiency of their showing. North-eastern title talk may need to step up a notch.</p> \n<p>Scott Borthwick typifies Durham’s approach. The cherubic all-rounder – and yes, that is what he remains – is a joy to watch and turned this match not once but twice. At first drop, amid the carnage of Durham’s second-innings tumble to 13 for four, his knowledge of the whereabouts of off-stump and the need to build a lead meant he left plentifully and excellently, yet his 75 still came inside 100 balls.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/18/mark-footitt-steven-finn-england-ashes-spain\">Mark Footitt may fit bill as England explore left-arm paceman option</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After lunch on Thursday, as Durham’s seventh bowler, he was every inch as busy, zipping the ball between his hands, then looping it up towards the footmarks and watching it spit out, a whoop and raise of the arms with every one as he took four wickets. Borthwick’s leg-breaks do not come from a deep bag of tricks but he gets marked turn and, crucially, knows how to make life tough for batsmen. Between times he stands at slip, where he has some of the safest hands in the land, captain Collingwood’s first call for counsel.</p> \n<p>Borthwick’s colleagues call him “Badger” because that is the contemporary cricketing patois for one who simply loves the game, not the nocturnal omnivore. To watch him here was evidence of its aptness: he is a fizzing, ferreting bundle of cricket-smart energy, Arundel’s plush green outfield not nearly spacious enough for such vim and vigour.</p> \n<p>His first three scalps were all dynamism: Luke Wright was fooled in the flight and caught and bowled brilliantly, Borthwick diving to his right; Ajmal Shahzad was deceived when charging and stumped by a distance, while a classic leg-break took George Dockrell’s outside edge. That Collingwood delayed handing the new ball to his seamers for 17 overs tells of the pressure Borthwick and Ryan Pringle – who started the rot with the wicket of the outstanding centurion Luke Wells – had Sussex under.</p> \n<p>Sussex’s resumption got off to a poor start, as Ed Joyce feathered John Hastings, probing from around the wicket, to Richardson. A sickly Chris Nash battled for 40 minutes before plopping a Graham Onions delivery that held in the pitch to mid-on but Wells and Wright counterattacked superbly. The latter struck six stunning straight drives for boundaries off Durham’s seamers and brought up his first century of the season shortly before lunch, which Sussex took confidently at 223 for four.</p> \n<p>But Durham returned from the break with renewed vitality and, in Borthwick, venom. After his and Pringle’s work, Onions made the collapse five for 29 with the wicket of Steve Magoffin, taken by a sharp Gordon Muchall catch at slip, in the first over of the new ball.</p> \n<p>The last pair, Ben Brown – who scored a fine 60 – and Tim Linley resisted manfully for more than an hour, forcing tea to be postponed but never taken, as Borthwick returned to nab Brown lbw. “I’ve always said I much prefer getting four- and five-fors than runs,” said Borthwick, whom the national team would be wise not to forget, “I still think of myself as a leggie and to get through overs and pick up wickets was fantastic.”</p> \n<p>For Sussex, who have now lost five in six and are struggling, the return to form of Wells, who batted with wonderful correctness and was perhaps unfortunate to be adjudged caught behind off Pringle, is a bonus, as is their highest Championship total in 10 innings. Also pleasing is that this perfect tree-lined circus of a ground – after a couple of drab puddings and &pound;10,000 worth of investment – has a pitch with life. At different stages it seamed and spun and was fine to bat on as the game wore on.</p> \n<p>In Division Two <strong>Glamorgan</strong> eased to a marvellous win at Guildford, with Graham Wagg needing only five balls to end <strong>Surrey</strong>’s second innings and complete a collapse of five wickets for four runs in five overs. Unbeaten Glamorgan’s top order then stalked down the 247 required with ease, with Will Bragg anchoring the innings with 83 and Ben Wright scoring 68. Glamorgan, who have played a game fewer, move to 12 points behind second-placed Surrey.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/18/1434663175785/Scott-Borthwick-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Scott Borthwick proved his worth to Durham with both bat and ball in the win over Sussex.
