But which version of the team will show up against the Americans<br /></p>","byline":"Caitlin Murray in Montreal","body":"<p>Whenever USA and Germany have faced one another in a Women’s World Cup, the winner has gone on to lift the trophy.<br /> </p> \n<p>As far as statistics go, it’s not the most ironclad – they’ve only faced one another twice in World Cups before. But given the paths both teams have taken to Tuesday night’s semi-final, and what lies ahead, that small piece of history is all the more striking.</p> \n<p>Whoever wins the semi-final will have beaten the other highest-ranked team in the tournament and will have the <a href=\"http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/womens-world-cup/\">best odds</a> of winning, based on past performances. The winner will face either Japan or England, and there are plenty of reasons to think both Germany and USA can beat either of those teams. “It’s No1 and No2,” the USA forward Alex Morgan said. “It’s almost like a final in and of itself.”</p> \n<h2><strong>Will the real USA please stand up?</strong></h2> \n<p>The Americans are riding a high after a win over China <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/28/usa-victory-china-five-things\">that showed an encouraging degree of attacking flair and style</a>. For the first time in Canada, the Americans succeeded in pressing high, winning the ball back and holding possession. They created the most chances they’ve managed all tournament.</p> \n<p>But China are no Germany and it’s unclear whether the Americans will be able to execute that same gameplan again.</p> \n<p>After the US tweaked their strategy against China, the midfield in particular has become something of a question mark. Because Lauren Holiday was suspended, Morgan Brian replaced her, playing a holding midfield role. That let Carli Lloyd push further into the attack and score the game-winning goal.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/29/how-carli-lloyd-found-freedom-to-become-usas-big-goal-hunter\">How Carli Lloyd found freedom to become USA's big-goal hunter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But having served her punishment, Holiday will be available again and during this tournament, USA coach Jill Ellis has favored a system where Holiday and Lloyd split attacking and defensive duties in the middle. Asked on Monday if she could find a way for both Lloyd and Holiday to attack, Ellis said, “I sure hope so. We’ll figure it out,” and then winked.</p> \n<p>Ellis has never been one to reveal line-ups early and she seems to relish playing coy with reporters when she can. Despite Ellis’s preference for a Lloyd-Holiday tandem, players gushed about the changed midfield in the China game.</p> \n<p>“I really liked getting a central midfielder a little higher up the field because in the last couple of games we’ve seen Lauren take that responsibility at times and Carli take that responsibility at times,” Morgan said. “But with Carli knowing it was her responsibility, she went and ran with it.”</p> \n<p>On the defensive side, the Americans have not conceded for a whopping 423 straight minutes. That’s largely due to the solid backline that has carried the Americans through this World Cup, buoyed by center-backs Becky Sauerbrunn and Julie Johnston, arguably the team’s two best players.</p> \n<p>But that has meant Hope Solo has had relatively little to do. Against a potent German side, the keeper will likely need to step up for the first time since USA’s opening game, when she made two brilliant saves to keep Australia at bay.</p> \n<p>“It’s not what Germany is going to bring because they are going to bring it,” Solo said. “I could talk all day about the strengths that they bring, but it’s all about how we play. I think we learned that from our last game [against] China. If we play our game, it doesn’t matter who we play.”</p> \n<h2><strong>Can Germany keep holding on?</strong></h2> \n<p>The Germany coach Silvia Neid didn’t mince her words when asked about the teams’ respective world rankings. “I know the US would like to be No1, but we are still No1 and we look forward to showing tomorrow that it’s our position to keep,” she said.</p> \n<p>If there is a favorite in this top-of-the-world clash, it has to be Germany.</p> \n<p>The Germans boast the two top goalscorers of the tournament in Celia Sasic and Anja Mittag. In attack, Germany have dominated for the entire World Cup: they have scored 20 goals so far (USA have managed just seven, although the Americans had far tougher opponents in the group stage). If that’s not enough to terrify US fans, Germany have had 134 goal attempts in Canada. The tournament average is 50. At the other end, their goalkeeper, Nadine Angerer, has conceded three goals in five games, and was Fifa’s 2013 World Player of the Year.</p> \n<p>Of course, 2014’s Fifa World Player of the Year was Nadine Kessler, a crafty striker who was ruled out of the tournament through injury. That hasn’t hampered them: the Germans have proved to have perhaps the deepest squad in the tournament.</p> \n<p>Not even a lingering injury to the brilliant youngster Dzsenifer Marozsan has been enough to cause them to stumble. Neid said on Monday that Marozsan’s status is unclear and she will wait until before kick-off before deciding whether the attacking midfielder can play.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/27/germany-france-womens-world-cup-quarter-final-match-report\">Germany 1-1 France (aet; 5-4 pens) | Women’s World Cup quarter-final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If anything gives the Americans their opening, it’s the gruelling chess match against France that Germany had to endure to move past the quarter-final.

Her goals secured gold medals in both the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. She has struck in World Cups before and in Canada, where her team has had trouble finishing chances, it was her goal that took USA to the semi-finals, where they face Germany.</p> \n<p>But Lloyd isn’t about to take it easy. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/26/womens-world-cup-usa-china-carli-lloyd\">After Friday’s 1-0 win over China</a>, Lloyd had one important phone call to make – to her longtime personal trainer, James Galanis, to talk about how she performed and what she needs to do against the Germans on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>“I’ll call him in a few,” Lloyd told reporters shortly after being named Fifa’s player of the match. “He’ll tell me, ‘Good job, blah blah blah – but that game’s over. Now, focus on the next one.’ ”</p> \n<p>For Lloyd, a player who has built a reputation of grabbing games by the scruff of the neck, soccer is an endless act of improvement. There is no lower gear or pit stop. She has one mode: go.</p> \n<p>The goal she scored on Friday was something she had rehearsed over and over again, she said. Her trainer had told her she needed to work on her headers. “Nothing is guaranteed and I don’t want to just be a participant in the World Cup,” Lloyd said. “I want to have a legacy. I want to have people remember me and let my play do the talking.”</p> \n<p>“It’s a constant push trying to prove people wrong,” she added.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APcfpZB2AdE\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/APcfpZB2AdE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>But notably, the night that Lloyd finally created a special moment in this World Cup was also the night that the USA coach, Jill Ellis, changed her role on the field.</p> \n<p>Throughout this tournament and under much of Ellis’s tenure, Lloyd has been paired with Lauren Holiday to share duties in central midfield. Side by side, both would get forward and both would help defend. </p> \n<p>Against China, though, Lloyd’s role was more limited, which gave her more freedom. Morgan Brian replaced Holiday, who was suspended, and covered defensive duties so Lloyd could roam in China’s half, on the prowl for goals.</p> \n<p>“The coaches told me to hold a little more and let her do what she needs to do,” Brian said. “That way Carli feels like she can attack more, and that’s good because we needed that.”</p> \n<p>The change worked for Lloyd. She looked more comfortable attacking, but it wasn’t anything new. Lloyd has been tasked with playing as a holding midfielder in the past, but she always looks her best when she can attack, when she can search for special moments and big goals.</p> \n<p>That raises the question: when Holiday returns, what happens to Lloyd, and perhaps just as importantly, what happens to Brian? The US women haven’t had a dedicated defensive midfielder in the center of the pitch for a long time, and it doesn’t seem they will abruptly find one in the latter stages of a World Cup.</p> \n<p>But it doesn’t seem that having Lloyd focused on both defending and attacking has yielded the best results from midfield. “How this tournament’s gone so far, I was a little bit restricted in the beginning games,” Lloyd said after the quarter-final. “I wasn’t able to express myself.”</p> \n<p>Brian told reporters on Sunday she didn’t know if she would play against Germany, and she is unsure what her role going forward will be. Whether Brian returns or Lloyd is again asked to focus on the attack may hint at whether Ellis and her staff sees the potential for another big Lloyd moment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/28/usa-victory-china-five-things\">USA can play soccer: five things we learned from the 1-0 win over China</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There were times when nobody was looking to Lloyd as a hero. In the lead-up to the 2012 Olympics in London, she wasn’t playing well and a lack of confidence seemed at least partly to blame. </p> \n<p>Then coach Pia Sundhage, who now coaches Sweden, didn’t have confidence in Lloyd either. She downgraded her from a starter to a substitute on the Olympic roster with Shannon Boxx taking her place. Lloyd would later admit she took Sundhage’s decision hard.</p> \n<p>Whether it was luck or fate, Lloyd got her chance to prove Sundhage wrong. Boxx injured her hamstring just 17 minutes into the opening match of the Olympics. Suddenly, after being told she wasn’t good enough, Lloyd was being asked to step up.</p> \n<p>She did that, scoring in that opening match against France and later again to clinch the gold medal over Japan, a rematch of the 2011 Women’s World Cup final.</p> \n<p>“Carli Lloyd is a player sometimes smarter than I am,” Sundhage said from Canada earlier this month. “The message I tried to give her and her role, sometimes she thought about it and had some questions about it and she didn’t do what we were supposed to do.”</p> \n<p>That doesn’t appear to be a problem under Ellis in this World Cup. Lloyd, asked to share central midfielder duties with Holiday, has put in the work and followed the game plan. </p> \n<p>But Lloyd is also a player drawn to goal like a moth to a flame. On Friday before the media, the first thing she said made it clear: “I live for these moments.” Before the match, she had envisioned herself scoring.</p> \n<p>Whether she has another chance to create a special moment may depend on Ellis and the players around her, but she will certainly try to find a way.</p> \n<p>“I know that this is what I’m made of,” Lloyd said. “I have to take the team on my shoulders and grind it out.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435540277509/e302c77b-f500-4f42-983d-7f6436557119-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chris Roussakis/EPA","altText":"Carli Lloyd","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Chris Roussakis/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-29T09:00:13Z","lastModified":"2015-06-29T15:39:53Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Caitlin Murray","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/caitlin-murray"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["USA","Women's World Cup 2015","Football","US sports","Women's football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/usfootballteam","webTitle":"USA"},{"id":"football/women-s-world-cup-2015","webTitle":"Women's World Cup 2015"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"football/womensfootball","webTitle":"Women's football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Caitlin Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/caitlin-murray"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/29/how-carli-lloyd-found-freedom-to-become-usas-big-goal-hunter","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a7k6","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/blog/2015/jun/29/how-carli-lloyd-found-freedom-to-become-usas-big-goal-hunter","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jun/29/how-carli-lloyd-found-freedom-to-become-usas-big-goal-hunter"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435540277509/e302c77b-f500-4f42-983d-7f6436557119-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Carli Lloyd celebrates after scoring the deciding goal against China.

The second half of the Lionesses’ <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/28/england-send-hosts-canada-packing-in-tense-quarter-final\" title=\"\">2-1 World Cup quarter-final win</a> against Canada in Vancouver on Sunday had barely begun and Chamberlain knew her big chance had finally arrived.</p> \n<p>That universal signal that a substitute is required had the 31-year-old leaping off the bench and nearly four weeks into her third World Cup finals, making her first appearance in international football’s showpiece tournament.</p> \n<p>As a good friend of Bardsley, Chamberlain was concerned about the allergic reaction which caused the first-choice England goalkeeper’s eyes to swell up alarmingly, seriously impairing her vision. Yet with a semi-final place at stake and a hostile 54,000-strong crowd to perform in front of at a packed BC Place stadium she could afford to think solely of herself.</p> \n<p>An assured display from Mark Sampson’s second-choice goalkeeper has left Chamberlain in strong contention to face Japan in Edmonton on Wednesday night as Bardsley struggles to fully recover.</p> \n<p>Happily the latter was deemed well enough to fly to Edmonton with Sampson’s squad yesterday but her condition had been sufficiently serious to necessitate a post-match trip to hospital where a specialist examined her.</p> \n<p>“There’s still time for Bards to fully recover,” says Chamberlain, “but, as a keeper, you’ve always got to be ready regardless and it will be the same if I’m needed against Japan.</p> \n<p>“ They’re an excellent side, very technical, they’re the World Cup holders and they’ve done well in this tournament. We had a couple of their players at Arsenal last year in Yukari Kinga and Shinobu Ohno and they were both fantastic. It should be an exciting game.”</p> \n<p>After so much sitting around on international benches down the years, her adrenaline levels are suddenly surging. “I did enjoy coming on against Canada,” Chamberlain says. “It’s a strange one because you’re coming into a situation which maybe you shouldn’t enjoy because there’s so much pressure on you, but I loved it – I didn’t feel nervous at all. The situation just took me over and I embraced the opportunity. To get to a World Cup semi-final for the first time is amazing. Everyone’s chuffed to bits.”</p> \n<p>Creditably Chamberlain contained her emotions, much to Canada’s chagrin, by completing a mini warm-up before replacing Bardsley. “I thought ‘Well, they can’t start the game without me,’ so I took my time,” she says. “If I’d started rushing or panicking I wouldn’t have been in a good place.”</p> \n<p>It helped that she had been forewarned of the possibility of being called to arms. “As we came out for the second half Karen mentioned to me that she had a problem,” says the 5ft 11in keeper. “But I’d warmed up anyway during half-time because, in our position, you know anything can happen at any point in any game. As a goalkeeper you’ve got to make sure you’re always properly prepared.”</p> \n<p>As befits the great rotator of the women’s game, Sampson has now used 22 out of his complement of 23 players at Canada 2015.

The 57-year-old’s move to Anfield has not been finalised but is set to go through before Liverpool embark on a pre-season tour of Australia and the Far East on 12 July. The team report back for training at Melwood next Monday.</p> \n<p>The Liverpool manager has been without a No2 since Pascoe and Marsh, paid the price for last season’s disappointments following a review conducted by the club’s owner, Fenway Sports Group. It initially appeared Rodgers had been left isolated by their departures, with Pascoe in particular a long-time confidante, but the Northern Irishman is a firm admirer of O’Driscoll and has been instrumental in the approach.</p> \n<p>Rodgers paid tribute to O’Driscoll’s qualities as part of a wider critique into the standard of English coaches in October 2013, when he claimed natural talent was being stifled by archaic coaching methods.</p> \n<p>“We need to stop blaming the players,” Rodgers said at the time. “The players get the blame in this country. No, it is the coaching. The problem is that the guys who are ’that type’ of coach you never hear of them really. Look at Sean O’Driscoll. He is one of the best coaches I have ever come across. He is working at Bristol City. He has never had a chance in the top flight. His teams were expressive, had movement, they were technical, but he will probably never get a chance at a higher level.”</p> \n<p>Liverpool now look set to give O’Driscoll that chance, only nine months after he replaced Noel Blake as head coach of England’s Under-19s side.</p> \n<p>O’Driscoll, who was capped by the Republic of Ireland as a player but was born in Wolverhampton, spent six years in charge of Bournemouth, five at Doncaster and also had brief spells at Crawley Town, Nottingham Forest and Bristol City before his move to the FA.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/29/sergio-ramos-real-madrid-wants-leave-manchester-united\">Sergio Ramos tells Real Madrid he wants to leave for Manchester United</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nathaniel Clyne has undergone a medical in Liverpool in his proposed &pound;12.5m transfer from Southampton. The 24-year-old right back was on Merseyside on Monday to finalise the terms of his move from the south coast and is expected to be confirmed as Liverpool’s sixth signing of the summer on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Clyne will take Liverpool’s spending beyond the &pound;40m mark, with their outlay to increase once an independent tribunal sets a fee for Danny Ings, but that is unlikely to be the end of the club’s spending. Christian Benteke remains a strong target for the club ,although they are unwilling to meet the &pound;32.5m release clause in his contract with Aston Villa.</p> \n<p>The club have also capitalised on Barcelona’s transfer problems by agreeing terms with 16-year-old Dutch winger Bobby Adekanye. The teenager’s move to Barcelona from Ajax’s academy in 2011 was declared illegal by Fifa and he spent last season on loan at PSV Eindhoven as a result. Both PSV and Ajax were keen to sign the promising youngster on a permanent basis this summer following his release from Barcelona but he is expected to finalise a move to Anfield next week.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435602769673/Sean-ODriscoll-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Brendan Rodgers revealed his admiration for Sean O'Driscoll while the England Under-19 manager was in charge at Bristol City.

But nothing in his Wimbledon singles career became him like the manner of his leaving it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/wimbledon-2015-nick-kyrgios-dirty-scum-outburst-diego-schwartzman\">Wimbledon 2015: Nick Kyrgios denies ‘dirty scum’ cry was at the umpire</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was inevitable that he would bow out with a dogfight. A five-set, full-pelt seesaw of a match; and the script was enhanced by the happenstance of his opponent. The left-handed Finn Jarkko Nieminen, 33, had also declared this would be his final Wimbledon. Few paid much attention because celebrated as he is, there are no grand slams to his name, just a Wimbledon quarter-final in 2006. But Nieminen also had reason to chase every cause.</p> \n<p>Without flinching they by turns attacked and counter-punched – Hewitt winning the first set 6-3, Nieminen raising his game to take the second, Hewitt dominant in the third and then wretched during an injury-beset fourth, which he lost 6-0.</p> \n<p>All four sets provided great drama, but were in hindsight just the warm-up for an utterly engrossing fifth set of 90 gruelling minutes. By the end Nieminen, slightly steadier, took it 11-9. But both men were on emergency batteries.</p> \n<p>If there was a way to lose a final match, reflected Hewitt, this was it. “That pretty much summed up my career,” he said. “My never-say-die attitude. I have lived with that for 18 or 19 years. It is not something I work on. I just have a lot of self-motivation to get the best out of myself, whether here or in the gym. I am proud [of the fact] that I went out there and left it all out there.</p> \n<p>I was always going to leave it out there, everything I had in the tank. I certainly did that. There were a couple of times the match could have gotten away from me and I found a way of hanging in there.”</p> \n<p>The highlight was that Wimbledon title in 2002. “It is hard to beat winning. You have worked for your whole life for the opportunity to play the final Sunday at Wimbledon and to have the chance of holding the trophy; nothing compares to that.”</p> \n<p>Last Sunday he prepared for the eventuality of defeat. “I sat in the stands of Centre Court and soaked it all up. Knowing this was the last time, I wanted to soak it all up.” No tears, he said. “I was very close, but not quite.”</p> \n<p>He has years to reflect on Monday’s heroics. Both he and Nieminen lost their serves twice in the first four games of the final set but as they steadied, Nieminen, was blessed with having opened the serving in the final set. Hewitt was repeatedly obliged to serve to stay in the match. In the 10th game of the set, having already summoned the trainer for the first of two running repairs on his right thigh and toes, Hewitt saved three match points – not by caution but through sheer nerve and bloody-mindedness. One of them involved a goalkeeper-type dive to his left for a winning volley.</p> \n<p>“We love you because you’re a fighter,” chanted the Fanatics, who used up much of their four hours of choreographed supportive material. Nieminen was fighting Hewitt, the Fanatics and much of the crowd and to his credit he survived, bided his time another 40 minutes and secured his match point. He now faces the even greater hurdle of Novak Djokovic in the second round.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/andy-murray-mikhail-kukushkin-wimbledon-2015\">Andy Murray faces Mr and Mrs K’s plan A – ‘do something good’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Though Hewitt has faded, there is optimism about Australian tennis because of players such as Bernard Tomic but also Nick Kyrgios. Acclaimed by the likes of Federer, and the conqueror last year of Rafael Nadal, Kyrgios provided spirited preliminary entertainment on No2 court as he took just under one and a half hours to dispatch the Argentinian Diego Schwartzman. Kyrgios went two sets up – 6-0, 6-2 in 44 minutes – and then selected cruise control, egged on again by the Fanatics.</p> \n<p>The carnival mood seemed to affect him and in the third set Schwartzman used his forehand to exploits gaps and opportunities where previously there were none. He broke Kyrgios’s serve in the seventh game but then surrendered his own immediately. Kyrgios finished with a flourish – a 128-mph flat serve that Schwartzman could only parry.</p> \n<p>But, for all the showmanship, there is a spiky side to Kyrgios who threatened to stop play in the final set in protest at a line call and then had to explain to whom he directed the epithet “dirty scum”.</p> \n<p>He said it was to himself rather than the umpire, Mohamed Lahyani. The self-abuse explanation has not been deployed with such aplomb since the glory days of John McEnroe.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/29/1435605951786/Lleyton-Hewitt-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lleyton Hewitt salutes the crowd after losing in five sets to Jarkko Nieminen at Wimbledon.

The symmetry of the 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 scoreline was slightly misleading in that it took the world No1 an hour or so to get into his majestic stride.</p> \n<p>Fending off accusations this week that he and his coach overstep the rules about coaching from the stands, Djokovic received a warm reception in victory, and told the BBC’s Garry Richardson: “They were very kind. It is great to be back. This is the cradle of our sport. It doesn’t get any bigger than Wimbledon. It’s a privilege to open the tournament as defending champion. I have only the dearest and best memories of Centre Court, coming back where I won the title the year before.”</p> \n<p>He added: “I had a very tough opponent who can be very tricky on all surfaces, especially grass.

In truth, he needed no assistance.</p> \n<p>Djokovic’s first stroke of the championships, at 1.09pm, was a 118mph ace down the middle. After that – with interruptions for Kohlschreiber and a ballboy to chase away a seemingly confused bird wandering over the court – there were few distractions for the Serb.</p> \n<p>There was more discussion in the early stages on the identity of the invading bird than there was of the tennis surrounding it. Was it wagtail? Surely not a common chaffinch at the All England Club … The consensus was that it was young blue tit and not very good at being a bird, otherwise it would have flown away rather than skipped and hopped.</p> \n<p>Maybe it liked tennis – certainly more than Kohlschreiber when Djokovic teased him through deuce then broke early, inducing a lazy backhand into the tramlines for 2-0.</p> \n<p>The champion handed back the advantage before claiming the set. The second set followed the pattern of the first, with Djokovic gradually gaining the upper hand and for awhile in the warm sunshine, it was pleasantly tedious.</p> \n<p>The bird returned briefly, looking ill at ease after trying to fly the coop, his wings not quite up to it.

He whipped in a cross from the right that Gary Medel turned into his own net. </p> \n<p>Parity lasted just four minutes, however, and again it was Vargas who did the damage as he picked up the ball in midfield and lashed home an unstoppable strike from 30 yards. </p> \n<p>Chile, who have never won the Copa Am&eacute;rica in its 99-year existence, will play the winners of Tuesday’s semi-final between Argentina and Paraguay.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2f4e531227b1145876b08edf1f31ad0b3b9dd4bd/88_0_4007_2406/4007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2406,"width":4007,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Javier Valdes/EPA","altText":"Chile v Peru","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Javier Valdes/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T02:44:26Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T04:47:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":81,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Copa América","Chile","Peru","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/copa-america","webTitle":"Copa América"},{"id":"football/chile","webTitle":"Chile"},{"id":"football/peru","webTitle":"Peru"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#005689","matchStatusPre":"#676767","matchStatusDuring":"#4bc6df","matchStatusAbandoned":"#da1d1d","matchStatusPost":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"football"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/30/chile-peru-copa-america-match-report","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a8k8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/30/chile-peru-copa-america-match-report","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/30/chile-peru-copa-america-match-report"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2f4e531227b1145876b08edf1f31ad0b3b9dd4bd/88_0_4007_2406/4007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2406,"width":4007,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chilean defender Gary Medel scores an own goal during the Copa America 2015 semi-final soccer match between Chile and Peru.

But Todt, the president of the FAI, its ruling body, said: “If he has some complaints, which may be right, it’s something we should address internally and not make it public. All the credit and money he has got, he deserves it, but I would hope he will be more positive about the product [in the future].”</p> \n<p>The two men have not always agreed on the direction F1 has taken. And Todt would also like to see the timing of races changed from lunchtime to early evening. He said: “Maybe we should decide that rather than the race at 1pm or 2pm in Europe during the summer, if you ask my opinion, I would prefer to have it at 6pm in the evening. That way people can then go to the beach, arrive home and see it.”</p> \n<p>Referring to his relationship with Ecclestone, Todt added: “I know Bernie very well. I know he may tell you I am his best friend then five minutes later to somebody else I am the worst idiot he has met in his life. I live with that.</p> \n<p>“The only thing is, I will not get into that. It just creates some unnecessary gossip. I don’t have any problems with him getting more involved, as he has to if it is bringing something on board.</p> \n<p>“ If it is not constructive, you should not do it. But it is his style. Do I intend to change him? I don’t intend to change him.”</p> \n<p>Ferrari, meanwhile, should call time on Kimi Raikkonen’s F1 career, according to his former team-mate, David Coulthard.</p> \n<p>Raikkonen, world champion in 2007, was outclassed by his team-mate Fernando Alonso last year, when he failed to win a single podium place. He started this season in better form, and was second in Bahrain. But weak performances in the past two races, in Canada and Austria, have once again placed his drive under threat. And he is being outdriven by his team-mate once again – this time Sebastian Vettel.</p> \n<p>“I think it’s time for change,” said Coulthard, who drove alongside Raikkonen for McLaren between 2002 and 2004. “I’m not anti-Kimi at all but having lived through that experience myself, there’s a point in your career where you just stop getting better.</p> \n<p>“ It happened to me in my career. I was never the best driver, but there was certainly a point at the end where you just lose the edge. Right now if Kimi goes and wins the next race we’ll all be super-excited, because we need that. But Vettel’s come in and immediately established himself.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/29/1435600511770/Nico-Rosberg-Zips-Past-Le-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nico Rosberg of Germany and Mercedes celebrates winning the Austrian grand prix but two F1 grandees are arguing about the V6 engine.

This was an almighty shove from Jonny Bairstow as he and Tim Bresnan helped to put Yorkshire in control at the halfway stage and in record-breaking fashion. Bairstow posted the second double century of his career and this best of 219 took his tally of runs to 636 in eight Championship innings and his average to an eye-catching 106. That was only just a portion of a dreamy day for the statisticians, however.</p> \n<p>Bairstow and Bresnan completed their five-hour partnership of 366 inside 81 overs during the latter stages of the afternoon and Andrew Gale opted to declare. Having recovered their team from 191 for six shortly after tea on day one, they recorded the third-highest seventh-wicket stand in first-class history and the best ever in county cricket, beating the 344 shared by the Sussex pair Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji and Billy Newham against Essex at Leyton in 1902.</p> \n<p>Their partnership was also the highest on this ground and the best against Durham, while it was Yorkshire’s fifth-highest first-class stand of all time for any wicket. The top four were all for the first wicket. Meanwhile Yorkshire became the first team in the Championship to pass 500 in an innings this summer.</p> \n<p>Incidentally the declaration came with Bairstow and Bresnan only six runs away from going second on the list of seventh-wicket partnerships, with the Australia A pair Mitchell Marsh and Sam Whiteman sharing 371 last year. Whiteman, a Western Australia wicketkeeper who hopes one day to wear the Baggy Green, was born in Doncaster.</p> \n<p>Bairstow, whose other double century came <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/may/05/jonny-bairstow-yorkshire-nottinghamshire\" title=\"\">at Trent Bridge in May 2011</a> when he recorded his first three-figure score in first-class cricket, hit top gear after lunch when he took on all-comers. With John Hastings coming around the wicket, the 25-year-old disdainfully swatted him over square-leg for his only six to go with 31 boundaries in 268 balls. It was an innings which would have no doubt been welcome news for Trevor Bayliss as he stood over a golf putt under the Spanish sun.</p> \n<p>Bresnan’s unbeaten 169 off 256 balls, including 27 fours, was also the best of his career. He has scored five first-class hundreds, including two of them this season. Days like these make one wonder whether he could add to his 23 Test appearances, the last of which came at Melbourne in December 2013. He also helped Adil Rashid make the breakthrough in the ninth over of Durham’s reply with a slip catch off an outside edge from Keaton Jennings before striking with his fourth ball when he yorked Gordon Muchall for a second-ball duck as the league leaders slipped to 81 for five in the 24th of 42 overs bowled.</p> \n<p>Steve Patterson had earlier struck twice, with his wickets of Mark Stoneman and Paul Collingwood – chopped on and lbw respectively – coming in successive overs either side of tea before Ryan Sidebottom trapped Michael Richardson lbw for 31. That would have been some relief to Yorkshire, who handed Richardson a couple of lives in the slips.</p> \n<p>Scott Borthwick and Ryan Pringle gave Durham something to smile about as they shared an unbroken 59 inside 19 overs for the sixth wicket but they will need to go some if their side are to avoid defeat. They need 268 more to avoid the follow-on.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435601202393/Yorkshire-batsmen-Tim-Bre-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Yorkshire batsmen Tim Bresnan and Jonny Bairstow shared 366, a seventh-wicket record in county cricket  Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images","credit":"Stu Forster/Getty Images","altText":"Yorkshire batsmen Tim Bresnan and Jonny Bairstow ","cleanCaption":"Yorkshire batsmen Tim Bresnan and Jonny Bairstow shared 366, a seventh-wicket record in county cricket  Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-29T18:07:36Z","lastModified":"2015-06-29T23:01:26Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":15,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["County Championship Division One","Yorkshire","Durham","Jonny Bairstow","Tim Bresnan","Sport","Cricket"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/countychampionship1stdivisioncricket","webTitle":"County Championship Division One"},{"id":"sport/yorkshire","webTitle":"Yorkshire"},{"id":"sport/durham","webTitle":"Durham"},{"id":"sport/jonny-bairstow","webTitle":"Jonny Bairstow"},{"id":"sport/tim-bresnan","webTitle":"Tim Bresnan"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/yorkshire-durham-county-championship-division-one-match-report","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a8f9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/29/yorkshire-durham-county-championship-division-one-match-report","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/29/yorkshire-durham-county-championship-division-one-match-report"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435601202393/Yorkshire-batsmen-Tim-Bre-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Yorkshire batsmen Tim Bresnan and Jonny Bairstow shared 366, a seventh-wicket record in county cricket  Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images","credit":"Stu Forster/Getty Images","altText":"Yorkshire batsmen Tim Bresnan and Jonny Bairstow ","cleanCaption":"Yorkshire batsmen Tim Bresnan and Jonny Bairstow shared 366, a seventh-wicket record in county cricket  Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images"}},"importance":3,"kicker":{"title":"Cricket"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[{"title":"County cricket / Compton disappointed after Middlesex fail to punish Hampshire","rawTitle":"Compton disappointed after Middlesex fail to punish Hampshire","item":{"type":"article","id":"sport/2015/jun/29/nick-compton-middlesex-hampshire","title":"Nick Compton disappointed after Middlesex fail to punish Hampshire","trailText":"Nick Compton holds himself to such high standards that it was hardly surprising the word ‘disappointing’ featured prominently in his post-match comments after Middlesex’s batting collapsed against Hampshire at Lord’s","standFirst":"<span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Hampshire 176; Middlesex 298-8\n<br />\n<span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Compton scores 87 but Middlesex endure morning collapse","byline":"Vithushan Ehantharajah at Lord's","body":"<p>Nick Compton holds himself to such high standards that it was no surprise that the word “disappointing” featured prominently in his post-match comments. At the age of 32, with his sights still firmly set on an England recall, judging himself harshly is a must.</p> \n<p>The first use of the word was levelled at his team. Having skittled Hampshire for 176 on day one and starting day two on 59 without loss, they lost five wickets for 53 in the morning session to undo their good work.</p> \n<p>It was Gareth Berg, returning to his former haunt, who started the mid-morning collapse when his and the day’s fourth ball trapped Sam Robson in front for 17. The dismissal means it is now 11 innings since Robson, like Compton, a former incumbent of that England opening spot alongside Alastair Cook, passed fifty. In the interest of transparency, 12 innings ago Robson scored a brilliant 178 against Durham here at Lord’s. But it is this, the dexterous use of statistics to quantify a batsman’s worth, that Compton is all too aware of.</p> \n<p>His 87 was a cut above anything else his team-mates could muster, including Eoin Morgan, who slashed his second ball to first slip for a duck. Compton’s knock helped Middlesex stay on top of the visitors, who operated well with the ball throughout. But it was another disappointing end to a lot of hard work. To the only ball of the day that turned noticeably Compton came down the track to dab it to square-leg only to find his outside edge taken low at first slip. It looked, for a moment, that he was contesting the legitimacy of James Vince’s low catch by staying put. At stumps he revealed it was just dismay.</p> \n<p>“I think I’ve got 10 scores between 80 and 100 in the last two years,” he said. “That hurts you when you’re trying to push for higher honours. All people look at is a scoreboard and, if you’ve got a hundred it makes them take notice. It’s quite hard to take because you feel you’ve worked your balls off for that and to fall so close to the landmark is not great.”</p> \n<p>“I got a 100 and then two 70s, back-to-back, and then an 80-odd. If I’d just batted a bit longer and with a bit more composure I’d have got four hundreds on the bounce. I could say, ‘Hey, now talk to me.’ Unfortunately that’s the world we live in.”</p> \n<p>Compton shared a sixth-wicket stand of 111 with John Simpson (64), who registered his second half-century of the season, to take Middlesex into a lead which sits overnight on 122. As the impressive Bradley Wheal’s dismissal of James Harris showed – the ball nipping up the slope and seemingly getting no higher than his ankles – batting last will not be an easy task.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435607419556/Middlesexs-Nick-Compton-005.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Middlesex's Nick Compton, at 32, still harbours hopes of a recall to the England team.

Newell was forced on to the back foot at a gathering of more than 200 people during the lunch interval, defending among other things his dual role as an England selector, Nottinghamshire’s winter recruitment and the fly-by-night Twenty20 signings of Darren Sammy and Dan Christian.</p> \n<p>Nottinghamshire were only two wickets down at that stage but things got worse by the hour on a pitch that has, in old bowling vernacular, “done a bit”. Their batting, after they were put in, bore the hallmarks of a team infected by Twenty20 fever: too many tried to force the pace when it was unnecessary.</p> \n<p>“If people play poor shots, does that mean they are not showing any bottle? I just think we have got people out of nick and not playing very well. You just have to accept that,” was Newell’s assessment.</p> \n<p>Alex Hales, one of those who has been in touch, returned from England duty and made a fatal error in shouldering arms in Joe Leach’s first over after switching from the Radcliffe Road end. Worcestershire were also handed their initial breakthrough when Michael Lumb flicked nonchalantly but straight to square-leg.</p> \n<p>Not for the first time in recent innings, James Taylor shuffled across his stumps and missed a straight one. His namesake, Brendan Taylor, sleek early on, was slowed considerably after reaching a 66-ball 50 and became frustrated; seeking a release shot down the ground, he spiralled a leading edge to mid-off.</p> \n<p>Then, for a 20-minute spell the Notts batsmen kept playing and nicking. There was also a comedy run-out to put into the mix as Luke Fletcher’s exaggerated turning circle saw him defeated, going for a third, by Ed Barnard’s throw and Ben Cox’s improvised take and removal of the bails.</p> \n<p>At that point it did not appear they would register a batting point. But the momentum altered when Barnard threw them one, quite literally, as his shy at the non-striker’s end rattled to the rope. Another 40 runs followed as Wessels and the last man, Andy Carter, chanced their arm.</p> \n<p>The hosts’ luck ran out, however, when the pair recalled from loans, Fletcher and Carter, incurred hamstring and abdominal strains that will almost certainly curtail their bowling in this match. It left the workload to the left-arm spinner Samit Patel in conjunction with Brett Hutton and Ben Hilfenhaus, who struck twice in four overs before the close.</p> \n<p>“In an ideal world you would want to come out in the morning with Hilfenhaus and Hutton and go for it because we need wickets,” said Newell.</p> \n<p>“But where do you go after 12 o’clock? The reality is we will have to have Samit bowling most of the day and Hilfenhaus and Hutton taking it in turns from the other end. That’s the only way you can manage a three-man attack.”</p> \n<p>By that stage Newell had become used to dealing with curve balls, having been lambasted by one member at lunch for selecting Hales ahead of younger talent. That being the same Hales who had contributed 543 runs in five matches before the club’s slump set in.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/29/1435607208742/Chris-Read-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Worcestershire celebrate the wicket of Chris Read of Nottinghamshire.
