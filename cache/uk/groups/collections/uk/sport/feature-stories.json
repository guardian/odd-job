Saeed Ajmal, for a time before the crackdown the premier spinner in the world, was bowling the final over before a second new ball became available to Worcestershire, and three times Warwickshire’s beefy, dangerous lower-order leftie Keith Barker belted him unceremoniously to the ropes. “Rubbish,” they grumbled. “Take him off, what have we signed him again for?” These are harsh critics with short memories that if they cared to delve would tell them that last season, before he returned to Pakistan for a Test series, he took 63 wickets for the county in nine matches, and played no small part in their eventual promotion.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/16/wg-grace-cricket-book-the-spin\">The Spin | WG Grace: a cricketer of contradictions who lived for his duel with the ball</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But that was then and this is now. Ajmal played in that series in Sri Lanka last August but it was to be his final first-class match until this return to New Road. Following that Test, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/sep/09/icc-suspends-saeed-ajmal-bowling-action\" title=\"\">he was suspended from cricket</a> pending scrutiny of an action that had always appeared, as Fabian might have said to Aguecheek, on the windy side of the&nbsp;law.</p> \n<p>The biometric tests showed a degree of flex that was way beyond ambiguous and into the realms of darts and Alexandra Palace. To his credit, he has worked hard at a total remodel of his action but it is not even close to the same and, deprived in particular of his doosra, neither is his effectiveness. Pakistan resisted the temptation to recall him for the World Cup and when he did make an international comeback, in two ODIs against Bangladesh in April, he was slaughtered by Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim. Despite everything it was, to be honest, just a little sad to watch.</p> \n<p>His action is fine now as far as legality goes, a ramrod straight arm from start to finish, but no longer is there any spark to it. For the most part, he bowls flat and gets a little spin without it being anything extravagant. Any variations he gets appear to be restricted to occasional changes of pace, and an equally occasional alteration to the height of his bowling arm to what is termed round arm. He looked efficient enough, but innocuous as well on a dry pitch that was showing a few signs of wear even after two days. The Worcestershire supporters were right to be suspicious.</p> \n<p>Frustration rather than suspicion would have been the overriding feeling of the national selector, James Whitaker, who was watching this unfolding. He had come to Worcester to watch Ian Bell, who shrugged off his indifferent Test match form and obliged with a composed, skilled century; and Moeen Ali, whose batting has fallen away a little although not significantly, but whose bowling, as England’s first-choice spinner, has been under scrutiny.</p> \n<p>Last summer, his first in international cricket, he took 22 wickets at 28 runs apiece and, at the Rose Bowl, bowled England to victory with six for 67 against an India team containing some of the finest players of spin in the world. Since then, it has not been so good. A lengthy period of ODI cricket does not allow any spinner to settle into a rhythm and his injury sustained at the back end of the World Cup prevented him from joining the start of England’s Caribbean tour.</p> \n<p>When he did arrive, the trust was such that he was rushed straight into the second Test in Grenada, subsequently to have a disappointing match there and in Barbados, followed by an indifferent series at home against New Zealand. Since his return, he has taken 11 wickets at 41 apiece.</p> \n<p>Now, with the profile that Adil Rashid has acquired during the current ODI series against New Zealand, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/02/england-drop-jimmy-anderson-stuart-broad-ian-bell-odi-squad-new-zealand-cricket\" title=\"\">from which Moeen has been rested</a>, he is seen, in some quarters anyway, to be under pressure for his place.</p> \n<p>Here, though, is the problem for him. Implicit in him being rested from white‑ball cricket is the idea that he would instead get good overs in the bank and so regain the rhythm of bowling that has deserted him. A spin bowler needs to be able to get into a spell, book himself in at one end as it were, without feeling under pressure to make things happen immediately.</p> \n<p>Watching Moeen in the Caribbean, it was clear that he was trying to force his game. But instead of being able to bowl himself back into form – essential with the approach of the Ashes, for which he should still be the first-choice spinner – he was accorded a single token over at the end of the first day against Warwickshire and a further five overs in tandem with Ajmal as Bell was approaching his hundred: six overs for 18 runs in total. There was no conclusion to be drawn by Whitaker from this: he bowled OK.</p> \n<p>Worcestershire have two more fixtures: against Middlesex at Uxbridge starting next Sunday; and on 29 June against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, where their teenage off-spinner Matthew Carter has just taken seven wickets in the first innings of his first‑class debut. The latter match will almost certainly coincide, or at least directly follow, an England camp with the new coach, Trevor Bayliss. With the old Ajmal, one might understand Worcestershire’s dilemma. This, though, is helping neither themselves, England nor Moeen himself. Maybe some dialogue is necessary.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434460410811/Moeen-Ali-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Moeen Ali has been rested by England but has not been getting overs at Warwickshire.

In my fall, I smashed the room’s night table. The shock was terrible,” he writes. “I was bleeding a lot and it hurt. My left cheekbone had exploded … I panicked.</p> \n<p>“The doctor asked me how I got the injury. I should have confessed I was drunk, but I was ashamed of my behaviour and afraid to face consequences. I was a coward.</p> \n<p>“So, instead of telling the truth and trusting management, I developed a lie. A lie, that would have heavy consequences.”</p> \n<p>Bastareaud writes that the decision to attempt to take his own life was directly related to this lie and the negative media coverage that followed it. Having returned to France after the tour he logged on to an anonymous website and read a number of posts that were critical of him. “I jumped up and walked to the kitchen. I took a big knife and slit my veins,” he writes. “I immediately collapsed on the floor, fainting.</p> \n<p>“My friends in the living room heard the noise and came in. They saw the knife, the blood, and me lying there, unconscious and they called emergency services immediately.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know if I really wanted to die. I wanted to suffer. I wanted to punish myself. When you hear everywhere all day long that you are just a loser, that you don’t deserve to be there … you try to keep a cool attitude but you begin to believe what people say … I smiled in public but, as soon as I came back home, I was alone.”</p> \n<p>Bastareaud took time in hospital to recover fully from the physical and emotional damage he had inflicted on himself.

For Sharon Laws, last year’s first Queen of the Mountains, the British tour was sorely needed. “It is setting an example. It blew people away. Apart from world championships and Olympics, last year’s race was the first time I felt like a proper professional athlete. There are races that are harder and longer but Britain outweighs most in terms of spectators and organisation.”</p> \n<p>As the Belgian bikinis underline, the trend is upwards, but not universally so. “It is an improving picture,” says Laws, “There are races like La Course and an equivalent at the Vuelta, and the Philadelphia World Cup is on again, but we’ve lost the Tour de l’Aude which was huge, and La Grande Boucle. What I’ve noticed is increasing professionalism among the teams – the likes of Boels-Dolmans, Rabo-Liv are more like the men’s squads. When I started hardly any teams had a camper, now some have buses.”</p> \n<p>Next year, women’s teams will be divided into two divisions, with the top 10 gaining automatic entry to a World Tour of upper-tier events. The British tour is hoping to be part of that structure, and Laws’s hope is that creating a new elite among teams will make progression easier for talented young riders and that it will raise the standard of riders and riding at the best races.</p> \n<p>Where the national team is concerned, Laws is less certain. The British star Lizzie Armitstead felt the Kenyan-born former mountain biker should have been selected to support her at last year’s world championships – “a disappointment”, Laws says. “The course was good for me, I was climbing well and I had good shape.”</p> \n<p>With the recreation of a national women’s road programme only coming later this year, there is no Great Britain squad in the Women’s Tour, something Laws says “would be an opportunity to give some girls a chance. Perhaps they do have a plan but I don’t know about it. I haven’t been in the system since 2009. In 2008 it was different, they appointed Julian Winn as coach, it was all planned around Nicole Cooke and you could see something was happening there.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/womens_tour_britain/giv-21277G4F6t10qFArz/\" data-alt=\"Women's Tour of Britain 2015\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/womens_tour_britain/giv-21277G4F6t10qFArz/\">Women's Tour of Britain 2015</a> \n <figcaption>\n  The route of the 2015 Women’s Tour of Britain.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For its second year, the British tour takes a step forwards with a team presentation on Tuesday evening, longer stages – two are over 140km – and a hilly finale through the Chilterns including the hairpins of the ascent of Tom’s Hill at Aldbury, well known to local club cyclists, “an absolute pig, where the general classification should be blown apart”, according to Guy Elliott of the organiser, Sweetspot.</p> \n<p>Another area that has progressed this year is what Elliott describes as the race’s social agenda, which he says has been embraced by Aviva after its absorption of the original title sponsor, Friends Life. “There will be 25,000 kids on the roadsides on days one to three, and we see this as playing a massive part of getting people into sport.”</p> \n<p>In the longer term, Sweetspot is looking to take the race route north and west out of the Home Counties and East Anglia in search of far tougher climbs, to increase the number of days’ racing – there is, Elliott believes, no reason why the race should not eventually extend well beyond a week – and boost the size of the field.</p> \n<p>Last year’s winner, Marianne Vos, will be present, but in a PR role as she is not racing due to injury, which may be a blessing in disguise in terms of opening up the racing. In her absence, all eyes will be on the current World Cup leader, Armitstead, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/mar/12/lizzie-armitstead-world-cup-cycling\" title=\"\">despite her assertions earlier this season that this is not a key target for her</a>.</p> \n<p>With the world champion, Pauline Ferrand-Pr&eacute;vot of France, pulling out on Tuesday due to injury, Armitstead’s key rivals are likely to be Emma Johansson of Sweden and Orica, and the Italians Elisa Longo-Borghini and Giorgia Bronzini of Wiggle-Honda, while the British sprinter Hannah Barnes of United Healthcare will fancy her chances on the flatter stages.</p> \n<p>British Olympians such as Laura Trott, Dani King and Joanna Rowsell also figure, as does the double world junior champion Lucy Garner, plus the latest addition to the select group of Britons riding for top teams, the 21-year-old Molly Weaver, who has just transferred to the Liv-Plantur squad and is probably eyeing British Cycling’s new policy with interest.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434467043305/Marianne-Vos-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Marianne Vos celebrates her overall victory of the inaugural Women's Tour of Britain in 2014.

It does not bear thinking about for Lancashire supporters, who have been treated to a particularly prolific two years of run making. On Tuesday he scored his fourth County Championship hundred of 2015 and is now on the verge of becoming the first man in this summer’s competition to pass 1,000 runs.</p> \n<p>The 38-year-old’s efforts – 939 runs from nine matches with three hundreds, one double century and three further fifties – have also helped put Lancashire within touching distance of a return to Division One even at this early stage in the season. Here, they sealed a sixth win thanks to a dominant display with bat and ball against Mark Cosgrove’s Leicestershire strugglers.</p> \n<p>Prince had intended to retire at the end of 2014 but his team-mates tried to convince him to delay those plans, with a determination to right the wrong of relegation tipping the balance. The left-hander, who scored 3,665 runs in 66 Test matches during a nine-year period from 2002, is the only championship batsman to have scored more than 2,000 runs since the start of last season. It will be of no surprise to learn that the campaign to persuade him to play on is in full swing.</p> \n<p>He scored only 30 runs during the third morning to advance from 74 overnight to 104 off 171 balls before being stumped off Jigar Naik’s off-spin in the search for quick first-innings runs. But he shared in half-century stands for the fifth wicket with Alex Davies and for the seventh with Arron Lilley, who was particularly adventurous as Lancashire secured a lead of 276 on the stroke of lunch. The off-spinner Lilley hit two sixes in a 41-ball 59 as 169 runs came in 29 overs before lunch. Naik ended up with a career best eight-wicket haul, including six of them before lunch, but it was very much bittersweet given he conceded 179 runs in his 44.3 overs.</p> \n<p>Not only do Lancashire have the leading run-scorer in either division of the championship, they also have the leading wicket-taker in Kyle Jarvis, with 55. Like Prince, the Zimbabwean is also qualified under the Kolpak ruling. Jarvis, 26, picked up his 50th wicket of the season in the first innings, and he claimed five for 44 from 15.4 overs in the second, including two with the new ball and three at the death.</p> \n<p>It was Lilley who broke the back of Leicestershire’s innings with three wickets in 13 balls shortly before tea, including Ned Eckersley and Ben Raine caught in the slips in the 32nd over to leave the score at 90 for six. He also had Umar Akmal caught behind off an inside edge to leave Ashley Giles with a selection headache, given he also took five wickets in his only other championship appearance of the season against Derbyshire at Southport last month.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Cricket/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434484212651/Lancashire-v-Leicestershi-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Angus Robson of Leicestershire is bowled by Kyle Jarvis of Lancashire during the County Championship Division Two match at Old Trafford.
