The bad news for everyone else is that the newly minted Wimbledon champion says he might play on for as long as the 33-year-old Roger Federer, whom he beat over four sets of a tense and<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/12/novak-djokovic-roger-federer-wimbledon-2015-final\" title=\"\"> thoroughly absorbing final</a> on Sunday.</p> \n<p>“I feel like I’m at the peak of my abilities and career, and I want to use that for as long as I can,” he said on Monday . When asked if Federer’s enduring career was an inspiration, the world No1 said: “How long I can go I really don’t want to predict. Roger is 33 and he also doesn’t think about how many years he can go.</p> \n<p>“Two years ago he had the first season that was below his standard, people were saying to him to retire but next year it came down to one or two matches and he was fighting for No1 in the world. Now he’s playing in the final of grand slams, fighting for trophies. He definitely deserves respect for everything he keeps on doing and achieves. Hopefully I will be able to be as healthy as him and keep going. I’m trying to take care of my body as much as I can and avoid the biggest enemy of any professional athlete which is injury but I think the decision will come down to how I feel mentally, how long I can motivate myself to keep going and keep pushing my own limits.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/12/wimbledon-novak-djokovic-roger-federer-mens-singles-final\">Wimbledon 2015: Novak Djokovic ends era of Big Four to stand alone | Bryan Armen Graham</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Djokovic, whose fitness, flexibility and strength are the wonder of the tour, looked suitably refreshed after dancing the night away at the Champions’ ball at the Guildhall in London, alongside the women’s champion, Serena Williams, as well as his wife, Jelena, with whom he also was celebrating their first wedding anniversary.</p> \n<p>In surroundings he has come to regard as his second home, Djokovic said he is looking forward to matching the standards of longevity as well as the domestic contentment of Federer, who travels the world with his wife, Mirka, and their two sets of twins. “Ever since I got married and became a father [to Stefan, last October], I haven’t lost many matches and I [have] won many tournaments,” Djokovic said at the celebration dinner. “I suggest that to every player: get married, have kids.”</p> \n<p>Since he married Jelena, he has won 58 matches and lost only three – the most painful of those the French Open final last month – and collected eight titles, a phenomenal return. Andy Murray’s win-loss record since he married Kim Sears in April is 25-2 (and a walkover), with three titles.</p> \n<p>Now Djokovic, who was in the hunt for a calendar grand slam <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/07/novak-djokovic-stanislas-wawrinka-mens-french-open-final-live\" title=\"\">until Stan Wawrinka derailed him in Paris</a>, anticipates hitting another peak on the second leg of the American hardcourt swing and the US Open in seven weeks’ time. He said winning Wimbledon has considerably roused his spirits and refocused his ambitions.</p> \n<p>He was also cheered to be reminded that, although he lost the final at Roland Garros, he has<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/03/french-open-novak-djokovic-rafael-nadal\" title=\"\"> beaten Rafael Nadal there</a> on his favoured clay, followed by Federer on the grass of Wimbledon, where the Swiss has won seven titles.</p> \n<p>“That is a great achievement now that you mention it,” he said. “I didn’t think about it, but it feels pretty good. It’s probably the ultimate challenge to win against those two guys on their preferred surfaces.”</p> \n<p>Yet there was lingering ennui after he failed to capitalise on putting Nadal out of the French Open in the quarter-finals.</p> \n<p>“It wasn’t easy to deal with another loss in the final but I lost to a better player. I had to congratulate him. I had to move on. The fact that I had Wimbledon around the corner helped me to rejuvenate – mentally, mostly, because physically I was feeling OK.</p> \n<p>“I just mentally was very disappointed, down on myself, and I didn’t know how long that feeling would stay with me, how long I would feel the traces of Roland Garros. Considering where I was - state of mind, I would say – three or four weeks ago, it’s pretty amazing to be here with you today as the Wimbledon champion, because I’ve managed to overcome that huge challenge once again. It’s very similar to last year.”</p> \n<p>That is gone. New York and beyond are his obsessions now.</p> \n<p>“Right now I still have this flair inside of me and passion and love for the sport. I enjoy coming out on the court and doing the repetitive things which sometimes are not very pleasant but at the end of the day it pays off and it allows you to be in the position to fight for these trophies.</p> \n<p>“I’m a big believer in preparation, in constructive, professional, well-thought work and strategy. I have a great team of people around me, they have their own area of expertise and are contributing to my success.”</p> \n<p>Djokovic rejected the view that the US Open is the one slam where he seems to fall short, even though his game is best suited to that surface.</p> \n<p>“It’s probably my best Grand Slam,” he asserted. “Since I played my first US Open main draw [in 2005], in 2007 I played the first final, and ever since then I’ve been reaching at least the semi-finals. That says something my game and my results there.</p> \n<p>“But, of course, I didn’t manage to make that final step many times – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/sep/13/novak-djokovic-wins-us-open\" title=\"\">only once, in 2011</a>. I’m going there with that thought in my mind: I like the surface, I like the conditions, I like playing in Arthur Ashe, it’s the biggest stadium in the sport. With all the achievements this year so far behind me, I think I’m in a very good position to go far.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436794871691/Novak-Djokovic-and-Serena-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams find plenty to smile about at their traditional dance at the Champions' dinner in London on Sunday night.

Suddenly the club’s perspective and potential changed,” he said. “Instead of selling the best players, they decided to keep the players and keep adding the quality every year. Once we do that we start to show more consistency, start to win trophies , confidence, atmosphere, everything gets better.”</p> \n<p>Arteta, who at 33 is the same age as Cech, is hoping this will be a significant period in his career after he started only six matches last season because of injury and the emergence of players such as the young French midfielder Francis Coquelin.

The 21-year-old, who claimed his fourth victory of a stunning year at the John Deere Classic on Sunday, said in the aftermath that there is real scope for improvement.</p> \n<p>Spieth triumphed in an Illinois play-off over Tom Gillis. On day three, the world No2 had scored a career-best 61. Concerns over Spieth choosing the PGA Tour rather than Scottish Open for his buildup to the third major of the year were therefore swatted aside. “I have got plenty in the tank,” the young Texan said. Spieth also insists better is to come.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/13/the-open-2015-tee-times-st-andrews-golf\">The Open 2015: tee times for first two rounds at St Andrews</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“My driver is really good on the range,” explained Spieth. “I’m not patient enough in my back swing on the golf course. It’s easy on the driving range because there’s no penalty to it. But on the golf course when there’s trouble in play, I’m getting a little steep.</p> \n<p>“At the top of my swing my club’s not pointed at the target. I’m hitting it where my club’s pointed, but that’s pretty far to the right. So I’ve got some work to do, obviously, because the driver is a very important club at St Andrews. I do really need to fine-tune my driver. I love where my putting is at. Really my pace control, my speed, is awesome right now.”</p> \n<p>Victory at St Andrews would set Spieth apart as a history maker and the first player since Ben Hogan to win the first three majors of a year. He would be threequarters of the way towards a grand slam and would upstage Rory McIlroy as the top-ranked golfer in the world.</p> \n<p>“I will be focused solely on how I can learn as much as I can these next three days and then just keep this going into the tournament,” he insisted. “I just want to put myself in position. I feel like if I do that, that same formula that I continue to talk about and not just majors, but any tournament, will kick in mentally.</p> \n<p>“So it’ll just come down to the physical skills and the draw and whatnot there. But no thoughts past this week will come into my head while I’m there.”</p> \n<p>Spieth’s commitment to the John Deere tournament had a benefit beyond another taste of success. A wet Scottish summer thus far means the Old Course does not resemble anything like the scorched links which could take the American players by surprise. When Spieth last visited St Andrews, he was an amateur.</p> \n<p>“I love the town, I loved the R&amp;A clubhouse. I love the Himalayas putting greens, the entire experience being there for two days was really cool,” he recalled.</p> \n<p>“The golf course specifically, I think it’s just mind-boggling that it can hold the test of time and still host a major championship, centuries and centuries after it was built. And you know, with just minor tweaks here and there.</p> \n<p>“So I’m excited to get there. It has yielded very low scores. That’s why I think this is advantageous to feel like you’re making a lot of birdies, feel like you need to make a lot of birdies. That way you can be maybe a little more aggressive than you would normally be starting a major championship, but I think it all depends on getting over there and establishing a game plan because when I played it whenever it was, three and a half years ago, I was in very much a different position and could take more chances.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436800355445/Jordan-Spieth-of-the-Unit-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jordan Spieth of the United States smiles before starting a session on the driving range at St Andrews.

However Roberto Mancini, who signed him, and the Italian’s successor, Manuel Pellegrini, deployed Milner in a variety of positions across midfield and occasionally at right-back and centre-forward.</p> \n<p>Although Milner was well thought of and claimed every domestic trophy, he is conscious that time is ticking on his career.</p> \n<p>Asked if he moved to become a central figure for Liverpool, Milner said: “Yeah. I felt valued by the manager [at City] and the club and they saw me as a big part of the team on and off the field. But I was always going to be filling in and being that utility guy and doing a job for the team, and maybe this was the first time I’ve made a decision to be more selfish and thought what was best for me.</p> \n<p>“I was thinking what could have happened had I kicked on from that one season at Aston Villa where I played centrally and what could have happened if I’d carried on like that. Who knows?”</p> \n<p>Milner was unhappy at being left out of vital matches when at the Etihad Stadium. “Getting to finals and things like that, the default was for me not to play,” he said. “That was the way it is and I want to play as much as I can. I could have easily stayed at City and been there another four to five years, being around the club, helping us win things. But over the next few years I wouldn’t have played as much and my game time would have reduced. When I’m older I want to look back and say that I became the best player I could. Liverpool’s a great club to be an older member of the squad and help the younger guys along. There’s a lot of football left in me and hopefully I’ll be a part of a massively successful period.”</p> \n<p>Milner is clearly frustrated by a view, offered by some supporters, that giving up on the City fight showed a lack of ambition.</p> \n<p>“I would probably disagree with that,” he said. “Some people may look at it the other way and say I was not willing to sit on the bench for half a season, I wanted to play every single game and fight for a shirt and play that way, and I couldn’t see that happening at Man City.</p> \n<p>“You can look at it any way you want, you can go away and write a story and twist it any way you want to put it. We know how it works and I can only tell you my thoughts and see it as a positive, and other people can look at it as a negative.</p> \n<p>“Obviously it was a difficult decision. It took me a long time to make it. I probably changed my mind on a weekly basis at times. The fans were amazing with me at City and that made it very tough for me as well. City is also a great club to play football at. But playing football are the key words in that sentence.</p> \n<p>“There’s no guarantee that I’ll come here and play every game. I know it’s down to me. But I feel here at Liverpool – what the manager has said to me and where he sees me playing, he thinks my best position is in the middle [of midfield] as well – so it’s down to me to get in the team.</p> \n<p>“I thought at times at City I won player of the month and then didn’t play for three, four or five games after. I feel here if I play well, I’ll keep the shirt.
