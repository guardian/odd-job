Chicago are the only team since the National Hockey League lockout in the 2004-05 season to win three Stanley Cups, tempting the modern ‘dynasty’ label.<br /></p> \n<p>That will be left to history to decide for certain, but there was little question Monday night where the Cup belonged. Save for a few moments – and at least one unlucky bounce for Tampa Bay – the Blackhawks played a tight offensive game, outshot the Lightning 32-25, won over twice as many face-offs, <a href=\"http://hockeystats.ca/game/2014030416\">and more or less dominated possession for all 60 minutes</a>.<br /></p> \n<p>It all amounted to the first Chicago Stanley Cup win on home ice since 1938, when the Cup itself wasn’t even present for the victory, as the league at that time didn’t think the Blackhawks could win. Despite a weather delay, the Cup finally made it to the United Center this time around, and was hoisted once again by captain Jonathan Toews.</p> \n<p>Monday was ultimately Chicago’s night, but the win was hardly a foregone conclusion. </p> \n<p>As a demonstration of how evenly matched the two teams were, there’s this: both teams were 11-1 going into Game 6 when scoring first. And it was that first goal that was of utmost importance Monday night, where the Blackhawks and Lightning went almost 40 minutes without a goal registered on the scoreboard. Not that there weren’t plenty of chances, especially early on, from Chicago. </p> \n<p>The Blackhawks started strong at home in a game where they could finally eliminate Tampa Bay. The early energy put the Lightning on their heels, helped along by face-off victories that were to continue all night. However, a shot from Tampa sniper Steven Stamkos almost put an end to the Blackhawks’ momentum, but it rang off the post. Moments later, Stamkos created another chance near the net, but Chicago’s Chris Versteeg, on the back-check came up with the save to keep things even at 0-0. </p> \n<p>Having escaped those chances, Chicago earned two back-to-back power plays. On the first, they could not manage to get anything going, and meanwhile allowed Tampa two good scoring chances. On the second, they were more effective, but Lightning goaltender Ben Bishop denied both Blackhawks superstars Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews to ensure the teams went to the dressing rooms tied. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxwduUtWTGc\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gxwduUtWTGc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Tampa Bay started the second at top speed, and Stamkos had another chance to open the scoring – something he’d not done enough of lately for the Lightning (going into Game 6, he hadn’t scored in seven games) – on a breakaway chance. A similar breakaway from Stamkos in Round 2 against Montreal ended in a goal, and rekindled the scoring touch he’d lost to that point. This time, he wasn’t so lucky. A rolling puck wouldn’t settle, and Stamkos couldn’t get it past Crawford’s sprawled left pad. </p> \n<p>That chance, however, only seemed to further energize Tampa Bay. They kept Chicago penned in their own end for the majority of the opening five minutes of the second period. After outshooting Tampa Bay 13-4 in the first period, the Blackhawks didn’t manage another until almost nine minutes into the second. However, once they started shooting again, the momentum shifted back in their favour. The latter half of the second period was dominated by Chicago, as they peppered Bishop constantly and pressing Tampa back into the defensive end for multiple shifts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zewTop3Qai0\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zewTop3Qai0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Finally, it paid off. After a close call just to the side of Crawford’s net, Kane emerged with the puck near centre ice. He then slowed up near the blue line and sent it back to defenceman Duncan Keith, who let go a bomb. Bishop made the first save, but let go a juicy rebound. Keith, the eventual Conn Smythe trophy winner, followed up on his shot, picked up the rebound and lifted it over Bishop to make it 1-0. A late Tampa penalty produced a few more chances, including a huge shot from Chicago defenceman Brent Seabrook, but it hit the post just before the end of the period.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5C2cDBksts\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p5C2cDBksts?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The third period started better for Tampa Bay, and Crawford was forced to come up with a big save early on to keep Chicago ahead. A chance at the other end from Marian Hossa nearly handcuffed Bishop, but Chicago couldn’t manage a second goal. Tampa pressed, but then, with only just over five minutes left in the period, the play shifted out of the Chicago zone, with Brandon Saad skating down boards before dropping the puck back to Brad Richards. Richards held the puck long enough to draw Bishop over, thinking he would take the shot, but at the last moment, he passed it over to a wide open Kane, who easily fired it into the yawning net to make it 2-0, and effectively seal the deal. It was the first time all series that either team had a two-goal lead. It would be the only one necessary.</p> \n<p>Tampa pressed late, and coach Jon Cooper pulled Bishop with a full three minutes to go, and as the Lightning went on the power play, they gained two extra attackers. But it wasn’t enough. Chicago shut it down in their zone and Crawford closed the door again and again to keep the lead alive and bring the Cup back to Chicago. <br /></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434426933115/fc17c249-1f6a-4918-8162-0e5c261fd7ad-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dave Sandford/NHLI via Getty Images","altText":"Chicago Blackhawks","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dave Sandford/NHLI via Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T03:07:58Z","lastModified":"2015-06-16T03:55:39Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":9,"contributors":[{"name":"Colin Horgan","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/colin-horgan"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Stanley Cup","Chicago Blackhawks","Tampa Bay Lightning","NHL","Sport","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/stanley-cup","webTitle":"Stanley Cup"},{"id":"sport/chicago-blackhawks","webTitle":"Chicago Blackhawks"},{"id":"sport/tampa-bay-lightning","webTitle":"Tampa Bay Lightning"},{"id":"sport/nhl","webTitle":"NHL"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Colin Horgan","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/colin-horgan"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/15/chicago-blackhawks-take-stanley-cup-in-front-of-jubilant-home-crowd","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49zta","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/15/chicago-blackhawks-take-stanley-cup-in-front-of-jubilant-home-crowd","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/15/chicago-blackhawks-take-stanley-cup-in-front-of-jubilant-home-crowd"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434426933115/fc17c249-1f6a-4918-8162-0e5c261fd7ad-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Chicago Blackhawks pose with the Stanley Cup.

South Africa suffered through indiscipline, with both their captain, Hanro Liebenberg, and second-row Jason Jenkins receiving yellow cards in the first half-hour. England’s Nick Tompkins finished the game in the sin-bin, allowing the Springboks to score two tries in three late minutes, through Malcolm Jaer and Daniel du Plessis, whose father Michael played eight Tests for South Africa in the 1980s.</p> \n<p>An attritional opening saw the sides trade penalties, with England going 3-0 and 6-3 ahead through Rory Jennings only to reach the 20-minute mark level at 6-6. But while Jenkins was off the pitch England drove their way to their first try, James Chisholm eventually touching down, and from a scrum they were given a penalty try moments before half-time, which England reached 18-6 in front.</p> \n<p>In the second half South Africa passed up several presentable opportunities to kick for goal, choosing instead to go for touch and failing to make England pay. Jennings, meanwhile, converted his one opportunity to stretch England’s lead to 21-6 and, when Brandon Thomson finally kicked for goal for South Africa, it sailed wide of the target.</p> \n<p>When Tompkins scored England’s third try with nine minutes remaining, taking the score to 28-6, the die looked cast but he was yellow-carded for an illegal tackle five minutes later, giving South Africa a glimmer of hope. Though the baby Boks capitalised clinically on their numerical superiority, they did not quite have time to turn the game round.</p> \n<p>“We looked at the performance against France and we weren’t happy,” the England captain, Charlie Ewels, said. “Individuals worked really hard this week and we trained well as a team and we are far happier with that performance. This team didn’t win the last two years. The Under-20 team is different every year, so this team is trying to build its own legacy.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434404928821/Englands-James-Chisholm-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"James Chisholm of England moves between South Africa's Ivan van Zyl, left, and Brandon Thomson during the World Under-20 Championship semi-final in Calvisano.

It didn’t make him cry but it made a lot of people smile.</p> \n<p>Hewitt blew a match point in the second set, which he later attributed to “a flipped forehand”, before the 6ft 8in South African they call “The Dog”, Kevin Anderson, broke him for the fourth time from seven chances to win 6-7, 7-5, 6-2 in two hours and 20 minutes. The dwindling score on Hewitt’s side of the ledger was a fair indication of the grinding nature of the match.</p> \n<p>It was a suitably grand farewell for the Australian, who has mellowed over the years into a crowd favourite after hanging on to his teenage tendencies longer than some.</p> \n<p>A baseball cap turned backwards on his fiery head, he arrived here as a brash, baggy-shorted 17-year-old in 1998 before going on to captivate audiences with a game of high intensity and no little invective, some of it woefully misdirected until maturity cloaked his sore but solid shoulders.</p> \n<p>At Queen’s he won four titles, all of them loudly, to move alongside his compatriot Roy Emerson, Boris Becker, John McEnroe and Andy Roddick. In his first final, in 2000, he beat Pete Sampras, who was still near the peak of his powers. It was one of “Rusty’s” greatest performances.</p> \n<p>He liked playing on grass but never made it easy for himself in an era of serve-volleyers, trusting his extraordinary defence from deep to wear down opponents. It was rarely pretty, never dull. Against Anderson he played fantastically well for more than an hour.</p> \n<p>It was only his 12th defeat here, a record many will struggle to equal, but there is a little more to come, including doubles with his young compatriot Thanasi Kokkinakis. Then he heads for Wimbledon – where he won in 2002 – for another valedictory opportunity and while his chances of reaching the second week for the first time in five years are slim, Hewitt will leave there to more heartfelt cheers.</p> \n<p>Hewitt may play the US Open but says his priority before his last slam, the Australian Open in January, is the Davis Cup, a week after Flushing Meadows – and where the semi-final opponent will be either France or Great Britain.</p> \n<p>For someone who was so single-minded when young, Hewitt has become the eminence grise of Australian tennis, proud and willing to nurture a small group of players who may one day emulate him.</p> \n<p>“I have prepared my whole life,” he said. “Now I can sit back and just chill out for a bit, enjoy, not having to set an alarm and go to the gym and do all the small things.</p> \n<p>“I’ll be helping out Australian tennis in some way. I have tried to help out Bernie Tomic the last couple of years, and I have a good relationship with Nick Kyrgios and know Thanasi really well – we are playing doubles here and at Wimbledon. I feel like I have a really good connection with those guys.” It is probably not a thought that would have occurred to him 17 years ago.</p> \n<p>Milos Raonic, the world No8, came from one set down to beat James Ward 5-7, 6-3, 6-2 in their first-round match. The Canadian, who reached the Wimbledon semi-final last year, was playing for the first time since undergoing foot surgery and started slowly against the British No3, although he sharpened up as the contest went on.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434395338076/lleyton-hewitt-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lleyton Hewitt of Australia poses with a replica of the Queen's trophy he won four times and after his last singles match at the tournament having lost to Kevin Anderson of South Africa.

He received the call-up from national selector James Whitaker less than 36 hours after all-rounder Craig replaced side-strain victim Chris Jordan, though he was unused for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/12/england-new-zealand-royal-london-one-day-series\" title=\"\">the three-wicket loss at the Ageas Bowl</a> that saw the tourists take a 2-1 lead.</p> \n<p>Were the 21-year-olds to take the field together in either Wednesday’s fourth one-dayer at Trent Bridge or the series finale at Chester-le-street on Saturday, it would represent the first time twin brothers have been named in the same England side and the first siblings to do so since Adam and Ben Hollioake played together in the 1997 one-day series with Australia and the Ashes series that followed.</p> \n<p>While Craig, a correct and aggressive batsman who bowls right-arm fast-medium, has been a more regular member of the Somerset team in the County Championship this summer, taking seven wickets in his last outing away at Durham, brother Jamie’s addition to the England ranks represents a greater surprise, having only fleetingly shown the form that led to his only previous call-up as a reserve for the one-day series against Australia two years ago.</p> \n<p>“Obviously it’s really pleasing that we have both been picked in the England squad,” said Craig, who toured South Africa with England Lions at the start of the year before flying home due to an ankle injury. “When Jamie was picked before me a couple of years ago I was really pleased for him but it was also an extra incentive for me to keep working – you’ve always got to think positive.”</p> \n<p>The quicker of the two but with a touch less control, Jamie spent the bulk of last season playing in the Devon Premier League after slipping down the pecking order at Taunton, but has featured in five&nbsp;games in the NatWest T20 Blast this year and one championship fixture against Yorkshire, sharing a last-wicket stand of 76 from just 35 balls with Craig in what was just their ninth first-class game together.</p> \n<p>In terms of attributes - he sends the ball down from a 6ft 5in frame – Jamie represents a prospect England are keen to develop further, having worked with him in their fast bowling performance programme in Potchefstroom, South Africa at the start of 2015.</p> \n<p>“Jamie has been bowling quick,” said Craig. “None of the boys have been looking forward to facing him in the nets, put it that way – especially me, because he always gives me a bit of extra ‘brotherly love’.”</p> \n<p>“I’ve probably always been a bit more the outgoing one,” said Jamie. “Craig has been more consistent as a bowler, and he’s technically the better batsman. But I’d like to think I’ve settled down a bit this year. We’ve not played that many games together for Somerset but we’ve been playing together all our lives so we’re pretty used to each other.”</p> \n<p>Asked if brotherly rivalry, from their first games together at North Devon Cricket Club to the present, has driven both careers, Jamie added: “That’s probably helped us a little bit. One is always one step ahead of the other, and that makes the other want to catch up. That bit of competition has probably helped us get to the next level. I’m not sure many people can say they’ve got a brother playing cricket just as well as they can.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5cdbf728ee1f4727d09927fee46b8e254414cf4f/0_81_4672_2802/4672.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2802,"width":4672,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Harry Trump/JMP/REX Shutterstock/Harry Trump/JMP/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Somerset’s Jamie and Craig Overton have both been called up to England’s ODI squad.

The Canadian 5,000m runner Cam Levins, who joined Salazar’s group in 2013, said his coach was “completely trustworthy” while the young American middle distance star Shannon Rowbury denied she had cheated and said any accusations against her were “slanderous”.</p> \n<p>Salazar has largely kept his counsel since the BBC’s Panorama claimed he had given the banned steroid testosterone to his athlete Galen Rupp when he was 16 and violated other anti-doping rules. He did break his silence to tell the Guardian last week that his accusers were “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/mo-farah-alberto-salazar-doping-allegations-false-statements\" title=\"\">knowingly making false statements</a>”. He is expected to release a series of documents, emails and witness testimonies to support his case in the next few days.</p> \n<p>Speaking at the Portland Track Festival, Levins insisted Salazar had never pushed him into any grey areas while he has trained with him. “Alberto and Galen have been very trustworthy,” he said. “There is nothing I have ever seen that I would attribute to any of these allegations. I’ve never been pushed in anything considered a grey area that a lot of people have sort of implied at. I trust them. They have never given me any reason not to.”</p> \n<p>Levins added: “I don’t take any thyroid medication and I don’t know of anyone besides Galen who takes it within our group. I have some medication I take for my asthma but that is something that is wrong with me. I’m asthmatic. I was dealing with it before I joined the project.”</p> \n<p>Rowbury said that while she was unable to comment on Steve Magness or Kara Goucher – two former members of the Oregon Project who have made allegations against Salazar – she said she had “never seen anything that would make me question him or my team-mates”.</p> \n<p>“I have a clean record. I have never cheated. I never would. I would rather quit the sport than do that. I hope that over time people can recognise my character. I know Alberto and Galen are doing whatever they can to dispute these allegations and to prove them wrong. I trust them to do that.”</p> \n<p>Rowbury said Salazar had not put her on an inhaler, or asked her to get a Therapeutic Use Exemption Certificate for any substance. “I’ve done everything in my power to compete morally and conduct myself well and it’s disappointing for me to still have people throwing slanderous allegations my way,” she added. “I could drive myself crazy trying to go on message boards and correct every falsehood that people have said and instead I just try to carry myself in a professional way.</p> \n<p>“I have my eyes on my goals which are to make the US team, to make the World podium and most importantly of all the Olympic podium.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434386807287/Alberto-Salazar--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Salazar is expected to respond to the allegations via a series of documents, emails and witness testimonies in the next few days.
