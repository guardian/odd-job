We’re lucky to be living in her time</a>\n<br />","byline":"Kevin Mitchell at Wimbledon","body":"<p>Serena Williams has her eyes on New York, not always the most welcoming landscape for her but now a destination where she is desperate to make history and friends.</p> \n<p>Where once there was rancour this time there ought to be the most fulsome lavishing of celebration for the finest tennis player the women’s game has known since Steffi Graf as Williams attempts to draw alongside the German’s tally of 22 majors while completing the first calendar grand slam since Graf’s in 1988.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/serena-williams-beats-garbine-muguruza-wimbledon-grand-slam\" title=\"\">Williams will arrive as owner of all four championships</a> and at the very peak of her game at 33 – fit, healthy and happy. What could possibly go wrong? Everything, if history crowds in on her.</p> \n<p>Williams’s home audience has not always been kind to her in the cavernous Arthur Ashe Stadium. There was the welter of poor calls against her during a loss to Jennifer Capriati in 2004; she was fined $10,500 for launching a tirade at a line official there six years ago during an acrimonious semi-final against Kim Clijsters and she was driven to apoplexy in a row with the chair umpire over a late scream of “come on!” when losing to Sam Stosur in the 2011 final. But this time, surely, it will be different.</p> \n<p>Was she prepared for the barrage of questions she will receive about her bid for the slam when she returns to the United States before the US Open? “I have to go into New York thinking, ‘Listen, I want to win the US Open. I want to defend my title’. And that’s the only reason I want to be there. I want to go in that locker room and take my famous picture on my knees and hold up that No4 [for a fourth title in a row].</p> \n<p>“And that’s how I got through this; it wasn’t about winning the Serena Slam, it was about winning Wimbledon. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/serena-williams-gabrine-muguruza-wimbledon-grand-slam\" title=\"\">I hadn’t won here in a while</a>, I really wanted to win this title and that’s the same mind frame I want to go into the next grand slam.”</p> \n<p>And the US Open? “It would be amazing. It would be really good to have an opportunity. Even to have this opportunity to go into New York, being an American, with that amazing New York crowd … I feel like I play better when I’m relaxed. Last year going into the [US] Open I didn’t get to the quarter-finals of any grand slam and so going into that tournament I was so relaxed that I thought I might repeat that and I probably won’t get too far in this tournament. So I just went in there having a low goal, quarter-finals, and then building on that goal match by match, and that’s literally how I took it. So I just have to take it one match at a time.</p> \n<p>“Hopefully people will be cheering me on to, like, push me over the edge, give me that extra strength I need to go for this historic moment. That would be great. And I think in a way it also makes things easier for me because I feel like I have nothing to lose. I feel like I can go in there, do the best I can and just hope for the best.”</p> \n<p>Her best will be more than good enough. While she had anxious moments here <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/03/serena-williams-v-heather-watson-wimbledon-2015-live\" title=\"\">against Heather Watson</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/serena-williams-victoria-azarenka-wimbledon-2015\" title=\"\">Victoria Azarenka</a> and, to a lesser extent, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/serena-williams-beats-garbine-muguruza-wimbledon-grand-slam\" title=\"\">Garbi&ntilde;e Muguruza in the final</a>, Williams always gave the impression she could find a way. And the regular slam, as opposed to her eponymous one, is the prize that matters most, she reluctantly agreed. “I think so, because of what everyone says and what everyone writes, seeing it as the ultimate – so obviously you can’t help but see it that way too. There’s a reason it’s been 27 years since it’s been done. I mean, it’s not the easiest thing to do.”</p> \n<p>After becoming the oldest slam winner in the modern era by beating the rising Spaniard Muguruza 6-4, 6-4 on Saturday, Williams was as content as experienced observers could recall. She has had more than her share of troubles, from failing health to wavering support during her “difficult” times on court. But there is an air of maturity and satisfaction about her that was missing here in the second round of the doubles last year, when she left the tournament suffering from a mysterious dizzy spell after serving four double faults in a row.</p> \n<p>In the bowels of the media centre at the end of a long and productive day on Saturday she paused to say in turn to each of her inquisitors “thank you so much”, and the thought arrives that the gratitude should be travelling very much in the opposite direction. We all have a lot to thank Serena Williams for.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436731416415/Serena-Williams-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Serena Williams said of September's US Open: 'Hopefully people will be cheering me on to, push me over the edge, give me that extra strength I need to go for this historic moment.'

Captain Meg Lanning and her team were flying out for England on Monday, aiming to break a 14-year dry spell in that country and remove any doubt over who are the world’s best.</p> \n<p>Sustained Ashes success is the one thing missing from the Southern Stars’ wonderful record over the past decade. They have won two of the last three World Cups and three of the last four World Twenty20 tournaments. But they have failed to stamp their authority over their English counterparts, with just one series win (2011) in six attempts since 2005.</p> \n<p>“It’s obviously the one thing we haven’t been able to win and the group is very fired up to really change that,” Lanning said. “Heading into this series we’ve all got a better understanding of our own games. We’re a very attacking-natured team and if we can continue that through all the formats that will give us the best chance of winning.”</p> \n<p>Head coach Matthew Mott said hoped selecting a similar squad to that which narrowly lost the last Ashes series, held 18 months ago in Australia, would ensure a burning desire to correct the record.</p> \n<p>“It’s 2001 the last time the team’s won in England, so there’s a lot of payback ready,” Mott said. “The team’s record speaks for itself over the last 10 years but the one thing that has eluded us is the Ashes. The girls are really excited about the opportunity coming up. We’ve prepared as well as we think we can and obviously those first couple of games are going to be critical.”</p> \n<p>Lanning will be assisted by vice-captain Alex Blackwell, with all-rounder Ellyse Perry and emerging strike bowler Holly Ferling among those likely to give England the most grief with bat and ball.</p> \n<p>Unlike the men’s series, the women’s Ashes includes all three formats of the game, with one Test bookended by a three-match 50-over series and three Twenty20 matches. An English win in the Test match last year at the Waca set up their successful Ashes defence but Mott hoped a change of schedule and weighting would work in their favour this year.</p> \n<p>“What we want to do is play a brand of cricket that’s attractive and enjoyable,” Mott said. “Meg and I have spoken a lot about making sure that in the Test match that we play that same brand of cricket. Aggressive, our intent’s good, a game that people want to sit and watch.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/ad32034d804a16bc55741709e6b9703fb61e10b5/0_0_4584_2751/4584.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2751,"width":4584,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Crosling/AAP","altText":"The Southern Stars captain Meg Lanning said her team would back their attacking instincts in England.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Crosling/AAP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-13T05:45:22Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T05:45:22Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Women's Ashes","Women's cricket","Southern Stars","England women's cricket team","Cricket","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/womens-ashes","webTitle":"Women's Ashes"},{"id":"sport/womenscricket","webTitle":"Women's cricket"},{"id":"sport/australia-women-s-cricket-team","webTitle":"Southern Stars"},{"id":"sport/england-women-cricket-team","webTitle":"England women's cricket team"},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/13/australian-women-vow-to-attack-during-ashes-tour","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4atfc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/13/australian-women-vow-to-attack-during-ashes-tour","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/13/australian-women-vow-to-attack-during-ashes-tour"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/ad32034d804a16bc55741709e6b9703fb61e10b5/0_0_4584_2751/4584.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2751,"width":4584,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Southern Stars captain Meg Lanning said her team would back their attacking instincts in England.

Warrington have got a great squad and some highly skilled players. I thought the quickness of both their dummy halves did some damage to us. Overall I feel encouraged by much of what went on but it was not enough to trouble Warrington on the scoreboard.”</p> \n<p>It was very much a case of job done again for Warrington though. After a mid-season wobble the Wolves are now just two points off fourth spot, and with form and momentum behind them, they look to be slowly getting on the right track ahead of the split themselves.</p> \n<p>The Warrington coach said: “We’re pleased overall. I thought we played alright all things considered. Wakefield have come a long way since we last played them. I thought they were good today; they were breathing right down our necks and it was a potential banana-skin today.”</p> \n<p>“We got troubled a few times near our own line and I have to pay tribute to young Miller, who was absolutely brilliant today. He was a real threat with ball in hand.</p> \n<p>“I thought Matty Russell was outstanding for us, his carrying of the ball was absolutely brilliant, and there were some terrific efforts from our dummy halves, Brad Dwyer and Daryl Clark. When they’re both out there, they’re a real threat.”</p> \n<p>A slow start from the hosts enabled Warrington to surge into a 12-0 lead, courtesy of tries from Stefan Ratchford and Joe Philbin, before Miller got his first on 18 minutes. By the time he scored his second Warrington had two more tries of their own to lead 22-6, but his hat-trick try four minutes after the restart reduced the gap to just eight points, sparking hopes of an upset.</p> \n<p>But the England international Clark then scored a wonderful solo try to calm any Warrington nerves, before the Catalans-bound half-back Richie Myler followed suit with another two minutes later. By the time Miller had scored his fourth the game was up for Wakefield, with Russell adding extra gloss to the result for Warrington four minutes from time.</p> \n<p><strong>Wakefield</strong> Locke; Tansey, Arundel, Lyne, Riley; Hall, Miller; Scruton, McShane, Kavanagh, Ashurst, Washbrook, Annakin. <strong>Interchange </strong>Anderson, Ryan, Sio, Walker. <strong>Tries </strong>Miller 4 <strong>Goals </strong>Miller, Hall</p> \n<p><strong>Warrington </strong>Russell; Ormsby, Wheeler, Atkins, Penny; O’Brien, Myler; Hill, Clark, Harrison, Westwood, Philbin, Ratchford. <strong>Interchange </strong>Dwyer, Asotasi, King, Wilde. <strong>Tries </strong>Ratchford, Philbin, Russell 2, Westwood, Clark, Myler <strong>Goals </strong>O’Brien 6</p> \n<p><strong>Referee </strong>P Bentham <strong>Attendance </strong>3,354</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/7/12/1436731530483/Wakefield-Trinity-Wildcat-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jacob Miller scores Wakefield’s fourth try but it was not enough to overcome a powerful Warrington side who ran out 40-20 winners.

This beautiful ground, overlooked by the school – which is grand in an army barracks rather than a country house way – has some wonderful quirks. The oval is ringed by trees, each of which is planted in celebration of a First XI century, while the pavilion clock is fast, meaning each session has begun four minutes early.</p> \n<p>Finn’s timing was impeccable. Even in a frustrating morning session for Middlesex that saw a disciplined bowling performance go wicketless, he beat the bat regularly and struck Tom Abell on the hand and Marcus Trescothick on the forearm. Abell was particularly doughty, taking 51 balls to reach 10 and registering his first boundary only when Ollie Rayner bowled him a loosener in the final over before lunch. Trescothick was more fluent, driving handsomely through cover and battering an uppish cut over point. Even on a pitch that is pale in colour (but is much trickier than that suggests), 69 without loss represented a significant victory for the visitors.</p> \n<p>That fine work was undone after the break, however, as Somerset lost four wickets for 44. First Abell feathered Finn behind, then Johann Myburgh had an unwise slash at Tim Murtagh with the same result. Finn’s pace was too much for James Hildreth, before Toby Roland-Jones pinned Trescothick plumb in front. Peter Trego twice hit Rayner through leg but was deceived by one that stayed low on the stroke of tea.</p> \n<p>From there, it was stop-start and emphatically Middlesex. Lewis Gregory was beaten for pace, Michael Bates was hit on the helmet by Finn and the patient Jim Allenby was caught well at slip with the light fading. An over later, Murtagh had dismissed Abdur Rehman and they were off for good.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436729510199/Steven-Finn-signing-crick-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England and Middlesex bowler Steven Finn signing cricket bats.

Stoneman was particularly savage during his initial burst of 5-0-34-0, depositing one pull over midwicket for six to reach a 76-ball 50. Revenge was delivered when Milnes rushed one through a lackadaisical prod - one of six wickets for 82 runs that redressed the balance of the contest.</p> \n<p>Clarke won contrasting leg before awards against Michael Richardson, who walked, and Collingwood, who visibly struggled to contain his displeasure, before returning to mop up the tail with the second new ball.</p> \n<p>But with their most decorated batsman, Jonathan Trott, on paternity leave, Warwickshire now face a grind to achieve parity but Stoneman, the one man to have mastered the surface, does not anticipate that happening. “If our lads are on song I can see us knocking them over for under 200,” he said.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436730162678/Rikki-Clarke-Warwickshire-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rikki Clarke of Warwickshire, pictured during a one-day match in August 2014, took five wickets in an innings for the first time in four years against Durham on Sunday.
