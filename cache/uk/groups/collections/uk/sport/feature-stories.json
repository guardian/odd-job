A few yards away a small group of men, women and children sat quietly on folding chairs while the giant screen in front of them relayed live coverage of<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/07/germany-celia-sasic-womens-world-cup-ivory-coast\" title=\"\"> Germany 10 Ivory Coast 0</a> from Ottawa.</p> \n<p>As the goals flew in several younger family members were enjoying a gentle kickabout on a mini football pitch installed across the cycleway as part of a newly established Fifa FanZone. With assorted brightly coloured international flags flapping in the breeze and a local band playing soft-rock covers, the atmosphere was happy and relaxed. It would, however, have been a gross exaggeration to claim World Cup fever was in the air.</p> \n<p>Two days later the weather had turned wet and windy to help dash hopes of filling Moncton Stadium – normally an athletics venue – to its 13,000 capacity. Those who stayed away did not miss much while an at-times slightly bored-looking <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/france-england-womens-world-cup-group-f-match-report\" title=\"\">France were beating an England side much better off the ball than on it 1-0</a>. Happily things picked up later and the absentees missed a treat in the highly entertaining <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/colombia-mexico-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">1-1 draw between Mexico and Colombia</a>.</p> \n<p>The reporter from Canada’s Globe and Mail summed up the situation in Moncton rather well. “On day four of this World Cup we saw women’s soccer at its best and dreariest,” he wrote. “Are the locals paying attention? Some of them. In a subdued sort of way.” The next morning The Times and Transcript, Moncton’s paper, offered a partial explanation for the disappointing crowd. “World Cup park and ride overwhelmed” declared its front page.</p> \n<p>Yet if unexpected queues for the free stadium shuttle service had succeeded in trumping rivals’ stories including “Greenland Harvest Threatens Atlantic Salmon” and “Crosswalk Light Broken at Scene of Fatal Collision”, the football itself is still to capture the region’s imagination properly. Hosting World Cup games may be a big deal for the hoteliers, restaurateurs and taxi drivers in this small city near the Atlantic coast but the overall sense is that the disarmingly friendly and unfailingly courteous locals are only mildly interested in Canada 2015.</p> \n<p>Not that this charming corner of New Brunswick should be regarded as a microcosm of a country almost the size of Europe staging games in cities spanning five of its six time zones. Unlike Moncton, other host cities have leading female football sides, sometimes rivalling their ice hockey equivalents in popularity. And significantly, unlike Moncton, other venues are multi-ethnic.</p> \n<p>After all, 53,000 – a record crowd for women’s football in Canada – turned out in Edmonton to see <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/07/canada-china-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">the hosts beat China 1-0</a> in the tournament’s curtain-raiser. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/08/sweden-nigeria-womens-world-cup-group-d-match-report\" title=\"\">Sweden’s thrilling 3-3 “group of death” draw with Nigeria</a> and the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/08/usa-beat-australia-at-womens-world-cup-thanks-to-megan-rapinoes-magic\" title=\"\">USA’s 3-1 defeat of Australia</a> were sufficiently engaging to suggest this is an event capable of drawing even the initially indifferent into its web.</p> \n<p>Bar Camille Abily’s unpunished elbow, jabbed painfully into Laura Bassett’s cheek during France v England, the tournament has so far proved refreshingly free of diving, cheating, time wasting, referee haranguing, injury feigning and much of the gamesmanship that regular watchers of the men’s game take, reluctantly, for granted.</p> \n<p>With female football still taking baby steps towards full professionalism, the sport retains a certain innocence long absent from its male equivalent.</p> \n<p>It is no coincidence the word “purity” keeps cropping up in tournament coverage. “Women’s football is very pure,” says Victor Montagliani, president of Canada Soccer. “It can shine a light on the dark clouds hanging over the wider game.”</p> \n<p>To date some 920,000 match tickets have been sold, meaning Canada 2015 is well on course to exceed the 1.2m record total registered during USA 1999. Much may hinge on how far the host nation – ably coached by the Consett-born John Herdman – progress.</p> \n<p>Damon Holowchak, director of a Vancouver pub chain, is convinced Herdman’s tactics will play a key role in determining this month’s profit margins. He does not expect “extraordinary business” unless Canada shine.</p> \n<p>“If Canada go deep it will [boost profits], a bit like the Canucks going deep into the NHL play-offs,” Holowchak says. “People will want to get out and watch the games – and this country will throw a party.”</p> \n<p>Whatever happens, high-calibre fixtures beckon once the knockout stages begin. If certain group matches appear a little underwhelming, the expansion of these finals to 24 teams means eight sides are making their World Cup debuts, with some one-sided encounters an inevitable byproduct. Excellent as Germany undoubtedly are, Ivory Coast had played only one game in the eight months before their thrashing.</p> \n<p>If the blame for such imbalances can be laid at Sepp Blatter’s door, do not expect to see too many of his old gang in the roped-off VVIP stadium seats. Well before the Zurich arrests the ruling body decreed mere bog-standard VIP positions were not good enough for its dignitaries. But with FBI officers waiting to pounce from across the US border, some of those “Very Very Important People” may well bodyswerve Canada 2015.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433955850092/Christine-Sinclair-Canada-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Christine Sinclair, right, celebrates scoring the late penalty that gave Canada a 1-0 win over China in the opening game of the Women's World Cup.

Can her return lift a lagging attack?</p>","byline":"Caitlin Murray in Winnipeg","body":"<p>Can the USA win a Women’s World Cup without striker Alex Morgan?</p> \n<p>That was perhaps the most pressing question about the USA heading into the tournament as doubts about Morgan’s readiness lingered due to a bone bruise to her left knee. Arguably the team’s best player, she hadn’t played in a competitive match in nearly two months going into Monday’s opener. In fact, she hadn’t even been fully training with the team.</p> \n<p>But now it seems the question may not need to be answered. Seemingly out of nowhere, Morgan returned to the field for the Americans as a late sub on Monday and is apparently ready to take the world by storm.</p> \n<p>“I’ll be ready to start if (coach Jill Ellis) wants me to,” Morgan told the Guardian after the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/08/usa-beat-australia-at-womens-world-cup-thanks-to-megan-rapinoes-magic\">USA’s 3-1 win over Australia.</a> “The plan is to hopefully build minutes throughout this tournament, but if she wants me to start, I’ll be there.”</p> \n<p>That’s a quick turnaround from not fully participating in team trainings only two days earlier. Her first full training with the team in World Cup preparations was on Saturday, according to the team, and the USA women opened their World Cup on Monday.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/gallery/2015/jun/09/womens-world-cup-australia-v-usa-in-pictures\">Women's World Cup: USA v Australia – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If Morgan can play a big role for the Americans, they will certainly need it. The USA looked somewhat dumbfounded in the attack for most of the first half against Australia. A very lucky deflection on a Megan Rapinoe shot got the Americans on the board first, but the USA offense was otherwise uninspiring.<br /></p> \n<p>Forward Abby Wambach had three clear chances for a header and she failed to capitalize each time. Twice she sent the ball wide and another time, she whiffed her best chance all day, somehow missing a ball that grazed her head. Wambach is known for being clutch, but she hasn’t been so much lately – it’s potentially a side effect of her decision to not play club soccer this year so she could focus on the World Cup.</p> \n<p>Sydney Leroux, the other forward in a tandem pair, struggled to get into the match early on, in part because of poor service. She did her best to chase down balls, something Morgan is particularly adept at, but had limited success until the second half when Australia started to look fatigued.</p> \n<p>Notably, none of the USA’s goals came from forwards on Monday, but Morgan said that doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think it means anything that the three forwards that got in didn’t score,” Morgan said after the USA’s first group-stage match. “It’s a long tournament and we need to pace ourselves.”</p> \n<p>Morgan came on in the 79th minute to replace Leroux after the Americans took a cushy 3-1 lead. She looked comfortable on the field, at times displaying how her speed and hustle can create opportunities from nowhere. </p> \n<p>“I felt really good. I had no pain whatsoever,” Morgan said. “Obviously, I was running down balls a lot and trying to keep possession and making sure we kept the 3-1 lead. So, I was getting max sprints out of me and I felt good. I’m looking forward to getting more time next game.”</p> \n<p>In her first touches of the match, she ran onto a long ball, cut around a defender and fired a long-range shot, which sailed wide. Though she created a spark, her short time on the field raised another question as Morgan works to get back to top form in the middle of a World Cup:&nbsp;how quickly can she shake off the rust and get her finishing back? </p> \n<p>Morgan went through this already earlier in the year. She sprained her ankle in October’s World Cup qualifying and was back to full training by late January. Her finishing seemed to suffer for a couple weeks until she scored against England in a February friendly. The World Cup, of course, is a four-week-long tournament.</p> \n<p>When Morgan is in form, she is massively productive. She has 51 goals and 32 assists in 85 international appearances for the Americans. When she scored in that win over England earlier this year, she became the third-fastest American woman to reach the 50-goal threshold behind Michelle Akers (49 games) and&nbsp;Wambach (64).</p> \n<p>But it may be a challenge to get her finishing back without matches. Given that the USA secured a victory worth three points and sole possession of first place in Group D to start their World Cup, it seems unlikely Ellis will call upon Morgan for significant minutes until the knockout stage. Ellis has made it clear Morgan will be eased into playing time.</p> \n<p>Still, Morgan said she is ready to start, and having one of the most potent threats available to be deployed at any time is a mental edge for the Americans, who could see rough waters ahead in the so-called&nbsp;Group of Death.</p> \n<p>It may be a sigh of relief for fans, too. In the lead-up to the opener, questions from reporters about Morgan’s return weren’t met with very clear-cut answers. With several weeks until the World Cup, Morgan wasn’t playing or training, and Ellis called it a “precautionary” measure – but as time stretched on, it seemed more like a possibility that Morgan was seriously injured.</p> \n<p>Whatever happened between then and now may no longer matter. It seems Morgan has gotten herself into match readiness with remarkable quickness, and if she can get her finishing back just as quickly, the USA’s chances of winning the World Cup seem immeasurably better.</p> \n<p>“It’s awesome to see how quickly she’s gotten back into the game and the way she’s taken care of herself over this time,” said teammate Tobin Heath at training on Tuesday. “It’s just shown that she’s able to jump in so seamlessly with us now.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/74309f6c514ede56587f6dd7b895593ce66af2e6/0_154_4556_2737/4556.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2737,"width":4556,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Kevin C.

Finn’s dismissal of McCullum all but stopped the chase in its tracks even given the potential of Martin Guptill’s hitting&nbsp;prowess.</p> \n<p>It certainly provided an ideal environment for Rashid with his leg-spin. He bowled very nicely, showing deceptive variations and some decent spin, and with his runs was a plausible candidate for man of the match. But the clamour that is already there for his instant inclusion in the Test side is heaping too much expectation on him and getting way ahead of the game.</p> \n<p>It is four years since I found myself writing an optimistic piece about Scott Borthwick perhaps having the potential to become the first English wrist-spinner since Tommy Greenough, in 1959, to take five wickets in a Test innings. That prospect fizzled out and last season he managed only 13 wickets for Durham at more than 58 runs apiece: his batting has become his forte instead.</p> \n<p>As an aside, the most prolific wrist-spinners for England since Doug Wright (108 wickets), the left-armer Johnny Wardle (102) and Eric Hollies (44), all in the decade after the second world war, have not been the obvious ones (Robin Hobbs, Ian Salisbury and Chris Schofield, all of whom were selected specifically as spinners) but the opening batsman Bob Barber, who took 42 wickets, and Ken Barrington, who managed 29.</p> \n<p>In Ian Peebles (45), Len Braund (47), Walter Robins (64) and Tich Freeman (66) you have the only wrist-spinners to have taken more wickets for England than Barber. As a contrast there are 25 finger-spinners with more than him, of whom 15 have more wickets than Wright. A lack of quality wrist spin is scarcely a new phenomenon.</p> \n<p>Even back in the Caribbean, where Rashid was selected for the Test tour but did not play, it was felt by some of the management that he could have a stronger part to play in England’s limited-overs cricket. For spinners, particularly those who can turn the ball either way, have tended to thrive in the format, largely because of the imperative for batsmen to attack and the preponderance of boundary fielders.</p> \n<p>On the other hand Test cricket – as New Zealand and most recently England have shown – can be adventurous, but it still remains a world away from the white-ball game. Unless there was a pitch that was so obviously going to turn significantly (the UAE in October might be a case in point) then, particularly in this country, the bowling is always going to be dominated by seamers, with a spinner largely required to play a holding role until the latter stages of the match.</p> \n<p>There is certainly a case for saying he could play a part in winkling out the tail, something that has eluded England for several years now, but technically, in terms of his default pace, he may allow Test match batsmen too much time. He really cannot play as a single spinner and in general, unless the seamers would be largely redundant once the new ball had gone, he would unbalance the team as a second spinner.</p> \n<p>For now, best to enjoy what Rashid is doing in the happy environment in which he finds himself.

The Everton defender gets to revisit his childhood club just before the tournament that could act as a launching pad for the rest of his international career.</p> \n<p>Stones grew up a matter of minutes from the ground in Barnsley and from the age of seven was on the Tykes’ books before swapping a Championship relegation battle for Goodison in a &pound;3m move in January 2013, aged 18. His development in the two and a half years since has been rapid. He was placed on standby for the senior squad at the World Cup last year and is now preparing to play a key part in England’s quest for their first Under-21 honours since 1984.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/gareth-southgate-england-european-under-21-championships\">Gareth Southgate waives England rules for Euro Under-21 Championships</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I’ve matured so much on the pitch – probably not off the pitch as much – but it’s been a great learning experience,” said the defender. “I’m very proud of where I’ve come from and what I’ve done. To Everton, to the England squad, it all happened very fast. It will be a great night for me to go back and hopefully play. To play on Oakwell – it brings back good memories there, going back to my days with [then Barnsley manager] Keith Hill. I think in the early stages of your career the games you play make you who you are and the Championship was a tough league, really tough.”</p> \n<p>Those formative experiences have helped add a rugged edge to a player who by his own admission “couldn’t be dirty if I tried”. But although his club manager, Roberto Mart&iacute;nez, and the Under-21 head coach, Gareth Southgate, are card-carrying disciples of the passing game, Stones recognises where his priorities as a defender must lie.</p> \n<p>“It’s got to be a mixture but as a defender keeping the ball out of the net first and foremost,” he said. “If it means doing it ugly then that’s what it’s got to take. But I’ve always been taught to bring the ball out and try to start play from the back. Roberto at Everton taught me to do that and the gaffer here as well is 100% behind me. That’s where the game’s going, I think, and for me to keep progressing and [be] on the ball tactically<strong> </strong>I’ve got to keep doing that.”</p> \n<p>That will be music to the ears of Southgate, who is eager to drum home the need for his defenders to prioritise defending. The message certainly seemed to hit home during the qualifying stages – England conceded only twice in 10 group games, comfortably the best record on the continent.</p> \n<p>Southgate said of Stones: “He’s quick, he can deal with things well one against one, he’s as composed as any young defender I’ve seen on the ball, really outstanding in that area. Like all of our defenders, there’s still a bit of work to be done on that understanding that keeping the ball out the net is No1, and we think as a team we’ve got to keep developing that. But everything is there for him to be successful. A stable background, good family support, wants to be the best he can be, wants to learn, if you’re working on things he’s always attentive, always looking back at his games to see what he could do better, analysing things – he’s a really exciting player.”</p> \n<p>Stones is one of five players in Southgate’s squad to have won caps with the full side – Jack Butland, Carl Jenkinson, Calum Chambers and Harry Kane are the others – and although he missed out on the World Cup squad despite being part of the pre-tournament training group in Miami, he was in the starting XI for England’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland in September.</p> \n<p>An ankle injury meant he missed nearly three months of the season and the chance to establish himself in Roy Hodgson’s squad but he hopes a successful tournament in the Czech Republic can help put him back into the reckoning for France in a year’s time. “We love playing for our country and to get tournament experience is massive for us,” he said. “So to take such a strong squad it should be a good experience for us all.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/6/10/1433956623586/John-Stones-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"John Stones is 'as composed as any young defender I've seen on the ball', says his England Under-21s manager, Gareth Southgate.

Having agreed to provide the prize money, the Qataris immediately set about trying to win some of it back by purchasing two horses fancied for races at Royal Ascot next week, including King Of Rooks, an impressive winner of Sandown’s recent National Stakes.</p> \n<p>Those behind the sponsorship deal repeatedly declined even to hint at the sum of money involved but one report has guessed at &pound;50m and that is not being criticised. The deal runs until 2024 and a simple process of adding up the prize money for the races involved over that time suggests that figure may even be on the low side.</p> \n<p>The deal is between Ascot, Newmarket, British Champions Series and Qipco, which is the investment vehicle of Qatar’s ruling Al Thani family. Since 2011, Qipco has been the backer for the Champions Series of 35 top British Flat races as well as an increasing number of the races themselves and the total prize money for those contests has, according to a BCS press release, risen 50% to &pound;17.4m over that time.</p> \n<p>The parties involved have stated a couple of early prize money ambitions in light of the new deal. Their plan is for Champions Day at Ascot in October to be worth &pound;5m by 2024, while the 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket will be made up to &pound;500,000 from next year, an increase of almost 25% in the case of the fillies’ race.</p> \n<p>Qipco became Ascot’s first official partner last year as a result of its investment at the royal track and that status has now been extended to 2024, entitling the firm to branding rights during two days of the Royal meeting each year. Nick Smith, Ascot’s spokesman, put the benefits of this deal in context when he described it as “unprecedented for both us and the wider industry”.</p> \n<p>Having such a long-term and well-funded commitment would, Smith said, “give us the confidence to be able to plan ahead. We’re going to look in the round at where we stand and have a think, over the rest of the year, about the way we should be using this investment.</p> \n<p>“Of course there will be prize money increases on the back of these deals and we have to find the balance between investing in prize money and our facilities. Prize money is not the whole deal but it is fundamental.”</p> \n<p>As news of the deal was released, Deloitte simultaneously published a report on the various means by which Qipco has invested in British racing in recent years. Again, the writers fought shy of reaching a global figure but mentioned 95 people employed, directly and indirectly, as well as capital investment of more than &pound;10m at the two stables owned by the firm.</p> \n<p>Al Shaqab, the name under which Sheikh Joaan al-Thani owns horses, has purchased a pair of promising two-year-olds, it emerged on Wednesday. King Of Rooks is the 5-4 favourite for next week’s Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot, while Easton Angel is third in the betting for the Queen Mary Stakes at 11-2.</p> \n<p>The pair are expected to stay with their current trainers, respectively Richard Hannon and Michael Dods. Only 50% of Easton Angel was sold and Paul Mulrennan keeps the ride as part of the deal.</p> \n<p>Cirrus Des Aigles will miss what would have been a keenly anticipated clash with Treve at Saint-Cloud later this month after discovery of what his trainer, Corine Barande-Barbe, described as “a little bump and a bruise” on one leg. She mentioned the Irish Champion Stakes in September as a possible target.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433956676822/Ascot-Races-QIPCO-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The plan is for QIPCO Champions Day at Ascot to be worth at least £5m by 2024.

He was accompanied by a fellow centurion, Joe Root, and Adil Rashid, who made 69. England’s innings of 408 for nine was their best ever one-day total.</p> \n<p>It was a performance in stark contrast to their display at the recent World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, where they failed to advance from the group stage. That campaign resulted in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/09/andrew-strauss-confirmed-director-england-cricket-ecb\" title=\"\">Peter Moores’ dismissal as coach</a>, although his assistant Paul Farbrace has remained in the interim before the arrival of Trevor Bayliss.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/england-new-zealand-first-odi-match-report\">England break records and New Zealand with crushing victory in first ODI</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Buttler, the Lancashire wicketkeeper, produced a stunning knock and reckons his side’s performance was the result of all those involved in English cricket demanding an attacking style. “If we weren’t going to go out and have a swing when everybody in this room wanted it, English cricket, the paying public and everybody who watches this sport, we couldn’t have had more of a licence to go and get bowled out for 150 in 20 overs,” he said.</p> \n<p>“I think that is a big change – everyone has accepted that English cricket can do that and I think if we were bowled out for 200 in 30 overs we would not have been criticised that much. So we had a real lease of life to go and play that way. It wasn’t through lack of trying before, it’s not as if we wanted to play [badly].”</p> \n<p>England gave Sam Billings a one-day debut while Surrey’s Jason Roy opened the batting. However, the new faces were not the ones who contributed significantly to the remarkable win, Roy being caught from the first ball of the match and Billings adding only three down the&nbsp;order.</p> \n<p>Instead Buttler, Root and Rashid scored at a rapid rate, the latter taking four wickets, as did Steven Finn, as New Zealand toiled to 198 all out. Buttler revealed his excitement at the new names in the squad, saying there is a vibrancy and freedom that will help England in good stead as they attempt to make progress on the one-day stage.</p> \n<p>“There’s a huge potential,” he said. “We don’t want to get carried away at one performance and think English ODI is fixed and we’re going to win the World Cup. But I think just looking round – the two training days were really exciting, watching what some of these guys can do in the nets, the energy they have brought to the group just through being new to international cricket, how exciting it is and how much fun it is.</p> \n<p>“There’s definitely been an extra buzz. Everyone has seen in county cricket how guys like Jason Roy and Sam Billings have played innings that make people stand up and take notice. When they do that in international cricket there will be a wider audience taking note. When we realise the potential of everyone as a group and can all do that at the same time, it will be a really exciting place to be.”</p> \n<p>New Zealand rested Tim Southee, and all their bowlers with the exception of Trent Boult were brutally punished by England. Southee could return at The Oval on Friday and the Kiwis’ coach, Mike Hesson, admitted his side must now fight to regain form for the four remaining ODIs. “I think it’s a different group,” said Hesson. “This English side naturally are quite attacking players. If you bowl poorly to them, they’ll punish you. The way Joe played initially and then Jos, and, to be fair, Adil Rashid batted beautifully as well at a critical time. They certainly gained some momentum and we’ve got to look to get it back in the next couple of days.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/10/1433949582536/jos-buttler-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Jos Buttler flat-bats another bounday in his 129 against New Zealand at Edgbaston.
