As thoughts turn naturally towards the first Ashes Test in three weeks, it would be easy for England’s one-off Twenty20 against New Zealand at Old Trafford to fade into a state of spectral semi-invisibility, a game to be forgotten before it has even begun.</p> \n<p>Except, of course, things are supposed to be a little different these days. The appointment of Andrew Strauss as the director of cricket may not have been everybody’s idea of a break from the more constipated recent past but the early talk about making white-ball formats the focus, the strong top hand leading English cricket into the near future, was reflected gloriously in the one-day series against New Zealand. With this in mind even a one-off, mid-season Twenty20 looks like an opportunity to emphasise the shift in focus from sullen five-day specialists to the new “brand” of England cricket, with its talk of engagement, aggression, polyvalent self-expression and all the rest of it.</p> \n<p>This represents a significant shift in priorities. In the buildup to this match two notable recent retirees have criticised the way red-ball cricket has tended to drive every decision around the England team. First, Graeme Swann suggested that Test match players have often dominated the one-day team for reasons other than pure playing merit. Separately <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/craig-kieswetter-england-cricket-dressing-room-cliques\" title=\"\">Craig Kieswetter has mentioned the split between cliques </a>of Test and one-day players, with no points for guessing which group ranked higher up the scale of human worth.</p> \n<p>But this has changed now. The idea that white-ball cricket – in other words, the cricket most of the world plays and watches – must be allowed to drive the way England prepare and select their teams was reiterated this week by the interim head coach, Paul Farbrace. And with this in mind it seemed apposite that Sam Billings, one of the more invigoratingly unconventional England debutants of recent years, should address the media before a match that is likely to bring his own Twenty20 international debut.</p> \n<p>“Hopefully playing New Zealand has generated a bit of interest around the country and got people behind the England cricket team going into the Ashes,” Billings said of the recent one-day international series. “Hopefully the vibe around the team can be taken forward into the Ashes and the one-day series against Australia. It is a start but that is how we mean to go on.</p> \n<p>“The gulf between Test and one-day cricket has probably narrowed in the last few years. The guys who are not in that Ashes squad have got to go back to our counties and play like England players. The great thing about this one-day team is there is competition for every place which is a good thing going forward.”</p> \n<p>Having played as a specialist No7 in the one-day series, Billings is expected to retain his place there behind Jonny Bairstow, who will keep wicket at Old Trafford. In the course of a wide-ranging press conference that touched on Billings’ skill at rackets (his cousin is the world No1) and the fact that he once scored a hat-trick for his under-14 football team against Tottenham Hotspur’s academy, it was tempting to reflect on the importance for any England Twenty20 cricketer of keeping a full range of alternative career options open.</p> \n<p>The sheer churn in personnel is evidence enough of how England have struggled with the shortest form. Of 13 international debutants in the last four years, only one, James Tredwell, has 10 or more caps. Harry Gurney, Tredwell, Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, Ravi Bopara and Moeen Ali will all be missing in Manchester, from England’s last game in this format against India last summer. The game before that had seen Michael Carberry, for reasons that remain obscure, make his England Twenty20 debut, face seven balls and then never play again, while the game before that England were bowled out for 88 by the Netherlands in Chittagong, the medium pacer Logan van Beek taking three for nine in 12 balls.</p> \n<p>Tuesday’s team will show nine changes from that ignominious end to last year’s World Twenty20. For once the abundance of untried talent looks like something other than a curiosity. Billings was keen to talk about “momentum”, as sports people so often are, but he might just be on to something.</p> \n<p>If England really are serious about allowing talent in the shorter game to pollinate across every format, then Alex Hales, Eoin Morgan, James Vince, Bairstow and, according to some wise judges, Jason Roy all have a chance to press their case.</p> \n<p>Another sound performance from Adil Rashid would confirm his status as England’s current best attacking option in white-ball cricket and an intriguing choice as a possible second spinner in the longer game. With the weather set fair there is at least a sense of something more at stake than simply a glorified farewell to some very popular tourists.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434995877303/England-Nets-Session-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's captain, Eoin Morgan, impresses his team-mates with a diving catch before their T20 international against New Zealand at Old Trafford.

That is what I personally think.”</p> \n<p>The No7 shirt worn by Kevin Keegan, Kenny Dalglish, Peter Beardsley and Luis Su&aacute;rez and the No9 shirt that Ian St John, Ian Rush and Robbie Fowler have donned are traditionally the Liverpool numbers most associated with the weight of history. Gerrard’s career means the No8 has added significance and his departure to LA Galaxy means his number, in addition to the No7 vacated by Su&aacute;rez last summer, is now available.</p> \n<p>Ings, though, who wore the No10 with Burnley, has no interest in taking either just yet. “I would make sure I am established before taking any of those numbers,” he said. “It is such a huge club. That was the thinking behind it. I wouldn’t want to go to Liverpool and chuck a shirt on my back like that … it is pressure you don’t need. The expectation at clubs like that is huge. Obviously I am going to work my socks off to earn that number one day. For now I will take a high number and work hard.”</p> \n<p>The transfer fee taking him from Turf Moor to Anfield has yet to be finalised, with Liverpool expecting to pay between &pound;5m-6m and Burnley holding out for something closer to &pound;10m. An independent tribunal will decide on the price if the clubs cannot come to an arrangement.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/21/sweden-england-european-under-21-championship-match-report\">Sweden 0-1 England | European Under-21 Championship Group B match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The disagreement means the move will be slightly more protracted than it could have been. For Ings, though, the potential for a change of scene has been long in the pipeline, beginning with his decision not to sign a new contract at Burnley last summer.</p> \n<p>“I knew about my contract situation at the start of the season,” he said. “I had a big decision to make whether to sign a new contract or not. I sat down with my family and agent and we came up with I was going to hold out.</p> \n<p>“I had quite a strong season, but obviously we went down and I was gutted. But I thought I did enough to get myself a good move and the next step, and another challenge. It is a challenge I am really looking forward to and I can’t wait to get going.”</p> \n<p>Ings has twice impressed as a substitute for England in the Under-21 Championship and could have done enough to force himself into Gareth Southgate’s plans for their make-or-break final group game against Italy on Wednesday. Southgate’s side play with a lone striker in the shape of Harry Kane and thus far Tom Carroll and Will Hughes have been preferred in the starting XI in the role just behind the Tottenham striker.</p> \n<p>Ings would perhaps offer a more attacking option at No10 but he is happy to wait for his chance. “That is the competition you want for any side, club or country,” he said.</p> \n<p>“You need that competition to push each other along to perform better. We did that against Sweden. Everyone came on and made an impact. That is what the manager needs. You can’t have players come on and not make the impact because the game will slowly slip away from you. It is important you are ready.”</p> \n<p>Southgate’s three substitutes against Sweden did indeed help turn the tide, with Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Jesse Lingard also impressing. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/21/sweden-england-european-under-21-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">The latter’s 85th-minute winner</a> means England go into their final game in the same Andruv Stadium in Olomouc knowing a win will to take them through to the semi-finals for the first time since 2009.

He has done Barcelona and here, two out of eight isn’t too bad really. I’m happy with that.</p> \n<p>“I have only had a couple of weekends where I have not been the strongest. Seven poles out of eight is pretty decent and perhaps without Monaco it wouldn’t be as close as it is now.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton admitted Roseberg was quicker in Austria and “did a fantastic job”. He added: “I’m not sure if he was quicker all weekend but he was definitely quicker in the race.”</p> \n<p>Rosberg, though, looked in more convincing form on all three days at the Austrian Grand Prix, and was set on Saturday to take pole before spinning off.</p> \n<p>The German said: “We’ve been developing the clutch so that’s a lot better now, more consistent, and I’ve had a lot of great starts lately in the last four races – and Sunday as well.”</p> \n<p>The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, said the former Ferrari and Mercedes technical director Ross Brawn could be the man to enliven F1 after much recent criticism. “I think the strategy group is fairly inept,” he said. “I keep saying it and I will repeat it again now: it is the commercial rights holder and governing body [the FIA] to decide what F1 should be and then put it on the table to the teams and say, ‘This is what we want the product to be, these are the rules, this is the entry form.’</p> \n<p>“Maybe you need an independent observer, someone not involved … someone like Ross Brawn, who understands the challenges and knows the business, to write a specification for what a car or technical regulations should be.”</p> \n<p>Horner, the most impressive team chief in the paddock, has been identified by some as the most likely man to take charge of the leader-less sport, in which the FIA does not seem interested while Bernie Ecclestone, 85 this year, appears incapable of reviving the sport he built up into a &pound;1.5bn business.</p> \n<p>Horner said: “Formula One has a huge amount of following around the world but we need to do a better job. We have gone too far and it is too complicated and we need to bring it back to basics. The cars are too easy to drive and you don’t see the drivers working as hard as they did a few years ago. You never hear a driver complaining about his neck these days. They want cars to be more of a challenge and therefore more of a spectacle.</p> \n<p>“The cars need to be more of a challenge. There needs to be more competition. We don’t have that at the moment. There are a lot of discussions for 2017 at the moment but can we wait for 2017? We need to accelerate some ideas and decisions need to be made so people know what’s coming.</p> \n<p>“We need to simplify some of these rules. Taking penalties and then further penalties in the race, drive-throughs, for example, is too complicated. It isn’t right that we don’t know what the grid sheet is until 10pm on a Saturday night after qualifying. For the teams to follow and understand is complicated enough but for the fans we need to keep it simple and get back to basics about what grand prix racing is.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434994948323/Nico-Rosberg-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nico Rosberg, right, celebrates his third win of the season in Austria, adding to victories in Barcelona and in Monaco.

Rosberg revved up on race days</h2> \n<p>Nico Rosberg has sharpened up his racing skills, as he promised. The German regularly beat Lewis Hamilton in qualifying last year but said he had to become stronger on race days. This year Hamilton has beaten Rosberg 7-1 in qualifying and still has the edge when it comes to wheel-to-wheel action. Rosberg, however, is now clearly a more committed adversary on Sunday afternoon and he <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/21/nico-rosberg-austrian-f1-gp-lewis-hamilton-mercedes\" title=\"\">surprised the world champion in Austria</a> by jumping him just after the start.</p> \n<h2>2. F1 fights back</h2> \n<p>It is peak season for trashing Formula One, with the most critical voices being the sport’s CEO, Bernie Ecclestone, and a list of highly regarded drivers. In Austria, though, the sport showed signs that it was ready to fight back. The crowd at Spielberg on Sunday was only 57% of last year’s attendance but it should be remembered that in 2014 it was a holiday weekend. In the Mercedes motorhome an hour before the race Toto Wolff, the team’s motorsport director, made an impassioned defence of his sport, telling everyone that, despite some of what the old drivers are saying, the modern cars are still very difficult to drive. Other teams, frightened of losing more sponsorship, are also in punchy mood.</p> \n<h2>3. Midfield and at the back is where real action is</h2> \n<p>Forget the frontrunners and concentrate on the also-rans if you want to see some proper racing. The real action is at the back or in the midfield these days. The best scrap at the Red Bull Ring on Sunday was that between the Williams of Valtteri Bottas and the Force India of Nico Hulkenberg. After a sluggish start Force India are once again punching above their weight and Nico – fresh from his win in the 24 Hours of Le Mans – gave a reminder of how good he could be with a top team in F1.</p> \n<h2>4. The Raikkonen question</h2> \n<p>Kimi Raikkonen moves further towards a future out of the sport. The Finn started the weekend angrily denying rumours that Ferrari would want him to take a pay cut for next season. Then he failed to get out of Q1 in Saturday’s qualifying and finally made it through just two corners in the race before crashing. The champion of 2007 may soon be looking for an enhanced pension instead of a new pay deal.</p> \n<h2>5. McLaren’s problems continue</h2> \n<p>Even the presence of Honda’s new CEO cannot inspire troubled McLaren. The new man was in place at the Red Bull Ring but things do not get any better for the team and their Japanese power unit. Fernando Alonso crashed out just after the start and Jenson Button was forced to retire on lap nine. At least the new Honda chief executive had plenty of time to get to know his drivers.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/gallery/2015/6/22/1434991349575/rosberg-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nico Rosberg, right, gets past his Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton in Sunday's grand prix at Spielberg.

Robson, 21, was just glad to be back on the court after such a long time away.</p> \n<p>Wozniacki said that her friend will need to be patient. “I think it will be tough for sure,” the world No5 said. “It’s never easy when you come back from an injury. She’s been out for a year and a half. She’s a good player and she has the technique. She still has many years to play.</p> \n<p>“It’s going to be tough but I definitely think we will see her back because, if you work hard and have the will and she’s been there before, I don’t see a reason why she shouldn’t be back. I just think it’s not going to be overnight. I think it’s going to take time.</p> \n<p>“I think she knows exactly what she’s doing. She has a good team around her. I can say one thing but she knows exactly what she needs to do. Obviously I think she needs to know it’s going to take time. But again I think that we are going to see her back.”</p> \n<p>Wozniacki hit with Robson last week and reported that her mood is positive. “She’s definitely in good spirits,” the Dane said. “I think when you’re away for a long time you get the hunger and you realise this is what you want to do.

It’s pretty hard to accept. But it’s done. The umpire’s finger is up. I have to look at where I go next. But I am frustrated. The portrayal of me as a coach in the media is just wrong. If people said, ‘I don’t rate you as a coach,’ then fine. But when it’s not what you are, it’s really frustrating.”</p> \n<p>Moores, who did use the word ‘data’ in a interview given to Sky television after that loss to Bangladesh in Adelaide in response to a technical question, insists his England regime had in fact dispensed with a statistical approach to the game and was encouraging his players to think on their feet.</p> \n<p>“We moved away from stats and data. Coaching doesn’t work like that at all. You watch a lot to say a little,” he said. “I’ve been in the game for 33 years and I’ve coached for 17. I know the game. And what I’ve learned is, my job is to simplify the game for players and free them up to go and play.”</p> \n<p>Moores refused to criticise the nature of his sacking by the England and Wales Cricket Board that saw the news break on the websites of three national newspapers, including the Guardian, during the one-day international against Ireland in Malahide at the start of last month – before he had been told himself.</p> \n<p>“I’ve been offered book deals, but it’s not who I am. And if I did one, I would want it to be things I’ve learned and stories to help people get the best out of themselves and others,” he said. “I have to be true to what I am. There’s not a lot of mileage in negativity, you know.</p> \n<p>Asked if he would consider working for the ECB again, he replied: “A role at [the National Academy in] Loughborough would be exciting. I love coaching and that would be working with the best players and coaches. Yes, it appeals.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1435011677222/Peter-Moores-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Peter Moores, pictured after England's shock World Cup defeat to Bangladesh, says his reputation for placing too much emphasis on statistics is unfair.

However, they opted to keep faith with their homegrown top six for the visit of Nottinghamshire.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/northamptonshire-kent-county-championship-match-report\">Northamptonshire restore feelgood factor as Olly Stone rolls over Kent</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So while Maxwell, who featured in the previous two Championship matches, was dispatched to the south coast for some recuperation after a non-stop start to 2015, Finch took his place in the Second XI Championship against Worcestershire. He started but will not finish the contest at Barnt Green. Having mistimed a pull on 19 off Chris Russell, the 28-year-old retired hurt, spent the afternoon having his ribs scanned and X-rayed in a Redditch hospital and returned to Leeds in early evening prior to receiving the results.</p> \n<p>With only 41 runs in three NatWest T20 Blast innings since recovering from the hamstring tear he incurred at the Indian Premier League on 14 April, Finch had been asked by Yorkshire to rediscover some red-ball form before next week’s top-of-the-table clash with the 2013 champions Durham, when Adam Lyth and Gary Ballance will be absent due to the pre-Ashes training camp in Spain. Their plans to slip him into the top order for that contest are now in jeopardy.</p> \n<p>One man who will return to the scene of his weekend heroics is Jonny Bairstow. England’s most contemporary match-winner is scheduled to join this contest on the third morning too, having been nominated before the toss to replace Andrew Hodd behind the stumps.</p> \n<p>It could be well advanced by that point. Nottinghamshire’s first innings dribbled into Tuesday by virtue only of rain and bad light wiping out half the opening day’s 96-over allocation. How they could do with the Sheffield-born teenager Luke Wood reproducing some of the rambunctious strokeplay that yielded a recent hundred against Sussex. Wood and Stuart Broad, making a first Championship appearance in 12 months, counter-punched on a gloomy evening punctuated by multiple stoppages but were separated when a snorter from Tim Bresnan took Broad’s edge and was pouched comfortably at third slip by Jack Leaning.</p> \n<p>Had Leaning held on to a difficult chance in the same position when Broad had a single to his name, off the metronomic Steven Patterson, Nottinghamshire would have been deeper in the mire.</p> \n<p>It was certainly a good toss for Andrew Gale to win. Yorkshire’s policy has been to leave more grass on their pitches in Leeds this summer and the greater bounce and carry certainly suits their disciplined pace attack. So, too, did the overhead conditions that prevailed here.</p> \n<p>Patterson, whose devotion to dots drives batsmen dotty, made the initial breakthrough after 55 minutes of Nottinghamshire resistance when the shoulder of Brendan Taylor’s bat looped the ball to first slip. Michael Lumb and James Taylor followed to make it three wickets in 22 deliveries, and Ryan Sidebottom celebrated his return from a two-month absence to a calf injury by ending Steven Mullaney’s vigil on his return from the Football Stand End.</p> \n<p>Any thoughts of a post-lunch fightback were deconstructed by two full Jack Brooks deliveries accounting for Samit Patel and Will Gidman, and Sidebottom striking at the start of a spell for a second time when extra bounce accounted for Riki Wessels.</p> \n<p>“There was a bit of help from the pitch and the overhead conditions but you’ve still got to put it in the right place,” was the assessment of Yorkshire’s director of cricket, Martyn Moxon.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1435007466967/Will-Gidman-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Will Gidman made just four runs before succumbing lbw ti Jack Brooks at Headingley.

Their bowling looks pedestrian but they are supremely drilled and seldom allow batsmen to leave the ball, harrying them into action. Here their busy, bustling batting was of the same spirit.</p> \n<p>After light rain caused a late start and the loss of 16 overs Joe Leach docked Middlesex’s tail efficiently and Moeen Ali and Tom Fell scored fine half-centuries to leave them only 114 behind.</p> \n<p>Leach, one of an unglamorous, often ungainly but always efficient seam trio, alongside Charlie Morris and Jack Shantry, had James Harris plumb in front with a ball that stayed low, then Toby Roland-Jones caught at slip next ball.</p> \n<p>With the bulging cordon baying, Tim Murtagh knocked the hat-trick ball into the covers for a single. But Ollie Rayner was on his way in Leach’s next over, unimpressed to be dismissed leg-before.</p> \n<p>Middlesex’s 309 looked good after five for two or 102 for five but not so considering the sixth wicket was worth 170. It is a show of Worcestershire’s bowling strength that they took all three bowling points for the 35th time in 36 matches.</p> \n<p>The bowling coach, Matt Mason, who treats each element of his varied seam attack – the regimented Morris, the scuttling Leach and the downright awkward Shantry – utterly as individuals, deserves a huge amount of credit. Mason preaches probing with attacking maidens and not settling for bowling dry on a fifth-stump line.</p> \n<p>To date, it has been Worcestershire’s batting that has betrayed them. Yet three partnerships – none vast, but each greater than the last – prevented another collapse. After Richard Oliver fell lbw in Harris’s first over, Daryl Mitchell – who scored three from his first 49 balls – and Ali were watchful. When Mitchell was caught at second slip, Moeen and Fell upped the pace, while the latter will look to build on his stand of 83 with Alex Gidman, with the new ball nine overs away. Fell was cautious early before unfurling some handsome drives and pulls and astutely taking advantage of the absence of a third man.</p> \n<p>These are curious times for Moeen. One of England’s finest limited-overs players, he was an onlooker in this month’s wondrous one-day international series, banished to the shires in search of spin.</p> \n<p>On Sunday he had cut a confused figure in the field, afforded only 12 overs as those seamers did the job again. On Monday he produced some strokes of aching elegance, such as the drive down the ground off Rayner, or the one uppishly through cover off James Franklin. Yet a lapse in concentration saw him give it away, leaden-footedly slapping Franklin to mid-off. Never mind, with the pitch expected to take turn and Shantry’s footmarks to aim at, the more important matter of soul-soothing wickets could yet be there for the taking.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1435008056231/Worcestershire-v-Warwicks-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Worcestershire's Moeen Ali scored 54 before a lapse of concentration saw him caught at mid-off from James Franklin's bowling.

Nothing came to her easily, it was rarely a beautiful fight and, when a match point came and went, a tentative backhand dribbling into the net, it seemed briefly that victory might slip from her grasp. It was that kind of lurching contest: bitty, unpredictable, disconcertingly ramshackle.</p> \n<p>Moments later, however, Watson was beaming after one last forehand return from Varvara Lepchenko sailed wide to seal a 7-6, 6-2 win for the British No1 in the first round of the Aegon International at Eastbourne. Watson did not care how she won, even if the contest did not end with a flourish, and her reward is a daunting challenge against Elina Svitolina, the world No17, on Tuesday.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/petra-kvitova-illness-eastbourne-wimbledon\">Petra Kvitova pulls out of Eastbourne because of illness</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After crashing out in the first round of the Aegon Classic in Birmingham, Watson cherished her first triumph on the grass this summer. She needed it badly, to prove both to herself and the critics that she can compete at Wimbledon. When she lost to the unheralded qualifier Aleksandra Krunic last week, she had to dismiss fears that an injury to her right elbow would threaten her participation in SW19 next week. Her elbow was heavily strapped and the problem had forced her to miss the Aegon Open in Nottingham two weeks ago.</p> \n<p>Her elbow was free of strapping against Lepchenko and the world No38 beaten in straight sets was a notable scalp for Watson. “The elbow is fine,” she said. “I served a lot better here than I did in Birmingham, I thought. I had a lot more pace on the ball and I was absolutely fine throughout the match.”</p> \n<p>It should do wonders for Watson’s confidence. Lepchenko, born in Uzbekistan but a naturalised American citizen, was a tricky opponent, even though the match failed to capture the imagination. Watson and Lepchenko shared eight breaks of serve in a tense first set, both of them skittish on serve in blustery conditions.</p> \n<p>Watson has areas in which she can improve. She was too tentative at times, unwilling to come to the net, too trusting in her defensive abilities, and she was unhappy with how many errors she made, yet she was impressive when she shook off her inhibitions and began to dictate the rallies. The first set went to a tie-break and Watson swept into a commanding 4-0 lead, only to lose the next five points. Yet she refused to wilt, earning a set point with a stunning backhand winner and Lepchenko succumbed.</p> \n<p>The second set was more of a stroll and when Lepchenko double-faulted to hand Watson a 3-2 lead, she crumbled. Watson broke again for 5-2 and she kept any lingering nerves at bay thanks to some solid serving in the final game. After an hour and 40 minutes of scratchy tennis, victory was hers.</p> \n<p>Although the majority of Monday’s schedule was washed away by a downpour that lasted until mid-afternoon, there was drama early in the day when the defending Wimbledon champion, Petra Kvitova, pulled out of her second-round match because of illness.</p> \n<p>Kvitova, the world No2 and top seed here, is confident that she will recover in time to defend her title. “I started to feel not well when I came here,” she said. “Maybe from the plane, I’m not really sure. I did not feel my best and two days ago I really feel a sore throat. It’s not really much better.</p> \n<p>“I don’t need antibiotics so that’s a good sign. I just need to be in the bed and drink lots of hot tea and I’m just lying and resting. I’m going to stay here and then move slowly to London.”</p> \n<p>Kvitova said that the problem is not linked to her recent six-week lay-off because of fatigue. “It’s something different,” she said. “During that time it was just exhaustion but now it’s more illness.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1435002098581/Aegon-International---Day-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"British No1, Heather Watson, gained a morale-boosting victory over Varvara Lepchenko in Eastbourne.

He also played down his role in Spieth’s triumph. “I told Jordan all week that I have nothing but great vibes here, starting with my marriage two years ago up there on the top of the hill. The best day of my life,” explained the caddie.</p> \n<p>“Ultimately as far as my local knowledge, it really wasn’t worth anything, I didn’t think, because Jordan’s Jordan. He’s one of the best players in the world and I was just trying to stay out of his way. I’ve worked hard the last couple of weeks but I haven’t been out here in five years. The course has changed. The guys that I’ve caddied for usually couldn’t break 90, or it’s myself playing and I can’t break 80.</p> \n<p>“I’m sure he’s being nice, but it comes down to Jordan just being one of the best players in the world.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/22/1434962369979/Jordan-Spieth-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jordan Spieth high fives fans after winning the 115th US Open Championship.
