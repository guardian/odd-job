Taylor’s dismissal led to a petition from users demanding Pao’s removal that attracted more than 210,000 signatures. It also led to Pao reportedly receiving death threats from users angry at her handling of the situation.<br /></p> \n<p>Reddit made the announcement in a statement on Friday afternoon saying it was by “mutual agreement”, even as Pao signalled “a different view” from the board.</p> \n<p>But, in a bid to take the sting out of any acrimony, both Reddit’s board member Sam Altman and Pao wrote pleas for compassion after the harassment.</p> \n<p>Pao urged those users who attacked her to remember that she was “just another human; I have a family, and I have feelings”. In a resignation statement, she wrote that she has seen “the good, the bad and the ugly on Reddit. The good has been off-the-wall inspiring, and the ugly made me doubt humanity”.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/3cudi0/resignation_thank_you/\">She wrote</a>: “Everyone attacked on Reddit is just another person like you and me. When people make something up to attack me or someone else, it spreads, and we eventually will see it. And we will feel bad, not just about what was said.”</p> \n<p>Altman said that it was “<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3cucye/an_old_team_at_reddit/\">sickening to see some of the things</a>” that the site’s users had written about Pao.</p> \n<p>He wrote: “The reduction in compassion that happens when we’re all behind computer screens is not good for the world. People are still people even if there is internet between you.”</p> \n<p>“If the Reddit community cannot learn to balance authenticity and compassion, it may be a great website but it will never be a truly great community.”</p> \n<p>Disagreements, he said, were not a problem. But, in an apparent reference to messages sent to Pao, he wrote that death threats would not be tolerated and that users who sent them would be banned.<br /></p> \n<p>Pao’s relationship with Reddit’s users deteriorated when the site, which was known for its “anything goes” atmosphere, began an anti-harassment drive in May this year.</p> \n<p>It caused further anger when that led to the shutting down of a handful of sections that “allow their communities to use [them] as a platform to harass individuals when moderators don’t take action”.</p> \n<p>Reddit’s management was accused by some of seeking to limit free speech, although the site’s bosses insisted they were “banning behaviour, not ideas”.</p> \n<p>Relations soured further with the dismissal of Taylor. Many of the unpaid moderators who keep Reddit’s subbranches – or subreddits – running, shut down their sections in protest. </p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Pao wrote that she was leaving Reddit, which attracted more than 163 million visitors last month, because the “board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining Reddit’s core principles”.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Altman’s statement said: “We are thankful for Ellen’s many contributions to Reddit and the technology industry generally. She brought focus to chaos, recruited a world-class team of executives, and drove growth.</p> \n<p>“She brought a face to Reddit that changed perceptions, and is a pioneer for women in the tech industry. She will remain as an advisor to the board through the end of 2015. I look forward to seeing the great things she does beyond that.”</p> \n<p>Regarding Huffman, the statement said: “We’re very happy to have [him] back. Product and community are the two legs of Reddit, and the board was very focused on finding a candidate who excels at both (truthfully, community is harder), which Steve does.</p> \n<p>“He has the added bonus of being a founder with ten years of Reddit history in his head. Steve is rejoining Alexis, who will work alongside Steve with the new title of ‘cofounder’.”<br /></p> \n<p>Pao was hired by Reddit in April 2013. In November 2014 she was <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/11/14/ellen_pao_appointed_interim_ceo_of_reddit_will_she_be_able_to_fix_the_site.html\">appointed interim chief executive</a> after the resignation of Yishan Wong, who left after an argument with the board over the running of the company. </p> \n<p>Pao made international headlines earlier this year when she <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/27/ellen-pao-loses-landmark-sexual-discrimination-lawsuit\">lost a landmark sex discrimination lawsuit</a> against a former employer, the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers.</p> \n<p>She was told to pay legal costs of nearly $1m (&pound;644,000), which her former employer indicated it would waive if she agreed not to appeal the court’s decision. However, it emerged last month that she had decided to go ahead with a legal challenge.</p> \n<p>Pao’s case raised issues surrounding gender inequality at elite Silicon Valley technology and venture capital firms. Pao’s lawyers argued she was an accomplished junior partner passed over for promotion because the firm she worked for, Kleiner Perkins, used different standards to judge men and women. Pao claimed she was fired when she complained about discrimination.<br /></p> \n<p>During the case lawyers said Pao was subjected to demeaning treatment including being cut out of emails and meetings by a male colleague with whom she broke off an affair and being given a book of erotic poetry by a partner at the company.</p> \n<p>Kleiner Perkins’ attorney Lynne Hermle countered during the trial that Pao failed as an investor at the company and sued to get a big payout as she was being shown the door. <br /></p> \n<p>Pao lost the case, but it was seen as a watershed moment, as former employees at Twitter and Facebook launched discrimination cases in its wake.<br /></p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/949806fceba424908586ac10852740c81cd98356/0_0_3000_1801/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1801,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Robert Galbraith/REUTERS","altText":"Ellen Pao","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Robert Galbraith/REUTERS"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-11T00:46:48Z","lastModified":"2015-07-11T05:12:14Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":579,"contributors":[{"name":"Martin Pengelly","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/24/1411572188018/Martin-Pengelly-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/martin-pengelly"},{"name":"Kevin Rawlinson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/kevin-rawlinson"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Reddit","US news","Technology"],"tags":[{"id":"technology/reddit","webTitle":"Reddit"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"}],"section":{"id":"technology"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"technology"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jul/10/ellen-pao-reddit-interim-ceo-resigns","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ahnq","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/technology/2015/jul/10/ellen-pao-reddit-interim-ceo-resigns","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/10/ellen-pao-reddit-interim-ceo-resigns"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/949806fceba424908586ac10852740c81cd98356/0_0_3000_1801/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1801,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The revolt against Pao began after the company’s director of talent was let go.

He broke off negotiations a fortnight ago and announced a snap referendum on the austerity terms demanded in return for extending the second bailout which expired on June 30.</p> \n<p>He campaigned for a no vote and won handsomely, backed by more than 61%, before performing a striking U-turn on Thursday night, re-tabling the same austerity terms he had campaigned to defeat and which the voters rejected. The terms included VAT and pension reforms Tsipras had previously insisted were red lines which would never be crossed.</p> \n<p>“On Sunday, the Greek people voted against these measures,” said Michael Fuchs, the deputy floor-leader in Berlin Merkel’s governing Christian Democrats. “I have a little bit of a problem trusting it because what is the difference between Sunday and today?”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3835de462cc1bafd71ee70ffe4b0f6364830feeb\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3835de462cc1bafd71ee70ffe4b0f6364830feeb/0_56_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexis Tsipras\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis Tsipras is applauded in the Greek parliament in Athens.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louisa Gouliamaki/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Deciding against a third bailout would leave Greece facing an unprecedented economic crisis. With its banks closed and capital controls in place, the financial institutions are rapidly running out of money. Without a bailout programme, the European Central Bank could cut off the only lifeline keeping Greece afloat: its emergency liquidity assistance to Greek banks. </p> \n<p>Grexit summits on Sunday would then focus on helping Greek operations to establish a secondary parallel currency, the half-way step to a return to the drachma.</p> \n<p>Despite Tsipras’s claims of a strong mandate for this weekend’s talks, his acceptance of the austerity measures demanded by the creditors will not be enough to secure a deal because the goalposts have moved in the two weeks since he rejected many of the same terms.</p> \n<p>The negotiation has changed. What was being negotiated last month was prolonging an existing bailout arrangement by several months. Merkel has made plain that Greece needs to table much more ambitious and draconian measures to qualify for a new two- to three-year bailout worth a lot more money.</p> \n<p>A German finance ministry spokesman said it was too late to “repackage” last month’s proposals and called on Tsipras to demonstrate greater commitment to an agreement by pushing reformist legislation through the Greek parliament immediately.</p> \n<p>This issue will figure strongly in Saturday’s negotiations, officials and diplomats said, pointing particularly to the resistance to a new deal from the newer and smaller members of the euro in eastern Europe who, in recent months, have come out of the closet as fiscal hawks and the loudest critics of Tsipras.</p> \n<p>The Slovak finance minister, Peter Kazimir, a leading hardliner, voiced his scepticism of Athens’ promises. “How quickly can a caterpillar turn into a butterfly?” he tweeted.</p> \n<p>Dalia Grybauskaite, the president of Lithuania, said: “It seems those proposals will really not be enough.”</p> \n<p>Her Latvian counterpart, Laimdota Straujuma, said: “It will be very hard for me to persuade the parliament. If you were to ask Latvians today whether they are willing to lend money to Greece, you can probably guess what their answer would be … At the moment, I see no reason for Latvia to give money to Greece.”</p> \n<p>Estonia, Latvia, Slovakia and Slovenia take a similar view.</p> \n<p>The head of sovereigns at Fitch’s ratings agency, James McCormack, predicted the talks would fail and there would be “an eventual exit from the eurozone” for Greece.</p> \n<p>Any agreement that might be struck would need to be put through the Bundestag early next week, but Greece fatigue is reaching critical mass in Berlin.</p> \n<p>There was some optimism. Some bookmakersclosed their books for bets on whether Greece would survive in the euro after an avalanche of betting on Greece remaining in the currency following the unveiling of Athens’ plan. The financial markets responded favourably to the talk of a weekend agreement, strengthening the euro against the dollar.</p> \n<p>And Paris, in a rare challenge to Merkel in five years of currency travails, has staked its all on keeping Greece in the euro, dispatching experts to help Athens to write its reform manifesto and loudly campaigning for an agreement to rescue Greece.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/10/divisions-in-merkels-coalition-over-proposals-for-greek-economic-reform\">Divisions in Merkel's coalition over proposals for Greek economic reform</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/92fad5e9af71624d2d40c7cd4f4f7911b7e7174e/100_85_4232_2539/4232.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2539,"width":4232,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jean-Paul Pelissier/Reuters","altText":"Anti-Euro protesters attend an anti-austerity rally in central Athens, Greece, July 10, 2015.

bestselling bullet-stopper novels on which their scripts are based.

The conception of Brienne, who moves from being held in contempt to grudging respect from her peers, is a progressive one, she said. “It doesn’t have its roots in sexuality and I thought it was a very powerful, modern representation,” she said, forcefully enough to elicit applause and cheers from the audience. </p> \n<p>The show’s behind-the-camera talent, producer Carolyn Strauss and director David Nutter, fielded questions about <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/08/game-of-thrones-recap-season-five-episode-nine-the-dance-of-dragons\">the brutal death this season of Shireen Baratheon</a>, one of the younger characters on the show. “It was an amazingly powerful moment that I think turned out just right,” Nutter said flatly.</p> \n<p>“It hurts more the more you know the characters, but just because it’s painful doesn’t mean it’s not a good point in the story,” Strauss said. “It wasn’t done because of the pain, but in spite of it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53d09d6f46f224e9f41d1ab3dca3e93dec3a2445\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/53d09d6f46f224e9f41d1ab3dca3e93dec3a2445/255_320_4533_2721/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alfie Allen, Sophie Turner, Natalie Dormer, Carice van Houten, Liam Cunningham, Gwendoline Christie&lt;br&gt;on the panel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alfie Allen, Sophie Turner, Natalie Dormer, Carice van Houten, Liam Cunningham, Gwendoline Christie on the panel.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The cast had had plenty of interesting interactions with their viewers, notably Nutter’s encounter with regular viewer Barack Obama. “He shook my hand, and he put his other hand on my shoulder and he said, ‘You didn’t <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/15/game-of-thrones-season-five-finale-episode-10-recap-mothers-mercy\">kill Jon Snow</a> did you?’ and I said, ‘Mr President, Jon Snow is deader than dead.’” </p> \n<p>Much of what the audience wanted to know, of course, wasn’t on offer.

He’d said he wanted to be friends. He didn’t, though.</p> \n<p>Back came the reply: “I’m sorry again that I disappeared on you. I felt overwhelmed. To be honest, all that stuff about wanting to be stitched into someone else’s life was kind of claustrophobic.”</p> \n<p>It wasn’t that, Miles. It was my body – tell the truth, I said aloud to the screen, but didn’t write. So it wasn’t really my not conforming to his type. It was my neediness that damned me.</p> \n<p>I asked what was wrong with wanting to be stitched into someone else’s life, if the stitching was mutual and contented. He said that living alone had taught him that he needs to be fundamentally independent. Shared meals, evenings, nights, should be a matter of choice: surely that was a truly liberated way of life? When I argued with this, he interpreted my scepticism as a proposition.</p> \n<p>“I can’t offer what you want,” he wrote. “And nice though it is to hear from you, I can’t offer you a date either.”</p> \n<p>I wasn’t looking for a date. “I’m not looking for a date, but thanks. Just saw your face pop up here and thought I’d say hello. All the best. Good luck.”</p> \n<p>When I logged into another website that I’m registered on, there was a message from him. He’d joined the day before, found me and written to say he thought we should have that lunch at his house and see what happens. But that was before we’d had the conversation we’d just had. “I don’t imagine this invitation still stands,” I replied. He did not answer.</p> \n<p>Then, there was an email from Lee, the Austrian, saying that he regretted we hadn’t met, in the end, and that we should have had the conversation about femininity face to face as it might have turned out differently. We would have smiled while we argued. We would have enjoyed the debate. Good relationships need friction, after all, he said. How about a drink? OK, I said. A drink. Why not. When, where? He didn’t reply. I wrote again. “Just name the day. Name the date.” Then I laughed a lot at my own joke.</p> \n<p>The culmination of this series of blasts from the past was a dating site message from Peter. It was as if I’d conjured him up by thinking about him, my long-distance disappointment of February. Peter has my email address and mobile number, but opted for the formality of the site email system.</p> \n<p>“Hello again. How’s it going for you?” he asked blandly. I told him it was going fine. He launched in to an account of his life since he’d kissed my head and got on a train and dumped me. He’d had a few short-term&nbsp;relationships. He’d thought he’d found “the one”, and then it turned out she wasn’t. They’d got on each other’s nerves. He’d realised that he needed to stop chasing the pretty girls and think about the intellectual fit. “And so – why are you contacting me again, Peter?” I asked him. “Have I been held in reserve until the wind changed?” There was no answer to&nbsp;that.</p> \n<p>I put on some lipstick and a red frock and went to the pub to meet Lance. Lance is short and plain and bald; he’d written a funny message admitting to these failings and listing his good points. (One was that he couldn’t make up his mind about Marmite, and thus was an original thinker, which made me smile.)</p> \n<p>At the pub, Lance was already ensconced in a corner and had bought a bottle of wine. We drank it. He was dressed as if he was about to go down into a ravine with Bear Grylls. We didn’t have much to talk about. Eventually he looked at his watch for the fourth time and said he had an early start, and should go home.</p> \n<p>Outside, he kissed me on the cheek, and said, “Look, I’m not sure, I have to be honest.”</p> \n<p>I said that was fine, and off we went in our different directions. That’s what most internet dates are like. That’s what most of mine are like. They are just not very interesting to read about.</p> \n<p><em>Stella Grey is a pseudonym</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/greystellagrey\" title=\"\">@GreyStellaGrey</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436180452360/Jar-of-marmite-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lance argued that as he couldn't make up his mind about Marmite, he was an original thinker.

The revelation, puncturing years of denials, has already led to at least one leadership firing and creates the potential for loss of licenses and even prosecutions.</p> \n<p>For more than a decade, the American Psychological Association (APA) has maintained that a strict code of ethics prohibits its more than 130,000 members to aid in the torture of detainees while simultaneously permitting involvement in military and intelligence interrogations. The group has rejected media reporting on psychologists’ complicity in torture; suppressed internal dissent from anti-torture doctors; cleared members of wrongdoing; and portrayed itself as a consistent ally against abuse.<br /></p> \n<p>Now, a voluminous independent review conducted by a former assistant US attorney, David Hoffman, undermines the APA’s denials in full – and vindicates the dissenters.</p> \n<p>Sources with knowledge of the report and its consequences, who requested anonymity to discuss the findings before public release, expected a wave of firings and resignations across the leadership of an organization that Hoffman finds used its extensive institutional links to the CIA and US military to facilitate abusive interrogations.</p> \n<p>Several officials are likely to be sacked. Already out, a past APA president confirmed to the Guardian, is <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/ethics/behnke.aspx\">Stephen Behnke</a>, the APA’s ethics chief and a leading figure in recasting its ethics guidelines in a manner conducive to interrogations that, from the start, relied heavily on psychologists to design and implement techniques like waterboarding.</p> \n<p>But the reckoning with psychologists’ institutional complicity in torture may not stop there.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/dec/16/us-paid-torture-doctors-punishing-psychologists\">The US paid torture doctors millions. Why is it last in the world in punishing them? | Dr Steven Miles</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Evidence in the Hoffman report, sources believe, may merit referral to the FBI over potential criminal wrongdoing by the APA involvement in torture. The findings could reopen something human rights groups have urged for years: the potential for prosecutions of people involved in torture. The definition of “collusion” adopted by Hoffman is said to be similar to language used in the federal racketeering statute known as Rico.</p> \n<p>If so, however, it would not be American military or intelligence interrogators themselves under investigation, nor the senior officials who devised torture policy in the Bush administration, but the psychologists who enabled them.</p> \n<p>Additionally, sources believe there will be grounds to initiate ethics charges against responsible individuals both within the APA and in the states in which they operate, which would be the first step toward the loss of a professional license.</p> \n<p>Sources familiar with Hoffman’s report said the APA, knowing that the findings will undermine years of its public positions, is negotiating with its dissenters and critics to deliver a public apology. Recommendations for structural reform are said to be likely ahead of the organization’s 123rd annual convention, scheduled to begin on 6 August in Toronto.<br /></p> \n<h2><strong>Manipulating the opposition: three doctors and torture tactics</strong></h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/15/cia-torture-human-experimentation-doctors\">CIA torture appears to have broken spy agency rule on human experimentation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Substantial sections of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/09/us/document-report.html\">report</a> focus on the APA ethics chief and describes Behnke’s “behind-the-scenes attempts to manipulate Council of Representatives actions in collusion with, and to remain aligned with DoD” – a reference to the Department of Defense.</p> \n<p>A University of Michigan-pedigreed psychologist, Behnke has held his position within the APA since 2000, and, according to sources, used it to stifle dissent. Hoffman’s report found Behnke ghostwrote statements opposing member motions to rebuke torture; was involved in voter irregularity on motion passings; spiked ethics complaints; and took other actions to suppress complaints.</p> \n<p>Nadine Kaslow, a former APA president, told the Guardian that Behnke’s last day at the APA was 8 July, after the APA received Hoffman’s report. She would not say if Behnke resigned or was fired. She indicated that further firings and resignations are likely in the coming weeks.</p> \n<p>For now, the APA is grappling with a number of institutional changes to salvage its credibility.</p> \n<p>“I am certainly apologizing on behalf of APA for what occurred – in terms of the fact that there was any collusion that occurred, and the fact that this may have paved the way for abusive interrogation,” Kaslow said on Friday.</p> \n<p>Behnke was hardly the only psychologist involved in the establishment and application of torture.</p> \n<p>According to two landmark Senate reports, one from the armed services committee in 2009 and the other from the intelligence committee in 2014, psychologists James Mitchell and Bruce Jessen were instrumental in persuading the CIA to adopt stress positions, temperature and dietary manipulation, sleep deprivation and waterboarding in interrogations. (Neither man is an APA member.)</p> \n<p>Psychologists assigned to the CIA’s office of medical services assisted abusive interrogations, which the Guardian revealed in June <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/15/cia-torture-human-experimentation-doctors\">appear to violate longstanding CIA rules</a> against human experimentation.</p> \n<p>Those tactics, save waterboarding, spread from the CIA to the military. Psychologists joined “behavioral science consultation teams” that advised interrogations at Guant&aacute;namo Bay. </p> \n<p>“For the APA officials who played the lead role in these actions, their principal motive was to curry favor with the Defense Department for two main reasons: because of the very substantial benefits that DoD had conferred and continued to confer on psychology as a profession, and because APA wanted a favorable result from the critical policy DoD was in the midst of developing that would determine whether and how deeply psychologists could remain involved in intelligence activities,” Hoffman found.</p> \n<p>Human rights-minded psychologists railed for years that the APA had created an environment that was conducive to medical professionals effectively participating in torture. Critically, in 2005, a prominent and highly controversial APA taskforce ruled that members could perform “consultative roles to interrogation- or information-gathering processes for national security-related purposes”.</p> \n<p>Yet the organization withstood all public criticism, until New York Times reporter James Risen revealed, based in part on a hoard of emails from a deceased behavioral-science researcher named Scott Gerwehr, the behind-the-scenes ties between psychologists from the APA and their influential counterparts within the CIA and the Pentagon.</p> \n<p>In 2002 – the critical year for the Bush administration’s embrace of torture – the APA amended its longstanding ethics rules to permit psychologists to follow a “governing legal authority” in the event of a conflict between an order and the APA ethics code.</p> \n<p>Without the change, Risen wrote in his 2014 book Pay Any Price, it was likely that psychologists would have “taken the view that they were prevented by their own professional standards from involvement” in interrogations, making it “far more difficult for the Justice Department to craft opinions that provided the legal approvals needed for the CIA to go ahead with the interrogation tactics”.</p> \n<p>In 2004, after the Abu Ghraib torture scandal burst into public view, the emails detailed a private meeting of APA officials with CIA and military psychologists to “provide input on how the APA should deal with the growing furor”, Risen wrote.</p> \n<p>Ethics chief Behnke emailed: “I would like to emphasize that we will not advertise the meeting other than this letter to the individual invitees, that we will not publish or otherwise make public the names of attendees or the substance of our discussions, and that in the meeting we will neither assess nor investigate the behavior of any specific individual or group.”</p> \n<p>Risen went on to report that six of the 10 psychologists on the seminal 2005 APA taskforce “had connections with the defense or intelligence communities; one member was the chief psychologist for US Special Forces”. The subject of tremendous internal controversy, the APA ultimately rescinded the taskforce report in 2013.</p> \n<h2>Collusion to promote torture: a reckoning finally arrives</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/apr/30/psychologists-bush-officials-torture-program\">Psychologists met in secret with Bush officials to help justify torture – report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In October, the APA called Risen’s account “<a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/response/risen-book.aspx\">largely based on innuendo and one-sided reporting</a>”. Yet the next month the association <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2014/11/risen-allegations.aspx\">announced</a> it had asked Hoffman to investigate potential “collusion with the Bush administration to promote, support or facilitate the use of ‘enhanced’ interrogation techniques by the United States in the war on terror”.</p> \n<p>Throughout the controversy, the APA has preferred to treat criticism of its involvement in torture, either from journalists or from human rights-minded psychologists, with dismissal. Its internal investigations of the criticisms have typically ended up exonerating its members.</p> \n<p>“A thorough review of these public materials and our standing policies will clearly demonstrate that APA will not tolerate psychologist participation in torture,” the APA communications chief, Rhea Farberman, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jan/22/guantanamo-torture-mohammed-al-qahtani-suspected-9-11-hijacker\">told the Guardian in January 2014</a>, after the Guardian revealed that an APA inquiry declined to pursue charges against a psychologist involved in the Guant&aacute;namo Bay torture of Mohammed al-Qahtani.</p> \n<p>The psychologist, former US army reserve major John Leso, took part in a brutal interrogation of Qahtani, the suspected intended 20th 9/11 hijacker, according to a leaked interrogation log and investigation by the Senate armed services committee.</p> \n<p>Interrogators extensively deprived Qahtani of sleep, forced him to perform what the log called “dog tricks”, inundated him with loud music for extended periods, and forcibly hydrated him intravenously until he urinated on himself.</p> \n<p>“The concern that APA’s decision to close the matter against Dr John Leso will set a precedent against disciplining members who participate in abusive interrogations is utterly unfounded,” the APA’s Farberman told the Guardian in January 2014.</p>","section":"Law","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/8bc332d705d301786a64df93df5320877248363e/0_0_2560_1536/2560.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1536,"width":2560,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"The Guardian","altText":"Collage to accompany story on CIA/torture","cleanCredit":"Photograph: The Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-10T19:48:08Z","lastModified":"2015-07-10T22:08:27Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":769,"contributors":[{"name":"Spencer Ackerman","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/4/1409842529387/Spencer-Ackerman-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/spencerackerman"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Torture","September 11 2001","Guantánamo Bay","US news","Doctors","Psychology","CIA","CIA torture report"],"tags":[{"id":"law/torture","webTitle":"Torture"},{"id":"us-news/september11","webTitle":"September 11 2001"},{"id":"us-news/guantanamo-bay","webTitle":"Guantánamo Bay"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"society/doctors","webTitle":"Doctors"},{"id":"science/psychology","webTitle":"Psychology"},{"id":"us-news/cia","webTitle":"CIA"},{"id":"us-news/cia-torture-report","webTitle":"CIA torture report"}],"section":{"id":"law"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Spencer Ackerman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/spencerackerman"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"law"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/law/2015/jul/10/us-torture-doctors-psychologists-apa-prosecution","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agv5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/law/2015/jul/10/us-torture-doctors-psychologists-apa-prosecution","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/jul/10/us-torture-doctors-psychologists-apa-prosecution"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/8bc332d705d301786a64df93df5320877248363e/0_0_2560_1536/2560.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1536,"width":2560,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The American Psychological Association asked a former US attorney to investigate ‘collusion with the Bush administration to promote, support or facilitate’ torture.
