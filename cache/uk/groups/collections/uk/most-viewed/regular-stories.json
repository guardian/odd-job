Charles died at home in Fort William yesterday. He was 55. We are obviously devastated at the loss.</p> \n<p>“Charles was a fine man, a talented politician and a loving father to his young son. We ask therefore that the privacy of his family is respected in the coming days. There will be a postmortem and we will issue a further statement when funeral arrangements are made.”</p> \n<p>A spokesman for Police Scotland said: “Police officers attended an address at Fort William on Monday 1 June to reports of the sudden death of a 55-year-old man. Police were notified by ambulance service personnel. There are no suspicious circumstances and our report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.”</p> \n<p>Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister, led the tributes. “Charles’s untimely death robs Britain of one of the most gifted politicians of his generation,” Clegg said as politicians across Britain praised Kennedy. “He was one of the most gentle and unflappable politicians I have ever known, yet he was immensely courageous too, not least when he spoke for the country against the invasion of Iraq.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37fae6d009f076111935b4623eab445df062cfa2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433223201680/514a880e-d258-4f4a-bdcb-339299b3df43-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nick Clegg and Charles Kennedy on the Andrew Marr show in September 2010.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Clegg and Charles Kennedy on the Andrew Marr show in September 2010.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lord Ashdown, Kennedy’s predecessor as Lib Dem leader, tweeted: “Charles Kennedy. In a political age not overburdened with gaiety and good sense, he brought us wit, charm, judgment, principle and decency.”</p> \n<p>Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and SNP leader, said: “Sad beyond words to hear the news about Charlie Kennedy. A lovely man and one of the most talented politicians of his time. Gone too soon.”</p> \n<p>Kennedy, who first entered parliament as MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye in 1983 for the SDP/Liberal Democrat Alliance at 23, was nicknamed “Chat Show Charlie” in light of his easy manner on television that once saw him chair an edition of Have I Got News for You. But Kennedy, who won the Observer Mace for University Debating in 1982 in the year he graduated from Glasgow university, was a deeply serious politician who placed the fight for social justice and the battle to keep the UK in the EU at the heart of his politics.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"ashdown\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n &lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Charles Kennedy.

But he felt deeply uncomfortable with Ashdown’s closeness to New Labour in the mid-1990s and loosened the ties when he succeeded Ashdown as Lib Dem leader in 1999. He eventually abandoned Ashdown’s joint consultative committee, which saw Lib Dem MPs sit round the cabinet table with Labour ministers after Blair aborted plans to form a coalition with Ashdown in the face of objections from John Prescott.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Nick Clegg tweets a tribute to Charles Kennedy\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n &lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Charles Kennedy was one of the most gifted politicians of a generation, he always spoke with great humour, humility and courage.&lt;/p&gt;— Nick Clegg (@nick_clegg) \n &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nick_clegg/status/605608120463847424&quot;&gt;June 2, 2015&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Kennedy went to on to become the most senior opponent at Westminster of the Iraq war as he forged a position to the left of New Labour. In his speech in the Iraq debate in March 2003, in which MPs approved military action, Kennedy said: “Before launching an almighty assault upon Iraq, is it not better to pursue the course of disarmament on the ground in the presence of weapons inspectors? No matter how sophisticated modern technology, even compared with at the time of the last Gulf war, is it not more precise to have weapons dismantled in the presence of inspectors rather than so-called precision bombing trying to take them out?”</p> \n<p>Prescott said in his tribute that Kennedy had been vindicated on Iraq. The former deputy prime minister tweeted: “So sad to hear of Charles Kennedy’s passing. He proved to be right on Iraq. History will be as kind to him as he was to others. A great loss.”</p> \n<p>His success included the Lib Dems achieving their best result of the modern era when they won 62 seats in the 2005 general election. But Kennedy’s leadership was dogged by ill-health and he stood down in 2006 after admitting he had experienced alcohol problems. Kennedy was briefly succeeded by Sir Menzies Campbell before Clegg assumed the leadership in 2007.</p> \n<p>Clegg followed a different path, dubbed the “Orange Book” approach, as he moved the Lib Dems to the centre ground with ambitions of becoming a party of government. Clegg fulfilled this ambition when he formed a coalition with the Tories in 2010 – to the deep shock of Kennedy, whose political hero, Roy Jenkins, had hoped to realign the centre-left by forging links between the Lib Dems and Labour.</p> \n<p>Kennedy voted against Clegg’s decision to form a coalition with the Tories in 2010. In an Observer article explaining his decision, Kennedy wrote: “With uncharacteristic understatement, Paddy Ashdown described last week’s events as ‘a rather unexpected moment’. Certainly, they drive a strategic coach and horses through the long-nurtured ‘realignment of the centre-left’ to which leaders in the Liberal tradition, this one included, have all subscribed since the Jo Grimond era. It is hardly surprising that, for some of us at least, our political compass currently feels confused. And that really encapsulates the reasons why I felt personally unable to vote for this outcome when it was presented to Liberal Democrat parliamentarians.”</p> \n<p>Kennedy had one son with Sarah Gurling. They were divorced in 2010.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d85b73e7b3ef07d2edbaab15d5920300359403bc/0_288_5157_3099/5157.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3099,"width":5157,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Martin Rickett/PA","altText":"Charles Kennedy in September 2005, preparing his speech to the Liberal Democrat conference in Blackpool.

Campbell and Charles Kennedy were close friends - their families would meet up on holiday in Scotland - and Campbell was one of the first to hear the news about Kennedy’s death yesterday. One thing they had in common was a struggle with alcohol and, <a href=\"http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog/2015/06/02/charles-kennedy-a-lovely-man-a-talented-politician-a-great-friend-with-a-shared-enemy/\">in a long, insightful and generous blog,</a> Campbell says that at some point he might write more about this if Kennedy’s family don’t mind. Instead, in the blog, Campbell focuses on the qualities that made Kennedy special.</p> \n<p>Here’s an extract.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>For some years, my family has spent either Easter, or Christmas and New Year, sometimes both, in Charles’ former constituency and he, his wife Sarah before they split up, and their lovely son Donald would always come over, sometimes to stay. I always think one’s own children’s judgement of friends is a good indicator, and my kids, used to politicians in their lives and often seeing straight through them, saw right into Charles for what he was – clever, funny, giving, flawed. My Mum could listen to him all day. ‘I think you’re marvellous on Question Time,’ she would purr about some programme she had remembered from months earlier. She always took his side when I was trying to persuade him he would be a ‘natural on twitter,’ and he felt it was all a bit silly and new fangled. I helped him set up his twitter account. Fair to say he never quite moved that far from his initial assessment.</p> \n <p>Mother and children enjoyed his robustness in braving whatever storms were lashing outside ‘to nip out for a wee bit of fresh air,’ otherwise known as a cigarette. Coming as they do from a maniacally exercising family, they appreciated his studied indifference to all forms of heavy exercise. ‘I’ve never actually been to the top of Ben Nevis,’ he said proudly and to great hilarity of the mountain on our doorstep, which had been on his doorstep all his life. They liked the way he advised on where the next long walk should be, ‘but I’ll probably stay and read a book.’</p> \n <p>I think they also appreciated that Charles, such a passionate and eloquent opponent of the war in Iraq, was nonetheless unwilling to join those who when it came to their view of Tony Blair or of me, could never see beyond that issue. Charles knew that it was possible to disagree with people without constantly feeling the need to condemn them as lacking in integrity or values; though he was not averse to making a few cracks about historic events down the road in Glencoe.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Campbell also reveals that Kennedy sent him this text after the general election.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>fancy starting a new Scottish left-leaning party?

The Liberal Democrats wouldn’t have existed without Charles Kennedy.</p> \n<p>It was his oratory, his persuasive way of speaking, that meant he was able to bring people who weren’t sure about that merger [the SDP and the Liberals] and make sure it actually happened.</p> \n<p>His like will not be seen again.

One’s heart just goes out to his family.</p> \n<p>It has been a very difficult time for him. He lost his seat; at the beginning of the election campaign he lost his father.</p> \n<h2>Norman Lamb</h2> \n<p>This is an untimely death and a really tragic loss of a lovely and immensely talented man – one of the most talented politicians of his age.</p> \n<p>He had a special talent for communication and connecting with people in a very passionate but decent way. He was a committed internationalist who believed in bringing people together.</p> \n<p>It is a great loss for my party but also for the country.

Here’s a round-up of some of them – first, from his own Liberal Democrat colleagues:</p> \n<h2>Tim Farron</h2> \n<p>I think it had been difficult for him – he was somebody who was a towering figure even from an early age. The Liberal Democrats wouldn’t have existed without Charles Kennedy.</p> \n<p>It was his oratory, his persuasive way of speaking, that meant he was able to bring people who weren’t sure about that merger [the SDP and the Liberals] and make sure it actually happened.</p> \n<p>His like will not be seen again. We can all learn from him to take people seriously, not just as electoral units.<br /></p> \n<h2>Paddy Ashdown</h2> \n<p>He is a loss to the Liberal Democrats when we can ill afford to lose a man of that calibre and stature. His judgment on the Iraq war was outstandingly good, opposing the entire political establishment and getting it right, and he got the reward for that at the election that followed when he achieved the greatest number of Liberal Democrat MPs than any before him.</p> \n<p>He had his demons – we all have our demons – but when he was on form, on song, Charles was the best of all of us. One’s heart just goes out to his family.</p> \n<p>It has been a very difficult time for him. He lost his seat; at the beginning of the election campaign he lost his father.</p> \n<h2>Norman Lamb</h2> \n<p>This is an untimely death and a really tragic loss of a lovely and immensely talented man – one of the most talented politicians of his age.</p> \n<p>He had a special talent for communication and connecting with people in a very passionate but decent way. He was a committed internationalist who believed in bringing people together.</p> \n<p>It is a great loss for my party but also for the country. My heart goes out to all of his family and friends.</p> \n<p>Thanks to my colleague <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong>, who has been collating these.</p>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-556d4cd2e4b04a873a5a944f","title":"Tributes from across the political spectrum","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-02T06:49:55Z","body":"<h2>Jeremy Hunt, Conservatives</h2> \n<p>When things like this happen, it puts everything else into perspective.

I was alway impressed with his personal bravery: being leader of Lib Dems in a rowdy House of Commons is pretty difficult.

The&nbsp;Conservatives actually campaigned on a manifesto pledge&nbsp;to get rid of human rights and people voted for it. As electoral choices go, it’s not far off&nbsp;choosing to be ruled by a dry, whispering voice&nbsp;taunting you from an antique mirror.</p> \n<p>Here, in what may well be the final years of our civilisation, I would like to ask a question that has been worrying me for some time. What if David Cameron is a genius? A shrewd and malevolent psychopath who thinks two moves deeper into the game than any of his opponents? What if there sits in Downing Street today <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN7DYPJLXkc\" title=\"\">a modern-day Moriarty</a>, living in a world where his schemes are only kept in check by the deductive brilliance of Harriet Harman? As Holmes would say, look at the evidence. Cameron has managed to set England against Scotland, Scotland against&nbsp;Labour. He&nbsp;has&nbsp;given his enemies the referendums they asked for, and won. He has left Nick Clegg looking like one of those terrified mouse faces that you find in an owl pellet. He has successfully pursued an agenda more radical than Thatcher’s with less popular support than John Major.</p> \n<p>Most impressively, Cameron has managed all&nbsp;this without anybody being terribly worried by&nbsp;him. Immediately after his re-election he announced: “For too long we have been a passively tolerant society, saying to our citizens so long as you obey the law we will leave you alone.” A statement so far to the right that it conceded the political centre ground to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-eI5oLlIeY\" title=\"\">Judge Dredd</a>.</p> \n<p>We have an idea of Cameron as an empty suit – he’s remarkably forgettable for someone who has a face like a gammon travel iron. What if this is simply a character he chooses to play? We can see the mileage Boris Johnson has got out of playing the fairly simple character of a sort of pissed-up dandelion. What if Cameron’s persona&nbsp;is actually more crafted and insidious?&nbsp;He has&nbsp;a brisk, stiff air of wishing he was somewhere else. We imagine he would much rather be a few years in the future, heading up some foundation that’s advising Qatar on how to bid for the Winter Olympics. Perhaps that’s quite an effective manner to adopt when robbing a country. Announcing in a clipped voice that you’ll be out of our hair just as soon&nbsp;as&nbsp;you’ve privatised the NHS, terribly sorry&nbsp;for&nbsp;any inconvenience. Cameron having a down-to-business persona is not terribly unlike one of those gangs who do heists in high-vis jackets.</p> \n<p>Speaking of which, I’ve always thought that Batman hired Robin simply to draw fire: throwing a teenage boy a bright yellow cape&nbsp;and telling him to run through a darkened warehouse full of goons. There seems to be little difference in <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/michael-gove-adjusts-his-ceremonial-robes-as-he-arrives-at-news-photo/473962200\" title=\"\">getting Michael Gove to dress up in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bib and plus fours</a> and throwing him into a roomful of barristers. Gove’s appointment as justice secretary seems to be somewhere between a sardonic trolling of the judiciary and simple misdirection. If he ever does have to produce a Bill of Rights it will be a Producers-style clusterfuck that draws attention away from all&nbsp;the&nbsp;real business of the government.</p> \n<p>Why else would he have put Gove there? Are&nbsp;we to imagine that his priority in choosing someone to draft tricky legislation was that they have a face that’s easy to carve into a pumpkin? Gove is a distraction for a robbery, who has been hired to be a kind of human bin fire. When the real business of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ratification is under way, he’ll be wheeled out on Newsnight looking like a treefrog trying to escape from a scrotum and the whole culture will stop to take aim.</p> \n<p>It’s time we accepted the true depth and horror of Cameron’s genius. In the run up to announcing a legislative programme entirely composed of the sort of things the Sheriff of Nottingham would yell at villagers as threats, he&nbsp;had everybody talking about foxes. He’s introducing the bulk interception of our emails and the only feeling it seems to have provoked from the public is mild arousal. He got quarter of a million people to sign a petition for a Human Rights Act referendum that they would definitely lose (British people think the European court of human rights is all about making sure that Ian Brady can get Netflix or marmalade or something). Indeed, Cameron had us all talking about human rights legislation while quietly pursuing a TTIP trade deal that will make human rights meaningless compared with those of corporations.</p> \n<p>And there we may have the real clue to Cameron’s manner. He is a sort of bored viceroy engaged in the handover of power from government to corporations. He has a detailed idea of what life will be like 10&nbsp;years down the line, when sovereignty is subordinated to corporate courts. He probably feels that, in context, we are churlish to get upset at this colourful, Lannisterish little government he&nbsp;has got together for the handover. Imagine the wry&nbsp;contempt the master criminal must have felt for Holmes, living at the centre of the brutal British empire and imagining that Moriarty’s little crimes were the worst thing in&nbsp;the world.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433175579241/The-Moriarty-of-Downing-S-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Moriarty of Downing Street?

We need an environment where people feel much more liberated to do desk standing.”</p> \n<p>Reviewing existing scientific evidence, which dictated the thresholds they set, the authors found that compared with those who sit the least, those who sit most are <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22890825\">more than twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease</a> and have a <a href=\"http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2091327\">13% and 17% increased risk of cancer incidence and mortality respectively</a>. </p> \n<p>Office workers spend 65% to 75% of their working hours sitting, half of which is in prolonged periods of sustained sitting, according to the study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/01/four-hours-standing-time-office-worker\">'I start to feel it in my knees' – working for hours while standing proves a tall order</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>British people sit for 8.9 hours each day on average and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23666019\">one study suggested</a> that, for those sitting more than seven hours a day, there is a 5% increased risk of premature death with each additional hour off their feet.<br /></p> \n<p>Bradley said some tasks, such as writing a paper or numerical analysis, were better done sitting but others such as meetings or going through your inbox were actually more productive when standing. </p> \n<p>To that end the study champions sit-stand adjustable desks, which only 1% of office workers in the UK have access to, compared with 90% in Scandinavia, according to research.<br /></p> \n<p>They typically cost hundreds of pounds each but the study says benefits are accrued through improved productivity, less absenteeism and reduced healthcare costs.</p> \n<p>However, <a href=\"http://news.cbi.org.uk/\">the CBI </a>responded cautiously to the study. “Companies will generally take a commonsense approach, and offices can be redesigned to encourage different ways of working, but ultimately firms will seek to balance the practicalities of time spent away from desks with the needs of the business,” a spokesman said. </p> \n<p>Professor Maureen Baker, chair of the Royal College of GPs, representing members of a profession who were <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g1558\">urged to stand up during consultations in an article in the BMJ last year</a>, said GPs tended to move about anyway but that the study “provides food for thought”. <br /></p> \n<p> She added: “In many cases – particularly for smaller organisations – the adjustments necessary to allow employees to stand for a significant proportion of the day might be unrealistic. It is, however, important that any employer recognises the responsibility they have to maintain their employees’ good health.”</p> \n<p>Bradley said staff should not feel shy about standing up at their desk, whatever the reaction of their employer or colleagues.</p> \n<p>“We are all sheep but as soon as the black sheep has his finger on the pulse and as soon as the shepherd or employer accepts that, they soon become a white sheep again,” he said. </p> \n<p>The study stresses that standing still for prolonged periods of time also carries health risks and warns that people who start standing more “could expect musculoskeletal sensations and some fatigue as part of the positive adaptive process”.<br /></p> \n<p>Dr Ann Hoskins, of Public Health England, welcomed the study but said “more research needs to be carried out before daily targets for work place activity are recommended”. </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433178678230/2f72b7f4-7f13-4e29-aaf1-b19f44c04469-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Office worker","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-01T22:30:00Z","lastModified":"2015-06-01T23:01:12Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":207,"contributors":[{"name":"Haroon Siddique","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/haroonsiddique"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Health & wellbeing","Health","Life and style","Society","Work-life balance","Work & careers"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"money/work-life-balance","webTitle":"Work-life balance"},{"id":"money/work-and-careers","webTitle":"Work & careers"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Haroon Siddique","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/haroonsiddique"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/01/office-workers-on-feet-standing-fours-hours-day-study-health","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ctn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/01/office-workers-on-feet-standing-fours-hours-day-study-health","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/01/office-workers-on-feet-standing-fours-hours-day-study-health"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433178678230/2f72b7f4-7f13-4e29-aaf1-b19f44c04469-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An office worker eats at her desk.

There have been plenty of people waiting for her to come out looking a mess, ready to ridicule her. Look who’s had the last laugh now. My Twitter feed reckons she looks a bit like Jessica Lange, or <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2013/jun/22/breaking-bad-anna-gunn-santa-fe-albuquerque\">that woman who played Walter White’s wife on Breaking Bad</a>, and she has a touch of the former supermodel about her too.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESW1AncRzeg\"> Bow down, bitches. </a></p> \n<p>Caitlyn Jenner is fit, healthy and rich, so may well have decades of long, enjoyable life ahead of her.

After going through all that, her time has finally come. To see her looking so happy on the cover of Vanity Fair is a triumph. I love that the cover doesn’t even mention her old name; every journalist should follow the magazine’s lead.</p> \n<p>When Kellie Maloney, former boxing promoter to Lennox Lewis,<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/04/kellie-maloney-boxing-sex-change-operation\"> came out as trans last year</a>, the more miserable quarters of the chattering classes cruelly asked: “What does a man in his 60s know about being a woman?” It was the wrong question. A better question is: “Why did this woman feel like she couldn’t be herself all those years?” Caitlyn, like Kellie, has always been a woman. Yes, even when they were “fathering” children. Gender is what’s inside – and for Caitlyn, finally on the outside too. </p> \n<p>Let’s be clear. Caitlyn Jenner is not your average trans person. Her lifestyle is so rarefied very few could realistically aspire to it. She has money for surgery. The majority of transgender people – who face such hideous discrimination in the job market, not to mention social and familial rejection – do not. </p> \n<p>Many trans people are forced into sex work in order to pay for the medical aspects of gender transition, and often this puts them at risk of drug abuse and physical harm. I’ve been there myself. I live in Britain, where transgender people are entitled to surgery and psychotherapy on the NHS – but even here we have to pay for things such as laser hair removal, seen as a “cosmetic” luxury by the NHS, but essential for any trans woman cursed with thick stubble. In the US, health insurance varies from state to state, leaving some transgender Americans covered, others to fend for themselves.</p> \n<p>That doesn’t mean Caitlyn Jenner’s transition isn’t significant. We need trans people from all walks of life challenging perceptions at every level of society. Transgender knows no boundaries when it comes to age, race or social class. As <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/17/true-trans-laura-jane-grace-aol-show-transgender-people\">Laura Jane Grace</a>, another American trans hero, pointed out to me on Sunday, Jenner matters culturally – and we need people who inhabit that space to complement the work being done at grassroots level to improve life for trans people. </p> \n<p>For years, we’ve been bombarded with stories about adult transitions and the complications and misery these inevitably entail. But stories like this will become a thing of the past as awareness about trans people spreads to parents and doctors. More and more parents are supporting their children when they come out as trans, and around the world trans teens are accessing treatments that delay their puberty and give them time to decide what they really want to do with their bodies as they mature. If we can help, love and support trans kids, the idea of the messy social transition – which so intrigues the public – will cease to exist. I can’t wait for that day.</p> \n<p>Things are changing.

The tightrope takes months of training.”</p> \n<p>Chase had previously appeared in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-oWmhdilQM\">O’Dwyer’s semi-final performance</a> alongside Matisse. However, in the final, for which O’Dwyer used a cops and robbers theme, the swap was done behind the scenes to make it look like Matisse had performed all the tricks.</p> \n<p>One Twitter user said that the use of the stunt dog meant that magician Jamie Raven had been “pretty much robbed of &pound;250,000”.
