The country failed to make a €1.5bn payment to the International Monetary Fund on time and has thrust the eurozone into an emergency.</p> \n<p>The long-running debt debacle left Greece on the brink of financial collapse, worsening recent years of wrenching austerity, and represented a historic blow to a Europe committed to the irreversibility of its 16-year-old single currency.</p> \n<p>The deadline on Greece’s bailout programmes, inaugurated in 2010, ended at midnight on Tuesday night, leaving the country without a financial lifeline.</p> \n<p>In a sudden referendum called on creditors’ bailout terms which are formally no longer on the table, Greeks are to vote on Sunday on what EU leaders say is a choice between quitting or staying in the euro.</p> \n<p>After a fortnight of non-stop brinkmanship at the highest level of EU leadership over how to resolve the impasse over Greece’s financial rescue, the leftwing Syriza government of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, tabled surprise new proposals on Tuesday, demanding that the bailout be rolled over into a new two-year programme worth almost €30bn to Greece to be spent on servicing debt.</p> \n<p>The demand included calls for a month of bridging finance to avoid the IMF default and for broader debt relief without mentioning Greek concessions in return for acceptance. It was promptly spurned by key creditors as too little too late.</p> \n<p>“We won’t negotiate about anything new at all until a referendum, as planned, takes place,” said the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. “This evening the programme expires.”</p> \n<p>The 19 finance ministers of the single currency bloc talked for merely an hour by teleconference on Tuesday evening and dismissed the last-minute brinkmanship from Tsipras.</p> \n<p>But Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs the committee, said the ministers would confer again on Wednesday and that Athens was expected to present further proposals on how to resolve the critical situation.</p> \n<p>Tuesday’s rollercoaster of on-off negotiations marked the lowest of lows in the eurozone’s five-year sovereign debt saga. As the midnight bailout deadline approached, hope of striking a deal between the creditors and the radical leftists in Athens dissolved.</p> \n<p>There will be no more IMF lending after the failure to repay the debt. And for the first time since 2010, Greece is bereft of a eurozone and European Central Bank package keeping it afloat.</p> \n<p>The Greek government insisted on Tuesday the ballot meant Athens remained at the negotiating table, while rejecting the terms on offer. Eurozone leaders maintained that the vote was tantamount to a choice of whether or not to stay in the single currency.</p> \n<p>After stunning fellow EU leaders last Saturday by calling the referendum, Tsipras delivered his last-minute bombshell by writing to eurozone leaders demanding a new, separate two-year bailout hours before the current arrangements lapsed.</p> \n<p>Tsipras called the president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, on Monday evening, to explore a possible last-minute way out of the crisis after the Greeks abandoned talks with the eurozone late on Friday and called the referendum. <br /></p> \n<p>Tsipras was told he could accept the creditors’ slightly amended final offer from last Friday and that he would have to campaign for a yes vote in the referendum if he was serious about rescuing a bad situation. He has strongly recommended a no in the vote on Sunday.</p> \n<p>“We see the referendum as part of the negotiation process, not in lieu of it. We look forward to greater flexibility in the days to come,” said Euclid Tsakalotos, Greece’s chief negotiator, as he listed several reasons why the terms from the so-called troika of the European commission, European Central Bank and IMF had to be spurned.</p> \n<p>During a day of gambles, demands and standoffs , Tsipras’s aides remained in telephone contact with commission officials for most of Tuesday before the Greek leader delivered his final move.</p> \n<p> He asked for bridging loans to get him through the IMF non-payment problem and for a new two-year programme covering almost €29bn in debt servicing costs as well as debt relief measures. There was nothing in his letter to Juncker, Klaus Regling, the head of the eurozone’s bailout fund, and Pierre Moscovici, the commissioner for monetary affairs, to indicate what his government was prepared to accept in return for a new deal.</p> \n<p>Any such arrangement would come with tight strings attached. Tsipras has already rejected the creditors’ terms. If he wins his no vote, the Germans and others believe he has burnt his boats and bid farewell to the euro. If he loses to a large yes vote, however, eurozone leaders would be keen to strike a new deal but not with Tsipras, whom they do not trust to deliver.</p> \n<p>A new rescue package would take time to negotiate with no guarantees of a successful conclusion. An agreement on more loans for Greece would need to pass through several eurozone parliaments, including the Bundestag in Berlin where it would get a rough ride.</p> \n<p>Juncker earlier told Tsipras that a last-minute deal was possible if Athens agreed to sign up to the creditors’ proposals presented last Friday. The commission president also dangled the prospects of debt relief for Greece and a €35bn “new start for jobs and growth” programme.</p> \n<p>That appeared to be old wine in new bottles. The €35bn is unlikely to be new money while the debt relief suggestion is the revival of a conditional offer to the previous Greek government from 2012.</p> \n<p>In the past five months, Tsipras has persistently blocked agreement on the current bailout which would have released €7.2bn in return for meeting fiscal targets, spending cuts, and tax rises. He has aimed to get the current programme dropped and wrapped into a new one involving debt relief.</p> \n<p>Since the weekend eurozone leaders desperate to avoid the blame for the departure of the first country from the currency have been declaring that the door remains open to more talks. Tsipras’s gambit on Tuesday tested the credibility of that pledge. But it appeared that it came too late.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435703679928/71549155-f26e-442c-9f22-ff6266138d3e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Petros Karadjias/AP","altText":"Greece's Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Petros Karadjias/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T22:47:02Z","lastModified":"2015-07-01T00:23:14Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2247,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian Traynor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/iantraynor"},{"name":"Jennifer Rankin","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jennifer-rankin"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Greece","Europe","Alexis Tsipras","European Union","International Monetary Fund (IMF)","Economics","Eurozone crisis","European Central Bank","European monetary union","European banks","Euro"],"tags":[{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/alexis-tsipras","webTitle":"Alexis Tsipras"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"business/imf","webTitle":"International Monetary Fund (IMF)"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis"},{"id":"business/european-central-bank","webTitle":"European Central Bank"},{"id":"business/emu","webTitle":"European monetary union"},{"id":"business/europeanbanks","webTitle":"European banks"},{"id":"business/euro","webTitle":"Euro"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/30/eurozone-emergency-greece-without-financial-lifeline","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9tn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/30/eurozone-emergency-greece-without-financial-lifeline","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/30/eurozone-emergency-greece-without-financial-lifeline"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435703679928/71549155-f26e-442c-9f22-ff6266138d3e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" Greece goes to the polls on Sunday in a referendum called by Tsipras to vote on whether to accept bailout terms which are no longer on the table.

But he warned it to “move as quickly as it can” or be seen as unwilling to “take the steps needed to maintain [Britain’s] position as a well-connected open trading economy”.</p> \n<h2>Heathrow’s third runway: the conditions in full</h2> \n<ul> \n <li>A ban on all scheduled night flights from 11.30pm to 6am.<br /></li> \n <li>No fourth runway – the government should make a firm commitment in parliament not to expand further.

Davies said Gatwick presented a “plausible case for expansion” but was “unlikely to provide much of the type of capacity which is most urgently required: long-haul destinations in new markets”. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/heathrow_third-zip/giv-212778xiH7azkR1l9/\" data-alt=\"Heathrow third runway graphic\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/heathrow_third-zip/giv-212778xiH7azkR1l9/\">Heathrow third runway graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite the exhaustive report, trying to expand Heathrow would run into intense opposition.</p> \n<p>While most airlines in the UK and abroad back the commission’s recommended option, a central plank in Gatwick’s campaign was the claim that a third runway for Heathrow would prove “politically undeliverable” due to pollution and noise issues.</p> \n<p>That claim may yet prove correct. Prominent members of the government – including cabinet members Justine Greening and Philip Hammond, as well as the London mayor, Boris Johnson – are all vehemently anti-expansion, while MPs of all parties from constituencies around Heathrow, as well the remaining Liberal Democrats and Greens, are opposed.</p> \n<p>For Cameron himself, who unequivocally ruled out a third runway in 2010 – saying “no ifs, no buts” – it will be a political embarrassment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"584263636398591676113f345155f8bd1fa06cd0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435728312638/15f53c3f-01d6-4996-872c-84e101e22f14-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Airports Commission chairman Sir Howard Davies has delivered his long-awaited report.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Airports Commission chairman Sir Howard Davies has delivered his long-awaited report on airport expansion.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The report stressed that the plan was “a fundamentally different proposition” from previous proposals to expand Heathrow, with the runway located further to the west and expected to have much less impact on local communities through noise. The commission said the airport should be held to account to spend more than &pound;1bn on community compensation, including &pound;700m insulating homes under the flight paths.</p> \n<p>Business groups and most airlines will welcome the commission’s verdict. A majority had accepted Heathrow’s argument that only a hub airport could deliver the long-haul connections to emerging growth markets that would underpin high-value exports and inward investment.</p> \n<p>John Stewart of the anti-expansion group Hacan, who chaired the last campaign against a third runway, said: “This is far from the end of the story. It will be the government that makes the final decision and given the strong opposition in the cabinet to Heathrow, the final chapter may come out in favour of Gatwick.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8211bbcc429e1f695ed4178a1c31886e68ff1175\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/8211bbcc429e1f695ed4178a1c31886e68ff1175/0_0_3000_1803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A passenger plane comes over Heathrow airport\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A passenger plane comes into land over a field at Heathrow airport.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said his department would consider the commission’s advice in detail.<br /></p> \n<p>He said: “As a nation we must be ambitious and forward-looking. This is a once-in a-generation opportunity to answer a vital question. I will make a statement to parliament later today in which I will set out the process for that decision to be made.”</p> \n<p>Heathrow said it would “work for all Britain” in trying to deliver the runway. The airport’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said: “This debate has never been about a runway, it’s been about the future we want for Britain. Expanding Heathrow will keep Britain as one of the world’s great trading nations, right at the heart of the global economy.</p> \n<p>“Our new plans have been designed around the needs of local communities and will meet carbon, air quality and noise targets, and provides the greatest benefit to the UK’s connectivity and its long-term economic growth.</p> \n<p>He promised to “create the world’s best connected, most efficient and most environmentally responsible hub airport”.</p> \n<p>Gatwick Airport’s chief executive, Stewart Wingate, said: “It is for the commission to make a recommendation but it is of course for the government to decide. So we now enter the most important stage of the process.” He claimed the commission had “left the door open to us”.</p> \n<p>But speaking on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, Davies said that while Gatwick had been “not inconceivable” when it was placed on the shortlist 18 months ago, he reiterated the commission’s “clear and unanimous” view that Heathrow offered significantly more benefits.</p> \n<p>He said Heathrow was “by a long, long way” the better choice for air freight and exports, and said 60% of the benefit would go to the regions of the UK who could now connect at the hub. He said: “There are only seven airports connected to Heathrow and the reduction in numbers has been relentless. People in the regions have been denied access to Heathrow’s network.”</p> \n<p>Asked if politicians would follow his advice, Davies said: “It has become a symbolic point around the world – is the UK and London prepared to make the decisions that are needed.”</p> \n<p>Environmental campaigners warned that building a new runway would put climate targets at risk, despite the commission’s insistence that it was compatible with the targets.</p> \n<p>Cait Hewitt of the Aviation Environment Federation said: “Increased emissions from a third runway at Heathrow, like all the shortlisted expansion options, would breach the climate change target for aviation unless politically challenging measures are introduced to limit growth at other airports or to substantially increase the cost of flying.”</p> \n<p>She added: “The UK has a legal obligation to meet EU air quality legal limits and the Airports Commission still cannot say confidently whether or not expansion would be legal.”</p> \n<p>Friends of the Earth said: “Building a new runway at Gatwick or Heathrow would have a hugely damaging impact on local people and their environment and would be a step backwards in UK efforts to tackle climate change.”</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/324291d300eb4a40d2d14fb098602dcd5a3bbadb/135_0_3279_1969/3279.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1969,"width":3279,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Heathrow Airport/PA","altText":"Artist’s impression of Heathrow airport’s planned third runway.

The Lad Bible declared that it <a href=\" https://twitter.com/TheLadBible/status/615143949368471552\">“wins the internet”</a>. Just in case she hadn’t noticed the flag itself during her husband’s set, thoughtful users<a href=\"https://twitter.com/82BAnArsenalFan/status/615176002659074049\"> tweeted it into Kardashian’s mentions</a> to be sure the picture be waiting for her when she got home. </p> \n<p>The precise intent behind the stunt isn’t clear, though the idea that a man should be threatened or shamed by his partner’s past sexual history is as old as it is misogynistic. The use of West’s lyrics suggests it might have been intended to suggest that Kardashian is herself a gold digger, despite her own enormously successful media and business ventures. Is it possible that the flag waver was trying to make a point about sexism in West’s lyrics? At a stretch, yes. Is it likely? No. And even if that were the case, the ends wouldn’t justify the means, any more than they did when the person who threatened to leak naked photos of Emma Watson later claimed it was all in the name of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-emma-watson-nude-photo-leak-was-a-very-elaborate-hoax-9752810.html\">a campaign against the internet site 4Chan</a>. Thank goodness for these towering heroes of morality. </p> \n<p>Regardless of intent, the outcome was yet another very successful woman being reminded that no matter how high she climbs, she can always be torn down by a slut-shaming, misogynistic double standard. There are powerful echoes here of the blame and outrage directed at the victims of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/10/fbi-seizes-computers-in-hunt-for-celebrity-photo-hackers\">last year’s nude celebrity photo hacks</a>. These are women who we pressure to be hyper-sexualised when they are objects for public consumption, in magazines or films or on television. We love to squeal over their “barely there” dress or “plunging cleavage” when they’re walking the red carpet, packaged for an approving audience. But when they dare to take ownership of their own bodies, to have sexual agency, or even, heaven forbid, to enjoy sex for themselves, we are ready to scream shame and demand grovelling public apologies. What Kardashian was doing in that sex tape was private and consensual. The only piece of wrongdoing was the publication of the tape without her consent; one amplified by the flag bearer in revictimising her before a live audience. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/18/kim-kardashian-selfish-book-selfies\">Kim Kardashian's Selfish book snapped up by thousands</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> Though Kardashian is not the only A-lister to have suffered this publicising of her sexual past as a weapon against her, there are noticeable differences in the way she is treated. While there was an outpouring of sympathy and support for many of the photo hacking victims, it was noted at the time that there was a nasty streak of venom reserved particularly for Kardashian. </p> \n<p>There was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/11113789/Kim-Kardashian-naked-photo-leak-Why-the-hacking-of-Kim-Kardashian-deserves-our-sympathy.html \">a classist undertone of sneering</a>, as some suggested that she was “asking for it” because she often chooses to share revealing photographs with her fans, or that as a reality star she doesn’t really deserve to be treated as a celebrity. It is regularly suggested that she leaked the tape intentionally to find fame, though she <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2015/06/hulk_hogan_sues_gawker_celebrity_sex_tapes_used_to_thrill_us_now_they_trouble.single.html\">has made it very clear this was not the case</a>. </p> \n<p>It was the same classist sexism that saw the Duchess of Cambridge, pregnant with Prince George, praised for her pregnancy style and svelte silhouette, while Kardashian, pregnant at the same time with baby North, faced nasty memes comparing her to a whale, and <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2013/03/28/pregnant-kim-kardashian-succumbs-to-cravings-and-gorges-on-burger-and-chips-3564195/\">front-page stories about her “gorging” on fast food</a>. While the Duchess topped Vanity Fair’s<em> </em><a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2013/04/top-ten-best-dressed-pregnant-celebrities#1\">“best-dressed pregnant celebrities” list</a>, Kardashian<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2305066/Kate-Middleton-v-Kim-Kadashian-baby-bump-Duchess-Cambridges-maternity-style-oceans-apart.html\"> was described as “brash” and “trashy”</a>. </p> \n<p>We will praise women for being sexy, as long as it’s the right kind of sexiness. As long as they’re the right “kind” of woman. As long as they’re not in control. As long as we can remind them of their place at any moment.</p> \n<p>This wasn’t “banter”. This wasn’t a hilarious stunt. This was the very public shaming of a pregnant woman in front of her husband and a crowd of strangers. And if that sounds positively medieval, then it should tell you something about our “modern” attitudes towards women.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673442393/1b22908c-b8ac-4fa7-b26c-1bf046efeaff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lionel Cironneau/AP","altText":"Kim Kardashian … social media reacted with glee at the stunt.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Lionel Cironneau/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T15:06:46Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T15:36:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1540,"contributors":[{"name":"Laura Bates","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/3/1428058264790/Laura-Bates-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/laura-bates"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Kim Kardashian","Women","Celebrity","The Duchess of Cambridge","Life and style","Feminism","Glastonbury 2015","Kanye West","Glastonbury festival"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian","webTitle":"Kim Kardashian"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/celebrity","webTitle":"Celebrity"},{"id":"uk/duchess-of-cambridge","webTitle":"The Duchess of Cambridge"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"world/feminism","webTitle":"Feminism"},{"id":"music/glastonbury-2015","webTitle":"Glastonbury 2015"},{"id":"music/kanyewest","webTitle":"Kanye West"},{"id":"music/glastonbury","webTitle":"Glastonbury festival"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Laura Bates","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/laura-bates"}}],"series":{"title":"Laura Bates on everyday sexism","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/laura-bates-on-everyday-sexism"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a96k","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673442393/1b22908c-b8ac-4fa7-b26c-1bf046efeaff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kim Kardashian … social media reacted with glee at the stunt.

The trust blocked moves to use the spectrum for a cheaper BBC1+1 time-adjusted channel.</p> \n<p>With the BBC trying to protect its remaining television channels and radio stations, it is expected that job cuts could run into the high hundreds or more from its 18,000 workforce.<br /></p> \n<p>“Having to find another &pound;150m inevitably makes decisions even tougher, but the director general has always said he came here to make the BBC a simpler and leaner place,” said the source. “None of this is easy, but his priority is what appears on screen and on the airwaves. Everything else must be reduced to a bare minimum.”<br /></p> \n<p>A green paper on the future of the BBC is expected to be published in the coming weeks, with the BBC facing a financial and political onslaught from Conservative ministers. <br /></p> \n<p>In recent weeks, ministers have: </p> \n<ul> \n <li>Warned that the BBC was at risk of being closed down if it did not deal with rightwing charges of leftwing bias. Nick Robinson, the BBC’s political editor, said David Cameron had threatened during the election campaign that he would “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/21/nick-robinson-cameron-threatened-close-down-bbc-election-bus\">close them down after the election</a>”. </li> \n <li>Considered whether to insist that the BBC pay for the &pound;700m-a-year charge of providing free television for the over-75s. Currently funded by the Treasury, the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/may/12/john-whittingdale-backed-bbc-paying-500m-cost-of-tv-licences-for-over-75s\">BBC governors threatened to resign </a>the last time this was mooted in 2010.</li> \n <li>Examined decriminalising non-payers of the &pound;145.50-a-year licence fee, which the BBC estimates would cost it a further &pound;200m.</li> \n <li>Debated whether to impose a new governance structure in charter renewal negotiations in which the BBC Trust would be closed to make way for external regulation from communications regulator Ofcom or a new organisation dubbed “Ofbeeb”. In an interview with Radio Times in April, the chancellor, George Osborne, signalled that he favoured the handover of BBC regulation from the BBC Trust to Ofcom.</li> \n</ul> \n<p></p> \n<p>Against that backdrop , the BBC has discovered a shortfall in its forecast income for 2016-17: a total of about &pound;3.7bn collected largely from licence fee payers is &pound;150m less than had been forecast. The deficit has emerged because increasing numbers of people have become aware of a loophole that allows people not to pay the licence fee if they only watch catch-up television. </p> \n<p>One BBC source said: “Change has come much faster than anyone predicted.” </p> \n<p>Since becoming director general two years ago, Hall, a former BBC head of news, has drawn up plans to save money by capping payoffs and introducing pay restraint. The BBC News division announced plans to<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2014/jul/17/bbc-news-cuts-digital-james-harding\"> cut 400 jobs last July.</a></p> \n<p>With the government looking for savings in next week’s budget as well as the autumn spending review, BBC insiders fear its licence fee funding in the runup to the end of its current charter in 18 months’ time will be a target.<br /></p> \n<p>With a full response to the green paper not expected until Hall makes a major speech at the RTS convention in Cambridge in September, the BBC is likely to argue that the licence fee should be modernised to include catch-up TV.</p> \n<p>The BBC is set to release details of a new study by auditors PWC which suggests that the corporation is already among the most efficient organisations in the public sector. It shows just 8% of spending is on general overheads, well below the average of 11.2% in the public sector. </p> \n<p>As part of its fightback against those who accuse it of waste, the BBC last year unveiled a report which said that administrative and property savings, pay restraint and staff cuts had already led to savings of more than &pound;1.5bn a year by 2017. </p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e33ac4bf9f0377a3126753ac9623ef33482de532/0_87_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jeff Overs/BBC/PA","altText":"Handout photo issued by the BBC of the gallery screen as Sophie Raworth presents today's BBC News at One for the new BBC newsroom studio at Broadcasting House, which is now home to the BBC News at One, Six and Ten and the BBC News Channel.

Hunt will highlight the case of a man found in Edinburgh last week three years after he died, and the eight council-funded “lonely funerals” a day in England, half of which involve over-65s.</p> \n<p>“Are we really saying these people had no living relatives or friends? Or is it something sadder, namely that the busy, atomised lives we increasingly lead mean that too often we have become so distant from blood relatives that we don’t have any idea even when they are dying?” Hunt will tell the annual conference of the Local Government Association. </p> \n<p>“In Japan, nearly 30,000 people die alone every year and they have even coined a word for it, <em>kudokushi,</em> which means ‘lonely death’. How many lonely deaths do we have in Britain where, according to Age UK, a million older people have not spoken to anyone in the last month?”</p> \n<p>Hunt will also urge people to be more careful about drawing on “finite NHS resources” and to display greater personal responsibility by taking better care of their own health in order to reduce lifestyle-related illness such as obesity, diabetes and cancer. </p> \n<p>Hunt will praise the work of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/social-care-network/2014/may/23/shared-lives-community-based-supporting-adults\">Shared Lives</a>, a charity that pays people to let vulnerable individuals – including pensioners who have recently come out of hospital or suffered a bereavement – stay with them until they have got back on their feet. Recipients also include people with learning disabilities and mental illness. </p> \n<p>Around 12,000 people across the UK receive accommodation and support through the scheme, which describes itself as providing “a unique way to live well and feel independent but not alone”. Half live with families on a long-term basis and half temporarily. </p> \n<p>Hosts receive payment for the care and support they provide. The arrangement is estimated to save &pound;26,000 in care costs for someone with learning disabilities, and &pound;8,000 for an individual with mental health problems. </p> \n<p>Hunt will say that the UK’s six million carers and a strong network of charities do great work but are not enough to help ensure the growing number of older people get the support they need. “If we are to rise to the challenges we face, taking care of older relatives and friends will need to become part of all of our lives,” he will say.</p> \n<p>Talking to a boss about elderly care should become as normal as discussing childcare arrangements, he will add. </p> \n<p>While stressing the need for the NHS to be efficient and to spend every pound of its &pound;110bn budget wisely, Hunt will say: “There is a role for patients here too. There is no such thing as a free health service: everything we are proud of in the NHS is funded by taxpayers and every penny we waste costs patients more through higher taxes.”<br /></p> \n<p>His call for people to live healthier lives to ease the strain on the increasingly overburdened NHS echoes a policy already being pursued by Wales’s Labour government. Its “prudent healthcare” initiative seeks to tackle “the twin challenges of rising costs and increasing demand, while continuing to improve the quality of care”.</p> \n<p>Citing greater personal responsibility as a way to relieve the strain on the NHS, Hunt will say: “The best person to prevent a long-term condition developing is not the doctor, it’s you.” </p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435690096826/8dece369-e286-4e34-b9fa-4027dad6e4b4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dave and Les Jacobs/Blend Images/Corbis","altText":"Carer and older woman","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dave and Les Jacobs/Blend Images/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T23:01:01Z","lastModified":"2015-07-01T00:05:58Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Denis Campbell","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/deniscampbell"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Older people","Jeremy Hunt","Social care","Health","Society","UK news","Health policy","Politics"],"tags":[{"id":"society/older-people","webTitle":"Older people"},{"id":"politics/jeremy-hunt","webTitle":"Jeremy Hunt"},{"id":"society/social-care","webTitle":"Social care"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/health","webTitle":"Health policy"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Denis Campbell","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/deniscampbell"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jul/01/invite-lonely-elderly-strangers-home-jeremy-hunt","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9g6","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jul/01/invite-lonely-elderly-strangers-home-jeremy-hunt","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/01/invite-lonely-elderly-strangers-home-jeremy-hunt"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435690096826/8dece369-e286-4e34-b9fa-4027dad6e4b4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"People are leading increasingly ‘atomised lives’ and becoming too distant from their elderly relatives, said health secretary Jeremy Hunt.
