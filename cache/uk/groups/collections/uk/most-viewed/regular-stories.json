This is interesting because it is the only area of the student survey where finalists often show dissatisfaction.”</p> \n<p>The university also has impressive student-staff ratios, he adds. “Few institutions outside the Russell Group manage such a low number of students per member of academic staff – and some Russell Group members don’t either.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5b0035101754fa11f33320bd3147ecb40075996c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432542093420/bdcb5415-9b2b-4fc2-8062-6445709c839c-348x420.jpeg\" alt=\"John Latham\" width=\"348\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vice-chancellor of Coventry University, John Latham: ‘We’re bringing in new forms of pedagogy and listening to students.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Coventry University</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>John Latham, vice-chancellor of Coventry University, says the university’s success is down to its focus on students’ needs. “We’re a modern university, but not just in the sense that we haven’t been around for as long - we’re very modern in our approach. We’re challenging the system. We’re bringing in new forms of pedagogy and listening to students.”</p> \n<p>The university has three objectives: “teaching students well, making sure that students are listened to, and making sure they get good jobs at the end of their course,” says Ian Dunn, deputy vice-chancellor for student experience at Coventry.</p> \n<p>Other institutions that performed well in the table include the universities of Surrey, Sussex and Falmouth. </p> \n<p>Sussex, which had fallen to the nether regions of the top 50 in previous years, has now climbed to 19th position. Michael Farthing, vice-chancellor of Sussex University, says the university’s recovery is down to its increased efforts to boost the employability of its graduates. <br /></p> \n<p>“We’ve been much more proactive in helping students get jobs,” says Farthing. “More students are getting the opportunity to do placements as part of their studies, more students are doing study abroad, and we’re supporting students much more in terms of their language development.”</p> \n<p>Surrey University, the only institution to enter the top five this year, also puts its success partly down to its employment figures. Michael Kearney, acting vice-chancellor at the university, says 97% of graduates find work six months after graduating. “We have a dedicated team working closely with the students and employers and we have excellent relationships with industry,” he says.</p> \n<p>Leicester and Aston University fared less well in this year’s rankings: both slumped from the fringes of the top 20 to positions outside the top 30. At Leicester, student satisfaction deteriorated, while at Aston value-added scores worsened, particularly in the area of English and creative writing.</p> \n<h2><strong>The subject tables: star performers</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>Across <a href=\"http://gu.com/p/497a8/\">the Guardian’s subject tables</a>, stand-out performers include Falmouth University, which has climbed the rankings for business, management and marketing.

The Franco-German initiative, likely to be endorsed by the 25 June summit, would definitively close the door on treaty renegotiation.</p> \n<p> The move from Berlin and Paris came as the UK prime minister prepared to open his negotiations with the French and the Germans on Thursday and Friday.</p> \n<p>Cameron faces a busy week on the referendum campaign.

They talked through the issue at some length in the spirit of finding solutions to these problems. They agreed that more discussion would be needed, including with other leaders, on the best way forward.”</p> \n<p>The former prime minister of Luxembourg will play a subsidiary, if influential, role in the negotiations whose outcome will ultimately be decided by national government leaders.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, a day after the state opening of parliament, Cameron will fly around Europe to meet the Danish prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, in Copenhagen, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, in the Hague and Hollande in Paris. The following day he will meet the Polish prime minister, Ewa Kopacz, in Warsaw before going to Berlin to see Merkel. He aims to speak to all other leaders of member states before the June summit.</p> \n<p> The Franco-German pact, agreed as the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/24/greece-warns-it-is-set-to-default-on-debt-repayment-loans\">Greek debt crisis</a> comes to a head, was finalised last week on the fringes of the EU summit in Latvia and sent to Juncker at the weekend, Le Monde reported.</p> \n<p> The summit in Riga last Friday was Cameron’s first opportunity since re-election to present his ideas to fellow EU leaders. But it appeared that Merkel and Hollande had bigger fish to fry.</p> \n<p> Juncker is preparing policy options for the June summit on how to integrate the eurozone fiscally and politically as it struggles to emerge from more than five years of crisis. The Franco-German proposals are likely to settle the direction of policy. They talk of economic, fiscal and social convergence, combining German insistence on monetary stability with French demands for greater investment.</p> \n<p> “Additional steps are necessary to examine the political and institutional framework, common instruments and the legal basis” (of the eurozone) by the end of next year, said the document, according to Le Monde.</p> \n<p> The following year, 2017, Germany and France have general elections, narrowing the scope for negotiations with Britain.</p> \n<p> The Franco-German policy proposal, said Le Monde, “shows that French and German leaders do not have much in common with David Cameron”.</p> \n<p> Cameron and Juncker have not had an easy relationship. The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jun/27/juncker-wrong-person-european-commission-leadership-david-cameron\">UK prime minister opposed Juncker’s appointment as European commission president</a>.

In many cities, more visible crimes have fallen: in New York in 1990, the homicide rate peaked with 2,245 murders; last year it saw a record low of 328. But new risks are emerging: terrorism is a serious concern for any major city, and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/technology/cybercrime\">cyber crime</a> is a growing threat – as cities increasingly rely on technology and connectedness, everything from traffic lights to air-traffic control, even sewage systems, could be vulnerable to hackers.</p> \n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://safecities.economist.com/whitepapers/safe-cities-index-white-paper/\">Safe Cities Index</a>, put together by the <a href=\"http://www.eiu.com/home.aspx\">Economist’s Intelligence Unit </a>(EIU), the title of world’s safest goes to the city that is also the most populous: Tokyo. <br /></p> \n<p>The EIU looked at a wide range of factors when putting together the index. It examined digital security, and considered the number of cyber attacks and how they were tackled. It looked at the obvious area of personal safety, but also infrastructure security – sanitation, roads, and management of natural disasters. In the health security category, it looked at quality of healthcare (for instance, how many hospital beds and doctors there were per 1,000 people), but also at issues such as pollution. As the report puts it, “Living in a safe and healthy urban environment can make a real and measurable difference to city inhabitants.” In the index’s top 25 cities, average life expectancy is 81; in the bottom half, it is 75.</p> \n<p>Tokyo scored highly across all categories. The report highlights its low crime rate, and how city planners improved quality of life by banning diesel cars to reduce pollution, and pedestrianising large parts of the centre.</p> \n<p>Before you start packing your bags, however, the conclusions aren’t simple: Tokyo also happens to be considered <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/gallery/2014/mar/25/earthquakes-hurricanes-cyclones-and-tsunamis-10-riskiest-cities-world\">the world’s riskiest city</a>, in part because of the huge number of people who would be harmed in an inevitable future earthquake. Nor does the report actually say which city is safest for <em>you</em>. From an individual’s point of view, as opposed to the municipal officials responsible for the smooth running of a city, isn’t personal safety more important than the threat of cyber crime? In that case, maybe you should look at Singapore instead. And what if health security is your priority, but you’ll take your chances on the streets? Move to Zurich: first for health, 13th for personal safety.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94b0554c01d5dba9b36edfd99c314455852b6156\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432050374825/cb26654d-e115-4dad-bdf5-34ed8873d5ea-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"In 2011 and 2013, Amsterdam was ranked safest for cyclists by urban planning consultancy the Copenhagenize Design Company.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 2011 and 2013, Amsterdam was ranked safest for cyclists by urban planning consultancy the Copenhagenize Design Company.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David R Frazier Photolibrary/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Tokyo might be one of the safest cities but it also happens to be one of the riskiest</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Other studies have revealed other issues that might be of personal importance. Amsterdam, for instance, is – perhaps unsurprisingly – a good place to be a on a bike. In 2011 and 2013, the Dutch city was ranked <a href=\"http://copenhagenize.eu/index/index.html\">safest for cyclists</a> by urban planning consultancy the Copenhagenize Design Company, using criteria such as bicycle facilities, drivers’ attitudes, and political will to promote cycling. The sheer proliferation of cyclists helps – cycling in the city, notes the report, is “about as mainstream as you can get” – as does cycling infrastructure and a 30kph speed limit.</p> \n<p>There is no exhaustive ranking of the safest cities for women, but <a href=\"http://www.trust.org/spotlight/most-dangerous-transport-systems-for-women/?tab=results\">one survey</a> last year looked specifically at how safe women were on public transport. Up to 500 women were polled in 15 of the world’s capitals, plus New York. They were asked about their experiences of being verbally harassed or assaulted by men, travelling at night, the likelihood that other passengers would come to their aid, and whether they trusted that officials would investigate reports of violence. Of the cities surveyed, New York came out best, with Bogota, Mexico City and Lima faring worst; London was ranked fourth safest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b801ebe4150a47f295b024e530c0aad3d1da9cf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432050621184/a3f759c6-efaf-4319-911e-c8a9a8fe06a4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"London was ranked fourth safest for women using public transport.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London was ranked fourth safest for women using public transport.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But is it really possible, or even desirable, to rank cities according to their safety? “We are quite wary of doing that,” says Dr Michele Acuto, principal investigator for UCL’s <a href=\"http://www.cityleadership.net/#!3s-cities/c13sv\">City Leadership Initiative</a>, which is working with the UN on how to improve urban safety. “Rankings pit cities against each other. If you say London is safer than Manchester, it’s a blunt generalisation. You can say London has a lower crime rate than Manchester – that would be correct – but making judgements on safety is perception-based.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/gallery/2014/mar/25/earthquakes-hurricanes-cyclones-and-tsunamis-10-riskiest-cities-world\">Earthquakes, hurricanes, cyclones and tsunamis: the world's 10 riskiest cities</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>How do you make a city safer? Nobody wants to live in a police state. “You have to reduce crime, but it’s also things like improving safety of transport. If you make a city more sustainable, with more bike lanes, for instance, you can redesign it so that it’s also safer for pedestrians.” The wealth gap also has an important effect on a city’s safety: “There is no safer-city agenda that can proceed without a social-equality agenda,” says Acuto.</p> \n<p>And if there’s one factor you might want to consider as a sign of how safe your city is likely to be in future, look to the immigration rate. Studies in the US have shown that, far from what the anti-immigration lobby would have us believe, a city with more immigrants has lower crime rates. <a href=\"http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/Clinics/Sampson_Immigration_Contexts.pdf\">A study</a> by Robert J Sampson, professor of social sciences at Harvard University, found that first-generation immigrants were 45% less likely – and second-generation immigrants 22% less likely – to commit violence than third-generation Americans. As Sampson <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/do-immigrants-make-us-safer-96377\">has summed it up</a>: “If you want to be safe, move to an immigrant city.”</p> \n<p></p>","section":"Cities","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432051875976/ced4b96d-08e1-4481-a29d-26076694876d-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy/Iain Masterton","altText":"Pedestrianisation of streets is considered to be a driver of a city's safety.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy/Iain Masterton"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432051162366/d2edbec0-fbf3-4df5-9aa0-498422ef03b9-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"In many cities, more visible crimes have fallen while terrorism and cyber crime are growing threats.

As with so many aspects of Liverpool’s mutable, oddly unquantifiable progress in the last two years, it might just be best to double-check the figures on that one. By Sunday night, Liverpool’s manager had recalculated. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/24/liverpool-brendan-rodgers-owners-manager-apologises-fans-stoke-city\">“I’ve always said if the owners want me to go, I go,”</a> he reasoned, pirouetting on his heel with a lithe, finely-balanced sense of sure-footedness that brought to mind something almost entirely unlike Emre Can.</p> \n<p>Rodgers is the kind of manager you can’t help wanting to believe in, even just a little bit. If only because of the memory of Liverpool’s best period in his three years to date, that thrilling surge in the previous season when a run of one defeat from January to April was marked by fast starts and sublime, fluent attacking interchange between three players who have, for different reasons, been largely absent this season.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/25/liverpool-brendan-rodgers-fsg-owners-anfield-future-stoke-pressure\">Brendan Rodgers backed by FSG to walk through Liverpool storm</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Rodgers has always presented himself as a seductively modern creature, a “process manager” with a fully tooled-up range of coaching neologisms, from state-of-the-art fluent passing football, to his urge to mint new positions, subvert the dominant paradigm, play a false No9 and 3/4 and all the rest of it. Plus, of course, there is that alluringly sonorous Liverpool-shaded persona, in the good times at least, a kind of Shankly-lite mash-up of the magnetic personality, the ringing tones, the grand gestures.</p> \n<p>And then, of course, there’s the Liverpool team. Like Rodgers himself, the side have been a little obscured in recent times, hard to get a decent look at. The bald facts are that three years on, and with &pound;210m spent, Liverpool have won no trophies and enjoyed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/dec/09/liverpool-basel-champions-league-match-report\">one disappointing Champions League season</a>. And yet in a sense Rodgers has been protected a little through this by the distracting effects of three competing wider narratives.</p> \n<p>The first of these we might call the Su&aacute;rez Distortion. It turns out, with the benefit of hindsight, that not only is Luis Su&aacute;rez a brilliantly decisive footballer, he is also phenomenally good at helping other players shine. Last year it was Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling at Liverpool. This time it’s Neymar and the recalibrated genius of Lionel Messi. By extension he’s a tonic for managers, too: with the world’s most selflessly, relentlessly intelligent centre-forward in his team Luis Enrique has also been transformed into a revered attacking technician.</p> \n<p>The net result is that after three years in which Liverpool have finished seventh, second and sixth it is tempting to conclude that what happened in that middle year is not that Liverpool managed to come second; but that with the outstanding Premier League player of the last six years in their team they failed to come first.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eae3ec0308bd4bbf60f4b3115a81f0321fc55d1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432592207310/092dc9cd-7968-4dd4-ae74-8d0f84a2dcc0-460x293.jpeg\" alt=\"Luis Su&aacute;rez was (so brilliant for Liverpool maybe we should be asking why Brendan Rodgers failed to win the title with him in the side last year,\" width=\"460\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis Su&aacute;arez was (so brilliant for Liverpool maybe we should be asking why Brendan Rodgers failed to win the title with him in the side last year.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was always likely Liverpool would miss the 55-goal contribution of Su&aacute;rez and Sturridge this time round. But even before the invertebrate defeat at Stoke there was a more profound, systemic feel to the team’s congealment.</p> \n<p>Liverpool have competed in five competitions this season. The manner of their exit from the running in each has been genuinely disappointing. The Champions League campaign brought just one win, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/sep/16/liverpool-ludogorets-champions-league\">at home to Ludogorets in the opening game</a>. In both domestic cup competitions the big games – semi-finals or against the game’s better managers – continued to elude Rodgers.</p> \n<p>The Premier League season disintegrated after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/22/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">the home defeat by Manchester United</a> in March, the first of six losses in 11 games to cap a season that saw Liverpool go from 84 points last season to 62 this.</p> \n<p>If Rodgers has been a little lucky it is in the fact the mechanics behind this falling away have been drowned out to a degree by noises off the pitch. First there has been <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/21/raheem-sterling-liverpool-agent-contract-900000\">the ongoing furore of Raheem Sterling’s wanderlust</a>. This has undoubtedly been <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/21/aidy-ward-raheem-sterling-liverpool-agent\">appallingly handled by his agent</a>. But it has also been allowed to encroach as far as possible, to play out as disruptively as any saga anywhere in recent memory.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/25/divock-origi-liverpool-lille-ligue-1-worst-team-of-season\">Liverpool striker Divock Origi named in Ligue 1 worst team of the season</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This is not a first. Star players will always want to leave. Young players often have their heads turned. Rodgers has been unlucky with the way this one has played itself out. But how would Shankly, or Sir Alex Ferguson or Jos&eacute; Mourinho have handled it? Or even, in Rodgers’ favour, a manager with a little more obvious on-site support from his board and owners?</p> \n<p>Similarly Steven Gerrard’s protracted farewell tour has overhung a large portion of the season. Just as man inevitably hands on misery to man, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/16/liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Gerrard’s sentimental departure</a> has been transformed into exactly the same distracting shadow of the past that has shadowed his own career. Bring me lucky generals, Napoleon said. Rodgers has been the opposite, forced to fight simultaneously on three fronts, only one of them strictly footballing. And yet for all that a great part of managing has always been managing problems, coping with bad luck, funnelling the right kind of energy your own way.</p> \n<p>The gripes against Rodgers’ micro-management are well rehearsed. A tendency to lose the big points. A habit of fiddling tactically, a fixed-gear zaniness that is at times more a sign of stubbornness than flexibility. But really what might just do for him now, a mark of underachievement that can’t be obscured by any wider narrative, are his dealings in the transfer market.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b04244f43126a68e27cb8305a7594f455404ead3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432592384080/a277c6be-7721-4eca-8961-cc66943f1e89-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mario Balotelli is far from being Brendan Rodgers' only expensive mistake in the transfer market.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mario Balotelli is far from being Brendan Rodgers’ only expensive mistake in the transfer market.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The manager must take a degree of responsibility both for the signings and subsequent progress of Fabio Borini (&pound;10.5m), Joe Allen (&pound;15m), Adam Lallana (&pound;25m), Lazar Markovic (&pound;20m) Dejan Lovren (&pound;20m), Mamadou Sakho (&pound;18m), Mario Balotelli (&pound;16m), Iago Aspas (&pound;7.2m) and Rickie Lambert (&pound;4m). Not to mention various expensive add-ons and loanees whose merits have so far remained obscure. For all the good business that may have gone the other way, it is a vast expense in a short time. Juventus, by comparison, have spent no more on a single player in the last few years than the &pound;14.5m they gave Real Madrid for &Aacute;lvaro Morata.</p> \n<p>There is simply a sense of wastage there. Liverpool are the ninth richest club in the world, richer than Juventus, Borussia Dortmund, Milan and Atl&eacute;tico Madrid. But can they really afford to trust the same manager with another three seasons’ worth of transfer budget? Not least when the club is currently still in a transitional phase in its modern existence, working at a level where the margins are still fine, where every decision must be the right one, where every drop must be wrung from the playing assets.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile there is a naturally corrosive quality to the churn under Rodgers. Perhaps we saw a little of this in the collapse at Stoke, a degree of emotional exhaustion at the end of three unsettling years, and a period of oddly fascinating, strangely wasteful stasis.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432628351885/7f4d68d7-0311-4968-83ba-951a3b6ff2b5-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dave Thompson/Getty Images","altText":"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers during the 6-1 hammering at Stoke City.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dave Thompson/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432592207692/092dc9cd-7968-4dd4-ae74-8d0f84a2dcc0-2060x1314.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1314,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Luis Suáarez was (so brilliant for Liverpool maybe we should be asking why Brendan Rodgers failed to win the title with him in the side last year.

He said: “Assisted suicide is illegal in the UK so it had to be Switzerland.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global/2015/may/20/end-of-life-care-services-be-improved\">How could end-of-life care services be improved?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He added that he decided it was time when his symptoms increased in severity. “I put one date off so that my daughter could do her exams – but I was going downhill and was finding it hard to use my hands. I had no pressure in my fingers.</p> \n<p>“I felt the illness had crossed the red line and I was getting worse. Rather than go late, I am jumping the gun. I call it the least worst option, which is best for my family in the long term.”</p> \n<p>Spector, who was the director of a number of advertising and internet firms in Blackpool, Lancashire, chose to be joined by a film crew for the last week of his life. His decision to be filmed has echoes of the death of Guernsey-based hotelier Peter Smedley, whose assisted death in 2011 was screened in a documentary by the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2011/jun/17/suzanne-moore-assisted-dying-terry-pratchett\">late Sir Terry Pratchett for the BBC</a>. </p> \n<p>Spector, whose family joined him at the Zurich clinic, described his condition as “a walking timebomb” as he could be struck with neck-down paralysis at any moment.</p> \n<p>In an interview released by Dignitas, Spector said he was not scared of death and added: “Never judge someone until you have worn their shoes.</p> \n<p>“I know I am going too early. My family disagree, but I believe this is in their best interests.” Stating he wanted to be “in control of the final stages of my life”, he said: “I was a fit and healthy person and my life has been turned upside down.</p> \n<p>“What started as backache in 2008 developed into an illness that led me to having to make this most awful decision. Friends, and most of all my family, have urged me not to go through with it.”</p> \n<p>Spector first discovered he was ill when he complained of having a sore back and stiff neck. He collapsed at a hotel after attending a friend’s retirement party and sought medical advice. He said: “I thought I had overdone things. My legs went in the hotel room. I got back home and booked in for an MRI scan.</p> \n<p>“The phone call from the clinic asked me to go for another scan, which revealed a large tumour high up in my spine in and around the spinal cord.</p> \n<p>“My surgeon was confident he could remove the tumour but tests revealed it would be too dangerous. I woke up thinking it would be out, but he told me he could not even take a biopsy.” </p> \n<p>Instead, surgeons removed bones elsewhere in his back to relieve pressure caused by the tumour, but it continued to grow. </p> \n<p>Spector added: “Had it been lower down the spine, and I lost the use of my legs, I would have been distraught but I could cope. Where it was meant total paralysis from my neck down.”</p> \n<p>As the tumour grew, Spector visited the Dignitas clinic and decided that he would kill himself before the tumour’s advance meant he would be unable to do so. </p> \n<p>He said: “I know I am going too early but I had consistent thoughts without peer pressure. It had to be a settled decision by a sound mind. If I am paralysed and cannot speak, then what hope is there? I am a proud person – a dignified person, independent and self motivated. It is me who is doing this.” </p> \n<p>In the UK, anyone convicted of assisting a suicide can face a 14-year jail term.

His private member’s bill was debated in the House of Lords in June 2014 and reached the committee stage in parliament in January. However, due to opponents delaying its progress, the bill did not reach the Commons before parliament was dissolved ahead of the general election. </p> \n<p>“Some people will criticise me, but do not judge me,” said Spector. “I believe in my human right to dignity. I want the ability to have a cup of tea and hold a phone – I want to be able to do those things myself.</p> \n<p>“I believe what I am doing is in the best long term interests of my family. They disagree, but they do accept I have my own opinion.” </p> \n<p>A family friend said on Monday: “Jeffrey was not for changing his mind.
