Their bodies were not recovered until Sunday morning, with the assistance of park rangers and a California highway patrol helicopter. Neither of the men appeared to have deployed their parachutes.</p> \n<p>Base jumping in Yosemite is illegal and those who attempt it risk being arrested and fined.</p> \n<p>Potter was one of the most recognizable figures in extreme sports. His independent spirit and inclination to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/gallery/2009/oct/01/dean-potter-skywalker\">push the boundaries</a> of what was possible in climbing and Base jumping made him a revered presence in the tight-knit community.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-389080301__\n</div> \n<p>Earlier this month, Potter set the record for the fastest ascent of Half Dome, one of Yosemite’s iconic monoliths. He completed it through a combination of trail running and free-soloing, or climbing without a rope. Potter also held the record for the longest wingsuit flight, covering nearly four miles (6.5km) of ground in 2 minutes, 50 seconds, after jumping from the Eiger in Switzerland.<br /></p> \n<p>In November, after the release of the adventure film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o86TpaSBcWw\">Valley Uprising</a>, sports nutrition company Clif Bar dropped its decade-long sponsorship of Potter, along with four other athletes that were shown Base jumping and free-soloing. Clif indicated that the athletes’ degree of risk made the company uncomfortable. The energy-bar maker cut financial support for the athletes but continued to promote the film.</p> \n<p>Potter made his home in Yosemite with girlfriend Jennifer Rapp and his dog, Whisper. Though his dog had accompanied him on previous jumps, she was not in Potter’s backpack on Saturday.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>In an interview with climber Jimmy Chin last spring, Potter explained he had become more committed to flying safely as he lost friends to the sport: “This past month, four friends died wingsuit flying, one of whom was my very good friend and wingman, Sean Leary,” Potter said. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGWiZLy0YuI\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AGWiZLy0YuI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>As he pushed the limits of human flight, Potter said, he was also studying aerodynamics and aerospace technology and was very much committed to developing safer gear and flying protocols.</p> \n<p>Potter’s determination brought human flight to the edge of what was possible. He developed the skill to climb difficult walls without ropes, relying on a small chute on his back in case he fell. “I love the idea that I can change the worst possible thing to the best possible thing – dying to flying,” he said in a video from Sender Films. “Everybody kind of fantasizes about it – flying – and it’s an amazing place in history right now that man actually has the ability to pull it off.”</p> \n<p>An investigation into what caused the men to crash is ongoing. </p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/be6be7b3b66edf10a94e15d317356c5edb8ef315/111_350_2739_1645/2739.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1645,"width":2739,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"ChinaFotoPress/ChinaFotoPress via Getty Images","altText":"Dean Potter after walking a 41 slackline strung across Enshi grand canyon at an altitude of 1,800m in 2012 in Hubei province, China.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: ChinaFotoPress/ChinaFotoPress via Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-18T03:10:53Z","lastModified":"2015-05-18T08:29:30Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Caty Enders","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/9/1420824212780/Caty-Enders-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/caty-enders"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["US news","California","Extreme sports","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"us-news/california","webTitle":"California"},{"id":"sport/extreme-sports","webTitle":"Extreme sports"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"us-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Caty Enders","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/caty-enders"}}],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-389080301","source":"Reuters","durationInSeconds":76,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/3gpp:small","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/4/23/120423ChinaSlackline_3gpSml4x3.3gp"},{"mimeType":"video/3gpp:large","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/4/23/120423ChinaSlackline_3gpLg4x3.3gp"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120423ChinaSlackline/120423ChinaSlackline.m3u8"}]}],"adTargetingPath":"us-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/may/18/extreme-athlete-dean-potter-among-two-killed-base-jumping-in-yosemite","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49xza","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/us-news/2015/may/18/extreme-athlete-dean-potter-among-two-killed-base-jumping-in-yosemite","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/18/extreme-athlete-dean-potter-among-two-killed-base-jumping-in-yosemite"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/be6be7b3b66edf10a94e15d317356c5edb8ef315/111_350_2739_1645/2739.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1645,"width":2739,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dean Potter after walking a 41 slackline strung across Enshi grand canyon at an altitude of 1,800m in 2012 in Hubei province, China.

This will also be provided in hospitals. The changes are due to apply across England by 2020.</p> \n<p>The prime minister will highlight the “shocking fact” that mortality rates for patients who are admitted to hospital on a Sunday can be 16% higher than for those admitted on a weekday. He will say that the largest number of seriously ill patients are admitted to hospitals at weekends when they are least well equipped to handle them.</p> \n<p>In his speech, Cameron will say: “There is nothing that embodies the spirit of One Nation coming together – nothing that working people depend on more – than the NHS. Our commitment to free healthcare for everyone – wherever you are and whenever you need it.</p> \n<p>“That means getting the best care and making that care available for everyone – free – wherever they are and whenever they need it. So I believe that together – by sticking to the plan – we can become the first country in the world to deliver a truly seven-day NHS.</p> \n<p>“We must do so to protect and preserve the values of the NHS that are so central to our national identity. To keep our people healthy, to look after them when they fall ill, to care for the elderly with dignity and to ensure that free healthcare is always there whenever people need it most. By sticking to the plan, we can and will achieve this together – seven-day NHS, safe in our hands for every generation to come.”</p> \n<p>The prime minister will claim that staff will not be forced to work longer hours because a more flexible approach will be introduced so doctors and nurses will be on duty when they are most needed.<br /></p> \n<p>Downing Street is particularly keen to campaign on the issue of health because Cameron believes that Ed Miliband’s plan to “weaponise” the NHS in the general election campaign fell flat. The Tories point out that voters often rated the NHS as their most pressing concern and yet Labour, which warned of Conservative plans to privatise the NHS, suffered its worst defeat since 1987.<br /></p> \n<p>But the prime minister will come under pressure to explain how George Osborne will provide the extra &pound;8bn a year pledged for the NHS by the end of this parliament. In one of his major announcements of the election campaign, the chancellor <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/apr/10/conservatives-plug-nhs-funding-gap\">promised in a Guardian article</a> to protect what he described as the “precious” NHS with a guarantee of an &pound;8bn increase in spending.</p> \n<p>The move is designed to help meet a &pound;30bn per year funding gap by the end of the decade identified by Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England. The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/mar/29/jeremy-hunt-pledges-extra-8bn-for-nhs-if-conservatives-win-election\">Stevens plan calls for &pound;22bn</a> in efficiency savings. This requires an extra &pound;8bn in governmental spending a year by 2020 over and above increases in line with inflation. This will come on top of the extra &pound;2bn announced in the autumn statement.</p> \n<p>But Osborne was unable to say exactly how he will provide the &pound;8bn. He simply wrote: “We can make this commitment because we’ve got the track record and a plan to grow our economy.” The chancellor is expected to give the first details in a budget next month ahead of a spending review in the autumn.</p> \n<p>The prime minister’s focus on the NHS comes after Nicky Morgan, the education secretary, said she would accelerate the schools shakeup started by her predecessor Michael Gove. The Queen’s speech, to be outlined next week, will include a bill to give the government greater powers to ensure that failing or “coasting” schools can be turned into academies free from local authority control.</p> \n<p><br />The new powers will mean that regional commissioners will be able to appoint new leadership for a school – and set it on a path to becoming an academy – as soon it is judged to be failing. So called “coasting schools”, which are judged to be just above the level of failing, will be forced to work with specialist headteachers. <br /></p> \n<p>Morgan told the Andrew Marr Show: “What I am going to be revolutionary about is about making sure that every child has the chance to fulfil their potential. That means every child has an excellent school to attend with great teachers.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431886899340/6c1f60d0-d46f-4dc1-9491-689569389e70-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Rex Shutterstock/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Cameron in Edinburgh","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Rex Shutterstock/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-18T06:30:17Z","lastModified":"2015-05-18T06:30:19Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1014,"contributors":[{"name":"Nicholas Watt","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nicholaswatt"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["David Cameron","NHS","Conservatives","Health","Politics","Society","UK news","Health policy","Public services policy","Doctors"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"society/nhs","webTitle":"NHS"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/health","webTitle":"Health policy"},{"id":"society/policy","webTitle":"Public services policy"},{"id":"society/doctors","webTitle":"Doctors"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Nicholas Watt","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/nicholaswatt"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/18/cameron-seven-day-health-service-nhs-pledge-conservatives","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49xjn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/may/18/cameron-seven-day-health-service-nhs-pledge-conservatives","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/18/cameron-seven-day-health-service-nhs-pledge-conservatives"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431886899340/6c1f60d0-d46f-4dc1-9491-689569389e70-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Cameron: ‘There is nothing that embodies the spirit of One Nation coming together – nothing that working people depend on more – than the NHS.’ Photograph: Rex Shutterstock","credit":"Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Cameron in Edinburgh","cleanCaption":"Cameron: ‘There is nothing that embodies the spirit of One Nation coming together – nothing that working people depend on more – than the NHS.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Rex Shutterstock"}},"importance":5,"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"The truth about poo: we’re doing it wrong","rawTitle":"The truth about poo: we’re doing it wrong","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/may/18/truth-about-poo-doing-it-wrong-giulia-enders-squatting","title":"The truth about poo: we’re doing it wrong","trailText":"Who knew sitting on the toilet was bad for you?

In her best-selling book Charming Bowels, microbiologist Giulia Enders explains how to go to the loo</p>","byline":"Annalisa Barbieri","body":"<p>In my large Italian family, I grew up with the subject of poo, bottoms and constipation readily – and far too frequently – discussed at the dinner table. I’d be about to raise a raviolo to my mouth, only to hear how someone’s piles had popped, just that morning.</p> \n<p>This doesn’t mean I’m anal (sorry) about the subject. It’s fascinating away from the lunch table. Late last year, I read that we are pooing all wrong: we should be squatting, not sitting, on a toilet bowl. Then a book called <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/may/07/gut-reaction-book-digestive-tract-german-bestseller\">Charming Bowels by Giulia Enders</a> caused something of a storm in its native Germany and I got fully immersed in the subject.</p> \n<p>Enders is studying in Frankfurt for her medical doctorate in microbiology. She is utterly, charmingly obsessed with the gut, gut bacteria and poo. She writes and talks about her subject matter with such child-like enthusiasm, it’s infectious. And, yes, we have been pooing all wrong. Enders tells me about various studies that show that we do it more efficiently if we squat. This is because the closure mechanism of the gut is not designed to “open the hatch completely” when we’re sitting down or standing up: it’s like a kinked hose. Squatting is far more natural and puts less pressure on our bottoms. She says: “1.2 billion people around the world who squat have almost no incidence of diverticulosis and fewer problems with piles. We in the west, on the other hand, squeeze our gut tissue until it comes out of our bottoms.” Lovely.</p> \n<p>But not to worry. Although you can climb on your toilet seat and squat (“It might be fun!”), we can iron out the kink by sitting with our feet on a little stool and leaning forward. The book even has a helpful drawing by Enders’ sister.</p> \n<p>Then there are the sphincters. One of them we probably all know about – the one we open consciously – but there is also another, inner one, which is operated unconsciously. This <em>ani internus</em> sends a sample into the chamber between the inner and outer sphincter for the sensor cells to analyse and decide if it’s “safe” to fart or poo: “Yes, you’re at home. No, you’re in the office.” If it’s not safe, the sensors send it back in. But, if the inner sphincter is ignored enough times – say, because we are too shy to go to the loo for fear of being overheard – it sulks and can switch off. That’s one of the reasons constipation can occur.</p> \n<p>Enders loves her inner sphincter. “Learning about those two sphincters really changed my perspective on life,” she says. “Those inner nerves don’t care for other people; they have no eyes or ears. Finally, something that only thinks of me! So, now I can go to the toilet anywhere. I worship that muscle!”</p> \n<p>But the gut – and Enders’ book – is about far more than poo (although there is plenty there, about consistency, frequency, buoyancy, colour and laxatives, to keep the most forensic of scatologists happy). Enders’ big thing is bacteria. Our gut, which comprises two-thirds of our immune system, is full of the stuff. Two kilos’ worth, in fact. Our bacteria fight pathogens, are involved in blood-group development, digest our food, extract energy, produce hormones and can affect our mood. This gut/brain connection is a fairly new area of medicine, which Enders is very excited about. And she’s not alone: the American biochemist <a href=\"http://biomedsci.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_descrip.aspx?id=339\">Rob Knight</a> told <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/index.html\">science journal Nature</a> that the field “offered at least as much promise as stem-cell research”.</p> \n<p>“There is an increasing interest in the gut microbiota and health and disease,” confirms Dr Ayesha Akbar, consultant gastroenterologist at <a href=\"http://www.stmarkshospital.org.uk/\">St Mark’s hospital in London</a>. “There is a huge number of gut bacteria which, in health, maintain a balance. However, an imbalance has been linked to many chronic disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease and obesity. There is a suggestion that they may also be linked to psychiatric disorders and mood, with the majority of evidence coming from animal studies. Further research needs to be performed in humans in this area.”</p> \n<p>Enders’ own interest in this link started when she was a new student. She met a man at a party whose breath was “the worst I have ever smelled – almost faecal”. The next day, he killed himself. “Could a diseased gut,” she wonders, “also have affected his psychological state?” She is keen, though, to point out that depressive disorders are multifactorial and not always connected to the gut; much more research is needed. The first human study of the effect of intestinal bacteria on the brain was only conducted only two years ago.</p> \n<p>Enders admits that writing about a possible connection between our psychological state and the gut was “the hardest part of the book for me. A professor would have been scared of putting it in the book, but I feel people are being robbed if they don’t know about this research.”</p> \n<p>As well as some serious issues, there are plenty of entertaining nuggets in the book. Did you know that our spit contains a painkiller more powerful than morphine: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiorphin\">opiorphin</a>? We have it only in minute quantities, so that we’re not off our heads all the time. Eating, though, releases more of the chemical and Enders wonders if this is one factor in comfort eating. And guess what? Your appendix – that bit of people always say is of no use – is actually made entirely of immune tissue and is a veritable larder of the best, most useful bacteria for the gut.</p> \n<p>Enders’ book is full of stuff like this. I hate to say it, but it is the perfect toilet book. Thankfully, it has also been translated into Italian, so that’s Christmas sorted.</p> \n<p><em>Gut: The Inside Story of Our Body’s Most Under-rated Organ by Giulia Enders (Scribe, &pound;14.99).

Swanton told local newspaper the <a href=\"http://www.wacotrib.com/\">Waco Tribune-Herald</a> eight people died at the scene and one died later in hospital.

A 4C global rise by 2100 would entail a sea level rise of between 52cm and 98cm, leading to widespread coastal flooding. There would be widespread risk of animal and plant extinctions and global agriculture would be severely hit. A 4C average would also mask more severe local impacts: the Arctic and western and southern Africa could experience warming up to 10C.</p> \n<p>The Shell document says: “Both our (oceans and mountains) scenarios and the IEA New Policies scenario (and our base case energy demand and outlook) do not limit emissions to be consistent with the back-calculated 450 parts per million (Co2 in the atmosphere) 2 degrees C.”</p> \n<p>It adds: “We also do not see governments taking steps now that are consistent with 2 degrees C scenario.”</p> \n<p>Environmentalists said the presumptions undermine Shell’s ability to talk with authority on climate change.</p> \n<p>Charlie Kronick, climate campaigner at campaign group Greenpeace, said Shell and IEA saw fossil fuels continuing to be burned, with the earth facing temperature rises of 3.7&deg;C or 4&deg;C in the short term, mounting to 6&deg;C later on.</p> \n<p>“What I don’t see is a realisation from Shell about what exactly would happen to its business if climate change escalated dramatically beyond what is safe with all the negative consequences in the world for food and water never mind energy,” said Kronick.</p> \n<p>Louise Rouse, an investor relations specialist and consultant to Greenpeace, said the New Lens document undermined Shell’s claim that ongoing oil and gas exploration helps raise living standards in the developing world by supplying the energy for rapidly expanding economies.</p> \n<p>“There is an incoherence at best between oil companies on the one hand positioning themselves as being on the side of the world’s developing countries and while on the other actively pursuing strategies which will entail catastrophic climate change which we already know is having a significant impact on the global south,” she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/kiln/fuelticker/\" data-alt=\"Fossil fuel ticker\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/kiln/fuelticker/\">Fossil fuel ticker</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Friends of the Earth in the Netherlands, which has carried out its own review of activities by the Anglo-Dutch oil group, said the company often argues that it is moving away from oil towards cleaner gas but has often concentrated on the most carbon intensive forms of gas such as liquefied natural gas. </p> \n<p>Shell’s carbon dioxide emissions have risen in 2014 and are set to increase further as it expands the business through a planned <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/apr/08/shell-bg-group-47bn-takeover-oil-industry\">&pound;47bn takeover of rival BG</a>.</p> \n<p>Shell declined to comment formally on the New Lens scenarios but oil industry experts said they were not meant to be a business blueprint. Instead, they represent “plausible assumptions and quantification” designed to make executives consider events that may be only remotely possible.

According to the latest figures, Wellcome held a stake of &pound;142m in Shell as of September 2014. The Gates Foundation held &pound;6m of Shell’s shares at the time of its latest tax filing in 2013. </p> \n<p>The Anglo-Dutch group said the BG takeover would expand its presence in controversial deep-water activities – many of the planet’s untapped fossil fuel resources are now in ocean regions that are difficult to access – but said it would also increase its presence in liquefied natural gas, a cleaner fossil fuel than oil.</p> \n<p>It added: “By combining BG’s portfolio and skills set with Shell’s capabilities, we can deliver a step change in the growth priorities for both of our companies.

The most prominent of their number, David Davis, likes the label, so it might just stick: shorthand for those Conservatives compelled by a strong belief in civil liberties and the tradition of ancestral freedoms, enshrined in Magna Carta on the meadowed banks of the Thames eight centuries ago.</p> \n<p>As an animating force, this conviction is more than the heritage-loving sentimentalism to which some Tories are indeed prone. In fact, it may be responsible for some of the new government’s most perilous moments in parliament. For a party that needed the Liberal Democrats to govern in its first term, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/live/2015/may/08/election-2015-live-labour-and-libdems-crushed-in-shock-election-result\" title=\"\">to win a 12-seat majority </a>was a historic achievement. But the scale of that achievement does not alter the brute fact: 12 is only 12.</p> \n<p>I have long urged the Cameron camp to make its peace with Davis, who was raised by a single mother on a council estate, is an experienced businessman and personifies the “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-blue-collar-conservatism-tory-tanks-on-labour-lawn\" title=\"\">blue-collar conservatism</a>” that the prime minister now endorses. But Davis has not been forgiven by the Tory leadership for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2008/jun/12/speeches\" title=\"\">resigning his seat in June 2008</a>, over Labour’s plan to extend the maximum period of detention of terror suspects without charge from 28 to 42 days. Seven years on, he fully expects to be at the heart of one of this government’s first significant defeats.</p> \n<p>To set the scene: Michael Gove, the new justice secretary, has been tasked with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/10/conservatives-to-push-forward-on-manifesto-and-scrap-human-rights-act\" title=\"\">fulfilling the Tory manifesto’s pledge to “scrap the Human Rights Act</a>, and introduce a British bill of rights”. Once enacted, the bill “will break the formal link between British courts and the European court of human rights, and make our own supreme court the ultimate arbiter of human rights matters in the UK”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Runnymede Tories believe that Blair and his successors have exploited the fear generated by terrorism to curtail rights</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Runnymede Tories such as Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke (both QCs) are not like the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2013/oct/22/john-major-speech-revenge-on-eurosceptic-bastards\" title=\"\">Eurosceptic “bastards”</a> who made John Major’s life a living hell. They do not operate as a cohesive gang or a whipped party-within-a-party – not yet, anyway. Some, such as Jesse Norman, the Tory MP for Hereford and South Herefordshire, want to keep the Human Rights Act. Others are content for it to be replaced by a British bill of rights – provided the bill is sufficiently robust as a bulwark against the over-mighty state. Meanwhile, Dominic Raab, MP for Esher and Walton, Davis’s former chief of staff and author of the Runnymede Tories’ founding tract, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2009/feb/08/assault-on-liberty-review\" title=\"\">The Assault on Liberty (2009)</a>, has been made a justice minister. Has he been bought off by Big Brother, or do the Tory civil libertarians now have a man on the inside?</p> \n<p>All parties are always, to a greater or lesser degree, split, often around many axes. For decades, the Conservatives were divided into “wets” and “dries”, then “Eurosceptics” and “Europhiles”, then socially liberal “mods” and morally upright “rockers”. These bifurcations persist. But the argument that is most intriguing and most fissile today is between the Runnymede Tories and those Conservatives who dislike the human rights industry, or the specifically European variety, or intellectual abstractions in general. The left are natural dialecticians. Most Tories think “dialecticians” are the people you phone when the fuses blow.</p> \n<p>Why has a significant minority of Conservatives become exercised by the risk to civil liberties, and why now? This generation of Conservative parliamentarians was shaped by New Labour, not the cold war. They watched Tony Blair and Gordon Brown regulate, intrude and nurture the nanny state, often in collaboration with Brussels. They fretted as political ambition was given rocket boosters by technology. The new gods were digital, omniscient, swooping through the stratosphere, recording anyone and&nbsp;anything they chose. In the end, Big&nbsp;Brother had come not in the form of “a boot stamping on a human face” but in gigabytes of data unwittingly given by&nbsp;the citizen.</p> \n<p>Related to this is the profound schism within Conservative ranks over the western response to 9/11 and subsequent jihadi attacks. When Blair said after the 7/7 atrocities that “the rules of the game have changed”, many Tories agreed (there are shy neo-cons too, you know). Gove was their natural tribune. In <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/jun/06/michael-gove-trojan-horse-islam\" title=\"\">his book Celsius 7/7</a> he wrote (correctly, in my view): “When a senior law lord such as Leonard Hoffmann can say of attempts to restrain the liberty of Islamist ideologues that ‘the real threat to the life of the nation comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these’, then we know we are living in a land that has still not woken up to the challenge we face.”</p> \n<p>Runnymede Tories, in contrast, believe that Blair and his successors have exploited the fear generated by terrorism to curtail rights and augment state power. For them, human rights are both profoundly precious and profoundly British. In 1951, after all, Britain became the first country to ratify the European convention – a text that had been heralded by Churchill and (mostly) drafted by the former Conservative attorney general David Maxwell Fyfe. For Conservatives of this stripe, the convention’s roots, furthermore, lie in the common law of this country and what Burke called the “recorded” rights etched into countless judgments of English courts. They are to be found in the 1689 bill of rights, in Blackstone, and in the work of more recent jurists such as AV Dicey.</p> \n<p>There are serious practical barriers to the scrapping of the Human Rights Act, not least the extent to which it is embedded in devolution legislation and the Good Friday agreement. But the technical aspects of the problem are the least of it. A folk memory of Magna Carta has been awoken that will not galvanise every Tory MP but is strong enough to give the government whips <a href=\"http://www.migrainetrust.org/factsheet-hemicrania-continua-10920\" title=\"\">Magna Hemicrania</a> (look it up).</p> \n<p>As I wrote last week, if anyone has the intellectual firepower to square all the circles it is Gove. He will also need political guile, and confidence that David Cameron will stand by him when things get sticky, which they will. Unfortunately, the justice secretary cannot take this for granted. The manner in which Gove was moved from the Department for Education for doing precisely what he had been tasked to do is one of the worst blemishes on Cameron’s record.</p> \n<p>This is precisely the sort of issue that might unite the opposition parties – so that every single Conservative vote will count. As things stand, the Runnymede Tories would defeat any bid to ditch the Human Rights Act with support to spare. That’s life with a small majority for you. Welcome back to reality, prime minister.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431878003249/David-Davis-with-David-Ca-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"David Davis, who resigned his seat in 2008 in protest over Labour's record on civil liberties, is the most prominent of the Runnymede Tories.
