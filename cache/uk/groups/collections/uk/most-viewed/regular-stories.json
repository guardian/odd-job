It would involve “a fundamental shift in the way UK broadcasting is regulated”, moving away from the current framework of post-transmission regulation which takes account of freedom of expression, he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4f5a1812e09301317d80c52e20c5644f16d781c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432235143706/54279019-ae46-4762-a6bc-8c85029ca9ea-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"First page of Sajid Javid's letter to the prime minister\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"249fc43b7ea24778be6cf2767b3d080ff3050b7a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432235285737/1dd172c8-4be6-480b-9c88-4cfd1e18beba-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Second page of Sajid Javid's letter to the prime minister.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sajid Javid’s letter to the prime minister.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The leaked memo from the then culture secretary came in response to a request made by May on 6 March to ministers on the cabinet’s home affairs committee and the national security committee. She was seeking clearance for publication of her extremism strategy, which included the broadcasters’ censorship proposal. <br /></p> \n<p>It is not clear exactly what the outcome was following Javid’s objection. Next week’s Queen’s speech is expected include loosely specified powers to “strengthen the role of Ofcom to take action against channels which broadcast extremist content” according to a statement released by Downing Street last week.</p> \n<p>The home secretary last hinted at her wish to see the introduction of pre-broadcast banning powers in the immediate aftermath of the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich two years ago, when Conservative MPs expressed strong criticism of a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2013/may/24/bbc-channel-4-anjem-choudary\">BBC Newsnight interview with the radical Islamist activist Anjem Choudary</a>.<br /></p> \n<p>May questioned what the BBC was doing in interviewing Choudary and said the government had to look at the role of Ofcom in relation to “what is being beamed into people’s homes”. But when the prime minister’s extremism task force reported in December 2013, it did not include any moves towards pre-broadcast censorship and the subject was presumed to have been dropped.</p> \n<p>At the time the idea was compared to Margaret Thatcher’s move to tell broadcasters to deny terrorists the “oxygen of publicity”, which led to a full-scale row over a BBC decision to broadcast an extended interview with Martin McGuinness. That led to a journalists’ strike and, two years later, the resignation of the director general.</p> \n<p>In Javid’s letter, dated 12 March, the minister voiced his concern about the risk that the revived censorship proposal would be used “otherwise than intended, not least given the difficulty of defining extremism, and the consequent likelihood of the government being seen to be interfering with freedom of speech without sufficient justification”.<br /></p> \n<p>Javid even went as far as adding: “It should be noted that other countries with a pre-transmission regulatory regime are not known for their compliance with rights relating to freedom of expression and government may not wish to be associated with such regimes.” </p> \n<p>Objections from Javid and to a lesser extent from other senior Conservative cabinet ministers, including Eric Pickles, Theresa Villiers, Nicky Morgan and Chris Grayling, prevented the home secretary from publishing her extremism strategy, A Stronger Britain, before the election. The Javid leak undermines claims that it was the Lib Dems alone who blocked May’s extremism strategy in the coalition.<br /></p> \n<p>Last week’s Downing Street statement also confirmed there will be legislation to introduce new banning orders for extremist organisations, and extremism-disruption orders to “combat groups and individuals who reject our values and promote messages of hate”, which will deny their access to the airwaves and to social media.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94788bacd4f3a5a7deb9c6dc8a392fe146a94eb6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432235915196/c1a41cce-cb86-4c3f-bcaf-1215e8f308a2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Theresa May first voiced concerns about extremist views on television in the wake of the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in 2013.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May first voiced concerns about extremist views on television in the wake of the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in 2013.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>May has already revealed plans to require the Home Office “extremism analysis unit” to set out clearly for the first time which individuals and organisations the government and public sector should or should not engage with: “This will make sure nobody unwittingly lends legitimacy or credibility to extremists or extremist organisations.”</p> \n<p>The commitment to produce legislation giving Ofcom a stronger role to take action against channels which broadcast extremist content suggests next week’s Queen’s speech will go much further than simply keeping its powers under regular review.<br /></p> \n<p>Ofcom, Javid’s letter said, already has strict rules to ensure that material that is likely to “incite hatred” is not broadcast on radio, television or in on-demand programmes. He says Ofcom has already taken “robust action against UK broadcasters which have breached these rules”.</p> \n<p>The minister told the PM: “However, Ofcom does not have the powers to approve programmes before they are broadcast and nor do we consider that it should have these powers as has been proposed in paragraph 111 of the strategy. </p> \n<p>“Extending Ofcom’s powers to enable it to take pre-emptive action would move it from its current position as a post-transmission regulator into the role of censor.”</p> \n<p>The then culture secretary said he was unable to agree to the publication of May’s extremism strategy with the wording in paragraph 111 and suggested it be replaced with a paragraph setting out the previously agreed position that Ofcom’s powers be kept under regular review.</p> \n<p>The Home Office said they refused to comment on leaked ministerial documents.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/68f872c06c906f721dba613553808aabd46d59b8/0_69_2540_1524/2540.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1524,"width":2540,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Stefan Wermuth/REUTERS","altText":"Sajid Javid","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/REUTERS"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432235145483/54279019-ae46-4762-a6bc-8c85029ca9ea-1360x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1360,"orientation":"portrait","credit":"Guardian","altText":"First page of Sajid Javid's letter to the prime minister"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432235287213/1dd172c8-4be6-480b-9c88-4cfd1e18beba-1360x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1360,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Sajid Javid’s letter to the prime minister.","credit":"Guardian","altText":"Second page of Sajid Javid's letter to the prime minister.","cleanCaption":"Sajid Javid’s letter to the prime minister."},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432235916437/c1a41cce-cb86-4c3f-bcaf-1215e8f308a2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Theresa May first voiced concerns about extremist views on television in the wake of the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in 2013.

Vera Farmiga, who’s roughly Ryder’s age, plays his adult daughter.</p> \n<h2>2. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/nov/13/third-person-liam-neeson-james-franco-film-review\">Third Person </a>(2013)</h2> \n<p>While 2011 delivered Unknown, an action vehicle starring Liam Neeson (then 58), who tries to save his wife (January Jones, then 33), Third Person takes the cake with the pairing of Neeson (61) and Olivia Wilde (29), who plays his “lover” (terrible word), Anna. That’s a full January Jones-in-Unknown between them.</p> \n<h2>3. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2012/feb/09/casablanca-review\">Casablanca</a> (1942)</h2> \n<p>Truth: 1942’s tale of 41-year-old Humphrey Bogart reconciling his relationship with 27-year-old Ingrid Bergman is the stuff of classic cinema dreams. Is Casablanca a brilliant treasure? Of course. But it still doesn’t mean we shouldn’t acknowledge that the age difference exists, and should be indicative of that era, not our own.</p> \n<h2>4. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/sep/21/magic-in-moonlight-review-sweet-natured-contrivance\">Magic in the Moonlight</a> (2014)</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"278dd7642261685e7758da511d0b2b4b4d60cb9e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432232444060/cde578f3-5419-4fe0-8940-710dddf89e5f-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Emma Stone and Colin Firth in Magic in the Moonlight.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Stone and Colin Firth in Magic in the Moonlight.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Sony Pictures Classis/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Arguably, we could include a number of selections from Woody Allen’s filmography, but 2014’s Magic in the Moonlight takes the cake. With an age difference of 28 years between leads Emma Stone and Colin Firth, it’s one in a long line of Allen-curated young woman/older man dynamics. The next? 2015’s Irrational Man, starring Joaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone, with an age difference of 14 years. The twist? He plays her professor. (So at least the power imbalance will be complete.)</p> \n<h2>5. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/jun/01/edge-of-tomorrow-review-tom-cruise-emily-blunt-born-again-blockbuster\">Edge of Tomorrow </a>(2014)</h2> \n<p>Edge of Tomorrow was an underrated movie that saw then 31-year-old Emily Blunt break out and take charge of an action narrative formerly reserved for her co-star, then 51-year-old Cruise. (The nickname “Full Metal Bitch” is truly the stuff of dreams.) In fact, for most of the film, it seemed the two would coexist as friends as opposed to romantic interests, but by the end, it seemed like Cruise’s character was more than willing to overlook that 20-year age gap.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://deadline.com/2015/04/sarah-wright-cast-in-tom-cruises-mena-barkhad-abdi-joins-the-wolf-who-cried-boy-1201405321/\">Kind of like what he’ll be doing alongside 31-year-old Sarah Wright Olsen</a> in the upcoming Mena.</p> \n<h2>6.

The clincher? Complete opposites, they’re stranded on a desert island. (So you can probably guess the rest.)</p> \n<h2>7. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2012/may/10/dark-shadows-review\">Dark Shadows </a>(2012)</h2> \n<p>Johnny Depp’s characters are clearly going through something: in 1999, the 36-year-old was paired up with 19-year-old Christina Ricci in Sleepy Hollow. In 2006 (at 43) Depp romanced 21-year-old Keira Knightley in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest. And in 2011, he co-starred with 25-year-old Amber Heard, now his wife, in The Rum Diary. However, in 2012, 48-year-old Depp hooked up on screen with 24-year-old Bella Heathcote in Dark Shadows. And despite the Victorian era being a very different time, it just felt like more of the same old (and not old at all).</p> \n<h2>8.<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2012/jul/12/seeking-friend-end-world-review\"> Seeking a Friend for the End of the World </a>(2012)</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b05d42acea458185374c1538231bb50718b8d28\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432233397459/a874400e-0c2b-43c2-9d0a-c8384afe6127-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Seeking a Friend for the End of the World\" width=\"435\" height=\"261\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sparks are flying in Seeking a Friend for the End of the World.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Let’s give Steve Carell and this 2012 black comedy credit: Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is less about falling in love &agrave; la Autumn in New York than it is about self-discovery. But casting directors still felt the need to pair the nearly 50-year-old Foxcatcher star with a then 27-year-old Keira Knightley who was great, but also more than 20 years younger than him. </p> \n<h2>9. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian/0,,44316,00.html\">A Perfect Murder </a>(1999)</h2> \n<p>Michael Douglas arguably attends the same school as Johnny Depp in that he has a long history of working with young co-stars. However, one-upping 1998’s Don’t Say A Word (in which he’s 20 years older than his on-screen wife, Famke Janssen) was 2001’s A Perfect Murder in which the veteran actor is married to Gwyneth Paltrow, who’s 28 years his junior.

Twenty years on, this column finds itself impossibly tantalised by dreams of another explosive double act, and demands you see the following two words in six-foot-high letters: MENSCH. HOPKINS.</p> \n<p>How is it possible that these two extraordinary talents have never worked together? In a world – <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InAWorld\" title=\"\"><em>in a world</em></a> – where control of the discourse has basically been ceded to four daytime TV bookers and anyone willing to monster a kid on Twitter, the fact that no one has been able to put together a deal that could appeal to Louise Mensch and Katie Hopkins is nothing short of a cultural scandal.</p> \n<p>Both are very much available. Louise is the former Tory MP who retired from parliament in 2012 because she could never top her spectacularly hilarious performance in the phone-hacking select committee hearings, where she explained to James Murdoch that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/phone-hacking/8879696/Phone-hacking-inquiry-live.html\" title=\"\">she had to leave early to pick her kids up</a>. “I believe we have children the same age,” she smiled at James (who disappointingly failed to reply: “Yeah, I’m a bit tied up with work at this precise moment – speak to my nanny about playdates.”)</p> \n<p>Louise now lives in Manhattan, where she starts each day with a wistful musical number entitled “When will America notice me?” in which she sings the chorus at her reflection in one of those novelty Time magazine mirrors that <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/2392606025569715/\" title=\"\">makes her look like she is on the cover</a>, before sitting down to her computer for 18 hours’ frantic tweeting about something or other, in a city widely held as one of the most exciting in the world. New York, New York, so good they made her spend half the week twatting on and on at some kid from Merseyside. Yes, this is the business about <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/may/19/louise-mensch-founder-twitter-abby-tomlinson-sun\" title=\"\">Louise’s alleged bullying of a 17-year-old girl who was something to do with the Milifandom thing</a>. If you need more info, her latest utterance on the subject at time of going to press was a <a href=\"http://unfashionista.com/2015/05/21/bullyfandom-was-twcuddleston-harassed/\" title=\"\">4,000-word blogpost</a> – 4,000! Jeez, Louise – I think the Sunday Times did thalidomide in less than that.</p> \n<p>As for Katie, the so-called Queen of Mean remains the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2013/jul/18/katie-hopkins-queen-of-conflict\" title=\"\">villain of choice for talentless talent bookers</a>, but has already ticked off appearances on most of the first-, second- and third-tier reality shows. I imagine Katie deals with the “quiet” weeks with the self-awareness of Withnail, who dismissed the idea of a bad patch with the retort: “Rubbish! Haven’t seen Gielgud down the labour exchange.” This week found her insulting a child with autism for reasons I&nbsp;can’t be bothered to look up. The point is: there are windows in her schedule.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, you just know that there will be producers pitching ideas designed to take Katie on some kind of vision quest, probably via some terrible shit-out-of-water format in which she’s confronted with her prejudices and encouraged to grow. But if you’d rather watch yourself be disembowelled than tune in to Katie Hopkins’ Migrant Journeys, might I suggest some programme ideas with the added benefit of pairing our emergent icons?</p> \n<h2><strong>Katie and Louise</strong></h2> \n<p>Inspired by the movie Thelma and Louise, this drama has two obvious heroines, but is expected to make a breakout star of the cliff edge used in its final scene. (Anyway, post-Broadchurch and Poldark, you can’t get commissioned without a cliff.) After Katie calls a child a “fat Nazi” in self-defence, she and Louise are forced to go on the run in some sort of objectionable car – probably a Range Rover Evoque. Owing to a series of unspecified previous controversies, they can’t drive through half the counties that would permit a direct route to freedom, and have to navigate a&nbsp;roundabout path via various telly sofas and media platforms. Throughout this inexorably doomed journey they are pursued by a sensitive cop, played by Leslie Grantham.</p> \n<h2><strong>Mastershit</strong></h2> \n<p>With “conflict” and&nbsp;social media typhoonery now the holy grail of all televisual enterprise, it&nbsp;was inevitable the BBC would find itself here for the third part of its highly acclaimed Master trilogy, which also includes Mastermind and MasterChef. Mastershit, AKA the Great British Hate-off, pits Hopkins and Mensch against one another in a&nbsp;series of gruelling rounds designed to crown one or other of them – but most likely Katie – Britain’s Most Controversial.</p> \n<p>These include the minor round, which seeks to establish which of these two over-40-year-olds can be most lavishly unpleasant to someone under the age of 18, and the specialist subject round. Louise’s area of expertise is Jewish history, inspired by the time she declared herself implacably opposed to anyone who used the term Zionist. Even <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl\" title=\"\">Theodor Herzl</a>, wondered someone. “Who?” Louise <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/08/18/louise-mensch-theodor-herzl-zionist-twitter_n_5688177.html\" title=\"\">hit back</a>. “If he uses Zionist, then yes. Cheap code word for Jew. Antisemitism. Not having it.” Katie’s <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/katie-hopkins-when-is-enough-enough-10186490.html\" title=\"\">specialist skill</a>, meanwhile, is listening to an interlocutor read&nbsp;out a series of phrases and identifying whether they originated in her published output or the Nuremberg Laws.</p> \n<h2><strong>Hearts of Darkness</strong></h2> \n<p>As any regular readers of this column will know, in the years BD (Before Downton), there was one rule to ITV Sunday-night drama. Anything in the 8pm timeslot had to either have the word “heart” in the title, or be part of what we might respectfully call the Heartbeat universe. The first category included things such as Where the Heart Is and Wild at Heart, while Heartbeat – the overlap in our Venn diagram – spawned 60s hospital drama The Royal. The Royal itself would go on to spawn The Royal Today. Anyway, Hearts of Darkness revives this golden era of broadcasting. Premise? Katie and Louise play palliative care nurses. Drama ensues. It’s set somewhere rural – obviously somewhere with a cliff – which allows for gorgeous aerial shots to make up for any gaping plot holes. Maybe Dover. Yes, it’s a palliative care hospice on the white cliffs of Dover. We’ll thrash out the rest later, but I can tell you now that it features vigilante border patrols and a permanently appalled Pam Ferris.</p> \n<h2><strong>Hopkins &amp; Mensch</strong></h2> \n<p>Or Mensch &amp; Hopkins – their agents can fight about the billing. The key thing is, it’s a buddy cop show in which two strong characters are thrown together and forced to solve&nbsp;a crime. Crucially, of course, these are lady cops, with all the investigative drawbacks that implies – namely, they can’t just crack a case by going to one of their <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tom&amp;defid=1485786\" title=\"\">toms</a> for a tip-off and a freebie. In fact, for the first few episodes, the investigation seems to be going nowhere, mainly because every time they get a suspect into custody, DS Mensch releases them without charge on the basis that she has to go and pick up her kids. But as the series advances, the pair’s working partnership gels to devastating effect, and their mastery of the classic “bad cop, bad&nbsp;cop” routine culminates in an interrogation scene so extreme it will never leave you.

The woman, who cannot be named, was 17 when a man raped her in Winchester in April 2012 after a night out with friends. Her mother reported the attack hours later and the victim told officers her T-shirt may contain her attacker’s DNA.</p> \n<p>But the garment was never sent for forensic testing and weeks later the girl, who has mental health problems, was accused of lying about the rape and arrested for perverting the course of justice. During the arrest, one detective told her: “This is what happens when you lie.”</p> \n<p>Documents seen by the Guardian reveal that detectives from Hampshire police decided within two days of the rape report that the girl was lying. A detective inspector, who was supervising the inquiry, told a junior colleague: “Fucking nick her.”</p> \n<p>But six months later – after a complaint by the girl’s mother about her treatment – a new team of officers reviewed the investigation and informed the mother and her daughter that they believed her. The T-shirt was sent for testing, and the suspect, Liam Foard, was tried and found guilty. <br /></p> \n<p>Hampshire police have apologised to the family and admitted liability for false imprisonment and assault. The force accepted there was a breach of its duties under the Human Rights Act to properly investigate the rape.</p> \n<p>The victim’s mother said: “I’m glad that they had admitted they were wrong, but how many time does it have to happen? If it can happen to my daughter, how many more can it happen to?” She said her daughter had yet to receive an apology in person.</p> \n<p>Four officers faced disciplinary action after an internal investigation by the Hampshire force’s professional standards department. Three avoided any sanction after they retired or resigned, and the fourth was given a written warning.</p> \n<p>Debaleena Dasgupta, the young woman’s lawyer, said: “Many people wrongly assume the police have a legal obligation to investigate crimes. However, the only way victims of crime can seek justice for these sorts of issues is using the Human Rights Act, which imposes a duty on the police to properly investigate very serious offences.”</p> \n<p>In the days after the rape, the girl was attacked twice in the local area and called a “pathetic rape victim”. The police investigated both incidents but no further action was taken. Eight weeks after her rape complaint, on June 22 2012, the girl was asked to come to a police station, where she was told she was under arrest for perverting the course of justice.</p> \n<p>“I just thought, ‘What the hell is going on?’” her mother said. “I knew what perverting the course of justice meant, so I knew they were arresting her for lying about the rape. So at that time my daughter had just turned 18 and I insisted because of mental health problems that I sit in on the interview.</p> \n<p>“She [my daughter] tried to run away – she just couldn’t believe it. And she did put up a fight in the police station.”</p> \n<p>After her arrest, the girl was on police bail for months while Hampshire police consulted the Crown Prosecution Service about whether to charge her. “It was horrible, because it was like she might have gone to prison. And what would she do, how would she cope, how would I cope, how would the family cope?” her mother said. She added that her daughter’s mental health deteriorated as they waited for the charging decision, and that she began self-harming and attempted suicide twice.</p> \n<p>“She was upset because she couldn’t believe that they couldn’t believe that it could happen to her,” the mother said. “We didn’t find out until a later date that they hadn’t done the forensics on the clothes. And that was partly the decision to arrest her, for perverting the course of justice.”</p> \n<p>In October, on the day the teenager was due to answer bail, two officers visited mother and daughter at their home. “They told me that my daughter didn’t need to go to the police station to answer bail and that they now believed her story and they would now be taking over the investigation,” said her mother. “I remember standing in the living room saying, ‘They believe you, they believe you.’ She didn’t believe it. She had lost all faith in them by then.”</p> \n<p>Documents from Hampshire police confirm that when forensic tests were finally carried out on the T-shirt, seminal fluid and DNA from the suspect were detected. The police documents state: “This was particularly significant as when interviewed for rape, Liam Foard denied any sexual contact with her.” Foard was convicted of rape in September 2013 at Winchester crown court and jailed for six years. <br /></p> \n<p>An internal investigation by the force’s professional standards department highlighted the impact of her arrest on the young woman. It said: “Given that she had been raped, reported the matter to the police and now found herself under arrest and being accused of lying, this must have been a particularly traumatic experience. Clearly, had the rape investigation been completed to the required standard, she would never have been arrested and interviewed.”</p> \n<p>Chief Superintendent David Powell, head of Prevention and Neighbourhoods at Hampshire police, said: “We accept the way we initially treated this victim fell well below the standard we would expect. We deeply regret this and we took action at the time by referring this case to our professional standards department.</p> \n<p>“We have changed our internal processes and any decision by an investigating officer to discontinue a rape investigation or release a suspect with no further action has to be agreed by an independent panel chaired by an assistant chief constable.</p> \n<p>“I would like to reassure all victims of sexual assault that we do take you seriously. We do believe you, we appreciate how hard it is to come forward to report these offences, we do not judge you and we are committed to ensuring a professional and supportive response. We are doing everything to ensure we never have an initial response like this again.”</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432228696135/ce1ec894-1579-418d-ab29-cb2b44abfdcd-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Gareth Fuller/PA","altText":"Rape victim","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-22T05:00:05Z","lastModified":"2015-05-22T06:11:55Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Sandra Laville","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sandralaville"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Rape","Law","UK news","Society","Police"],"tags":[{"id":"society/rape","webTitle":"Rape"},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"uk/police","webTitle":"Police"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sandra Laville","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sandralaville"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/may/22/victim-falsely-accused-of-lying-by-uk-hampshire-police-wins-payout","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/495fm","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/may/22/victim-falsely-accused-of-lying-by-uk-hampshire-police-wins-payout","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/22/victim-falsely-accused-of-lying-by-uk-hampshire-police-wins-payout"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432228696135/ce1ec894-1579-418d-ab29-cb2b44abfdcd-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A rape victim was falsely accused of lying about attack to police.
