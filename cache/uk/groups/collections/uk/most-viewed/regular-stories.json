We are sorry if some people have found this distressing.”</p> \n<p>Michieletto has assembled an all-star cast for the production, including American tenor John Osborn, Canadian baritone Gerald Finley and Swedish soprano Malin Bystrom, with ROH music director Antonio Pappano conducting.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xMh8oIPanY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1xMh8oIPanY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Guillaume Tell trailer. \n  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1xMh8oIPanY\">Link to video</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> Osborn, who plays a Swiss patriot torn between his love of his country and his love for Bystrom’s Austrian Princess Mathilde, said that perhaps the controversial scene went on longer than necessary.</p> \n<p> “Maybe it went a little longer than it should have, but it happened and I think it’s an element you can use to show just how horrible these people were that were occupying this town,” he said.</p> \n<p> Michieletto said he had no intention of changing anything. “If you don’t feel the brutality, the suffering these people have had to face, if you want to hide it, it becomes soft, it becomes for children,” he said backstage after the boos had died down following the final curtain.</p> \n<p>Reaction continued after the performance:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/larkingrumple/statuses/615634334528184320\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ROH Guillaume Tell: Chandelier.

Reuters has some details of what would have been in it for the Greeks:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p data-dropid=\"2\">The offer published on Sunday incorporated a proposal from Greece that would set value-added tax rates on hotels at 13 percent, rather than at 23 percent as originally planned in the lenders’ proposals. It was not immediately clear whether there would be any additional changes.</p> \n <p data-dropid=\"3\">If the offer were accepted, the euro zone finance ministers could adopt a statement saying that a 2012 pledge to consider stretching out loan maturities, lowering interest rates and extending an interest payment moratorium on euro zone loans to Greece would be implemented in October.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p data-dropid=\"3\">In a sign that battle lines continue to be drawn EU leaders have turned Sunday’s proposed referendum into an in/out vote on Greece’s position in the euro<strong>,</strong> when it is clearly about the creditors proposal, but given that polls appear to suggest a majority of the Greek population would prefer to stay in the euro, it suits the narrative of the EU to peddle that particular line. </p> \n <p data-dropid=\"4\"> In fact EU Commission President Juncker strayed a little too far into the realms of bad taste yesterday, urging the Greek population not to commit suicide by voting No, which in a country that has seen suicides soar as a result of EU policies, was crassly insensitive, and could well turn out to be a massive own goal, if the vote is indecisive. Maybe that explains last night’s late move to make a fresh attempt at trying to reach a deal by the EU Commission President, but in any event the deal was rebuffed by the Greek PM, with the only concession appearing to be on VAT for hotels being held down at 13%, instead of raised to 23%.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Worries about the chaos in Greece hit stock markets yesterday, with the FTSE 100 down nearly 2% and French and German markets down 3%.<br /></p> \n<p>Asian markets <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/30/asian-markets-creep-up-as-the-euro-sags-in-deepening-greek-crisis\">edged up overnight </a>but European markets are expected to open lower once more.

What has become clear is that lenders don’t trust Tsipras, they want him out and he is right when he says the differences are ideological, it is no longer just about him.” </p> \n <p data-dropid=\"7\">Tsipras may be trapped in his referendum gambit but creditors had also made several mistakes, Memis said. </p> \n <p data-dropid=\"8\"> “Tactically speaking they were totally wrong not to accept the 47-page list of proposals the government made last week. Had they accepted it and Tsipras tried to implement it, six months later his government would have collapsed, he would have gone.” </p> \n <p data-dropid=\"9\">Greeks are waiting with baited breath for the release of several opinion polls that will reflect just where the country stands, psephologically, on the “no,” “yes” vote. “Things will become much clearer and move a lot faster when the polls come out later today and tomorrow,” said Memis. </p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-559259e3e4b01275a173c21f","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-30T08:57:24Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T08:57:32Z","body":"<p>And could those talks in fact actually take place after all?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EKourtali/statuses/615805002406166528\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Greek government is thinking of returning to the negotiating table by tonight, Greek media report</p>— Eleftheria Kourtali (@EKourtali) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EKourtali/status/615805002406166528\">June 30, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-5592582de4b01275a173c213","title":"EU attempting to open new talks with Greece","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-30T08:53:11Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T08:58:04Z","body":"<p>Attempts are being made to get Athens back to the negotiating table, according to Austrian finance minister Hans Joerg Schelling.</p> \n<p>But he said he was not very optimistic about the possibility of holding further talks with Greece. </p> \n<p>The comments came after EC president Jean-Claude Juncker made a last-minute offer to Athens to reach an agreement before the bailout deadline ends later today.</p> \n<p>“Attempts are taking place to hold further talks.

Many have been saying that if Greece does not pay the €1.6bn due to the International Monetary Fund by tonight’s deadline that does not count.</strong> Gary Jenkins, chief credit strategist at LNG Capital, is not so sure:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p data-dropid=\"1\">Greece is due to pay the IMF today. It appears that they will not make the payment. There has been lots of talk that this is not really a default. Indeed the rating agencies have stated that they would not consider a non-payment as a default. All I can say on this matter is that if you do not pay the absolute last lender of resort I think that’s a default.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>We’ll see how the markets take it when it happens (as seems inevitable). On the referendum, Jenkins says:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p data-dropid=\"2\">My take on it is that if the Greek people vote ‘No’ to the proposals that Mr Tsipras may feel vindicated and insist upon a new round of negotiation. However the probable damage done to the economy by recent events will make this a largely Pyrrhic victory. It is possible that the Institutions will restart negotiations but it is equally likely that they would indeed regard such a result as a step towards exit from the Eurozone. I’m leaning towards more negotiations but with little additional support from the ECB so more damage to the economy.</p> \n <p data-dropid=\"3\"> If the Greek people vote ‘Yes’ then it is difficult to see how Mr Tsipras can remain as Prime Minister. Under this scenario a new government is likely to be formed that will accept the Institutions terms which I guess may be eased somewhat to reflect the new economic conditions and to try and build a new relationship between the parties.</p> \n <p data-dropid=\"4\"> So whilst the impact upon the market on Day 1 has been less than feared that is not to say that we will not see further weakness over the coming days. The market may have been taking comfort from all of the opinion polls that have taken place in Greece over the last few years showing that the Greek people wanted to stay in the Eurozone at pretty much any cost. However all of these polls were taken before the call for a referendum. Certainly I would expect a ‘No’ vote to be met with significant volatility in peripheral government bonds amid the classic flight to quality.</p> \n <p data-dropid=\"5\"> This is clearly now a fast moving situation and it is still by unclear as to how it will play out. As an old credit analyst my instinct therefore is to be cautious and wait to see what the weekend brings. Next Monday could be a much worse day for peripheral debt than yesterday was if the ‘No’ vote wins.</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-55924354e4b0e31832956e17","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-30T07:21:24Z","body":"<p>Not that we thought they had but:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TradeDesk_Steve/statuses/615781204856418304\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Russia Reiterates Greece Hasn't Applied For Financial Aid: RIA</p>— Steve Collins (@TradeDesk_Steve) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TradeDesk_Steve/status/615781204856418304\">June 30, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-55923fb4e4b0e31832956e0e","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-30T07:08:06Z","body":"<p>European markets edge lower in early trading</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23e1b4f893969f80d2726882496bd78619b91426\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435648058988/00cc1bb6-c524-4433-9e85-7902aa44bc2e-460x51.png\" alt=\"Markets dip in early trading.\" width=\"460\" height=\"51\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Markets dip in early trading.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-55923e97e4b0e31832956e0c","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-30T07:01:49Z","body":"<p>If Greece does default on its payment to the IMF it will be following an historical precedent.

In fact, European leaders are finally beginning to reveal the true nature of the ongoing debt dispute, and the answer is not pleasant: it is about power and democracy much more than money and economics.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/live/2015/jun/29/greek-crisis-stock-markets-slide-capital-controls-banks-closed-live\">Greece debt crisis: Europe says referendum is euro vs drachma - live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Of course, the economics behind the programme that the “troika” (the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund) foisted on Greece five years ago has been abysmal, resulting in a 25% decline in the country’s GDP. I can think of no depression, ever, that has been so deliberate and had such catastrophic consequences: Greece’s rate of youth unemployment, for example, now exceeds 60%.</p> \n<p>It is startling that the troika has refused to accept responsibility for any of this or admit how bad its forecasts and models have been. But what is even more surprising is that Europe’s leaders have not even <em>learned</em>. The troika is <em>still </em>demanding that Greece achieve a primary budget surplus (excluding interest payments) of 3.5% of GDP by 2018.</p> \n<p>Economists around the world have condemned that target as punitive, because aiming for it will inevitably result in a deeper downturn. Indeed, even if Greece’s debt is restructured beyond anything imaginable, the country will remain in depression if voters there commit to the troika’s target in the snap referendum to be held this weekend.</p> \n<p>In terms of transforming a large primary deficit into a surplus, few countries have accomplished anything like what the Greeks have achieved in the last five years. And, though the cost in terms of human suffering has been extremely high, the Greek government’s recent proposals went a long way toward meeting its creditors’ demands.</p> \n<p>We should be clear: almost none of the huge amount of money loaned to Greece has actually gone there. It has gone to pay out private-sector creditors – including German and French banks. Greece has gotten but a pittance, but it has paid a high price to preserve these countries’ banking systems. The IMF and the other “official” creditors do not need the money that is being demanded. Under a business-as-usual scenario, the money received would most likely just be lent out again to Greece.</p> \n<p>But, again, it’s not about the money. It’s about using “deadlines” to force Greece to knuckle under, and to accept the unacceptable – not only austerity measures, but other regressive and punitive policies.</p> \n<p>But why would Europe do this? Why are European Union leaders resisting the referendum and refusing even to extend by a few days the June 30 deadline for Greece’s next payment to the IMF? Isn’t Europe all about democracy?</p> \n<p>In January, Greece’s citizens voted for a government committed to <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/greece-government-reforms-by-yanis-varoufakis-2015-05\">ending austerity</a>. If the government were simply fulfilling its campaign promises, it would already have rejected the proposal. But it wanted to give Greeks a chance to weigh in on this issue, so critical for their country’s future wellbeing.</p> \n<p>That concern for popular legitimacy is incompatible with the politics of the eurozone, which was never a very democratic project. Most of its members’ governments did not seek their people’s approval to turn over their monetary sovereignty to the ECB. When Sweden’s did, Swedes said no. They understood that unemployment would rise if the country’s monetary policy were set by a central bank that focused single-mindedly on inflation (and also that there would be insufficient attention to financial stability). The economy would suffer, because the economic model underlying the eurozone was predicated on power relationships that disadvantaged workers.</p> \n<p>And, sure enough, what we are seeing now, 16 years after the eurozone institutionalised those relationships, is the antithesis of democracy: many European leaders want to see the end of prime minister Alexis Tsipras’ leftist government. After all, it is extremely inconvenient to have in Greece a government that is so opposed to the types of policies that have done so much to increase inequality in so many advanced countries, and that is so committed to curbing the unbridled power of wealth. They seem to believe that they can eventually bring down the Greek government by bullying it into accepting an agreement that contravenes its mandate.</p> \n<p>It is hard to advise Greeks how to vote on 5 July. Neither alternative – approval or rejection of the troika’s terms – will be easy, and both carry huge risks. A yes vote would mean depression almost without end. Perhaps a depleted country – one that has sold off all of its assets, and whose bright young people have emigrated – might <em>finally </em>get debt forgiveness; perhaps, having shrivelled into a middle-income economy, Greece might <em>finally </em>be able to get assistance from the World Bank. All of this might happen in the next decade, or perhaps in the decade after that.</p> \n<p>By contrast, a no vote would at least open the possibility that Greece, with its strong democratic tradition, might grasp its destiny in its own hands. Greeks might gain the opportunity to <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/new-beginning-for-greece-eurozone-exit-by-dennis-j--snower-2015-06\">shape a future</a> that, though perhaps not as prosperous as the past, is far more hopeful than the unconscionable torture of the present.</p> \n<p>I know how I would vote.</p> \n<p><strong><em>Joseph E.

First on the scene would be one of the hundreds of armed officers who routinely patrol in armed response vehicles.</p> \n<p>They would take no longer than 15 minutes to arrive, or even less for areas identified as prime targets, such as Whitehall. The new CTSFO unit would also be scrambled.</p> \n<p>Police chiefs believe terrorist attacks such as the one in Nairobi show that most casualties happen in the first hour or two.</p> \n<p>A senior police source said the new unit would aim to arrest the attackers, but would be prepared to contain and “neutralise” them. “We’re police officers, not soldiers. We’re not at war. Our job is to arrest people,” the source said.</p> \n<p>Even if faced with a gunman or gunmen on the rampage, the unit would not have orders to shoot to kill, but would be told to use minimum force. They would not be “firing the maximum number of bullets” and their actions would be subject to the criminal law.</p> \n<p>They have, nevertheless, been issued with SIG 516 weapons and trained to shoot to the head if necessary. Armed officers are traditionally trained to shoot towards the centre of the chest. </p> \n<p>They new unit has also been trained to take to speedboats in case of an attack from water,and to “fast-rope” from helicopters should road traffic be gridlocked following an attack.<br /></p> \n<p>There is no intelligence of an imminent gun attack on Britain, but the two-day exercise in London this week will test how police, the emergency services and government would cope with the intense strain of a such an event.</p> \n<p>The government’s Cobra emergency committee will take part in the exercise, which was devised in January. </p> \n<p>The announcement by the prime minister, David Cameron, of beefed up counter-terrorism measures and a renewed drive against extremism is otherwise expected to make little difference to policing practices. Officers have been engaged in unprecedented levels of activity for nine months already, making nearly one terrorism-related arrest a day.</p> \n<p>The deployment of hundreds of officers, 600 so far, to deal with the attack on Britons in Tunisia, comes at a time of strain for the police counter-terrorism network, made up of Scotland Yard’s S015 and a series of regional units.</p> \n<p>Senior officers have convinced the government to give counter-terrorism policing more money, but they worry privately that cuts to neighbourhood policing, including a potential reduction in the number of frontline officers, would damage the contacts and trust gained among communities and thus the intelligence gathered.</p> \n<p>In May, Britain’s top counter-terrorism officer, Mark Rowley, said: “Our discussions over the next few months in terms of the spending rounds … around counter-terrorism, will make the point it’s not simply about the counter-terrorism network enforcement, its about the strength of those other elements of policing.”</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/474c682206ac15116b1a783fcc72efcca6b25dc9/0_0_5184_3110/5184.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3110,"width":5184,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Armed transport police officers on patrol at London Bridge station","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-29T18:23:22Z","lastModified":"2015-06-29T23:01:23Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Vikram Dodd","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/vikramdodd"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["UK security and counter-terrorism","Police","Metropolitan police","London","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/uksecurity","webTitle":"UK security and counter-terrorism"},{"id":"uk/police","webTitle":"Police"},{"id":"uk/metropolitan-police","webTitle":"Metropolitan police"},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Vikram Dodd","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/vikramdodd"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/29/scotland-yard-creates-sas-style-unit-to-counter-threat-of-terrorist-gun-attack","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a8dh","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jun/29/scotland-yard-creates-sas-style-unit-to-counter-threat-of-terrorist-gun-attack","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/29/scotland-yard-creates-sas-style-unit-to-counter-threat-of-terrorist-gun-attack"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/474c682206ac15116b1a783fcc72efcca6b25dc9/0_0_5184_3110/5184.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3110,"width":5184,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Armed transport police officers on patrol at London Bridge station.

Athens right now is slick with perspiration; every public space is charged with hormonal tension and political disagreement – even the bakery where you buy your morning bread. The politics are brutal. Last week, stick-wielding anarchist youths attacked the HQ of the Antarsya – a far-left anti-capitalist party – because the latter had tried to make them pay to go into a music festival when the anarchists thought it should be free.</p> \n<p>I’ve seen, in the bohemian Exarchia district, a troupe of black-clad 15-year-olds distrupt a whole street full of similarly bohemian cafe-goers on a Saturday night, using petrol bombs and flaming rubbish bins, simply because “creating mayhem” is their doctrine.</p> \n<p>Athens has become, in short, the stage for flamboyant acts of self-dramatisation: sporadic riots, public kissing, street theatre and ill-advised scooter techniques. It is, to use a phrase Huxley once used about Shanghai, “life with the lid off”, and for the same reasons: “so much life, so carefully canalised, so rapidly and strongly flowing”.</p> \n<p>Antonis Vradis, a geographer at Durham University who has studied the impact of repeated waves of unrest here since 2008, describes how the youth networks have been preparing for this week’s “rupture” with the ECB: “They are creating structures you can’t default on. Self-organised clinics, the social centres you see all around you. Structures that will help them survive.”</p> \n<p>I meet Vradis in Floral cafe on the corner of Exarchia Square. He points out that the building – shabby as it is now – is a Bauhaus masterpiece. More importantly, during the 1944 uprising against the British, “the communists were snipers on the roof”.</p> \n<p>The young here live always with a portion of their brain operating in the past. They don’t need wall plaques. When they move through Exarchia, or Syntagma, or up the side of parliament towards the mansion prime minister Alexis Tsipras now occupies, they can “see” where the resistance fighters died; where the students of 1974 stopped a tank.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b1a1ad37ccdfb13cfa092ea590eada9c0eec441\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435598561522/82925ccc-85da-443b-a625-feb3c9df548a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alexis Tsipras in parliament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis Tsipras in parliament.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was the young people radicalised amid this landscape who pitched a tent camp outside parliament in 2011. They organised a movement most foreign journalists didn’t see: local assemblies in small squares across the city and its suburbs, where young mums, migrants and outraged pensioners could have their say. The communists denounced them; the socialists sent riot police to disperse them; Tsipras is said to have looked out of the window of his office and delared: those are the people who will put us into power.</p> \n<p>But Syriza is different. Syriza is a coalition whose colours are red for socialism, green for ecology and purple for feminism. But it is primarily red. It was born out of Eurocommunism – when the communist parties of the west declared loyalty to parliamentary democracy instead of Moscow. Its most influential activists are aged 50 and above: people who have read all three volumes of Karl Marx’s Capital, plus the Grundrisse, Theories of Surplus Value and Friedrich Engels’ Anti-D&uuml;hring. A lot of them are MPs now, or special advisers: you’ll find them in greying huddles in their old haunts – the radical bars and cafes of Exarchia and Plaka.</p> \n<p>How this generation of Greek leftwingers broke out of isolation is of more than academic interest. They have managed – for the first time in modern history – to form a government that defied the global finance system, and to do so with flair.</p> \n<p>Their strength was that they understood the significance of the youth revolts of 2008 and 2011. Some pitched their own tents in Syntagma Square and were tear-gassed out of it. But in the process, the party built something more official and resilient.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71e76233ad1e4100b35ad8b6dccbb28c798b60d5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435599348009/0df98774-1e20-4bfd-92c6-3dc504638d7c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Syriza supporters in 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syriza supporters in 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Petros Giannakouris/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Their weakness, it turns out, starts with Nicos Poulantzas. Poulantzas was a Greek intellectual of the new left who famously clashed with Ed Miliband’s father, Ralph, in 1969 over the nature of the capitalist state. Miliband said the state was “capitalist” because personally controlled by<strong> </strong>the business elite. Poulantzas said the state was structurally capitalist – independent of the will of individuals.</p> \n<p>Poulantzas evolved a dual strategy for the Greek left in the 1970s: first, to encircle the state with social movements, which were not to be controlled by any party but allowed to become expressions of popular democracy. And at the same time, to enter the state, democratise it and use it to pursue social justice. Poulantzas killed himself in 1979, but his ideas guided the precursor organisation to Syriza. Not many people remember now, but the party’s predecessor, Synaspismos, joined a short-lived coalition government with the conservatives in 1988, and a national government thereafter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b2bee148a02ec1caf3ce8ec10adeeefd3e459e96\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435598683877/705fb1c1-b3b1-40bf-ab13-ad43aac5a495-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nikos Poulantzas.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nikos Poulantzas.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Bassouls/Sygma/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the runup to its election victory, Syriza got a chance to execute the Poulantzas strategy of the march through the state: it won the Euro elections and the vital prefecture of Attica, where its candidate was protest veteran Rena Dourou. Then it won state power – but that has turned out differently.</p> \n<p>When Tsipras took over the Maximos Mansion, the PM’s residence, the outgoing government removed all computers and all soap. There is soap now, and computers, though no Wi-Fi for security reasons. Tsipras rules from one side of a marble hall; the other side is the cabinet room. In the basement are secure meeting rooms and offices. At the weekend, you will often find somebody’s children crayoning on the floor. The ceremonial guards, in their white tunics, sip <em>freddo-cappuccino</em> on a narrow terrace, alongside press photographers and armed bodyguards.</p> \n<p>In power, Syriza has discovered the unguessed secret of the Greek state. Without oligarchs, it is inefficient. So thoroughly did the old parties use patronage to run the operation that they barely needed a civil service, or the shock absorbers provided by independent regulators and quangos normal in a state such as Britain. I have seen ministers confronted with ridiculously detailed operational decisions, such as the appointment of a new boss for the state TV channel, which in Britain would be delegated to a regulator, but in Greece fell to minister of state Nikos Pappas. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis routinely handles his own press: though he has press officers drawn from Syriza, the actual press operation of the Greek state is barely engaged.</p> \n<p>Yannis Dragasakis, Greece’s deputy prime minister, was in many ways the embodiment of Syriza’s long-term dreams. His team of advisers included those most attuned to the “horizontalist” agenda emerging out of the networked social movements; people whose main desire was to nurture the 70-plus small-scale economic experiments they had promoted: local currencies, Wi-Fi networks in the mountains, producer co-ops.</p> \n<p>But Dragasakis was given “operations”: to operate the government, to firefight the banking system, to sort out the state energy company. Those who expected his department to unleash a wave of entrepreneurship and experimental projects have had to wait.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4e3ad7d8e66b4fd17ef9850059961212c77b58f9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435599060691/db11cf06-28f4-4f85-973a-fd8208eda35f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Probably the most challenging job in Greek journalism right now is to work for Avgi, Syriza’s newspaper. It is a daily, with professional graphic design, but suffers because nobody can decide whether it is meant to carry the party line or to be a voice for the mass base, and therefore a pain in Tsipras’s butt. When I meet editor-in-chief Giorgos Kiritsis, he is surrounded, almost symbolically, by fading newsprint and old posters. He chain-smokes and pulls up a Facebook page on which someone has posted a 50,000 drachma note with Kiritsis’s face on.</p> \n<p>Nobody knows what 50,000 drachmas will be worth if Greece defaults on its debts, but Kiritsis and his colleagues have for months been exposed to the basic dilemma of Syriza. It is a coalition – including the hard, pro-Moscow left who want that drachma note to become real; a centre around Tsipras who wanted to try to shrug off austerity within the euro; and former social democrats who want, at all costs, to do a deal with the lenders.</p> \n<p>It was not until 4 June that Tsipras became convinced that his original strategy – to go on paying the lenders while negotiating the fine detail of an accord that never seemed to come – was fruitless. It was at this point that the forces in Syriza realigned leftwards and the strategy of the troika (the ECB, IMF and European Commission) – which had always been to split Syriza, forcing Tsipras and his own moderates into a coalition government with the centre parties – was in tatters.</p> \n<p>The ultimate question for Syriza, with the banks closed and the referendum due, is: can it now function as a movement? It has ridden to power on the back of social movements but, unlike Podemos in Spain or Sinn F&eacute;in in Ireland, has never really been a mass movement itself.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3945b3ddbede563c2b7a3cf45c3761adc515ce9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435599495654/7a01ae56-55c8-4250-ab8c-70bd1badd4b0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Graffiti in Athens\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graffiti in Athens.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Petros Giannakouris/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the middle-class suburb of Chalandri in northern Athens, the mayor, Simos Roussos, has to organise the referendum and simultaneously keep the machinery of government going.

It is run this way because the austerity under the previous govenrment means they can’t staff the clinic with paid employees. The volunteers include doctors, psychologists and qualified pharmacists, but I find them engaged in the menial task of hand-sorting donated medicines. They note the sell-by dates, count the pills and sort them. This is Syriza’s mass base – but it is not Syriza.</p> \n<p>Syriza was always a party before it was a movement. The early polls taken since the referendum was called indicate it still has mass support. The unanswered question is whether it can hold the leftwing half of Greek society together amid this week of chaos.</p> \n<p>Nineta, one of the volunteers at the clinic, tells me people are frightened, but that she is totally behind what Syriza has done. The antidote to fear is solidarity, she says. But nobody is sure how much solidarity can survive if the banks stay closed.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435598408859/c8bb2cc0-97d7-466f-8272-89e33ecfeed6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"A demonstration in front of the Greek parliament in Athens.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435599228581/43c97af9-962e-4d8a-9b6c-5645709b95e8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"People wait outside a closed National Bank of Greece branch in Athens.

Their gamble paid off and Rezgui, 24, turned and walked along the beach, before jogging down a side street, shouting at Tunisians: “I haven’t come for you. Go away,” Ghoul said.</p> \n<p>Another member of the group, Anis Gamaoun, a waiting supervisor at the Palm Marina said the gunman moved calmly back down towards the beach.</p> \n<p>“My understanding is he was someone who has a mission, his mission was finished and he was waiting for someone to kill him. He could have killed us all if he had wanted to,” said Gamaoun, a 39-year-old father of four, adding that he would have rather Tunisians died. “It would have been better than killing guests.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37cb2b721b83d2766675574f0392a6b6e7470ee6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435615678494/91a0c7d0-edae-4a56-b2e0-d6dc4217374a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ibrahim al-Ghoul\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ibrahim al-Ghoul, rear, with three of his colleagues.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eileen Byrne</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Minutes later Rezgui was killed by police at the end of the street, but not before a resident had dropped some tiles on him from a rooftop.</p> \n<p>Tunisians said the hotel workers on the beach were not the first to try to stop Rezgui.
