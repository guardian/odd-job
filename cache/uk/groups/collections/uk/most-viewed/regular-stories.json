I’ve nothing to be afraid of,” said Blatter.</p> \n<p>“I’m afraid that they want to wreck Fifa, a work that I helped create,” the 79-year-old said.</p> \n<p>Blatter said he accepts criticism but “what hurts are hateful tirades.

She has zero money, is very deep into her overdraft and spends money on the most absurd things. I have to pay for her food out of my student loan, but she refuses to get a job. She just sits at her desk all day sharing junk on Facebook. I try to be polite and understanding, but whenever I say something about this she accuses me of being “verbally abusive”. She cannot take any criticism even though it is clearly constructive. I appreciate that it’s hard for a parent to receive advice from their 20-year-old son, but should I just leave her to wallow?</em></p> \n<p><strong>Mariella replies</strong> I have a theory. There comes a point in every child’s life when you reach the same level of maturity as one or both of your parents. It can take many years to appreciate that the dynamic has significantly altered and is often at the epicentre of other problems between you and your creators.</p> \n<p>Generally, once you’ve passed that critical juncture the disparity increases, and parents can feel like an increasing problem the older we (and they) get. Eventually it can feel like you’re dealing with bloody-minded toddlers, which is yet another of life’s little ironies. Once your paths have diverged, you continue becoming a more responsible adult and they become increasingly irresponsible, relying on you for everything you once needed from them.</p> \n<p>As with all relationships it’s entirely subjective and experienced at a different age and in disparate ways by each of us. As a phenomenon it’s curiously similar to the trauma experienced by parents when their children finally embrace independence and leave home, and offers further proof that we live not in a linear way but a circular pattern.</p> \n<p>For slow developers it can take well into your 40s or 50s before you catch up with Mum and Dad – some never do – while for others it can happen at a poignantly precocious point in childhood. I’ve seen serious little eight-year-olds trying to negotiate the responsibilities of caring for the unreliable adults in their lives. It’s heartbreaking to witness.</p> \n<p>Luckily you’ve managed to reach first base in terms of adulthood before having such unwelcome duties thrust on you, and while it’s not an easy burden to shoulder, there are definitely ways of making it less hard. You’re old enough to cope far better than the youngsters I just described.</p> \n<p>Plenty feel unfettered by genealogical lineage and focus purely on their own forward momentum. Personally, I’m for walking a middle line. There’s enough drama around us without whipping it up in your closest circle if it’s avoidable. Few of us don’t aspire to close relations with our families. That sort of solid familial ground to launch yourself into life from is enviable and surely merits reciprocal treatment when the baton is passed from the older to the younger hand. That’s in a perfect world, which this is not!</p> \n<p>For many of us the perils of our parents in close proximity are a torture, and tangible distance – emotionally and even geographically – is the only respite. Choosing to bring a child into this world and later giving them no option but to parent you is not a fair deal, but behaving magnanimously out of guilt, shame or expediency isn’t a healthy option either, and resentment takes a similar toll on all within its catchment.</p> \n<p>Many of us, once we surpass our parents’ ability to act like responsible adults, need to separate from them, even if it’s just to establish acceptable boundaries on both sides. Your story suggests it’s time for you to draw a line between your mother’s expectations and what you are prepared to offer. She needs to look beyond her computer screen and take responsibility for a life that’s not even half lived (hopefully).</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, your energies will benefit you both much better in the future if at present they are directed to your studies and the enriching experience of living life on your own terms. It will come as little surprise to you that your parent isn’t perfect. I suspect straight talking and direct action may be your best accomplices in achieving mutual understanding here.

Nudity. Violence”, warns the first frame of the latest video from pop provocateur Rihanna. What follows certainly lives up to the billing.</p> \n<p>Depending on which commentator or social media spat you choose, the video – viewed 12 million times since its release – is either an empowering challenge to music industry stereotypes or a racist and gory piece of misogyny.</p> \n<p>Bitch Better Have My Money (BBHMM) is a slick seven-minute film, co-directed by one of the few black women in America who has managed to get right to the top of a male-dominated pop industry.</p> \n<p>The plot is simple – an accountant has defrauded the singer out of money, so she kidnaps his wife, a spoiled, wealthy white woman complete with chichi dog and diamonds. With two friends, she bundles her into a trunk, strips her, swings her upside down from a rope, knocks her out with a bottle, then lets her almost drown in a swimming pool.</p> \n<p>When that doesn’t get her the money, Rihanna finds the accountant, straps him to a chair, shows a collection of knives presumably used to finish him off, and then is shown blood-covered and naked in a trunk of money.</p> \n<p>A show of sisterhood it isn’t, although the homage to Hollywood’s girl power blockbuster Thelma and Louise, with Rihanna and her co-conspirators riding off in a 1960s blue convertible, suggest the artist might think differently.</p> \n<p>The song, the second single from the singer’s eighth album, is based on Rihanna’s grievance against an accountant, Peter Gounis, whom she filed a lawsuit against in 2012, claiming he gave her “unsound” financial advice that led to a loss of $9m in 2009 alone. She won a multimillion settlement.</p> \n<p>Predictably, BBHMM ignited a furious debate. A headline on Refinery29 declared the video “Not Safe For Work or Feminists” while Twitter accused Rihanna of glorifying violence against women, and condemned the “kidnapped female” trope. Rolling Stone<em> </em>was attacked for praising the video and crediting the two minor male roles while not even giving a name to the actress who plays the main role.</p> \n<p>Rachel Roberts, who has made several Vogue covers, said the offer of her part was “irresistible”. “The video was Rihanna’s concept,” Roberts said last week. “She co-directed it, so she personally cast me. Despite her out-there public image, she’s very professional and hands-on. The whole thing was an insane thrill ride. Helicopters, boats, gunfire, stunts, holding my breath underwater, a dozen locations and a Pomeranian toy dog.” She praised Rihanna as “an undeniable talent”.</p> \n<p>In the New Statesman, Helen Lewis was less gushing: “It was not very feminist – not even very hashtag feminist – of Rihanna to ‘torture that poor rich lady’. That is because it is not very feminist to torture women. Even if they are white. Even if they are rich. Even if you are a woman yourself. Sorry if this comes as a surprise.”</p> \n<p>In an America seething over endemic racism, the presentation of a black woman exacting revenge on a white exploiter has been less controversial than the nudity. Vogue.com columnist Karley Sciortino said: “It’s good to normalise the female body. In so many music videos where you see nudity, it’s framed in these really specific ways: abstract female body parts just looking hot. When Rihanna’s naked she isn’t posing in a hypersexual way, she’s covered in blood and she’ll cut your dick off. She looks powerful, but it’s almost casual, normalised. It’s about showing a powerful representation of the female body, where women are in charge of the way that they’re being viewed.”</p> \n<p>Rihanna’s co-directors, Leo Berne and Charles Brisgand, said her intention was clear. “From the beginning she was like, “I don’t care if it’s not aired on TV’,” Brisgand said. “She wanted something that people don’t expect from her.” The director said it was Rihanna’s idea to hang Roberts from her feet naked.</p> \n<p>Rihanna, who has 22 million followers on Instagram, is one of the few whose appearance on a magazine cover will boost sales. Her past as a victim of domestic violence has brought her fans among young women who see a successful survivor. She certainly has the power to provoke – and she is using it.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436031340434/Rihanna-Bitch-Better-Have-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bitch Better Have My Money is based on Rihanna’s grievance against an accountant, claiming that he gave her ‘unsound’ advice.","credit":"/PR","altText":"Rihanna Bitch Better Have My Money","cleanCaption":"Bitch Better Have My Money is based on Rihanna’s grievance against an accountant, claiming that he gave her ‘unsound’ advice."}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-04T17:36:38Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T01:59:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":344,"contributors":[{"name":"Tracy McVeigh","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/tracymcveigh"},{"name":"Edward Helmore","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/edwardhelmore"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Rihanna","Music","US news","World news","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"music/rihanna","webTitle":"Rihanna"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jul/04/feminists-fall-out-over-rihanna-video","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ack8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jul/04/feminists-fall-out-over-rihanna-video","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/04/feminists-fall-out-over-rihanna-video"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436031340434/Rihanna-Bitch-Better-Have-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bitch Better Have My Money is based on Rihanna’s grievance against an accountant, claiming that he gave her ‘unsound’ advice.","credit":"/PR","altText":"Rihanna Bitch Better Have My Money","cleanCaption":"Bitch Better Have My Money is based on Rihanna’s grievance against an accountant, claiming that he gave her ‘unsound’ advice."}},"importance":5,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436031340434/Rihanna-Bitch-Better-Have-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bitch Better Have My Money is based on Rihanna’s grievance against an accountant, claiming that he gave her ‘unsound’ advice.","credit":"/PR","altText":"Rihanna Bitch Better Have My Money","cleanCaption":"Bitch Better Have My Money is based on Rihanna’s grievance against an accountant, claiming that he gave her ‘unsound’ advice."}}]},{"title":"London 'anti-Jewification' demo dwarfed by anti-fascist counter-protest","rawTitle":"London 'anti-Jewification' demo dwarfed by anti-fascist counter-protest","item":{"type":"article","id":"world/2015/jul/04/london-anti-jewification-demo-dwarfed-by-anti-fascist-counter-protest","title":"London 'anti-Jewification' demo dwarfed by anti-fascist counter-protest","trailText":"Lines of police keep two groups apart as neo-Nazis stage demonstration against Jewish neighbourhood watch group","standFirst":"<p>Lines of police keep two groups apart as neo-Nazis stage demonstration against Jewish neighbourhood watch group</p>","byline":"Damien Gayle","body":"<p>Police were forced to escort around 20 neo-Nazi protesters out of Westminster on Saturday afternoon after they staged an “anti-Jewification” protest.</p> \n<p>Hundreds of counter-protesters chanted “Scum, scum, scum” as they followed the far-right activists from Whitehall towards Westminster tube station.

Some choice | Aggeliki Spanou</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At a rally in the centre of Athens on Friday night, Tsipras urged his compatriots to cast a no ballot, assuring them it would not be a vote for leaving the euro, but for remaining in Europe “with dignity”. Greece’s creditors and most of the opposition parties have claimed that, on the contrary, it could lead to exit from the single market (“Grexit”) and even the European Union.</p> \n<p>Almost 9.9 million Greeks have the right to vote in the referendum, which the interior ministry said would cost less than half the amount spent on the general election in January that brought Tsipras’s Syriza party into office in a coalition with the populist, nationalist Anel party.</p> \n<p>Among the many imponderables was the impact of votes cast by Greeks living abroad. Under the same rules that govern elections, expatriates must return to the country if they are to cast valid ballots. There was evidence that large numbers of Greeks living abroad were coming back for the referendum and that most leaned towards voting yes.</p> \n<p>The prime minister’s decision to call the vote prompted outrage among opposition politicians who favour a yes vote. They have argued that the offer on which the referendum is based was withdrawn when the bailout programme ran out and that Syriza has rigged the ballot by putting both options on one ballot sheet with the no option first. But a claim that the vote was unconstitutional <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/live/2015/jul/03/greek-debt-crisis-council-of-state-to-rule-on-referendum-live\">was thrown out by Greece’s highest court</a> on Friday.</p> \n<p>Polling stations will be open from 7am local time until 7pm (5pm British summer time). The first results are expected around 9pm.</p> \n<p>Opinion polls have given contradictory results and none has shown a clear majority for either option. But they have all shown an overwhelming majority of Greeks – around three-quarters – want their country to keep the euro.</p> \n<p>A no vote is supported by both the parties in government and the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party. The centre-right opposition New Democracy party has campaigned for a yes vote as have Pasok and To Potami, both of the centre-left.</p> \n<p>In a surprise development on the eve of polling, the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble – until now even more of a hardliner than his chancellor, Angela Merkel – turned a more conciliatory face towards Greece. Having previously insisted that a no vote on the lenders’ last terms would see their country forced out of the euro, Sch&auml;uble told the Bild newspaper that the choice before them on Sunday was between holding on to the euro and being “temporarily without it”. It was far from clear what Sch&auml;uble had in mind, but economists have mooted the notion of a period in which <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/greece\">Greece</a> might go back to its national currency, the drachma, while its economy recovered.</p> \n<p>With pharmacists in Athens reporting that the government had rationed the distribution of drugs, and fears being raised of food shortages within weeks, the finance minister of Europe’s biggest economy said: “It is clear that we will not leave the [Greek] people in the lurch.” Sch&auml;uble’s last-minute intervention appeared to favour the no camp’s argument that the vote is not on membership of the euro.</p> \n<p>The German minister’s tone was strikingly at odds with that of his charismatic but controversial Greek counterpart, Yanis Varoufakis, who turned up the heat before the ballot by accusing Greece’s creditors of terrorism.</p> \n<p>“Why did they force us to close the banks?” he asked in an interview published by the Spanish daily El Mundo. “To instil fear in people. And spreading fear is called terrorism.”</p> \n<p>Rallies in support of Greece were held in several European capitals on Saturday. Others were also held in Britain: in London, Liverpool and Edinburgh.</p> \n<p>Several economists warned that financial markets were underestimating the risks of a no vote – and even of a yes vote.

(Legal. Please advise. Are we&nbsp;allowed to say this now without being shouted down by Nigel Lawson?) The business community’s genius move in the third runway debate has been to change the dialogue from an argument which should have been between building a runway and not building a runway at all, and trying to restructure our society to avoid the need for a third runway, into an argument about where exactly it was best to position this massive portent of our world’s forthcoming doom. It’s like offering an innocent man who doesn’t want to be hanged the chance to be poisoned instead.</p> \n<p>As with fracking and the academification of all schools, decisions have already been made behind closed doors by forces beyond our control.

Can it only be four decades ago that every summer holiday trek along A-roads to South Devon caravan sites left our Morris Marina windscreen smeared thick with now-disappeared invertebrates, that sparrows swarmed around morning milk bottles, that sticklebacks and minnows spawned in every park pond, that hedgehogs gathered at night in suburban gardens and lay flattened in their thousands on roads every morning, and that an actual hare ran out of the encroached common land of Palmers Rough, on the fringes of Birmingham, to be chased by my grandfather along Arnold Road in that same Morris Marina, a sight that would seem as surreal today as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/video/2015/jun/14/hippopotamus-zoo-animals-escape-after-flooding-tbilisi-video\" title=\"\">escaped hippos</a> wandering the streets of some collapsed eastern European capital?</p> \n<p>The absence of abundance is already accepted. The metaphors of the nature poets, mapping human hearts through once commonly understood imagery, are irrelevant and impenetrable. “The sun of Winter, / The moon of Summer, and all the singing birds / Except the missel-thrush that loves juniper, / Are quite shut out.” I’m sorry. The missel-what? Can the juniper be monetised? Is this missel-thing for sale? Our children already have no stable baseline from which to calibrate the loss of all that lives. It’s game over.</p> \n<p>Bearing this in mind, I finally find myself reluctantly agreeing with the business community. There is no time for delay. Let’s build the runway. Let’s choke the Earth. Let’s get this damn thing over with, for what can be avoided, whose end is purposed by the mighty gods of business?

It was distributed by accounts known to be linked with Islamic State militants. Stills from the video show the killers to be young, possibly in their early teens. They are pictured holding guns and dressed in desert camouflage and brown bandanas.</p> \n<p>Close-up shots of the soldiers on their knees with their hands tied behind their backs appear to show that they have been beaten. Hundreds of men in civilian clothes are shown sitting watching the slaughter on the steps in front of a stage with the backdrop of a large Isis flag. A man stands in front of the flag and addresses the gathering before a command is given and the condemned soldiers are killed simultaneously with a shot to the head from the young killers standing directly behind them.</p> \n<p>It is not clear when the filming took place but it was not the first such killings in the famous Roman amphitheatre. Days after Isis captured Palmyra in late May the terrorist group killed 20 men in the same location, which had formerly been used for an annual festival in the city and is a Unesco world heritage site.</p> \n<p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, based in the UK, said at the time that residents near the site were rounded up and forced to watch the killings of the men, who were accused of being government supporters.</p> \n<p>Isis reportedly carried out more than 200 killings, including of civilians, in and around Palmyra in the period when it captured the city. The group is known for using children as suicide bombers and soldiers.</p> \n<p>Reports suggest that at least 500 have been kidnapped in recent weeks, and Iraqi police said children were being brainwashed into joining the militants. The children were snatched from Iraq’s Anbar and Diyala provinces and taken to the group’s bases, where they are trained for use in “terror attacks”, according to Iraqi authorities.</p> \n<p>In May, Mamoun Abdelkarim, Syria’s head of antiquities, said he feared the killings could signal the start of “the group’s barbarism and savagery against the ancient monuments of Palmyra”. He said: “Using the Roman theatre to execute people proves that these people are against humanity.”</p> \n<p>Abdelkarim said most of the artefacts from Palmyra’s museum had been sent to Damascus before Isis approached the city.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/4/1436045533629/Aerial-view-of-amphitheat-005.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Roman amphitheatre in Palmyra has been the scene of atrocities since the city was captured by Isis.
