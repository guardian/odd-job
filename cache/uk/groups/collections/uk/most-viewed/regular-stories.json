However, there is no clear definition of what this means and the SNP has several options that might pave the way for it to argue it has a mandate for another.</p> \n<p>Possible reasons include if Cameron resists the SNP’s demands for greater devolution of powers, if the UK votes to leave the European Union or withdraw from the European convention on human rights, or if the SNP wins a decisive victory at the Holyrood elections in 2016 having expressed a desire for another referendum in its manifesto.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/14/scotland-bill-falls-short-of-previous-cross-party-recommendations\">Scotland bill 'falls short of previous cross-party recommendations'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4439642.ece\">Sturgeon separately indicated that the Scottish people could demand another independence referendum</a> if Cameron does not agree to her call for more powers for the Scottish parliament. She also said the prime minister cannot “rule out a referendum against the will of the people”.</p> \n<p>The subject is likely to be the matter of discussion at a meeting between Sturgeon and Cameron on Friday, at which the first minister will present the prime minister with a shopping list of demands including control over the minimum wage, national insurance contributions, welfare, business taxes and equality policy.</p> \n<p>The SNP source said that the party believes a second referendum will happen and that it would be won decisively if it took place tomorrow, despite last year’s vote being billed as a way of settling the issue for a generation. It “only has to be won once” and the last referendum was lost only because of the Labour former prime minister Gordon Brown’s intervention, the source added.</p> \n<p>A spokesman for Sturgeon said: “These claims are totally wrong – there are no such plans. The position is crystal clear – the general election was not a mandate for another referendum. And there will only be another referendum if and when the people of Scotland back such a proposal at a Scottish parliament election.</p> \n<p>“It is not for David Cameron or any other single politician to try and dictate what Scotland’s future should be; it will always be in the hands of the people.”<br /></p> \n<p>The issue of whether there will be another referendum has taken centre stage since the SNP won a landslide victory in Scotland at the general election. Cameron has definitively ruled out allowing another poll since the election, but the SNP appears to have been emboldened by the fact it won 56 out of 59 Scottish constituencies.</p> \n<p>The Conservatives have promised to devolve more powers to Scotland, but Cameron is maintaining he is willing to go no further than the proposals published by the Smith commission, offering partial responsibility for tax raising. Sturgeon is pushing for full fiscal responsibility, while acknowledging that will take a number of years. She said earlier this week that Cameron “has to” discuss the matter.<br /></p> \n<p>Cameron will tell Sturgeon that they have to work together as he promises to deliver a Scotland bill in his first Queen’s speech that hands over responsibility for 60% of Scottish spending to Holyrood. “Scotland has two governments, and it is the duty of the first minister and myself to respect each other’s roles and responsibilities and to work together for the benefit of all the people of Scotland.” </p> \n<p>Alex Salmond, the former first minister and previous SNP leader, said last week that the tidal wave of support for his party left Cameron with “no legitimacy whatsoever” in Scotland.</p> \n<p>In a move that will do nothing to help relations between the SNP and Conservatives, the prime minister on Thursday gave a peerage and ministerial job in the Scotland Office to Andrew Dunlop, a former adviser to Margaret Thatcher at the time of the poll tax. Responding to that appointment, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/11/snp-seeking-greater-powers-slowly\">SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson</a> said it was an “appalling and anti-democratic” scandal.</p> \n<p>However, SNP insiders believe antagonistic moves like this will actually boost the campaign for independence. Likewise, it is understood that the SNP is hoping that Jim Murphy will stay in his position as Scottish Labour leader, given the fact he oversaw the collapse of his party at the polls last week.</p> \n<p>The senior SNP source said the party would have considered fielding candidates in the north of England had the leadership debates happened sooner, as they made clear Sturgeon’s potential for popularity south of the border. Sturgeon has said there are no plans to do this, despite a favourable impression of her among many English voters and a social media campaign in the north of England called #TakeUsWithYouScotland.</p> \n<p>It is understood that not even Sturgeon herself believed the predictions that the SNP would almost sweep the board in Scotland with 56 out of 59 seats, having a “wobble” on Thursday night about how well the party would fare against Labour.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/14/snp-mps-flout-commons-etiquette-with-first-day-tweets\">SNP MPs flout Commons etiquette with first-day tweets</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The fact that the SNP is talking about opportunities for another referendum is likely to make for a combative parliament. Many of the party’s new MPs have been celebrating in the House of Commons this week, taking over a bar in parliament called the Sports and Social Club that has usually been populated by Labour researchers.</p> \n<p>The party is already in talks to get all the obligations and privileges of the Liberal Democrats as the new third party in Westminster. An SNP MP said the party has secured use of the old Lib Dem corridor and suggested renaming it “Freedom Alley”. Robertson will move into Nick Clegg’s old office and the party’s whips will get an office allowing them to open unofficial communications with the Labour and Tory whips, known as the “usual channels”.</p> \n<p>The party is also expecting to be handed at least two chairmanships of select committees and two questions at prime minister’s questions, as well as opposition debate time.</p> \n<p>Robertson was confirmed as SNP’s Westminster leader on Tuesday, despite speculation that Salmond could make a return to the top job in London. Sturgeon has made clear she will be her party’s chief negotiator and spokesman on major issues.</p> \n<p>Speaking following the SNP’s landslide election, Robertson said his party was “better placed to hold the UK government to account” than ever before. </p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/662e35c63cbdbbe6575517228379e06eb8ac7922/455_374_2736_1641/2736.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1641,"width":2736,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dylan Martinez/Reuters","altText":"Nicola Sturgeon indicated Scotland could demand referendum if Cameron does not agree to more powers for Holyrood.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-15T02:02:10Z","lastModified":"2015-05-15T07:05:59Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2792,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowena Mason","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899403654/Rowena-Mason-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rowena-mason"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Scottish independence","Scottish National party (SNP)","Nicola Sturgeon","Alex Salmond","Scotland","Scottish politics","Politics","David Cameron","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/scottish-independence","webTitle":"Scottish independence"},{"id":"politics/snp","webTitle":"Scottish National party (SNP)"},{"id":"politics/nicola-sturgeon","webTitle":"Nicola Sturgeon"},{"id":"politics/alexsalmond","webTitle":"Alex Salmond"},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland"},{"id":"politics/scotland","webTitle":"Scottish politics"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rowena Mason","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rowena-mason"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/14/snp-prepared-overrule-cameron-second-independence-referendum-scotland","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49vve","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/may/14/snp-prepared-overrule-cameron-second-independence-referendum-scotland","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/14/snp-prepared-overrule-cameron-second-independence-referendum-scotland"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/662e35c63cbdbbe6575517228379e06eb8ac7922/455_374_2736_1641/2736.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1641,"width":2736,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nicola Sturgeon indicated Scotland could demand referendum if Cameron does not agree to more powers for Holyrood.

At that time, the maintenance of the Kim personality cult was cited by North Korean state media as <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/-thrice-cursed-acts-of-treachery-parsing-north-koreas-report-on-the-execution-of-kim-jong-uns-uncle/282339/] \">justification for Jang Song-taek’s execution</a>; the would-be regent was accused of applauding the leader with inadequate gusto at a meeting and putting an inscription in praise of Kim in the shade rather than in sunlight.</p> \n<p>In such a system, it is nearly impossible for figures other than Kim to accumulate public charisma or prestige. For all of his strange disappearances, evident health problems and unlikely friendships with Dennis Rodman, the ruler has been celebrated in state media as every bit the “peerlessly great man of Paektu” that his predecessors were. Lacking in any actual administrative expertise, Kim has traded fully upon his bloodline as his primary credential.<br /></p> \n<p>The young leader’s celebrated <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/gallery/2015/apr/20/kim-jong-un-north-korea-climb-mountain-in-pictures\">“climb” to the summit of Mount Paektu</a> this past month is a case in point: this was an occurrence which not just the whole of the armed forces but the entire nation was expected to celebrate.

The findings challenge the idea that sexual equality is a recent invention, suggesting that it has been the norm for humans for most of our evolutionary history.</p> \n<p>Mark Dyble, an anthropologist who led the study at University College London, said: “There is still this wider perception that hunter-gatherers are more macho or male-dominated. We’d argue it was only with the emergence of agriculture, when people could start to accumulate resources, that inequality emerged.”</p> \n<p>Dyble says the latest findings suggest that equality between the sexes may have been a survival advantage and played an important role in shaping human society and evolution. “Sexual equality is one of a important suite of changes to social organisation, including things like pair-bonding, our big, social brains, and language, that distinguishes humans,” he said. “It’s an important one that hasn’t really been highlighted before.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/mar/01/hunting-with-wolves-humans-conquered-the-world-neanderthal-evolution\">How hunting with wolves helped humans outsmart the Neanderthals</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The study, published in the journal <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aaa5139\">Science</a>, set out to investigate the apparent paradox that while people in hunter-gatherer societies show strong preferences for living with family members, in practice the groups they live in tend to comprise few closely related individuals. </p> \n<p>The scientists collected genealogical data from two hunter-gatherer populations, one in the Congo and one in the Philippines, including kinship relations, movement between camps and residence patterns, through hundreds of interviews. In both cases, people tend to live in groups of around 20, moving roughly every 10 days and subsisting on hunted game, fish and gathered fruit, vegetables and honey.</p> \n<p>The scientists constructed a computer model to simulate the process of camp assortment, based on the assumption that people would chose to populate an empty camp with their close kin: siblings, parents and children.</p> \n<p> When only one sex had influence over the process, as is typically the case in male-dominated pastoral or horticultural societies, tight hubs of related individuals emerged. However, the average number of related individuals is predicted to be much lower when men and women have an equal influence – closely matching what was seen in the populations that were studied.</p> \n<p>“When only men have influence over who they are living with, the core of any community is a dense network of closely related men with the spouses on the periphery,” said Dyble. “If men and women decide, you don’t get groups of four or five brothers living together.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Sexual equality is one of the important changes that distinguishes humans. It hasn’t really been highlighted before</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Mark Dyble, leader of the study</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The authors argue that sexual equality may have proved an evolutionary advantage for early human societies, as it would have fostered wider-ranging social networks and closer cooperation between unrelated individuals. “It gives you a far more expansive social network with a wider choice of mates, so inbreeding would be less of an issue,” said Dyble. “And you come into contact with more people and you can share innovations, which is something that humans do par excellence.”</p> \n<p>Dr Tamas David-Barrett, a behavioural scientist at the University of Oxford, agreed: “This is a very neat result,” he said. “If you’re able to track your kin further away, you’d be able to have a much broader network. All you’d need to do is get together every now and then for some kind of feast.”</p> \n<p>The study suggests that it was only with the dawn of agriculture, when people were able to accumulate resources for the first time, that an imbalance emerged. “Men can start to have several wives and they can have more children than women,” said Dyble. “It pays more for men to start accumulating resources and becomes favourable to form alliances with male kin.”</p> \n<p> Dyble said that egalitarianism may even have been one of the important factors that distinguished our ancestors from our primate cousins. “Chimpanzees live in quite aggressive, male-dominated societies with clear hierarchies,” he said. “As a result, they just don’t see enough adults in their lifetime for technologies to be sustained.”</p> \n<p>The findings appear to be supported by qualitative observations of the hunter-gatherer groups in the study. In the Philippines population, women are involved in hunting and honey collecting and while there is still a division of labour, overall men and women contribute a similar number of calories to the camp. In both groups, monogamy is the norm and men are active in childcare.</p> \n<p> Andrea Migliano, of University College London and the paper’s senior author, said: “Sex equality suggests a scenario where unique human traits, such as cooperation with unrelated individuals, could have emerged in our evolutionary past.” <br /></p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431675991615/b11fb5f4-2812-4f95-bf41-13059d6964c3-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Everett Collection / Rex Features","altText":"The authors of the study argue that sexual equality may have proved an evolutionary advantage for early human societies, as it would have fostered wider-ranging social network (probably not including gardening).","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Everett Collection / Rex Features"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-14T21:58:49Z","lastModified":"2015-05-15T07:46:37Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":423,"contributors":[{"name":"Hannah Devlin","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/hannah-devlin"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Anthropology","Gender","Women","Evolution","Science","Society","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"science/anthropology","webTitle":"Anthropology"},{"id":"world/gender","webTitle":"Gender"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"science/evolution","webTitle":"Evolution"},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"science"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Hannah Devlin","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/hannah-devlin"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"science"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/may/14/early-men-women-equal-scientists","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49v3c","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/science/2015/may/14/early-men-women-equal-scientists","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/14/early-men-women-equal-scientists"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431675991615/b11fb5f4-2812-4f95-bf41-13059d6964c3-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The authors of the study argue that sexual equality may have proved an evolutionary advantage for early human societies, as it would have fostered wider-ranging social network (probably not including gardening).
