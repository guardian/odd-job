There are many women who have never managed to orgasm at all, and many who have never discovered the truths about their own sexual responses. Some simply live in hope that one day, some lover will figure it out for them (“Some day my prince will make me come!”).</p> \n<p>Vibrators are too intense for many women, but you either need that intensity to fully stimulate your genital nerve endings, or have become habituated to it. Either way, it would be best to relax and accept that it is simply your style of reaching orgasm. I hope you can help your husband to recognise how lucky he is to be married to a woman who has cleverly and proactively sought her own pleasure, despite a high orgasmic threshold.

However, he added: “The CofCC is hardly responsible for the actions of this deranged individual merely because he gleaned accurate information from our website.”</p> \n<p>Reached by telephone at home on Sunday evening by the Guardian, Holt said he was busy and hung up.</p> \n<p>Holt has since 2012 contributed $8,500 to Cruz, the Texas senator running for the Republican presidential nomination, and his <a href=\"http://www.jobsgrowth.org/\">Jobs, Growth and Freedom Fund</a> political action committee, according to <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/\">Federal Election Commission</a> (FEC) filings. On some filings Holt’s occupation was listed as “slumlord”.</p> \n<p>He has also given $1,750 to <a href=\"http://www.randpac.com/\">RandPAC</a>, the political action committee of Paul, the Kentucky senator and presidential contender, and he gave $2,000 to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney. </p> \n<p>A further $1,500 was donated by Holt to Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator and 2012 Republican presidential primary runner-up, who is running for president again in the 2016 race and attended Sunday’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/gallery/2015/jun/21/charleston-shooting-remembrance-march-service-in-pictures\">memorial service</a> at Emanuel AME Church.</p> \n<p>In response to questions from the Guardian, Rick Tyler, a spokesman for Cruz, said in an email: “Upon review, we discovered that Mr Holt did make a contribution. We will be immediately refunding the donation.” </p> \n<p>Tyler said Cruz’s own campaign and leadership PAC would “be making a full refund”.</p> \n<p>Matthew Beynon, a spokesman for Santorum, said in an email: “Senator Santorum does not condone or respect racist or hateful comments of any kind. Period. The views the Senator campaigns on are his own and he is focused on uniting America, not dividing her.”</p> \n<p>A spokesman for Paul’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>A series of racist statements have been posted over the past four years to the website of The Blaze, a conservative news outlet, by a user going by Holt’s full name, Earl P Holt III.

More recently, she has concentrated on green issues, and her protests have landed her in jail. So does Sense8, her new Netflix series with the Wachowskis, herald a comeback?</p>","byline":"Xan Brooks","body":"<p>On the hottest day of the year so far, Daryl Hannah appears like a mirage outside her Paris hotel. She has been<strong> </strong>window-shopping and people-watching, but the heat is intense and her foundation is flaking. She explains that she likes taking walks in the city because this was where it all started; it is where her parents met. Without Paris, she says, she would not even exist.</p> \n<p>Hannah is in town to plug her role in <a href=\"http://www.netflix.com/WiMovie/80025744?mqso=81640163&amp;gclid=CL2M3M2AgcYCFSrJtAod5HQAIg\">Sense8</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/04/sense8-review-wachowskis-netflix\">an audacious, globe-hopping Netflix series about fluid identities and the shadowy links between the present and the past</a>. As luck would have it, the first three episodes have her cropping up as a ghost on various bustling city streets. Flaxen hair trails across her shoulders. Her gaze is full of mysterious import. She has something vital to tell us. I have no idea what it is.</p> \n<p>Once inside, Hannah retouches her makeup and arranges herself on the couch. At the age of 54, she has amassed more than 70 screen credits and squared all manner of circles. She is the painfully shy child turned 80s poster girl; the Hollywood star who found a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2009/jun/07/interview-daryl-hannah\">fresh lease of life as an environmental campaigner</a>. She has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2011/aug/30/daryl-hannah-arrested-at-white-house\">been arrested five times</a> and has seen the inside of jails. But interviews spook her so much that she has a PR sitting with us. She concludes the bulk of her answers with a sheepish giggle, as though taken aback at her own presumption. She looks like a valkyrie and behaves like a faun.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8216e0c88eb93f665cabc3ffe9d0cc2a9714a79\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434734128288/bc292ca1-5012-4ef8-b8d2-8f15905cc8e6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hannah in the new Netflix series Sense8.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hannah in the new Netflix series Sense8.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>No doubt this friction is part of her appeal. “One of the great advantages with Daryl is that she combines enormous strength with enormous vulnerability,” says Grant Hill, the producer of Sense8. “That’s what makes her so perfect for the role. You have the sense that she is controlling the tension, but that at any moment the balance could shift.”</p> \n<p>The trouble is that a discussion of Sense8 can only take us so far. The show is the brainchild of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wachowskis\">blockbusting siblings Andy and Lana Wachowski</a>, working alongside Babylon 5 creator <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski\">J Michael Straczynski</a>, and spotlights the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/11/fast-and-curious-what-do-you-make-of-sense8s-telepathic-tag-team-netflix-episodes-one-to-six\">telepathic communication between eight strangers in eight different cities</a>. But the series is designed to reveal its hand slowly and the opening episodes scatter so many clues that it is all I can do to work out whether we are in Berlin or Nairobi. Hannah takes pity. She insists the show is beautiful and profound and that everything of importance will be explained in due course. “I believe that when you see the whole series it will expand your mind,” she says. She peers at me earnestly. “And your heart.”</p> \n<p>Assuming Sense8 connects, it will count as a comeback of sorts. Her recent credits are dotted with obscure titles such as SOS: Love! and Zombie Night. I have the sense that acting has been playing second fiddle to her real-world concerns. Hannah edits and presents her own environmental blog on sustainable living (<a href=\"http://www.dhlovelife.com/v2/opening/\">DHlovelife</a>), although she laments that the site is in need of updating. Over the past decade, she has helped to organise protests against the closure of a community farm in Los Angeles, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2009/jun/24/james-hansen-daryl-hannah-mining-protest\">surface mining in West Virginia</a> and the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2012/oct/05/daryl-hannah-arrested-keystone-protest\">construction of the Keystone oil pipeline between Canada and the Gulf coast</a>. Her Hollywood profile lends visibility to causes that otherwise risk being ignored by the mainstream news media. It must also make it awkward for the cops sent to put her in handcuffs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75f2ec6fcb449ef4dc95b90687ed9c95d9648905\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434734313406/5ae60e10-b29d-47f4-9004-65dfae99c511-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hannah as the Mermaid in the 1984 film Splash.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hannah as the Mermaid in the 1984 film Splash.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She nods. “Oh yeah, it’s pretty funny. Generally I end up taking pictures with the sheriffs at the station. So I do get singled out – not necessarily in good ways. The times I’ve been put in jail, I’m always in solitary. Partly because they think: ‘Oh, she must be the ringleader.’ Partly to protect me from the drunks and murderers.” She laughs at the memory. “It’s kind of scary and boring being in solitary.”</p> \n<p>Naturally, she makes an effort to lead by example. Her house runs on solar power; her car on recycled grease from fast food. But she acknowledges that the wider struggle verges on the Sisyphean.</p> \n<p>Does she feel hopeful? She see-saws her hand. “I go back and forth. Sometimes I’m very optimistic, when I’ve just participated in some action with young people and can see that there is a growing awareness. But then when you see the brick wall of resistance within the legislative and political system, it can be very frustrating.”</p> \n<p>She was raised in a world of wealth and privilege, of private jets and holiday homes. But her adolescence was a torment and she was bullied by her peers. A doctor diagnosed her as “borderline autistic” and suggested she be hospitalised. Acting, she says, was her way of escaping into a fantasy world. By the time she turned 25, Hannah had played the punkish replicant Pris in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9t5ikxjAQ4\">Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner</a>, the Cro-Magnon orphan in The Clan of the Cave Bear, and Tom Hanks’s wide-eyed mermaid lover in the box-office hit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMIsXdoj2vU\">Splash</a>. She felt that her salvation had been there all along.</p> \n<p>“Oh, for sure, when I did Blade Runner, I was completely transported to another world. The whole thing was perfect. It was just what I wanted. I wanted to become another person. I wanted to live in another reality.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6323bc3b523e10e49132029800fdbb2dbce55fab\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434734466624/2e815bfe-1bb9-4276-abae-67a02fd2c199-460x318.jpeg\" alt=\"Hannah as Pris in the 1982 film Blade Runner.\" width=\"460\" height=\"318\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hannah as Pris in the 1982 film Blade Runner.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The illusion, however, could not last for ever. “I always loved the process, but I was very uncomfortable with the other aspects of the job – the publicity and all that stuff. And I didn’t anticipate that, because I was such a fan of 30s and 40s cinema: I thought it would all be so glamorous. ‘Oh, I’ll be getting out of a car and walking into Grauman’s Chinese theatre, won’t that be so wonderful?’ I didn’t realise that, because I was a self-conscious, picked-on kid, when people were looking at me, I’d feel they were making fun of me.”</p> \n<p>Even when those people were applauding and cheering? “Well, yeah,” she splutters. “Because that was the only attention I was used to. So the attention triggered the same old response. I knew that people were looking at me because I looked weird.”</p> \n<p>It seems safe to assume that the world did not think she looked weird. She was tall, blond and beautiful; the possessor of “one of the 10 best female bodies”, according to McCall’s magazine. Producers fell over themselves to cast her as an object of desire. Off screen, she has had relationships with David Blaine and John F Kennedy Jr; Jackson Browne and Neil Young. But I keep recalling what Hill told me about her curious blend of vulnerability and strength. It occurs to me that many of those early roles installed Hannah as a particularly benighted male fantasy figure: the gauche, innocent child with the body of a woman.</p> \n<p>“Oh no,” she protests. “Not always. Come on.” She mentions 1989’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2IGgZgWj0k\">Steel Magnolias</a>, in which she played a frowsy southern misfit behind thick, horn-rimmed specs. “But, actually, I did a lot of films where I wasn’t playing that role. And, come on – every 20-year-old actress is installed in that way. It’s a male-dominated industry. It’s just a bunch of guys saying: ‘Let’s make the girl younger, and sexy, and hot.’ So, yeah, of course it’s exploitative. And that’s unfortunate because it has the potential to be really transformative in expressing the human condition.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3ac51d5f82944046274d0dd15c7a9802c1ed5c3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434734735948/a03e4d83-24c2-4d23-9979-485590b631aa-460x347.jpeg\" alt=\"Hannah during a protest against oil giant Texaco in Ecuador in 2007.\" width=\"460\" height=\"347\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hannah during a protest against oil giant Texaco in Ecuador in 2007.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Jacome/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In hindsight, she sees that her first 12 months in the business were pure playtime, in that she was able to shoot a bunch of movies unnoticed before the klieg light was switched on. After that, she was stricken. Journalists kept asking about her acting technique, when of course she had no technique; she was making it up as she went along. So, she enrolled in acting classes and immersed herself in Shakespeare and reckons that this was a disaster; it messed her up more than ever. It took her years to reconnect with the skills she had to begin with. “All I was trying to do was to lose myself in the fantasy, just like a kid does in the playground. People kept telling me that it wasn’t enough, to the point where I didn’t know that pretending something and believing it is all that it is. Seriously,” she laughs, “that’s all acting is.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2010/mar/14/the-film-that-changed-daryl-hannah\">As a kid, she loved Judy Garland and longed to be whisked away to the land of Oz</a>. Now she accepts Oz isn’t real and has made her peace with the pretence. The day after our interview, she is going to the south of France, where her elderly mother is having a birthday party. A storybook child might travel there by tornado. A Hollywood star would fly down on a jet. But Hannah prides herself on finding more sensible solutions – a sustainable middle route between these two fantasy worlds. Her ticket is prebooked; she is taking the train.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Sense8 is available on Netflix now.</em></p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434733909575/8fd85206-6311-4efe-8319-7e8f79b73952-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Eric Ray Davidson/Netflix","altText":"Daryl Hannah: 'I wanted to become another person, to live in another reality.'","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Eric Ray Davidson/Netflix"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434734129637/bc292ca1-5012-4ef8-b8d2-8f15905cc8e6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Hannah in the new Netflix series Sense8.

It’s galling to see it misused, if you care about this kind of thing, and especially if it’s being misused by the kind of people who ought to know better.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/21/michael-gove-justice-secretary-civil-servants-grammar-guidelines\">Michael Gove issues civil servants with grammar guidelines</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The problem is that Gove has, as so often in his career, opened himself up to scrutiny and ridicule to the point where you begin to suspect that he is actually doing this for the public’s amusement rather from any genuinely held set of convictions. When commenting on a memo that advises its recipients not to begin a sentence with the word “however”, it is hard not to begin a sentence, in reply, with the word “however”; or to search for examples of Gove’s own published works (for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/jul/20/michael-gove-education-secretary-compassionate-conservatism-divisive-policies\">he used to be a journalist</a>) in which he begins sentences with the word “however”. (And there are quite a few of these examples.)</p> \n<p>And when he goes so far as to tell civil servants they should opt for “does not” instead of “doesn’t” in official communications, or avoid “anything too pompous”, or write “I am sorry to read that …” instead of “I am sorry to hear that …” – an over-literalism that precludes the possibility that the writer may indeed have heard rather than read some news – then once again the familiar Gove is before us. Here is the anxious, insecure man beleaguered by the pace of change in a world becoming alien to him, who sees correct usage as a kind of security blanket, prides himself on his command of the language, and likes to let everyone know it – even when his strictures are contradictory (there will, after all, be times when saying “does not” instead of “doesn’t” verges on pomposity) or simply ridiculous.</p> \n<p>Add to this mix the strong whiff of someone with too much time on his hands and an inclination to didacticism, and we have, in the higher reaches of government, a version of the know-all Harry Enfield character who keeps saying “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkZdTHmX0TQ\">You don’t want to do it like that</a>”. Characters like that have been, as I am sure Gove will know, figures of fun since Chaucer; and the glorious thing about such people – even those who have read Chaucer, as I am sure Gove has – is that they are utterly unaware of their own condition.</p> \n<p>He is, one suspects, the kind of person who will not just sigh inwardly at seeing a sign saying “tomato’s”; he’s the kind of person whom it is not hard to imagine going up to the individual responsible and complaining about it. And if he has not done it yet, it is only a matter of time. There are plenty of public servants – say, the entire teaching profession – who can attest to his tendency to stick his nose in and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2012/oct/17/free-education-political-interference-teacher-control\">make contributions that are not wanted</a>.</p> \n<p>However, all this is to miss the point, or to make light of it for the sake of comedy. There are two clues as to what is really going on. The one in plain sight is his job: however sidelined he may be from the actual levers of power, or from David Cameron’s cosy clique, Gove is, in his own eyes at least, and relative to us, an Important Person. The clue that is tucked away in his instructions is his insistence that when his civil servants refer to rising court fees, a fact due entirely to his party’s policies, they must mention “the need to tackle the economic situation that the government has inherited”.</p> \n<p>So, while it is all very well for him to generously recommend (I split the infinitive gleefully) that they read <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/feb/27/king-for-day-george-orwell-language-consultant-alastair-stewart\">George Orwell</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens\">Christopher Hitchens</a>, such advice would sound a bit better – or read a bit better, if he prefers – if he wasn’t recommending that, every time a certain subject comes up, propaganda should be used; or, as Orwell or Hitchens would have put it: a lie.</p> \n<p>Nicholas Lezard is a literary critic for the Guardian</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434910268889/Michael-Gove-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'However sidelined he may be from the actual levers of power, or from David Cameron’s cosy clique, Gove is, in his own eyes at least, and relative to us, an Important Person.'
