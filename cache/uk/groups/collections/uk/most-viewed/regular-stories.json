Should he say that people who are engaged in paedophilia should be involved in the church?”</p> \n<p>Tinker was repeatedly asked by an interviewer if he was likening homosexuality to paedophilia.</p> \n<p>He responded: “We are talking about moral categories here, and if homosexual sex falls into the immoral category, then it is in the same category as any other immoral action.”</p> \n<p>When reminded that homosexuality is legal, he said: “At one time of course homosexual genital activity was illegal.”</p> \n<p>Tinker accused Smith of “flaunting the scriptures under the banner of equality”. He said: “What we are talking about is whether certain actions are right or wrong in God’s eyes, as he has revealed it in scripture, and also according to natural law as well.”<br /></p> \n<p>Greg Stephenson, chair of <a href=\"http://www.yorkpride.org.uk/\">York Pride</a>, said it was disappointing that such comments are being made in 2015, adding. “It just reinforces why Pride events are so important. There’s more to them than just a big party. It’s to highlight that these kind of comments and views are still out there and that they need changing.”</p> \n<p>About 400 rainbow flags will go up across York as part of Saturday’s march, which organisers hope will attract as many as 5,000 people.<br /></p> \n<p>York Minster, which will drape a 15-metre rainbow flag across its steps, has issued a statement saying that it plans to show its support for the LGBT community. </p> \n<p>“As in previous years, York Pride will begin its parade from outside the west end of York Minster, and for the second year running we are joining other groups in the city of York in showing our support for a section of the community that frequently experiences discrimination and hostility,” it read.<br /> <br /> “York Minster’s invitation to everyone to discover God’s love through our welcome, worship, learning and work is extended to the entire community – both inside and outside of the minster. The Church of England is actively encouraging conversations around human sexuality and it is better to have those conversations with friends.”</p> \n<p>A local group, LGBT Christian Fellowship for Hull and East Riding, has also <a href=\"http://www.lgbtchristianfellowship.co.uk/author/admin/\">issued a statement </a>saying that Tinker did not represent all Christians.</p> \n<p>It said: “Although we have a long way to go, that’s not actually the view of people in the pews.”<br /></p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434749913598/ac6e001d-5de9-4b54-88aa-496a03d140bb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Poller/Zuma Press/Corbis","altText":"A couple pose behind the rainbow flag","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Poller/Zuma Press/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T22:01:09Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T22:44:17Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":799,"contributors":[{"name":"Rebecca Ratcliffe","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rebecca-ratcliffe"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["York","LGBT rights","Christianity","Yorkshire","UK news","Religion","Hull"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/york","webTitle":"York"},{"id":"world/lgbt-rights","webTitle":"LGBT rights"},{"id":"world/christianity","webTitle":"Christianity"},{"id":"uk-news/yorkshire","webTitle":"Yorkshire"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/religion","webTitle":"Religion"},{"id":"uk-news/hull","webTitle":"Hull"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rebecca Ratcliffe","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rebecca-ratcliffe"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/19/hull-vicar-likens-homosexuality-paedophilia-adultery","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4axe7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/19/hull-vicar-likens-homosexuality-paedophilia-adultery","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/hull-vicar-likens-homosexuality-paedophilia-adultery"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434749913598/ac6e001d-5de9-4b54-88aa-496a03d140bb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A couple pose behind the rainbow flag.

We do not think the decision should be questioned,” Putin told journalists on the sidelines of an investment forum in Saint Petersburg.</p> \n<p>“We were ready and that’s what convinced Fifa. The stadium construction has already started.</p> \n<p>The head of Fifa’s auditing and compliance committee, Domenico Scala, this month warned Russia and Qatar could lose the right to host the the 2018 and 2022 World Cups if evidence was found of corruption in the bidding process.</p> \n<p>Putin said Russia supported the corruption inquiry currently unfolding at world football’s governing body but said it was “up to a court to decide if someone was guilty”.</p> \n<p>The president said no evidence had been found of any corruption.</p> \n<p>“If anyone has evidence, let them present it,” he said. “We won in a fair fight and are going to host the World Cup.”<br /></p> \n<p>Putin also insisted Russia wanted to co-operate with Washington and its allies in dealing with the threat posed by Islamic State and other global challenges as he tried to allay investors’ fears over the country’s course.<br /></p> \n<p>Putin blamed the United States for ignoring Russia’s interests and trying to enforce its will on others but he sent conciliatory signals, saying Moscow wanted a quick settlement to the Iranian nuclear standoff and a peaceful political transition in Syria.</p> \n<p>Russia wanted February’s Ukraine peace agreement to succeed, he said. Fighting there would stop once Ukraine provided broader rights to its eastern regions, gave amnesty to the rebels and called local elections.</p> \n<p>The annual event, intended to burnish Russia’s image before global investors, was tarnished by the freezing of Russian accounts in France and Belgium on Thursday as part of an effort to enforce a $50bn judgment to compensate shareholders of the now-defunct Yukos oil company. Putin sought to downplay the freeze and said Russia would contest it. He argued the arbitration court in The Hague, Netherlands, which issued the ruling in 2014, does not have jurisdiction over Russia.</p> \n<p>The court ruled Russia must pay damages to shareholders in the oil company, which was dismantled in a politically driven onslaught that saw its chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, sentenced to 10 years in prison.</p> \n<p>EU and US sanctions over Ukraine have helped push Russia’s economy into recession and cut investment and imports dramatically. Putin, however, argued on Friday the Russian economy was on the path to recovery and the west hurt itself by imposing the sanctions.</p> \n<p>Asked about the downing of a Malaysia Airlines plane over eastern Ukraine last July that killed all 298 people on board and triggered the toughening of western sanctions, Putin said it was necessary to wait for the conclusions of the Dutch Safety Board investigation into the crash.</p> \n<p>Controversy continues over who downed the airliner. Ukraine and the west suspect it was destroyed by a surface-to-air missile fired by Russian soldiers or Russia-backed separatist rebels fighting in the area. Russia denies this. Putin referred to an unofficial report alleging the damage to the Malaysian airliner could have been inflicted by a missile launched from the area held by Ukrainian forces at the time.</p> \n<p>Putin’s speech on the economy lacked any engagement on his part or specific proposals to turn around the economy. A large number of Russian and foreign investors in the audience were reading news or emails on their smartphones as Putin delivered a speech in which he did not address the severe crisis businesses in Russia are facing.</p> \n<p>In contrast to the economy speech, Putin was much more animated while responding to questions about foreign policy.</p> \n<p>His emphasis on foreign affairs has reflected the way the Kremlin has been running Russia since the Ukrainian conflict began. Critics have blamed Putin for sacrificing the country’s economic growth for geopolitical ends such as the 2014 annexation of Crimea.</p> \n<p>David Iakobashvili, founder of Russia’s once-largest beverage company and head of a Russia-US business council, said businessmen have got used to the fact Putin seems to prioritise foreign policy goals over domestic development.</p> \n<p>“It’s very clear today that geopolitics is more important from his point of view,” he said. “But ... we shall adapt to whatever environment has been presented by the government and act accordingly.”</p> \n<p>Addressing the forum, Putin argued Russia wants February’s peace deal for Ukraine to succeed. He said Russia was exerting pressure on the rebels to abide by the agreement and urged the US to encourage Kiev to comply.</p> \n<p>Ukraine and the west have accused Russia of breaking the peace deal by supporting the rebels with troops and weapons. Moscow denies this.</p> \n<p>Commenting on the accusations, Putin said the rebels are defending themselves against the Ukrainian military. He added that “once an attempt is made to solve the problem by political means, those weapons will be gone”.</p> \n<p>In Washington, State Department spokesman John Kirby called on Russia to fully implement February’s ceasefire agreement in Ukraine and remove heavy weapons from the country.</p> \n<p>As for Putin linking the arms to a political solution, Kirby said it was “difficult to have a political solution when you’ve still got thousands of combined Russian separatist forces inside Ukraine fomenting violence and instability, and violating the agreement that they signed up to.”</p> \n<p>Putin used the investment conference as yet another opportunity to blame the US and the European Union for triggering the Ukrainian crisis by refusing to take into account what he described as Russia’s legitimate interests.</p> \n<p>“They have pushed us back to the line beyond which we can’t retreat,” he said. “Russia isn’t seeking hegemony or some ephemeral superpower status.”</p> \n<p>Putin said Russia wants to co-operate with the west in tackling global threats and challenges – including Islamic State, calling the extremist group an “absolute evil” that requires stronger joint efforts to combat.<br /></p> \n<p>Putin also said Russia wants a deal ending the standoff over the Iranian nuclear program to be signed as planned before the end of June, but cautioned against putting “unfulfillable” demands upon Tehran.</p> \n<p>And he also voiced readiness to encourage the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to discuss a peaceful political transition. He explained Moscow’s backing for the Syrian ruler was to prevent the victory of radical forces who would begin a reign of terror.</p> \n<p>“We are ready to work with the president to ensure political transformation, so that all Syrians have access to instruments of power,” he said.</p> \n<p><em>The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report</em></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a470584d42b8c7a70400a85800ed327cb94a1591/0_47_3500_2101/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2101,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images","altText":"Vladimir Putin blamed the United States for ignoring Russia’s interests and trying to enforce its will on others.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-20T02:02:23Z","lastModified":"2015-06-20T07:17:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":676,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Vladimir Putin","Fifa","Russia","Football politics","Football","Sport","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/vladimir-putin","webTitle":"Vladimir Putin"},{"id":"football/fifa","webTitle":"Fifa"},{"id":"world/russia","webTitle":"Russia"},{"id":"football/footballpolitics","webTitle":"Football politics"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/20/putin-fifa-decision-to-grant-world-cup-2018-to-russia-should-not-be-questioned","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4axt2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/20/putin-fifa-decision-to-grant-world-cup-2018-to-russia-should-not-be-questioned","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/20/putin-fifa-decision-to-grant-world-cup-2018-to-russia-should-not-be-questioned"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a470584d42b8c7a70400a85800ed327cb94a1591/0_47_3500_2101/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2101,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Vladimir Putin blamed the United States for ignoring Russia’s interests and trying to enforce its will on others.

Still, I could forgive that …","standFirst":"Miles looked a decade older than the man in his profile picture, and he was balding and had a belly. Still, I could forgive that …","byline":"Stella Grey","body":"<p>Recently, a reply to a hello message that I wrote last autumn arrived out of the blue, apologising drily for the delay. It came from Miles, who is an academic and lives an hour away by train. Miles is round-faced with wild, grey hair and a wide smile. His profile picture, I recalled, was rather dapper (three-piece suit, tie; a picture probably taken at a wedding) and he’d come over as a Glass Three-Quarters Full person, consumed by enthusiasms. His only complaint about life was that there’s not enough time.</p> \n<p>After a brief flurry of mutually reassuring emailing, establishing that there was conversational potential, I was invited to lunch. After a morning of trying on and rejecting dresses, opting for jeans, boots, a T-shirt and blazer, careful, subtle makeup, big jewellery, I nervously took the train to his town, to meet at a restaurant he’d suggested.</p> \n<p>In fact, this was plan B. Originally, he had asked me to his house in a&nbsp;village a further short drive away. “Sod the protocol. Come to my place on Sunday and I’ll cook you lunch and&nbsp;we’ll walk across the fields in the afternoon,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>What seems normal and sensible to one person – a 10-minute lift from the station – is impossible to others. I’m unable to get into a strange man’s car unless it’s a taxi. Nor, needless to say, was I sure about going into a stranger’s kitchen. Miles thought I was being overcautious. Caution will gain us nothing, at this stage of our lives, he said. As he’s 59, about to be 60, this was perhaps a little over-inclusive. Maybe he could cook for me on the second meeting, I suggested. I had already checked his identity, online; academics are easy to validate, at least. His reaction to this idea was positive. Good plan, he said. Let’s do that. Then he sent another email, the night before we met, with pictures of his house – a newbuild, partly designed by him. Beneath the photographs there were thoughts about what he might cook me for lunch on our second date.</p> \n<p>We decided to meet at the restaurant. After that, we’d mooch; there was interesting mooching to be had. Stay for an early evening drink, he said, perhaps an early supper somewhere before heading home. By the time I got to the bistro, it was raining heavily.</p> \n<p>Miles texted to say he would be late. I texted back to say I was already at the table. When he arrived, the man striding towards me, the big smile evident, looked a bit different from the man in the profile picture, but then, no doubt, so did I. He was wearing a cotton polo neck and a giant, plaid shirt. He was broader, a decade older than in the picture, and balding. I wasn’t attracted to him, but I’ve learned not to make snap judgments. Sexual chemistry isn’t always immediate. Sometimes it builds softly and surprises you.</p> \n<p>We ordered and talked about being single in midlife. He’d been divorced for almost 10 years and in the past four, hadn’t had a relationship that lasted more than a month. Perhaps you’re too picky, I told him. My mother’s sure I am. He didn’t ask about my mother or my family or origins, or career. He wanted to talk about ideas, which was fun, if a bit exhausting.</p> \n<p>We ate fish and drank white wine – I&nbsp;drank almost all of it, as he was driving – and then he insisted on paying the bill. He was smiling broadly as he paid. “This has been fun,” he said. “It’s tremendous to meet new people.”</p> \n<p>As I rose from the table – the first time he’d seen me standing up – his eyes went to my hips and thighs, and his smile faltered. We stood in the porch of the restaurant, under its awning, the rain hammering on it. He had already made his decision. Miles, who is heavy, with a belly that I could have forgiven, couldn’t bring himself to see me again. He could give me a lift to the train, he said, but to be honest I’d be as quick to walk. Oh, I said, sounding obviously disappointed, you’re heading straight home? I thought …</p> \n<p>He had work to mark, he said, not looking at me, and it was raining, so best call it a day.

The group’s social-media accounts, normally used to promulgate weapons enthusiasm, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nra\">fall silent</a>.</p> \n<p>On Friday, an NRA spokesperson hewed to that strategy, saying that the group would have no comment “until all the facts are known”.</p> \n<p>“We are praying for the victims and their families and, given the tragic loss, we don’t think this is the time for a political debate,” spokeswoman Jennifer Baker told the Guardian. </p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.nrapublications.org/index.php/17405/charles-cotton/\">Board member</a> Charles Cotton, however, strayed from the script late on Thursday, when he posted a comment online blaming the pastor killed in the South Carolina shooting, Clementa Pinckney, for the death of his eight congregants.</p> \n<p>Cotton, who did not return a message left at his Houston-area law firm, pointed out on a <a href=\"http://texaschlforum.com/\">Texas gun forum</a> that Pinckney was a state senator who had voted against a law allowing gun owners to carry concealed weapons without permits.</p> \n<p>“Eight of his church members who might be alive if he had expressly allowed members to carry handguns in church are dead,” Cotton wrote. “Innocent people died because of his position on a political issue.”</p> \n<p>“Individual board members do not speak for the NRA,” Baker said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/19/rick-perry-charleston-church-shooting-accident\">Rick Perry calls Charleston church shooting an 'accident'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/06/18/3671649/nra-board-member-blames-charleston-victim-death/\">remark</a> has since been deleted. The comment was unusually direct in blaming the victims of gun violence for gun violence. However, like other reactions following mass shootings – from the White House on down – the remark was also an echo. </p> \n<p>“The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” the NRA’s chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, said after the massacre at a Connecticut elementary in December 2012. Then he <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/remarks-from-the-nra-press-conference-on-sandy-hook-school-shooting-delivered-on-dec-21-2012-transcript/2012/12/21/bd1841fe-4b88-11e2-a6a6-aabac85e8036_story.html\">called on</a> Congress to “put armed police officers in every single school in this nation”.</p> \n<p>South Carolina state senator Lee Bright, a Republican who has sponsored legislation to allow citizens to openly carry guns in public, said he supported the right to carry guns in churches, in the interest of self-defense. But he also believes in deferring to the wishes of the property owner. In South Carolina it is legal to carry guns in houses of worship if the leadership allows it.</p> \n<p>“If the leader of the church doesn’t allow you to carry, then obviously you don’t have to go into that church,” Bright said in a phone interview with the Guardian. “I do not know what the policy was at that particular church.”</p> \n<p>Bright called national gun laws a “hodgepodge”.</p> \n<p>“In South Carolina, when I’m driving my car, my weapon has to be concealed,” he said. “When I go up [Interstate] 85, and cross into North Carolina, my weapon has to be visible. In the space of one mile I have to pull over and take out my gun.”</p> \n<p>Allison Anderman, an attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that advocates for gun legislation reform, said the contention that guns stop gun violence was unrealistic.</p> \n<p>“The fantasy that someone could react in an active shooter situation to disarm the shooter is just that, a fantasy,” she said. “When you have a roomful of people with guns it doesn’t take a lot of imagination to understand what’s likely to happen.”</p> \n<p>After the latest mass shooting, gun control groups emphasized the redundancy of the problem. </p> \n<p>“Once again, a senseless act of gun violence has brought terror, tragedy and pain to one of our communities,” said a <a href=\"http://americansforresponsiblesolutions.org/2015/06/18/charlestonshootingstatement/\">statement</a> from Americans for Responsible Solutions, a group affiliated with former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and astronaut Mark Kelly.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457208996__\n</div> \n<p>Addressing the mass shooting on Thursday, President Barack Obama also found himself repeating himself. “At some point it’s going to be important for the American people to come to grips with it, and for us to be able to shift how we think about the issue of gun violence collectively,” he said at the White House.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/18/obama-gun-violence-south-carolina-newtown\">Obama on gun violence: six years of statements but change remains elusive</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The words recalled an impassioned speech he gave in April 2013 after the failure in the Senate of legislation requiring universal background checks for gun purchases. “When Newtown happened, I met with these families and I spoke to the community, and I said, something must be different right now,” Obama said then. “We’re going to have to change. That’s what the whole country said … Sooner or later, we are going to get this right.”</p> \n<p>Late on Friday, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/19/barack-obama-charleston-shooting-i-refuse-to-act-as-if-this-is-the-new-normal\">Obama made a more forceful call for action</a>, saying his earlier comments had been misinterpreted.</p> \n<p>“I am not resigned,” he said. “I have faith that we will eventually do the right thing. I was simply making the point that we have to move public opinion. We have to feel a sense of urgency.”</p> \n<p>Anderman, of the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said it was too early to speculate about what laws may have prevented the suspect in the attack, 21-year-old Dylann Roof, from acquiring a weapon. Roof’s criminal record reflects that he was arrested and charged <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/18/dylann-roof-south-carolina-charleston-shooting-suspect\">with felony possession of Suboxone</a>, a narcotic prescription drug. Due to this record, he would not have been able to buy it from a dealer or a store, which is required run a federal background check.</p> \n<p>The law center annually grades all 50 states’ gun laws. In 2014, the group gave South Carolina a <a href=\"http://gunlawscorecard.org/\">failing grade</a> for its less restrictive laws. The state does not require a background check prior to <a href=\"http://smartgunlaws.org/private-sales-policy-summary/\">the transfer of a firearm between unlicensed individuals</a>; nor the <a href=\"http://smartgunlaws.org/mental-health-reporting-policy-summary/\">reporting of mental health information</a> to the federal database. The state also does not regulate the transfer or possession of <a href=\"http://smartgunlaws.org/assault-weapons-policy-summary/\">assault weapons</a> or <a href=\"http://smartgunlaws.org/large-capacity-ammunition-magazines-policy-summary/\">large capacity ammunition magazines</a>.<br /></p> \n<p>This time around, it was left to Cornell William Brooks, president of the NAACP, to find new language to describe the shooting.</p> \n<p>“This was not merely a mass shooting. Not merely an incident of gun violence,” Brooks said Friday. “This was a racial hate crime.”</p> \n<p>For all the rote speech that attends mass shootings in the United States, “racial hate crime” stood out as an uncommon phrase.</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/6d352a3fe67316118ee9da91d67322731c97491f/0_54_3000_1799/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1799,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Win McNamee/Getty Images","altText":"The nine victims killed in Charleston","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T19:51:51Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T22:38:22Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":848,"contributors":[{"name":"Tom McCarthy","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/tommccarthy"},{"name":"Lauren Gambino","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/13/1413212606419/Lauren-Gambino-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/lauren-gambino"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["US gun control","South Carolina","South Carolina church shooting","NRA"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/gun-control","webTitle":"US gun control"},{"id":"us-news/south-carolina","webTitle":"South Carolina"},{"id":"world/south-carolina-church-shooting","webTitle":"South Carolina church shooting"},{"id":"us-news/nra","webTitle":"NRA"}],"section":{"id":"us-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-457208996","source":"Reuters","durationInSeconds":131,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/18/150618ObamaCharleston.m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/18/150618ObamaCharleston_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/18/1434648555938/KP_300204_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Barack Obama on Charleston shootings: the American people need to get to grips with gun control  video","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Barack Obama on Charleston shootings: the American people need to get to grips with gun control  video","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Barack Obama on Charleston shootings: the American people need to get to grips with gun control  video"}}],"adTargetingPath":"us-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/19/nra-mass-shootings-south-carolina-church","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4axej","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/us-news/2015/jun/19/nra-mass-shootings-south-carolina-church","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/19/nra-mass-shootings-south-carolina-church"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/6d352a3fe67316118ee9da91d67322731c97491f/0_54_3000_1799/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1799,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Photographs of the nine victims killed at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in Charleston, South Carolina are held up by congregants during a prayer vigil at the the Metropolitan AME Church 19 June 2015 in Washington DC.
