George Osborne will hand responsibility for Sunday trading laws to Britain’s towns and cities, allowing them to decide how long shops can stay open, in a move that will put an end to the national ban on large stores staying open for more than six hours.<br /></p> \n<p>The six-hour rule was relaxed for six weeks in July 2012 during the Olympics, resulting in a relatively significant surge in sales. The Liberal Democrats, then part of the coalition government, opposed a permanent relaxation at the time, insisting that Sunday should remain special and that the compromise between consumers, traders, shopworkers and the religious should be retained.</p> \n<p>Osborne has decided that verdicts on similar relaxations of the law should in future be taken at a local level, so that areas that think longer opening hours would boost economic activity would be free to do so. The supermarkets are divided over the wisdom of opening hours for longer on Sunday.</p> \n<p>The budget is expected to announce a consultation on two proposals: devolving power over Sunday trading law to elected mayors, and also to local authorities. If the reform was only handed to elected mayors, it would have a much slower impact since the number of mayors is going to be limited for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<p>Osborne said: “Even two decades on from the introduction of the Sunday Trading Act, it is clear that there is still a growing appetite for shopping on a Sunday. There is some evidence that transactions for Sunday shopping are actually growing faster than those for Saturday.</p> \n<p>“The rise of online shopping, which people can do round the clock, also means more retailers want to be able to compete by opening for longer at the weekend. But this won’t be right for every area, so I want to devolve the power to make this decision to mayors and local authorities.</p> \n<p>“This will be another part of my plan to ensure a truly national recovery, with our great towns and cities able to determine their own futures.”</p> \n<p>Sunday trading laws allow all stores to open for six hours between 10am and 6pm, while small shops covering less than 3,000 sq ft, or less than 280 square metres, can open all day.</p> \n<p>The lobby group Open Sundays claims the reform would bring in &pound;20.3bn over 20 years to the British economy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/06/guardian-view-on-benefit-cap-disgraceful-policy-george-osborne-budget\">The Guardian view on the benefit cap: a disgraceful policy that’s about to get worse | Editorial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At the time of the temporary exemption for the Olympics, John Hannett, general secretary of the shopworkers’ union, Usdaw, said: “Usdaw remains vehemently opposed to the deregulation of Sunday trading and we expect the government to abide by its commitment that this summer’s temporary suspension will not lead to any further attempts to extend Sunday opening hours.</p> \n<p>“The government failed to make a coherent business case for the suspension and there is no evidence that it will boost the economy or tourism.”</p> \n<p>Under existing laws, shopworkers have a right to opt out of Sunday working but, in practice, that right can be reduced if employers put pressure on their staff.</p> \n<p>Research by the New West End Company, the London business voice for the West End, has shown that extending Sunday trading by two hours in London alone would create nearly 3,000 jobs, and generate more than &pound;200m a year in extra income. Reform would bring Britain in line with its international competitors.

For some, the past dozen years had taken no obvious toll on their body’s biology.<br /></p> \n<p> But others were not so fortunate. A good many participants had biological ages in the 50s, while one, described by scientists as an “extreme case”, had a biological age of 61 years old. That meant that for every birthday over the past dozen years, their body had aged three years.</p> \n<p>“The overwhelming majority are biologically in their mid-40s or younger, but there are a handful of cases who are in pretty bad shape. In the future, we’ll come to learn about the different lives that fast and slow ageing people have lived,” said Daniel Belsky at Duke University in North Carolina.<br /></p> \n<p>The researchers drew on data gathered on 871 people enrolled in the Dunedin study, a major investigation that has tracked the health and broader lives of around 1000 New Zealanders born in 1972 or 1973 in the town of Dunedin, New Zealand. Of the original group, 30 had died by the age of 38 due to serious diseases such as cancer, or by accidents, suicides and drug overdoses. <br /></p> \n<p>“Our goal was to see if we can measure ageing in young people,” said Belsky. “It’s becoming increasingly clear that ageing is really the cause of much of the disease and disability burden we face, but our existing science is based on ageing in older people who already have a lot of age-related diseases.”<br /></p> \n<p>According to Belsky, studying ageing in younger people gives researchers the best chance of teasing apart the biological changes that drive ageing from those that underpin specific diseases.<br /></p> \n<p>The scientists drew up a list of 18 biological markers that together reflect a person’s biological age. They included measures of kidney and liver function, cholesterol levels, cardiovascual fitness and the lengths of teleomeres, which are protective caps that sit on the ends of chromosomes. <br /></p> \n<p>The set of markers were measured when the volunteers were aged 26, then 32, and finally at the age of 38. The researchers then looked to see how much the markers changed over time, to produce a “pace of ageing” figure.<br /></p> \n<p>Across the group, the biological ages of the 38-year-olds varied from 28 to 61. If a 38-year-old had a biological age of 40, it implied a “pace of ageing” of 1.2 years per year over the 12 year study period. Details of the study are published in <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1506264112\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>.<br /></p> \n<p>“Even before they develop age-related diseases, their physiology shows signs, and there is great variation in how fast people ageed in the past 12 years,” Belsky said.<br /></p> \n<p>People with older biological ages fared worse on tests that are typically given to people over 60. These included tests of balance and coordination, but also mental tasks, such as solving unfamiliar problems. The biologically older people also reported more difficulties with activities like walking up the stairs.<br /></p> \n<p>The scientists went on to see whether volunteers’ biological ages matched how they old they looked. They invited students to view photos of the study participants and guess their ages. The biologically older people were consistently rated as looking older than their 38 years. <br /></p> \n<p>“Already, before midlife, individuals who were ageing more rapidly were less physically able, showed cognitive decline and brain ageing, self-reported worse health, and looked older,” the scientists write.<br /></p> \n<p>The next step in the research is to sift through the lives of the Dunedin participants to see how factors such as lifestyle, medical history, family circumstances, and stressful events might affect the speed at which people age. <br /></p> \n<p>Belsky called the study a “proof of concept” for using biological markers to measure the ageing process in people who are too young to have age-related diseases. An objective measure of biological age, he said, could be used to assess whether new anti-ageing therapies work or not in a reasonable time frame. <br /></p> \n<p>“What we need are measurements that can show whether these therapies are working, so we don’t have to wait 50 years to see if someone is still alive or not. We want a real-time barometer of how a peson is doing, and whether the therapy is really changing their rate of ageing,” he said.<br /></p> \n<p>The ultimate goal is to target ageing instead of the multiple separate diseases that people are increasingly likely to develop as they age. “As we get older, our risk grows for all kinds of different diseases. To prevent multiple diseases simultaneously, ageing itself has to be the target,” Belsky said.<br /></p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/049f6baaf8be940f8482152d0cc527505391300a/0_0_5434_3263/5434.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3263,"width":5434,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dimitri Otis/Getty Images","altText":"Scientists believe that measuring ageing in younger people will allow them to explore age-related disease and disability.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dimitri Otis/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T19:00:01Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T23:24:20Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":625,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian Sample","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733739319/IanSample.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/iansample"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Ageing","Science","Biology","Medical research"],"tags":[{"id":"science/ageing","webTitle":"Ageing"},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science"},{"id":"science/biology","webTitle":"Biology"},{"id":"science/medical-research","webTitle":"Medical research"}],"section":{"id":"science"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ian Sample","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/iansample"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"science"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/jul/06/old-before-your-time-people-age-at-wildly-different-rates-study-confirms","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4adnn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/science/2015/jul/06/old-before-your-time-people-age-at-wildly-different-rates-study-confirms","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/06/old-before-your-time-people-age-at-wildly-different-rates-study-confirms"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/049f6baaf8be940f8482152d0cc527505391300a/0_0_5434_3263/5434.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3263,"width":5434,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Scientists believe that measuring ageing in younger people will allow them to explore age-related disease and disability.

It marks the first time that the actor has been heard, in his own words, directly referring to purchasing drugs for use in a sexual context.</p> \n<p>The court documents include transcripts of the deposition of Cosby on 27 and 28 September 2005. In the course of the depositions, the comic was asked several questions about his purchasing of drugs, leading to tense exchanges between his lawyer Patrick O’Connor and a lawyer for Constand, Dolores Troiani.</p> \n<p>During the deposition, Cosby said that he had obtained seven prescriptions for the sedative quaalude.</p> \n<p>“You gave them to other people?” he was asked.</p> \n<p>“Yes,” he replied.</p> \n<p>When Troiani tried to elicit from Cosby whether he had given the drug to other people knowing that to be illegal, O’Connor intervened, instructing his client not to answer.</p> \n<p>“When you got the quaaludes, was it in your mind that you were going to use these quaaludes for young women you wanted to have sex with?” asked Troiani.</p> \n<p>“Yes,” replied Cosby.</p> \n<p>Asked whether he had given young women the drug without their knowledge, the lawyer again intervened, advising him not to answer.</p> \n<p>Cosby told the deposition that he got the quaaludes prescriptions in the 1970s and then kept them for several years.</p> \n<p>The documents also include details of questions Cosby was asked under deposition about another woman, one of the so-called “Jane Does” who were called anonymously to give evidence in the Constand case. The woman told lawyers that at the age of 19 she met with Cosby and had sex with him after he gave her quaaludes.</p> \n<p>In his deposition, Cosby said he met the witness in Las Vegas: “She meets me backstage. I give her quaaludes. We then have sex.” Cosby then goes on to say: “I can’t judge at this time what she knows about herself for 19 years, a passive personality.”</p> \n<p>Cosby adds that the witness was “sweet in her personality. As far as I was concerned was well-mannered, didn’t demand or give a feeling that she was above anyone. If anything, I think she may very well have been very happy to be around the showbusiness surroundings.”</p> \n<p>“Starstruck?” he was asked.</p> \n<p>“You’ll have to ask her,” Cosby replied.</p> \n<p>The public opening of the documents comes at the end of a tough legal struggle for the Associated Press. On 17 June, lawyers representing the news agency delivered a motion to the federal courthouse for the eastern district of Pennsylvania requesting that they be included as an interested party for the unsealing of the court documents, including Cosby’s testimony.</p> \n<p>Cosby’s lawyers argued that the unsealing of the documents would be “terribly embarrassing” for their client, the AP reported in June. But, on Monday, their request was granted by judge Eduardo Robreno.</p> \n<p>Explaining his decision to release the papers, Robreno is scathing about Cosby’s claim that he had a right to privacy. He said that Cosby had “donned the mantle of public moralist and mounted the proverbial electronic or print soap box to volunteer his views on, among other things, childrearing, family life, education, and crime. To the extent that Defendant has freely entered the public square and thrust himself into the vortex of th[ese] public issues he has voluntarily narrowed the zone of privacy that he is entitled to claim.”</p> \n<p>Robreno said the public had a “significant interest” in the “stark contrast between Bill Cosby, the public moralist and Bill Cosby, the subject of serious allegations concerning improper (and perhaps criminal) conduct”.</p> \n<p>The judge concludes: “The nature of the allegations – sex, drugs, seduction, etc – do not cloak this case, including the depositions of one of the parties, with an automatic, or per se, seal of silence.”</p> \n<p>Since the allegations of sexual misconduct resurfaced last year, the comic has faced renewed legal actions against him. But so far all of them have floundered on the rock of time – the statute of limitations that restricts the period after an alleged crime in which prosecutions can be brought.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436226471159/2adfbc9d-eeae-4d17-99bb-0719691fc48e-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Al Pereira","altText":"Bill Cosby.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Al Pereira"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T07:32:21Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T07:32:24Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ed Pilkington","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/edpilkington"},{"name":"Nicky Woolf","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nicky-woolf"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Bill Cosby","US news","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/bill-cosby","webTitle":"Bill Cosby"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#005689","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#005689","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#63717a","colourPalette":"analysis"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/07/bill-cosby-court-documents-legal-problems","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aexv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/07/bill-cosby-court-documents-legal-problems","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/07/bill-cosby-court-documents-legal-problems"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436226471159/2adfbc9d-eeae-4d17-99bb-0719691fc48e-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bill Cosby has continued to perform even as more and more allegations against him have been made.

Tsipras also sacrificed his controversial finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, in what was seen as a conciliatory signal towards Greece’s creditors.</p> \n<p>In Paris, Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande tried to plot a common strategy after Greeks returned a resounding no to five years of eurozone-scripted austerity. The two leaders were trying to find a joint approach to the growing crisis ahead of an emergency eurozone summit on Tuesday to deal with the fallout.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The prospects of a happy resolution of this crisis are rapidly diminishing</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Chancellor George Osborne</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But Merkel said there was no current basis for negotiating with the Greek side and called on Tsipras to make the next move.</p> \n<p>As eurozone leaders prepared for today’s emergency summit in Brussels, the heads of government were at odds. France, Italy and Spain are impatient for a deal while Germany, the European commission and northern Europe seem content to let Greece stew and allow the euphoria following Sunday’s vote to give way to the sobering realities of bank closures, cash shortages and isolation.</p> \n<p>Greek banks are to remain closed until Thursday at the earliest, it was announced, with ATM withdrawals rationed to €60 daily.</p> \n<p> “The prospects of a happy resolution of this crisis are rapidly diminishing,” said the British chancellor, George Osborne, after speaking to some of the key policymakers. “If there is no signal from these meetings that Greece and the eurozone are ready to get around the table again, we can expect the financial situation in Greece to deteriorate rapidly.”</p> \n<p>The commission had nothing positive at all to say about Sunday’s Greek referendum, while Germany’s increasingly hardline social democratic leader, Sigmar Gabriel, warned that Greece was on the brink of insolvency. </p> \n<p>He accused Tsipras, the radical leftist prime minister who outmanoeuvred the rest of the eurozone with his plebiscite, of ruthlessly pursuing the Greek national interest at everyone else’s expense. His message suggested a Grexit was now inevitable as he stressed the need for EU humanitarian programmes to forestall social implosion in Greece.</p> \n<p>Tsipras is expected to table new bailout proposals on Tuesday to eurozone leaders meeting in Brussels after he ditched the flamboyant Varoufakis. Over five months of negotiations, Varoufakis, a leftwing economist and neophyte politician, has rubbed his interlocutors up the wrong way, persistently arguing he is right and everyone else is wrong when it comes to dealing with the Greek debt crisis. </p> \n<p> The detail of Sunday’s voting patterns left no doubt about the devastating verdict and the challenges it now presents to Europe’s leaders. Around 80% of voters under the age of 34 voted no on Sunday.<br /></p> \n<p>Germany’s Gabriel said the Greeks had simply rejected the single currency rules, while Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, delivered a cri de coeur lamenting the desperate situation the eurozone and the EU now found themselves in.</p> \n<p> “Two political building sites need our work urgently, in European capitals and in Brussels,” he said. “If we stand still, prisoners of rules, regulations, and bureaucracy, Europe is over. Reconstructing a different Europe will not be easy … The first one is Greece, a country in very difficult social and economic conditions. Meetings tomorrow will have to indicate a conclusive solution to this emergency.”</p> \n<p>Merkel has taken a hard line with Greece since Tsipras announced his snap referendum 10 days ago, while the French have been much more accommodating towards Athens. A brief statement issued after the leaders had dined together on Monday evening showed little sign of the two main EU leaders bridging their differences.</p> \n<p>There were no signs either of movement from the eurozone towards the main demands from Athens – a new deal writing down the Greek debt mountain, as urged last week by the International Monetary Fund.</p> \n<p>German government sources said there would be no debt reduction measures offered and that it was up to Greece, which ended negotiations with its creditors 10 days ago and called the referendum, to make the next move.</p> \n<p>“In light of the decision by the Greek citizens, the conditions to start negotiations on a new aid programme are not met yet,” said Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert.</p> \n<p>Valdis Dombrovskis, the most senior European commission official in charge of the euro, said the referendum result risked leaving everyone a loser. “The no result unfortunately widens the gulf between <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/greece\">Greece</a> and other eurozone countries … There is no easy way out of this crisis. Too much time and too many opportunities have been lost.”</p> \n<p>A day of frantic politicking in Greece, and internationally, left few clues as to what happens next. Tsipras has persistently surprised and out-manoeuvred his opposite numbers, but without securing any net gains for a country in the throes of financial collapse. Greece’s bank holiday and the rationing of ATM withdrawals to €60 a day was extended until at least Thursday.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/06/greek-referendum-alexis-tsipras-moment-triumph-may-be-brief\">Greek referendum: smart response from Tsipras, but triumph may be brief</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The country’s banks are entirely dependent on the European Central Bank to keep standing and last night the ECB toughened it stance towards Greece’s banks by demanding they put up more collateral in return for the emergency liquidity allowance which has been keeping them afloat. The ECB said its government council is “closely monitoring the situation in financial markets and the potential implications for the monetary policy stance and for the balance of risks to price stability in the euro area”.</p> \n<p>Tsipras spent much of the day with other Greek party leaders, resulting in the five-party national consensus behind his negotiating strategy committed to debt restructuring. Tsipras’s leftwing Syriza, and his rightwing nationalist coalition partner, Anel, were joined by centre-left Pasok, liberals To Potami, and centre-right New Democracy.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457418978__\n</div> \n<p>Tsipras’s ‘new’ proposals are likely to lean heavily on his recently tabled third bailout ideas, which call for €29bn in new loans over a two-year period under the eurozone’s ESM permanent bailout fund, combined with a debt swap that would see the ESM buy up Greece’s obligations to the European Central Bank and convert this into longer-term loans at cheaper rates. Greece would have to commit to many of the austerity measures that were roundly rejected by voters on Sunday. </p> \n<p>Gabriel, however, emphasised the problems of devising a new bailout under the ESM, whose rules are more exacting than those for the eurozone instrument used for the previous bailouts since 2010.</p> \n<p>The ESM rules say that a bailout can be considered for a eurozone country if its financial plight imperils the stability of the euro area as a whole. Many argue that this is not the case with Greece, that there is little risk of contagion and destabilisation of the broader currency area.

The difference between the experience of the two continents is that at least Americans did not have to labour under the enormous design faults of the eurozone. Imagine their chagrin if the citizens of hard-hit states (eg Nevada or Ohio) had to worry about a death embrace between the debt of their state and the losses of the banks who happened to operate within the state.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Europe's architecture was not sound enough to sustain the shock waves from the death throes of neoliberal capitalism</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Additionally, Americans were spared the need to contend with a central bank utterly shackled by inner divisions and the German central bank’s penchant for treating the worst-hit parts of the union (the eurozone, that is) as alien lands that had to be fiscally waterboarded until they ceased to obey the laws of macroeconomics.</p> \n<p>In the past two years, the debate in Europe has focused exclusively on issues that sound technical and minor: will there be “<a href=\"http://www.e-ir.info/2013/11/01/eu-conditionality-an-effective-means-for-policy-reform/\" title=\"\">conditionality</a>” attached to the purchases of Italian and Spanish bonds by the European Central Bank? Will the ECB supervise all of Europe’s banks, or just the “<a href=\"http://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-analysis-and-data/global-systemically-important-institutions\" title=\"\">systemic</a>” ones?</p> \n<p>These are questions that ought to be of no genuine interest to anyone other than those with a morbid interest in the interface between public finance and monetary policy. And yet these questions (and the manner in which they will be answered) will probably prove as important for the future of Europe as the treaties of <a href=\"http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/treaty-westphalia\" title=\"\">Westphalia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.history.co.uk/study-topics/history-of-ww2/treaty-of-versailles\" title=\"\">Versailles</a> or even <a href=\"http://www.civitas.org.uk/eufacts/FSTREAT/TR1.php\" title=\"\">Rome</a>. For these are the issues that will determine whether Europe holds together or succumbs to the vicious centrifugal forces that were unleashed by the crash of 2008.</p> \n<p>Even so, they are not issues that are worth expounding upon here. All they do is to reflect a tragic, underlying reality that can be described in simple lay terms without the use of any jargon whatsoever: Europe is disintegrating because its architecture was simply not sound enough to sustain the shockwaves caused by the death throes of what I call the Global Minotaur: the system of neoliberal capitalism centred on Wall Street, extracting tribute from the world after 1971.</p> \n<p>It is quite obvious that the insolvency of Madrid and Rome had nothing to do with fiscal profligacy (recall that Spain had a lower debt than Germany in 2008 and Italy has consistently smaller budget deficits) and everything to do with the way in which the eurozone’s macroeconomy relied significantly for the demand of its net exports on the Global Minotaur. Once the latter keeled over in 2008, and Wall Street’s private cash disappeared, two effects brought Europe to its knees.</p> \n<p>One was the sequential death-embrace of bankrupt banks and insolvent states (beginning with Greece, moving to Ireland, to Portugal and continuing until Italy and Spain were torn asunder). The other was the Minotaur’s simulacrum and its determination to hang on to its option of exiting the eurozone at will, therefore denying each and every rational plan for mending the currency union in a sustainable manner.</p> \n<p>The telling question thus becomes: why such resistance, particularly from Germany, to every idea that would end the euro crisis? The standard answer is that Germany does not wish to pay for the debts of the periphery and will resist all federal-like moves (eg a banking or a fiscal union) until it is convinced that its partners will behave responsibly with their German-backed finances. While this captures well the mindset of many northern Europeans, it is beside the point. Consider the following mental experiment, which, I believe, helps us unveil a deeper motive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59a5a0bafe62f78e9b14b60ce82392f00d4d9e0d\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/59a5a0bafe62f78e9b14b60ce82392f00d4d9e0d/0_0_3765_2258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Angela Merkel and Sigmar Gabriel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Angela Merkel and the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Kumm/dpa/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Picture the scene when a sheepish finance minister enters the chancellor’s Berlin office bearing a control panel featuring one yellow and one red button, and telling her that she must choose to press one or the other. This is how he explains what each button will do:</p> \n<h2>The red button<br /></h2> \n<p>If you press it, chancellor, the euro crisis ends immediately, with a general rise in growth throughout Europe, a <a href=\"https://www.bundesbank.de/Navigation/EN/Statistics/Public_finances/Maastricht_deficit_and_debt_level/maastricht_deficit_and_debt_level.html\" title=\"\">sudden collapse of debt for each member state to below its Maastricht limit</a>, no pain for Greek citizens (or for the Italians, Portuguese, etc), no guarantees for the periphery’s debts (states or banks) to be provided by German and Dutch taxpayers, interest rate spreads below 3% throughout the eurozone, a diminution in the eurozone’s internal imbalances, and a wholesale rise in aggregate investment.</p> \n<h2>The yellow button</h2> \n<p>If you press it, chancellor, the situation in the eurozone remains more or less as it is for a decade. The euro crisis continues to bubble along, albeit in a controlled fashion. While the probability of a break-up, which will be a calamity for Germany, remains non-trivial, the chances are that, if you push the yellow button, the eurozone will not break up (with a little help from the European Central Bank), German interest rates will remain extremely low, the euro will be nicely depressed (‘nicely’ from the perspective of German exporters), the periphery’s spreads will be sky-high (but not explosive), Italy and Spain will enter deeper into a debt-deflationary spiral that sees to a reduction of their national income by 15% over the next three years, France shall slip steadily into quasi-insolvency, GDP per capita will rise slowly in the surplus countries and fall precipitously in the periphery. As for the first “fallen” nations (Greece, Ireland and Portugal), they shall become little Latvias, or indeed Kosovos: devastated lands (after the loss of between 25% and 40% of national income, a massive exodus of their skilled labour) on which our people will holiday and buy cheap real estate. In aggregate, if you choose the yellow button, chancellor, eurozone unemployment will remain well above UK and US levels, investment will be anaemic, growth negative and poverty on the up and up.</p> \n<p>Which button do you think, dear reader, the chancellor would want to push?</p> \n<p>Whereas the yellow button would hold no attraction for the American president or the British prime minister, for the German chancellor the yellow button is a far more powerful option. Even if the chancellor wanted to opt for the red button, she would be terrorised by the reaction of the German electorate were she to do so. Letting the Greeks and the Italians, the Spaniards and the Portuguese, off the hook of their Great Depression so “easily” would be unlikely to win many votes east of the Rhine and north of the Alps.</p> \n<p>For two years now, the German public has become convinced that Germany has escaped the worst of the crisis because of its people’s virtuous embracing of thriftiness and hard work; in contrast to the spendthrift southerners, who, like the fickle grasshopper, made no provision for when the winds of finance would turn cold and nasty.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The Minotaur’s surplus recycling was essential to the maintenance of the eurozone’s faulty edifice</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>This mindset goes hand in hand with a moral righteousness which implants into good people’s hearts and minds a penchant for exacting punishment on the grasshoppers – even if punishing them also punishes themselves (to some extent). It also goes hand in hand with a radical misunderstanding of what kept the eurozone healthy and Germany in surplus prior to 2008: that is, the Global Minotaur whose demand-generation antics were for decades allowing countries like Germany and the Netherlands to remain net exporters of capital and consumer goods within and without the eurozone (while importing US-sourced demand for their goods from the eurozone’s periphery).</p> \n<p>Interestingly, one of the great secrets of the post-2008 period is that the Minotaur’s death adversely affected aggregate demand in the eurozone’s surplus countries (Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland) more than it did the deficit member states (like Italy, Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece). While the sudden withdrawal of capital from the deficit countries brought about their insolvency, countries like Germany saw their “fundamentals” more grievously affected by the crash of 2008. This fact, in conjunction with the terrible squeeze on German wages, explains the deeper causes of the animosity in places like Germany that so very easily translates into anger against the Greeks and assorted Mediterraneans – feelings that are then reciprocated, thus giving the wheel of intra-European animosities another spin, favouring the rise of xenophobia, even Nazism (in countries like Greece, quite incredibly), and thus leading to a wholesale readiness to push all the yellow, as opposed to the red, buttons in sight.</p> \n<p>To recap, the Minotaur’s surplus recycling was essential to the maintenance of the eurozone’s faulty edifice. Once it vanished from the scene, the European common currency area would either be redesigned or it would enter a long, painful period of disintegration. An unwillingness by the surplus countries to accept that, in the post-Minotaur world, some other form of surplus recycling is necessary (and that some of their own surpluses must also be subject to such recycling) is the reason why Europe is looking like a case of alchemy-in-reverse: for whereas the alchemist strove to turn lead into gold, Europe’s reverse alchemists began with gold (an integration project that was the pride of its elites) but will soon end up with the institutional equivalent of lead.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>This is an extract from Yanis Varoufakis’s book </em><a href=\"http://www.zedbooks.co.uk/paperback/the-global-minotaur-0\" title=\"\"><em>The Global Minotaur: America, Europe and the Future of the Global Economy</em></a><em>, published by Zed Books</em></p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436202066668/Greeks-celebrate-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Greeks celebrate as early opinion polls predict a referendum win for the no campaign.
