But the fate of her two step-grandparents, who were also on board, remained unclear.</p> \n<p>Family members alerted authorities when the Beech A-35 light plane failed to complete its flight from Kalispell, Montana, to Lynden, Washington state, on Saturday afternoon. Rescuers narrowed down a search area based on cellphone data and typical flight patterns. But there was no sign of the aircraft or its occupants until Autumn Veatch, 16, followed a trail to Highway 20, near the east entrance to North Cascades national park.</p> \n<p>A motorist picked her up on Monday afternoon and drove her 30 miles east to a general store in Mazama, where employees called 911. The Aero Methow Rescue Service sent a paramedic team to check her out before she was taken to a hospital in Brewster for treatment of what appeared to be minor injuries, said Cindy Button, director of services at the organisation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jan/03/girl-7-walks-plane-crash-kentucky-killed-all-four-others-on-board\">Girl, 7, walks free from Kentucky plane crash which killed four</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Our initial information is she sustained no life-threatening injuries and is somewhat dehydrated due to being out in the elements,” said Scott Graham, chief executive officer at Three Rivers hospital. The girl was being evaluated on Monday evening, he said.</p> \n<p>Okanogan County Sheriff Frank Rogers said she had been “walking for a couple of days”. He declined to comment on the status of the other two people who had been on the plane.</p> \n<p>Serena Lockwood, the manager at the Mazama Store, said the girl and a motorist came in on Monday afternoon. “She was obviously pretty traumatized,” Lockwood said.</p> \n<p>Rescuers celebrated Veatch’s survival but immediately returned their focus to finding the wreckage, aided by Veatch’s description of the crash site, said Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Lustick of the Civil Air Patrol. Lustick said he could not confirm any details about the condition of the grandparents, Leland and Sharon Bowman of Marion, Montana.</p> \n<p>“We’re so happy about this,” Lustick said. “I’ve spent 30 years in the Civil Air Patrol and in search and rescue. Moments of joy like this can be hard to find.”</p> \n<p>Lustick said he had spoken with Veatch’s father, who said his daughter told him the plane crashed and caught fire after flying into a bank of clouds. She remained at the crash site for a day before deciding to hike down, eventually finding a trail and following it to the trailhead on Highway 20.</p> \n<p>Five aircraft equipped with special radios for detecting the missing plane’s emergency locator beacon had been searching the mountains on Monday along with ground crews, officials said.</p> \n<p>The plane crossed the Idaho-Washington border about 2.20pm on Saturday but it dropped off the radar near Omak, Washington state, about an hour later, transportation officials said.

Half the fund will be used to recapitalise Greek banks, while the remaining €25bn will pay down Greek debts as well as be investmented.</p> \n<p>Determined to keep his party together ahead of an expected onslaught by MPs opposing the outlined deal, Tsipras summoned his closest allies to a meeting in Athens before a gathering of his parliamentary party on Tuesday.<br /></p> \n<p>The former Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, has called the deal “unviable” and likened it to the 1919 Versailles treaty – widely seen as the harbinger of the second world war for its crushing of Weimar Germany.</p> \n<p>“This has nothing to do with economics. It has nothing to do with putting Greece back on the rails towards recovery,” Varoufakis told Australia’s public broadcaster, the ABC.</p> \n<p>“This is a new Versailles treaty that is haunting Europe again, and the prime minister [Alexis Tsipras] knows it. He knows he’s damned if he does and he’s damned if he doesn’t.”</p> \n<p>The leader of Tsipras’s coalition partner, the populist Independent Greeks, said he could not support a key element of the proposals that he described as “barbaric”.<br /></p> \n<p>Panos Kammenos said a demand that Athens hands over €50bn in assets from privatisations as collateral for fresh loans was a form of “confiscation” and “we cannot agree to that”.<br /></p> \n<p>The level of hostility engendered by the accord ensures that Greece is likely to be plunged into prolonged political tumult.

The vote, which was promised in the Conservative manifesto, is now almost certain not to pass, as Labour will be whipped to vote against it as well.</p> \n<p>Angus Robertson, the SNP leader in Westminster, said it was “right and proper” to assert the Scottish interest on foxhunting given that there are moves in Holyrood to toughen up Scotland’s law on the issue.<br /></p> \n<p>“We totally oppose foxhunting and, when there are moves in the Scottish parliament to review whether the existing Scottish ban is strong enough, it is in the Scottish interest to maintain the existing ban in England and Wales for Holyrood to consider,” he said. </p> \n<p>Robertson indicated the SNP was not in a mood to be accommodating towards the Conservatives given its unhappiness with the devolution settlement offered in the Scotland bill.</p> \n<p>“We are in a situation where the Tory government are refusing to agree to any amendments to improve the Scotland bill – which are supported by 58 of Scotland’s 59 MPs – and imposing English votes for English laws to make Scotland’s representation at Westminster second class,” he said. </p> \n<p>“In these circumstances, it is right and proper that we assert the Scottish interest on foxhunting by voting with Labour against the Tories’ proposals to relax the ban – in the process, reminding an arrogant UK government of just how slender their majority is – just as we will vote against the Tory welfare cuts next week and appeal to Labour to join us.” </p> \n<p>SNP sources had last week indicated the party would probably abstain but it was coming under pressure from its activists not to be party to a Tory attempt to relax the law, even though it usually takes a decision on principle not to vote on English and Welsh-only matters.</p> \n<p>Under the Scottish ban, enshrined in the Protection of Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002, dogs can only be used if they are “flushing” foxes from cover towards waiting guns. </p> \n<p>But the Scottish government has launched its own investigation into the effectiveness of this legislation after surveillance of five of Scotland’s 10 hunts suggested that they are routinely behaving as they did before the ban, with a complete absence of shotguns. Covert video footage taken by the League Against Cruel Sports over a three-month period apparently shows no practice of ‘flushing to guns’.</p> \n<p>The Holyrood environment minister, Aileen McLeod, confirmed in a letter to the League that MSPs intended to scrutinise the ban, writing that she “would be very concerned” if the law was being flouted and that she was referring her concerns to Police Scotland.</p> \n<p>SNP MPs have been struck by the strength of feeling on the issue. From the moment they were elected, new SNP MPs reported being lobbied by voters in the rest of the UK who promised to holiday in Scotland and buy more whisky if they voted against the repeal of the hunting ban.</p> \n<p>The Conservatives suggested the SNP’s move made them more determined to bring in proposals to allow English votes for English laws. A party source said: “This is a technical change to bring the law in England and Wales more closely into line with Scotland.<br /></p> \n<p>“Hunting is a devolved issue. The SNP’s decision to vote on a draft law that does not affect Scotland at all shows exactly why Conservatives committed in our manifesto to ensure laws that only affect England can only be passed with the consent of English MPs.”<br />However, the Tory English votes proposals would not in fact have stopped the SNP voting down the relaxation of the foxhunting ban because the proposals still require a vote of the whole house for legislation to pass, in addition to a vote by English MPs only.</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436817108827/4c443d7c-af5a-4569-b2f1-5edc09086610-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Simon Dawson/AP","altText":"The Albrighton & Woodland Hunt in 2009.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Simon Dawson/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-13T19:58:52Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T23:20:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2231,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowena Mason","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899403654/Rowena-Mason-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rowena-mason"},{"name":"Libby Brooks","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/5/1399294301217/Libby-Brooks-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/libbybrooks"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Hunting","Scottish National party (SNP)","David Cameron","Conservatives","House of Commons","Animal welfare","Animals","Politics","UK news","Scotland","Scottish politics"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/hunting","webTitle":"Hunting"},{"id":"politics/snp","webTitle":"Scottish National party (SNP)"},{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"politics/houseofcommons","webTitle":"House of Commons"},{"id":"world/animal-welfare","webTitle":"Animal welfare"},{"id":"world/animals","webTitle":"Animals"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland"},{"id":"politics/scotland","webTitle":"Scottish politics"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/13/foxhunting-ban-changes-under-threat-from-snp","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aja5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jul/13/foxhunting-ban-changes-under-threat-from-snp","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/13/foxhunting-ban-changes-under-threat-from-snp"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436817108827/4c443d7c-af5a-4569-b2f1-5edc09086610-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Albrighton &amp; Woodland Hunt in 2009.
