The chancellor will create a &pound;175,000, tax-free allowance per person for their main property on top of their existing &pound;325,000 allowance that can be applied to all assets.</p> \n<p>His intention to lift all but the wealthiest homeowners out of inheritance tax was first revealed when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/mar/16/tories-1m-inheritance-tax-giveaway-sensitive-papers-wealthier-households\">sensitive Treasury papers</a> were leaked to the Guardian before the last budget, which concluded that it would “most likely benefit high income and wealthier households”.</p> \n<p>The Conservative proposals were later confirmed by David Cameron during the election campaign and became a key plank of the Tory manifesto championing a “Conservative dream”.</p> \n<p>At the time, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the proposal would disproportionately benefit wealthier people and could have a negative effect on the property market if elderly homeowners were discouraged from downsizing.</p> \n<p>The changes, likely to cost about &pound;1bn, will be paid for by reductions to tax relief on pensions, possibly through lowering the amount available to top-rate taxpayers from &pound;40,000 to &pound;10,000 a year on a sliding scale. The IFS has said this would “affect a relatively small number of high-income individuals”.</p> \n<p>It is understood the plans have now been amended to allow pensioners to move into smaller homes without missing out on the &pound;1m relief on their former properties. A new mechanism will mean that if someone sells their main residence and buys one that is cheaper, they will get the allowance up to the value of their previous home.</p> \n<p>Osborne’s decision to bring forward the proposals in his first budget since the Tories won a majority is a sign that it is high on his list of priorities, eight years after he first pledged to raise the threshold to &pound;1m while in opposition as the shadow chancellor.</p> \n<p>Many within Labour are likely to use the announcement to characterise the Conservatives as being the party of tax cuts for millionaires in the same way as they did when Osborne lowered the 50p income tax rate to 45p under the Conservative-Liberal coalition.</p> \n<p>Under the current rules, inheritance tax is charged on estates worth more than &pound;325,000, rising to &pound;650,000 for couples, because the rate is transferable between those who are married or in civil partnerships. It is charged at 40% of the excess value of assets above the threshold and is paid by the estate of the deceased.</p> \n<p>The new proposals raise the rate to &pound;500,000 by introducing a new zero-rate band of &pound;175,000 on a main property when it is passed on death to a child or grandchild. This would create a &pound;1m limit for couples because it would also be transferable and mean that 94% of households are exempt from the tax.</p> \n<p>Osborne is expected to set out details of much of his proposed &pound;12bn cuts in welfare in the same budget, which will be delivered to parliament on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Cameron has strongly hinted that one of the cuts will be reductions to tax credits, after he gave a speech saying he wanted to end the welfare “merry-go-round” whereby wages are topped up by state handouts.</p> \n<p>There have also been reports that Osborne would like to go even further than his plan to reduce the benefit cap from &pound;26,000 to &pound;23,000 and perhaps cut it to &pound;20,000 outside London.</p> \n<p>Separately, the chancellor is under pressure from a group of about 160 Conservatives to reduce the top rate of tax further for those earning more than &pound;150,000 a year from 45p to either 42p or 40p.</p> \n<p>It is possible he could also announce reforms to the non-dom status, including raising the annual charge and stopping its hereditary nature. Labour had pledged to abolish the status in a popular announcement during the election campaign.</p> \n<p>At the time it was announced, the IFS described the inheritance tax pledge as special treatment for homeowners.</p> \n<p>A briefing note said: “Since the children of those with very large estates are disproportionately towards the top of the income distribution, the gains from this [and in fact any] IHT cut will also go disproportionately to those towards the top of the income distribution.”</p> \n<p>Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, then told the BBC that it was “rather odd to give this special treatment to housing given that owner-occupied housing is already extremely tax privileged”.</p> \n<p>He said: “This will only increase the bias we have towards putting your money in a house, to inflating potentially the value of housing, without dealing with the lack of housing, which is driving up the value of private residences.”</p> \n<p>Before the election, Chris Leslie, the then shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said it “cannot be a priority to spend &pound;1bn on a policy which the Treasury says would not apply to 90% of estates”.</p> \n<p>He said: “The Tories would choose to give a &pound;140,000 tax cut for a house worth &pound;2m while they have increased VAT on families and pensioners.”</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/630e08bc50b93d437d8b882bfa78a17870c4d3a7/0_217_1905_1142/1905.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1142,"width":1905,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Niklas Halle'N/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"The UK chancellor George Osborne","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Niklas Halle'N/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T21:00:03Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T23:08:08Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1602,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowena Mason","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899403654/Rowena-Mason-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rowena-mason"},{"name":"Rajeev Syal","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rajeev-syal"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Budget 2015 (July)","Politics","Budget","UK news","Tax and spending","Inheritance tax","Tax","George Osborne","Conservatives","Housing","Institute for Fiscal Studies","Business","Communities","Economics","Benefits","Pensions","Money","Society","Thinktanks"],"tags":[{"id":"uk-news/budget-2015-july","webTitle":"Budget 2015 (July)"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/budget","webTitle":"Budget"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/taxandspending","webTitle":"Tax and spending"},{"id":"money/inheritancetax","webTitle":"Inheritance tax"},{"id":"money/tax","webTitle":"Tax"},{"id":"politics/georgeosborne","webTitle":"George Osborne"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"society/housing","webTitle":"Housing"},{"id":"business/institute-for-fiscal-studies","webTitle":"Institute for Fiscal Studies"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"society/communities","webTitle":"Communities"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"society/benefits","webTitle":"Benefits"},{"id":"money/pensions","webTitle":"Pensions"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"politics/thinktanks","webTitle":"Thinktanks"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/03/inheritance-tax-giveaway-welfare-cuts-budget-conservatives-george-osborne","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aca4","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jul/03/inheritance-tax-giveaway-welfare-cuts-budget-conservatives-george-osborne","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/03/inheritance-tax-giveaway-welfare-cuts-budget-conservatives-george-osborne"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/630e08bc50b93d437d8b882bfa78a17870c4d3a7/0_217_1905_1142/1905.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1142,"width":1905,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The chancellor, George Osborne, first pledged to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £1m while in opposition.

One phoned and another used a social media platform to tell the loved ones the news that they have been dreading. At the request of their families, the Guardian is not naming the married pair.</p> \n<p>Their families are said be be distraught at the news and have been clinging to the hope their daughters would want to come home.<br /></p> \n<p>The schoolgirls say that they have been separated and have been living apart for several weeks, in and around Raqqa, Syria – an Isis stronghold.</p> \n<p>The two schoolgirls have been living with the men whom they married in a ceremony approved by Isis authorities.</p> \n<p>The two schoolgirls are understood to have been given an effective “catalogue” of men deemed suitable by Isis for marriage. They then made their picks from those presented to them. The teenagers who married are believed to have been wed to older men, in their 20s.</p> \n<p>Tasnime Akunjee, a solicitor representing the families, said the families were grieving at the news of the marriages, as told to them by their daughters: “It has caused a lot of distress. It entrenches their lives in Syria, rather than in Britain. It erodes significantly hopes that they will come back.”</p> \n<p>The girls initially lived together in Raqqa. They plotted the trip together, drawing up a shopping list of items to take with them.</p> \n<p>They had all been gifted students at the Bethnal Green academy in east London, before being lured by Isis propaganda.</p> \n<p>They fled on 17 February while they were on a half-term break, taking a flight from Gatwick to Turkey, which borders Syria. A few days later, they are believed to have crossed the border and entered land in Syria held by Isis.</p> \n<p>The loss of the girls was a blow to the Muslim community in east London and hit home across Britainhow powerful Isis’s lure could be. Since then, three women from Bradford are feared to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/16/relatives-of-missing-bradford-women-and-children-criticise-police\">have taken nine children</a> to Isis-controlled land, and it emerged three generations from a family of 12 from Luton <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/02/missing-luton-family-were-stopped-by-police-when-trying-to-leave-uk\">may have followed suit</a>.</p> \n<p>On Friday night, the Daily Telegraph showed video claiming to show the girls in Isis controlled territory in Syria out shopping, with a gun-toting woman leading them. </p> \n<p>The girls’ families do not believe it is them. All three of the women shown in the video are unidentifiable because they are wearing burqas.</p> \n<p>The video, which was taken by a group that says it opposes Isis, was shot eight weeks ago. Six weeks ago, the families’s lawyer was approached by another media organisation about whether the people featured in it were the London teenagers.</p> \n<p>Akunjee said: “At the time the video was shot, two of the girls are known to be married and separated from their friends from east London.</p> \n<p>“The families think the video is unlikely to be them. All three are living apart and those who are married are under the aegis of their husbands and are unlikely to be under the aegis of some woman leader.”</p> \n<p>The Metropolitan police did not confirm any knowledge of the girls’ whereabouts, but said that its investigation into the three girls – plus a fourth student from the same school who went missing previously – was ongoing.“The investigation into all of the missing girls continues. It remains a priority to try to prevent people travelling to join terrorist groups whether they be determined terrorists, radicalised individuals or vulnerable teenagers. We will continue to work with our partners and the authorities to combat this risk and prevent tragedies,” it said.</p> \n<p>The group that took the video, called Eye on Homeland, said when the girls arrived in Raqqa, they were locked in a compound for widows and would-be jihadi brides, while their loyalty to the terrorist group was tested.</p> \n<p>The group claimed the girls were forbidden to leave the building without their chaperone, a woman handler known as Um Laith – “Mother of the Lion” – tasked with “purifying their western minds” by instilling the practices of the caliphate.</p> \n<p>In March, Scotland Yard commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the teenagers could return home without fear of being prosecuted for terrorism, as long as no evidence emerged of them being engaged in violence.</p> \n<p>Their families believe police kept crucial information from them that could have alerted them to the fact they were in danger of being lured by the terrorists. Police have apologised.</p> \n<p>The head of counter terrorism for Scotland Yard, assistant commissioner Mark Rowley, said in March: “We have no evidence in this case that these three girls are responsible for any terrorist offences. They have no reason to fear, if nothing else comes to light, that we will be treating them as terrorists.”</p> \n<p>Rowley said the three girls were different to someone “running around in northern Iraq and Syria with Kalashnikovs”, who then apologised for having committed terrorist offences.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d5366026e826fd74b95f5d83f01cae3a2572a791/117_0_1193_716/1193.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":716,"width":1193,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"LONDON METROPLITAN POLICE / HANDOUT/EPA","altText":"Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase","cleanCredit":"Photograph: LONDON METROPLITAN POLICE / HANDOUT/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T23:22:57Z","lastModified":"2015-07-04T00:20:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":836,"contributors":[{"name":"Vikram Dodd","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/vikramdodd"},{"name":"Nadia Khomami","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/8/1428480381597/Nadia-Khomami-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nadia-khomami"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Islamic State","UK news","London","World news","Syria","Middle East and North Africa"],"tags":[{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/04/two-bethnal-green-schoolgirls-now-married-isis-men-syria","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aceg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/04/two-bethnal-green-schoolgirls-now-married-isis-men-syria","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/04/two-bethnal-green-schoolgirls-now-married-isis-men-syria"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d5366026e826fd74b95f5d83f01cae3a2572a791/117_0_1193_716/1193.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":716,"width":1193,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"From left: Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, the three schoolgirls who have apparently been separated now for several weeks.

And here I am, trying to call someone yet absent-mindedly pulling up your profile. In the tiny square picture icon, you are there in your blue T-shirt, leaning over the table and smiling at the camera. Next to your name it says, “Hear me now”. </em></p> \n<p><em>That drove me mad; you’d sit there and repeat, “Hear me now?

I should delete your account … and your phone number, email address and all sorts of other aspects of your online life. I sit and wonder if other people you were connected to have deleted your profile. And I stare out the window wondering if I should try to call you again.</em></p> \n<p>My husband, Iain, and I met at school when we were 17, dated in the sixth form, went our separate ways at university, then got back together and married in a flurry of excitement in 2008. Iain worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office so we lived, worked and adventured together for seven years in Delhi and Geneva. In October 2013, Iain was diagnosed with a brain tumour, and on 7 December 2014, he died in our bed at home. On that morning, my husband, our hoped for family and my future roadmap of work and travel for the next 40 years, all vanished in one shuddering breath. We were both 33.</p> \n<p>Six months along this single-track pathway, I’m repeatedly aware I have to rebuild and reshape my life – a life I can’t remember distinct from Iain. If your partner dies, a lot of admin also comes your way. And, these days, people die a digital death alongside their physical one, which creates a whole new world of admin that didn’t pass the radar of grieving widows 50 years ago. Those 20th-century widows would have had a box of love letters and a few hard copy photos; I have Facebook messages, professional videos on YouTube, personal videos on my iPhone, email histories, recorded Skype chats, WhatsApp conversations, text messages and digital photos – photos galore. And all this from a marriage with someone who never really liked spending time online. He set out his stall at 18 announcing that he wouldn’t be getting a mobile phone because they “seem pretty annoying, I doubt they’ll catch on”.</p> \n<p>I’ve found at least one blog that tries to make sense of it all. <a href=\"http://www.thedigitalbeyond.com\" title=\"\">The Digital Beyond</a>, which offers a “go-to source for archival, cultural, legal and technical insights, to help you predict and plan for the future of your online content”. Along with “scatter tubes” – tubes with a perforated lid for transporting and scattering ashes – and bespoke jewellery made from ashes, it’s another blossoming industry I never knew existed.</p> \n<p>The blog lists 54 online companies that deal specifically with aspects of dying or, more commonly, the legacy of memories online. I’m slightly spooked by the number of websites that help you send posthumous messages to your friends and relatives. <a href=\"http://tolovedones.com\" title=\"\">ToLovedOnes</a>, for example, will send letters after your death, calculating the dates they are posted “with 95% accuracy from public records”. Which just leaves me worrying about the 5% of people who receive the letters when their relative is still alive.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://knotify.me/\" title=\"\">Knotify.me</a>, meanwhile, is a free app that answers the question you never knew you had; “What happens to all my online accounts if I get amnesia, Alzheimer’s or if I leave this world?” It helps you set future notifications for your family or yourself, so “nothing of your digital life will be wasted”. <a href=\"http://www.rememberedvoices.com\" title=\"\">Remembered Voices</a> lets you record your voice and play it back to people after you’ve died, <a href=\"http://www.cirruslegacy.com\" title=\"\">Cirrus Legacy</a> stores digital assets in a single place online, so your executor can access them easily. That would have been helpful, in fact. Terry Pratchett was in the know – his recent death was announced in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/terryandrob\" title=\"\">a series of tweets from his own account</a>.</p> \n<p>Just as we’re playing catch up with technology, the technology developers themselves are in the same position. Dying, understandably, didn’t feature highly in Facebook’s early risk registers. Which might be why it was in trouble recently for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32193923\" title=\"\">locking a grieving mother out of her teenage daughter’s Facebook account</a>, despite having her daughter’s permission to use it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I hadn’t anticipated the outpouring of love from around the world. There were messages from Japan, Pakistan, Chile …</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>When someone dies, Facebook tends to “memorialise” their account – freeze them so they can be viewed, but providing no access to past messages. I read that and panicked: I didn’t want that to happen, so grabbed my laptop and logged in urgently as Iain. Once in though, I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do – it didn’t feel right reading personal messages to and from other people. They weren’t for me. If he’d left a box of letters, would I have read those? People store important letters, but online messages are kept just because we don’t press delete. Should I read his emails? I didn’t. But I read and reread our text message conversations, which lifted me up so high it felt like we were actually chatting. Then when I got to the end and there were no more, it was a bad, long fall from there. So I decided memorialising was OK.</p> \n<p>Facebook also offended a fair number of bereaved people with its Year in Review clips, in which photographs that attracted the most comments were automatically selected to reappear on your timeline under the words “Here’s what your year looked like”. The problem was that for some, these were pictures of dead loved ones. And, however comforting photos and associated memories can be, out of the blue and at the wrong moment on your computer screen they can cause havoc if you are grieving.</p> \n<p>The bereaved: an oversensitive minority population, you may think, but the numbers involved are bigger than you may realise. Based on Facebook’s growth rate, and the age breakdown of its users over time, probably 10 to 20 million people who created Facebook profiles have since died. Even if Facebook closed registration tomorrow, the number of deaths per year will continue to grow for decades, as the 2000-2020 school generations grow old. And the peak? <a href=\"http://www.webpagefx.com/blog/internet/happens-online-presence-die-infographic/\" title=\"\">Nasa physicist turned full-time cartoonist Randall Munroe </a>estimates that if Facebook falls out of favour with young generations, as many social media sites do, the point at which there will be more users who have died than are living is around 2060. And if Facebook continues to thrive, that’s more like 2130.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"446d2d3ace6429d1c51d5f64623022c365f95944\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435683664595/a89fcfc8-bc81-4bb2-9d8f-6c76c959b4e4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Caroline and Iain in 1999, when they were still at school.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Caroline and Iain in 1999, when they were still at school.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the hours and immediate few days after Iain died, I turned to the memorial website built overnight by a kind colleague to celebrate my man’s life. A bewildered and floundering group of Iain’s closest friends and family immersed ourselves in a world of photos and memories and words and purpose. Three days later, all within half an hour, the website went live, an email to the worldwide Foreign and Commonwealth Office workforce went out and I put a “global announcement” on Facebook. “Informing friends of the deceased”, 21st-century style. I changed my profile to black, shut my laptop and left the house; the internet did its thing – with speed, breadth and a rush of wildfire.</p> \n<p>I hadn’t anticipated the outpouring of love from around the world. Within minutes there were messages from Japan, Pakistan, Chile … the inhabitants of our interconnected world, suddenly spinning inwards to be connected by shock and grief, then spinning out again to their own physical pockets around the world.</p> \n<p>Today, one of the things I cherish most is an eight-second video of Iain telling me he loves me. There’s something about seeing him as if in real life and hearing his voice, that is just quite incredible. The only downside is that it’s far too short. And it’s all I’m going to get now. I wish I had more videos – they are by far the hardest thing to look at right now, but I sense that one day they will be some of the most precious things I have.</p> \n<p>Otherwise a huge comfort and unity online has come from a network for younger people whose partners have died – <a href=\"https://www.widowedandyoung.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Way (Widowed and Young)</a>. In the past month, I’ve got to know some of the 1,500 people in that group by seeing their biggest fears, their “smallest” achievements, their practical worries and their rallying strength posted online in a closed group. A sub-set of our society, normal people living normal lives that suddenly know tragedy and are thrust together in their confusion and loneliness and upset.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I've discovered that when you cry lying on your back, your tears slide into your ears, which fill up and feel strange</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I don’t use the rest of Facebook so much now – I posted a positive few things early on and hadn’t expected so many instantaneous likes and messages saying I was “amazing”. It was too surreal to be told that when you’re barely able to hold a conversation in real life, and it made me feel strange. I’m certainly not going to start covering Facebook with the reality of the new world I have found myself living in since Iain’s death – people don’t go there to see the truth if it’s not pretty.</p> \n<p>So, after I put my phone aside each evening and disconnect myself from my online communities, the moment just after my head hits the pillow is when the reality of my sadness becomes so stark. The moment I go from being exhausted to somehow feeling wide awake, when I feel so, so solo. I look over at Iain’s side of the bed and just his picture grins back at me. I poke my toe over the cold sheet and I wonder how it can be that he was right there, and now he’s not. I think about friends in their homes, with their favourite people breathing quietly beside them. I think of people listening out for babies in other rooms. For their children stirring. I want to say, “Imagine none of those people are in your house now, imagine that silence. And imagine it’s for always.” That’s how alone it feels.</p> \n<p>As I lie there I wonder, have I fallen off the end of the world? I’ve discovered that when you cry while you’re lying on your back, your tears slide into your ears, which fill up and feel strange. I shake my head. And at some point I fall asleep. And then I wake up too early and feel the same.</p> \n<p>As I take the commuter train, I look at everyone on their smartphones. I imagine there are others also scrolling through pictures of their families, just as I am with photos of Iain. I see a message from a lady, a new friend, whose husband also died of a brain tumour a few days before Iain – we’ve never met but have shared such a similarly traumatic story that we’re linked to each other now. As I go to reply, I’m aware that we’d never have connected if this had been 1915, not 2015.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.thebraintumourcharity.org/\" title=\"\"><em>thebraintumourcharity.org</em></a></p> \n<p><em>Caroline Twigg has written a book to help bereaved children.

She should have won the match.”</p> \n<p>Watson, for her part, was inconsolable at the result. “It was a tough, tough ask today, but I was super-, super-close. I think that’s what really hurts the most.”</p> \n<p>Though Watson is the British No1 and came into her third round match on the back of two impressively tough-minded wins, very few would have expected a performance of such fire – or a result so close. But Watson’s slight 5’7” frame and softly spoken manner belie a grit and confidence that have been hard-earned. </p> \n<p>Born in St Peter Port in Guernsey in 1992 to Ian, a Mancunian-born businessman, and Michelle, who was born in Papua New Guinea, she took up tennis at seven at around the same time as she made her first visit to Wimbledon. </p> \n<p>On that visit, she said earlier this week, “I bought two posters: One was Venus and Serena together and one was Roger Federer. Those were the three players that I liked. They went straight up on my wall.”</p> \n<p>At 12 she left home, alone, to board at Nick Bollettieri’s tennis academy in Florida; three years later her mother, with a teenage Watson already travelling around the world to compete in the junior circuit, <a href=\"http://www.thenational.com.pg/?q=node/683\">left her job</a> to accompany her daughter full-time.</p> \n<p>“Lots of times I feel quite lonely,” <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/9763188/British-No-1-Heather-Watson-admits-when-she-is-on-tour-she-feels-lonely-and-does-not-fit-in.html\">she said in 2012</a> of life on the tour. “I just want to go home and see everybody, because I hardly get to see my friends and family during the season. It’s really tough, always living out of a suitcase or in a hotel.”</p> \n<p>Part of the problem, she suggested, was that as a warm and fun-loving young woman who loves posting silly photos to <a href=\"https://instagram.com/heatherwatson92/?hl=en\">her Instagram feed</a>, she found it difficult to make friends and was often snubbed by the more aloof players on the tour.</p> \n<p>“I don’t really fit in,” she said. “I couldn’t be mean and not talk to people if I tried … But some of the girls have to be that way. In their minds, they are not playing a friend, they’re playing an opponent. That’s the job. It’s difficult, though.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/andy_murray/statuses/617038314164477952\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Retweet if <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeatherWatson92\">@HeatherWatson92</a> just made you feel really effing proud!
