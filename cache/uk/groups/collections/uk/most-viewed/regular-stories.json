It called for Greece to be expelled from the eurozone for a minimum of five years and demanded that the Greek government transfer €50bn of state assets to an outside agency for sell-off.</p> \n<p>Timo Soini, the nationalist True Finns leader, meanwhile, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/12/finlands-parliament-in-favour-of-forcing-greece-out-of-the-euro-says-report\">threatened to bring down the government in Helsinki</a> if Alex Stubb, the finance minister, agreed to a new bailout for Greece. Stubb apparently came to the crunch meeting on a new bailout without a mandate to agree one.</p> \n<p>“The hawks are very vocal,” said an EU diplomat. “It’s very tough.” Berlin also demanded stronger and more intrusive powers for outside monitors to police the economic and fiscal reforms that Alexis Tsipras, the leftist Greek prime minister, would need to commit to to secure the new bailout.</p> \n<p>Saturday night’s talks were not to agree on a third bailout, but were negotiations on whether to launch more talks on Greece’s third rescue package in five years. The ministers faced formidable problems, said Sch&auml;uble, who argued debt relief for Greece, broadly seen as essential, was banned by the EU treaties: “Athens’s proposals are far from sufficient. The funding gaps are way beyond anything we’ve seen so far,” he said.</p> \n<p>The hard line was echoed by Peter Kazimir, finance minister of Slovakia, who said that new austerity measures tabled by Athens were already past their sell-by date.</p> \n<p>The eurozone has been united for five months in the negotiations with Tsipras, but with the stakes rising greatly in the last 10 days, major divisions have surfaced, with the French working tirelessly to save Greece and the hardliners now pushing Greece’s expulsion for the first time openly.</p> \n<p>The European commission and the European Central Bank issued dire warnings that a failure to grant Greece new rescue funds of up to €78bn would put the country on a trajectory of complete banking and financial collapse.</p> \n<p>The widening gulf between eurozone hawks and doves paves the way for an acrimonious summit on Sunday, with France and Italy lining up against Germany and the northern and eastern Europeans. Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, is expected to tell chancellor Angela Merkel that enough is enough and that Greece should not have to put up with any more humiliation.</p> \n<p>Merkel is under intense pressure from the Americans not to “lose” Greece and is worried about her own legacy. But Greece fatigue is becoming endemic in Germany, and she faces growing unrest in her party ranks where Sch&auml;uble’s hard line is popular. She was said to have endorsed Sch&auml;uble’s tough position.</p> \n<p>If the talks break down irretrievably and Greece is allowed to slide into even greater chaos, relations between Berlin and Paris will come under tremendous strain. Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, lauded Tsipras for putting his austerity proposals before parliament and saw the moves of the past few days as “positive”.</p> \n<p>Tsipras won a sweeping majority with the support of opposition parties, but many in his Syriza movement defected, leading to speculation that he could either call new elections or ditch his hardliners and lead a new “national unity” government.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Tsipras performed a remarkable U-turn and accepted more austerity measures than had been rejected in the referendum he called for five days earlier. The prompt volte-face confounded negotiators.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436653837315/Greek-finance-minister-Eu-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Greek finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos listens to IMF managing director Christine Lagarde during a Eurogroup meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Saturday.

David Cameron <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/09/government-publishes-amendment-fox-hunting-act-free-vote\">has promised a free vote on a government amendment</a> that would make it legal to kill foxes for pest control and for them to be flushed out by a full pack of hounds. Under the current law, passed after years of parliamentary battles, hunts are allowed to use two dogs to flush out foxes that can then be shot for pest control purposes.</p> \n<p>The changes follow <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/mar/06/david-cameron-backs-repeal-of-ban-on-hunting-with-dogs\">a Tory manifesto commitment to offer a free vote on repeal of the law</a>. But, fearing they would lose a vote for complete repeal, ministers have tabled changes to water down the bill, bringing the rules into line with those in Scotland.</p> \n<p>Critics of the plans, which would also permit an unlimited number of dogs to flush out diseased or injured foxes and allow them to be used for “research and observation” purposes, say hunters would exploit the loose wording to claim they were assessing fox populations or disease levels when in fact they were hunting as they wished.</p> \n<p>Crouch, who is a patron of the organisation <a href=\"http://www.conservativesagainstfoxhunting.com\">Blue Fox – Conservatives Against Fox Hunting</a> told the <em>Observer</em> that if MPs were <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/08/cameron-foxhunting-hunting-ban-legal-changes\">lulled into backing the amendment</a> they would be flying in the face of public opinion. “The proposed amendment relaxes current legislation making the current act unenforceable. The vote could be close, so I hope colleagues on all sides … will not be fooled by the spin of the pro-hunt lobby and inadvertently vote for a measure that makes a mockery of public opinion on foxhunting.” Between 20 and 30 Tory MPs could oppose the amendment.</p> \n<p>When the ban became law in 2004, 61% of people supported parliament’s decision while 30% opposed it. Recent research by YouGov research found that 51% of people still support the ban while 33% oppose it.Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP for Totnes, said she too would vote against the amendment. “People have moved on from this. What this will do is make people think the Tories are all pro-hunting when that it is not the case.I also resent the way this is being presented as a town against country thing. In rural parts of my constituency many people do not agree with fox hunting.”</p> \n<p>Justice minister Dominic Raab said recently: “I can’t see the case for repealing the Hunting Act. There are parts, like hunting deer with dogs, that I just feel are wrong in principle. With respect to foxhunting, I see that farmers need to protect their livestock from attack, but hunting foxes with dogs is not the most humane way to do that.”</p> \n<p>The outcome could be determined by the 56 SNP MPs, who were refusing to say on Saturdayhow they would vote. It is expected that they will abstain, taking the view that it is a matter for England and Wales.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/08/cameron-foxhunting-hunting-ban-legal-changes\">David Cameron the sly fox is about to legalise hunting by stealth | Stephen Moss</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Robbie Marsland, director of the League Against Cruel Sports (Scotland), said it was wrong to claim England was being brought into line with Scotland.

We were close when I was a child (I’m 23 now) and I drifted away from him during adolescence. I cannot put my finger on why, except perhaps I became more girly and less relatable to him. I am an only child and am very close to my mum. I am often a disappointment to him, but I cannot see my mistakes coming. I’m envious when my friends’ dads say they look lovely or when I see how tenderly the fathers of the children I babysit treat their wives and kids. Dad refers to my mum as bonkers, hopeless, waste of bloody space, mad bat, bloody useless, or just “ya mum” (“Where’s ya mum gone now?!”) or often just “woman”…</em></p> \n<p><strong>Mariella replies </strong>He’s a charmer! As you’ve made clear, your dad doesn’t wear his heart on his sleeve. How sad that the two of you are both trapped in patterns of behaviour that lock each other out. It’s guesswork my end, but it ’s no understatement to say that your father struggles with his emotional side. He’s not alone among his sex in finding it an embarrassment to let down his guard, particularly with the two women in his life. If he treated you more tenderly he’d be showing you he cares about you, and what a Pandora’s box that would open, eh?!</p> \n<p>Your father is a perfect stereotype of unreconstructed manhood, illustrating why there is much to do in furthering the male/female balance in today’s world. Despite some 70 years of full-on feminist rhetoric, we still bring up boys to be emotionally buttoned up and girls to remain painfully vulnerable to any emotional undercurrent. This male inability to express vulnerability, admit to weakness or talk honestly about feelings is the greatest obstacle to real emancipation and pervades the corridors of power and politics across the globe. How can we resolve the biggest issues of our time when the world is primarily run by a gender that struggles to communicate basic emotions? Love, fear, affection, sadness, depression and isolation are buried under a veneer of ability and control. It must be as exhausting for men as it is for the opposite sex.</p> \n<p>Responding to this pervasive cultural pressure to behave in a “manly” manner, my small foundation <a href=\"http://www.thegreatinitiative.org.uk/\">thegreatinitiative.org.uk</a> created a pilot project in London devoted to encouraging young men to see women as friends, not foes; to showing that an emotional life is a far richer one, and that women’s ability to show weakness, far from being worthy of disparagement, can actually be a strength. <a href=\"http://www.great-men.org/\">Great Men Value Women</a> works in schools training class ambassadors to host group talks where boys get to discuss their real feelings. Early findings suggest that it’s not only popular but creating positive change, and the most common emotion expressed by the boys in the pilot project is relief at being allowed to “open up”.</p> \n<p>That’s no help to your dad, who’s beyond their impressionable age. He’s your full unreconstructed behemoth, and when you are judging his feelings towards you it’s very important that you keep that in mind. Every term he uses about your mum is an emotionally distancing one. That doesn’t mean he doesn’t love her; in fact it makes it far more likely that he does. He simply can’t express himself in anything other than isolating, self-protective terms. I’m sure your dad also loves you, but he really doesn’t know how to manage or express it. He’s a product of his time and an example of why we need to make the world a more female-shaped place.</p> \n<p>Society accepts fathers who are “soft” on their little girls, so he was more comfortable back then, but as you’ve become a mature adult that dynamic has changed and he’s clueless how to bridge what appears an insurmountable divide. The only way to cross that Empty Quarter is to improve communication – and that is going to be up to you. Would it help to think of him as a foreign language speaker, a person with whom just a little tutoring could open up a whole new world? Your dad won’t know he’s got a problem, let alone how to fix it. To develop a relationship between you that’s even half as rewarding as the one you have with your mum, you’ll have to soften him up. He’s like some tragic caged gorilla destined forever to be segregated from his family. For every gruff word he utters, respond with a welcoming one; encourage him towards you by expressing yourself to him in the way you’d like him to respond. Knowing that underneath that Billy Goat Gruff exterior lie all the emotional undercurrents you yearn for will hopefully make it worth the initial arduous steps.</p> \n<p>You are definitely not unique, and watching other families from the outside very rarely gives a true picture – my husband and I were once so impressed by the caring, affectionate behaviour we witnessed in a visiting family that we resolved to end our incessant low-level bickering and behave in the manner of our guests. I’m afraid we failed, but as they separated within months of the visit their tenure as role models also ended! I haven’t the slightest shred of doubt your father is crazy about you and your mother; he just needs you to walk towards him with your arms open so he feels secure enough to tell you.</p> \n<p><br />If you have a dilemma, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk\">mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk</a></p> \n<p>Follow Mariella on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mariellaf1\">@mariellaf1</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436274892601/d4920f6b-79c9-456a-a91b-b2dad7b86021-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":207,"width":345,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"SCPhotographie/Getty Images","altText":"Father holding daughter in lake, seen from the back","cleanCredit":"Photograph: SCPhotographie/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-12T04:59:00Z","lastModified":"2015-07-12T04:59:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":124,"contributors":[{"name":"Mariella Frostrup","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/13/1421154121982/Mariella-Frostrup-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/mariellafrostrup"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Family","Parents and parenting","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Mariella Frostrup","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/mariellafrostrup"}}],"series":{"title":"Dear Mariella","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/dearmariella"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/dad-never-show-love-respect-mariella-frostrup","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aeex","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/dad-never-show-love-respect-mariella-frostrup","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/dad-never-show-love-respect-mariella-frostrup"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436274892601/d4920f6b-79c9-456a-a91b-b2dad7b86021-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":207,"width":345,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Society accepts fathers who are “soft” on their little girls, so your dad was more comfortable back then.

And in that one example of carelessness and lack of attention to detail, you know all you need to.</p> \n<p>But I had to sit through the whole damn meal so I don’t see why you shouldn’t, too. This US business has swaggered into London like it thinks it’s the bollocks. The description is almost right, if you remove the definite article before the reference to testicles. It is about as shoddy an operation in separating people from inexcusable amounts of their cash as I have seen in a very long time.</p> \n<p>But first a little context. Until about a decade ago Britain was crying out for a proper steakhouse on the American model; one that knew how to source beef, cut steaks thick enough and char them properly. Endless feeble attempts came and went. Then we got both <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/08/goodman-restaurant-london\">Goodman</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/18/jay-rayner-restaurant-hawksmoor-air-street\">Hawksmoor</a>, the latter adopting all the tropes of the US steakhouse, but giving them a pronounced British accent. It put prime cuts of British beef centre stage.</p> \n<p>And now comes Smith &amp; Wollensky (hereafter S&amp;W), which bellows loudly about importing US Department of Agriculture beef from Iowa, but which is backed by a consortium from Ireland, a country which produces some of the best beef in the world. They have spent a reputed €10m, and you can see where every cent has gone. The conversion of the basement and ground floor space of the 1930s New York pastiche Adelphi Building just behind the Strand is an orgy of leather and wood, of brass rail and tasteful mural. It can seat 300 people. Across 14 services a week I calculate they will need to find roughly 4,000 people able to pay the prices required to return that investment.</p> \n<p>Cocktails are &pound;13. That buys me an insipid Moscow Mule served in a stupid brass mug with a thin plastic straw. Five pleasant enough medium-sized seared scallops with shards of crisp bacon are &pound;18; four jumbo prawns are &pound;14. Except they don’t call them prawns, because despite the London setting the place must have a transatlantic drawl. So prawns are shrimps and all steaks are listed in imperial measurements. The USDA cuts include a 24oz bone-in ribeye and a 21oz sirloin. The prices for these are astonishing. The former is &pound;65, the latter &pound;62. To put this in context, at Hawksmoor the bone-in sirloin is &pound;5.60 per 100gm. At S&amp;W it’s &pound;10.42 per 100gm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a3922ec825662746ea984ba69e4d6269da1bc46\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436282247183/365ed920-9950-4831-86eb-17acddbf07a7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Smith &amp; Wollensky's bone-in ribeye steak next to sauces in pots and a knife\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The char is feeble, the overwhelming taste is of salt, and the texture is floppy’: Smith &amp; Wollensky’s bone-in ribeye steak. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Is that simply because it has travelled? Not if the fillet steak prices are anything to go by, because S&amp;W have sourced those from the UK. At Hawksmoor fillet is &pound;11.33 per 100gm; at S&amp;W it’s &pound;14.55. Both the menu blurb and the waiting staff bang on about this being the best steak you will ever have. The menu also mentions a list of blackboard specials – T-bones and so on – all of which have run out by 8.20pm. We order the bone-in ribeye. The char is feeble and the overwhelming taste is of salt. Worse is the texture. It’s floppy. Part of this, I think, is a cultural difference; Americans like to celebrate steaks based on tenderness, as if being able to cut a piece of dead animal with a butter knife is an aspiration. I think that if you’re going to eat beef, you want to know it has come from an animal that has moved. This steak slips down like something that has spent its life chained to a radiator in the basement.</p> \n<p>The sauces are dire. A b&eacute;arnaise is an insult to the name, lacking any acidity or the anise burst of tarragon. An au poivre sauce is just a shot of hot demi-glace. A side salad is crisp and well dressed. We take comfort in it. Many other sides are priced for two which is a quick route to higher profit margins and greater food waste. The &pound;9 battered onion rings are good; the &pound;10 truffled mac and cheese is dry and tastes not at all of truffle. Those terrible chips come in the kind of mini-chip-fat-fryer-basket used at chain pubs.</p> \n<p>Service is omnipresent. Twice we ask to keep our bread and side plates when they attempt to remove them. When a third waiter lunges in I finally admit defeat. Take them if you’re so bloody desperate. How hard is it to communicate a table’s wishes to the half dozen people working a corner of the floor, especially when a meal is going to cost more than &pound;100 a head?</p> \n<p>Our waitress, an escapee from Hawksmoor, is lovely – efficient, charming and utterly wasted here. She has been sent out on to the floor in a jacket she admits is about three sizes too large for her and is already stained. Either the management gives a damn about the dignity of its staff or it really doesn’t. Still, she speaks fluent Smith &amp; Wollensky, intoning the oft-repeated figure that theirs are the best 2% of all USDA steaks. God help the other 98%. We try to love it, really we do, but we just can’t. Clearly the poor animal died twice: once in the slaughter house, once on the grill. We give up and hope she doesn’t look too distraught. Curiously, the menu announces in small print that items “may” be cooked to order. May? Only <em>may</em>? Don’t put yourself out, guys.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"faa1e2dd4f50f351a89e80aff4e195ec43eb42ed\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436282525577/f84b8aea-cfaa-4466-8df4-f2be77471b1b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Slice of rich layered chocolate cake next to a cow-shaped biscuit, some cream and raspberries, blueberries, strawberries\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The chocolate cake – ‘an obscenity’, according to Jay.

It comes with a mini milk urn full of chilled lightly whipped and sweetened cream. That cream is by far the best thing we eat all night. The cake is an obscenity, a foul, brusque monolith of heavy sponge and cack-handed mousse almost a foot high. It tastes of fat and sugar and disdain. It eats like those showpiece cakes that have sat for years in coffee shop windows look. We are told there is an option to take left-overs home. We choose not to. The last thing we want, as we walk out the door, is to take any part of the dreadful Smith &amp; Wollensky experience with us.</p> \n<h2>Jay’s new bites</h2> \n<p>■ At the other end of the expense scale, Grillshack on London’s Beak Street serves a quick-seared piece of flattened rump, with shoestring potatoes and smoked butter for just &pound;9.95. It keeps prices down with new tech: although you can order at the counter you can also do so from a downloadable app. Food is then brought to you. There’s mac and cheese, buttermilk chicken, and an American pancake menu. It more than ticks the box marked cheap and cheerful (<a href=\"http://www.grillshack.com/\">grillshack.com</a>).</p> \n<p>■ People of Ilkley rejoice.

It comes amid a growing backlash from young people against George Osborne’s budget last week in which he announced welfare cuts that will hit many young families, ended automatic entitlement to housing benefit for those aged 18 to 21, and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/jul/08/budget-2015-grants-poorer-university-students-scrapped-loans\">replaced maintenance grants for students with a loan system. </a>Osborne also unveiled plans for a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-2015-uk-gdp-other-rich-nations-george-osborne\">new “national living wage” </a>that will rise to &pound;9 an hour by 2020, giving millions of people a pay rise. But it will not apply to those under 25.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/11/families-work-poverty-osborne-budget\">For too many families work is no longer an escape route from poverty</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The bishop of Manchester, the Rt Rev David Walker, raises deep concerns over the effect of the budget on poorer families, particularly those with children. While he welcomed the national living wage, he described as a “huge leap backwards” the cuts in tax credits for those trying to make ends meet, often taking several jobs at once.</p> \n<p>The bishop, writing for the <em>Observer </em>online, says: “It asks those already struggling to keep their heads above water to take on an extra burden. Bad enough we were thinking about those of working age, but that is to forget the real losers from the tax credit cutbacks. The number of children who will be adversely impacted by the budget change is almost certainly above the number of adults.”</p> \n<p>Young people who tried to climb the ladder out of poverty found there was no route to do so. “In Britain in 2015, for far too many households, work has ceased to be the escape route from poverty.”</p> \n<p>The report will show a worrying picture of a society that is piling debt on young people while denying them educational opportunities and the prospect of buying their own homes. It will show that levels of spending on education as a proportion of GDP have fallen steadily since 2010, from 5.95% to 5.28%, while levels of participation in higher education have also declined.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/mar/13/decline-uk-housebuilding-drop-off-construction-ons-output-mortgage-approvals\">The number of houses built fell </a>to 140,000 in 2014, a level that the foundation says is “pitifully low” and a main reason, along with stagnating wages between 2010 and 2014, for rising prices which make buying a home unaffordable for many young families.</p> \n<p>Despite the rosy picture painted by the chancellor, the report says that the number of young people out of work is three times higher in the UK than in Germany. By contrast the cost of healthcare and pensions for the elderly rises exponentially.</p> \n<p>Commenting on the report, a former World Bank economist Professor Lawrence Kotlikoff said inequality between old and young was the “moral issue” of the day.</p> \n<p>“The foundation’s vitally important index makes it clear that the UK is failing its young,” he said. “The UK, like other developed economies, has engaged in fiscal, educational, health and environmental child abuse.”</p> \n<p>Angus Hanton, co-founder of the foundation, said the situation would be exacerbated by the budget. “One of the things we’re doing is drawing to the attention of the older generation exactly what they are doing. Unfortunately human nature means people think ‘We did something to deserve our comfortable lives, we’re entitled’ – and the baby boomers are experts at that. A lot of people have a moment of dawning, when they start joining the dots. A lot of politicians are very aware of what’s looming, but they won’t dare say it.”</p> \n<p>On Saturday a campaign group called Youth Fight for Jobs took their tents and placards to Parliament Square in London to protest at what they said was a government “declaration of war on young people”. One of the organisers, Ian Pattison, said the budget was an attempt to “snatch our future”. Pattison added that “the grim outlook of increasing hardship for young people stands in stark contrast with Osborne’s treatment of the rich. We’re erecting tents to highlight the devastating effects of housing benefit cuts on vulnerable young people.”</p> \n<p>Following the budget, Andy Burnham, seen by many as the favourite to be the next Labour leader, wrote to every party member insisting that the living wage should apply to young people. Burnham said that the budget “divided young from old” and “represents everything that’s wrong with Westminster politics”.</p> \n<p>He added: “What possible justification can there be for excluding under-25s from the ‘national living wage’?”</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436638144364/George-Osborne-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"George Osborne’s budget has met a growing backlash from young people.

Around 91,000 wealthy Chinese sought second citizenship between 2000 and 2014, according to a report by residence investment broker Lion Global, a factor that is fuelling demand to buy foreign property.<br /></p> \n<p> Most of these individuals, defined as those with net assets of US$1m or more excluding their primary residences, are moving to the US, Hong Kong, Singapore and Britain.</p> \n<p> Brian Ward, president of capital markets and investment services for the Americas at commercial property company Colliers International, said Chinese investors had already sunk around US$5bn into US real estate in the first six months of 2015, more than the US$4bn they invested in the whole of 2014.</p> \n<p> In London, Alex Newall, managing director of super prime residential realtor Hanover Private Office estate agents said he had seen an increase in interest from Chinese investors at the top of the market, although no transactions yet.</p> \n<p> “They’re wanting to try and park large sums of money – I’m talking from &pound;25m [US$38.5m] to &pound;150m,” Newell said. “They’re looking to park that capital into London homes.”</p> \n<p> Australia and Canada are also increasing in popularity, gaining an edge from their weakening currencies.</p> \n<p> “Property prices are still cheap in RMB [yuan] terms,” said Timothy Cheung, a principal of Morphic Asset Management in Sydney.</p> \n<p>The rush by Chinese investors into foreign property has not been without criticism, with some in London, Sydney and Vancouver blaming them for pushing up already spiralling prices.<br /></p> \n<p> The Australian government has moved to look tough on the issue, introducing new fees and jail terms for those found flouting foreign investment rules.

This year history gate-crashed modern America in the form of a 150-year-old document: a few sheets of paper that compelled Hollywood actor <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/apr/22/ben-affleck-embarrassment-hide-slave-owning-ancestor\" title=\"Ben Afflect admits embarrassment led to him trying to hide slave-owning ancestor\">Ben Affleck to issue a public apology</a> and forced the highly regarded US public service broadcaster PBS to launch an internal investigation.</p> \n<p>The document, which emerged during the production of <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/finding-your-roots/\" title=\"Finding Your Roots homepage\"><em>Finding Your Roots</em></a>, a celebrity genealogy show, is neither unique nor unusual. It is one of thousands that record the primal wound of the American republic – slavery. It lists the names of 24 slaves, men and women, who in 1858 were owned by Benjamin L Cole, Affleck’s great-great-great-grandfather. When this uncomfortable fact came to light, Affleck asked the show’s producers to conceal his family’s links to slavery. Internal emails discussing the programme were later published by WikiLeaks, forcing Affleck to admit in a Facebook post: “I didn’t want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed.”</p> \n<p>It was precisely because slaves were reduced to property that they appear so regularly in historic documents, both in the US and in Britain. As property, slaves were listed in plantation accounts and itemised in inventories. They were recorded for tax reasons and detailed alongside other transferable goods on the pages of thousands of wills. Few historical documents cut to the reality of slavery more than lists of names written alongside monetary values. It is now almost two decades since I had my first encounter with British plantation records, and I still feel a surge of emotion when I come across entries for slave children who, at only a few months old, have been ascribed a value in sterling; the sale of children and the separation of families was among the most bitterly resented aspects of an inhuman system.</p> \n<p>Slavery resurfaces in America regularly. The disadvantage and discrimination that disfigures the lives and limits the life chances of so many African-Americans is the bitter legacy of the slave system and the racism that underwrote and outlasted it. Britain, by contrast, has been far more successful at covering up its slave-owning and slave-trading past. Whereas the cotton plantations of the American south were established on the soil of the continental United States, British slavery took place 3,000 miles away in the Caribbean.</p> \n<p>That geographic distance made it possible for slavery to be largely airbrushed out of British history, following the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833. Many of us today have a more vivid image of American slavery than we have of life as it was for British-owned slaves on the plantations of the Caribbean. The word slavery is more likely to conjure up images of Alabama cotton fields and whitewashed plantation houses, of <em>Roots</em>, <em>Gone With The Wind </em>and <em>12 Years A Slave,</em> than images of Jamaica or Barbados in the 18th century. This is not an accident.</p> \n<p>The history of British slavery has been buried. The thousands of British families who grew rich on the slave trade, or from the sale of slave-produced sugar, in the 17th and 18th centuries, brushed those uncomfortable chapters of their dynastic stories under the carpet. Today, across the country, heritage plaques on Georgian townhouses describe former slave traders as “West India merchants”, while slave owners are hidden behind the equally euphemistic term “West India planter”. Thousands of biographies written in celebration of notable 17th and 18th-century Britons have reduced their ownership of human beings to the footnotes, or else expunged such unpleasant details altogether. The <em>Dictionary of National Biography</em> has been especially culpable in this respect. Few acts of collective forgetting have been as thorough and as successful as the erasing of slavery from the Britain’s “island story”. If it was geography that made this great forgetting possible, what completed the disappearing act was our collective fixation with the one redemptive chapter in the whole story. William Wilberforce and the abolitionist crusade, first against the slave trade and then slavery itself, has become a figleaf behind which the larger, longer and darker history of slavery has been concealed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d93df442b2cfd3b82c0767e18728e2373ea0c784\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436625495547/a2dcbec2-112f-4ac7-8eb0-84ce9be7bc13-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Plan of a slave ship showinmg how slaves were stowed, manacled, into the hold.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plan of a slave ship showinmg how slaves were stowed, manacled, into the hold.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Jones/Bristol Museum</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is still the case that Wilberforce remains the only household name of a history that begins during the reign of Elizabeth I and ends in the 1830s. There is no slave trader or slave owner, and certainly no enslaved person, who can compete with Wilberforce when it comes to name recognition. Little surprise then that when, in 2007, we marked the bicentenary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade, the only feature film to emerge from the commemoration was <em>Amazing Grace</em>, a Wilberforce biopic.</p> \n<p>George Orwell once likened Britain to a wealthy family that maintains a guilty silence about the sources of its wealth. Orwell, whose real name was Eric Blair, had seen that conspiracy of silence at close quarters. His father, Richard W Blair, was a civil servant who <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jun/30/george-orwell-birthplace-motihari-bihar-india-museum\" title=\"George Orwell's birthplace in India set to become a museum\">oversaw the production of opium</a> on plantations near the Indian-Nepalese border and supervised the export of that lethal crop to China. The department for which the elder Blair worked was called, unashamedly, the opium department. However, the Blair family fortune – which had been largely squandered by the time Eric was born – stemmed from their investments in plantations far from India.</p> \n<p>The Blair name is one of thousands that appear in a collection of documents held at the <a href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/slavery-or-slave-owners/\" title=\"How to look for records of slavery or slave owners\">National Archives</a> in Kew that have the potential to do to Britain what the hackers of WikiLeaks and the researchers of PBS did to Affleck. The T71 files consist of 1,631 volumes of leather-bound ledgers and neatly tied bundles of letters that have lain in the archives for 180 years, for the most part unexamined. They are the records and the correspondence of the Slave Compensation Commission.</p> \n<p>The Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 formally freed 800,000 Africans who were then the legal property of Britain’s slave owners. What is less well known is that the same act contained a provision for the financial compensation of the owners of those slaves, by the British taxpayer, for the loss of their “property”. The compensation commission was the government body established to evaluate the claims of the slave owners and administer the distribution of the &pound;20m the government had set aside to pay them off. That sum represented 40% of the total government expenditure for 1834. It is the modern equivalent of between &pound;16bn and &pound;17bn.</p> \n<p>The compensation of Britain’s 46,000 slave owners was the largest bailout in British history until the bailout of the banks in 2009. Not only did the slaves receive nothing, under another clause of the act they were compelled to provide 45 hours of unpaid labour each week for their former masters, for a further four years after their supposed liberation. In effect, the enslaved paid part of the bill for their own manumission.</p> \n<p>The records of the Slave Compensation Commission are an unintended byproduct of the scheme. They represent a near complete census of British slavery as it was on 1 August, 1834, the day the system ended. For that one day we have a full list of Britain’s slave owners. All of them. The T71s tell us how many slaves each of them owned, where those slaves lived and toiled, and how much compensation the owners received for them. Although the existence of the T71s was never a secret, it was not until 2010 that a team from University College London began to systematically analyse them. The <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/\" title=\"\">Legacies of British Slave-ownership</a> project, which is still continuing, is led by Professor Catherine Hall and Dr Nick Draper, and the picture of slave ownership that has emerged from their work is not what anyone was expecting.</p> \n<p>The large slave owners, the men of the “West India interest”, who owned huge estates from which they drew vast fortunes, appear in the files of the commission. The man who received the most money from the state was John Gladstone, the father of Victorian prime minister William Ewart Gladstone. He was paid &pound;106,769 in compensation for the 2,508 slaves he owned across nine plantations, the modern equivalent of about &pound;80m. Given such an investment, it is perhaps not surprising that William Gladstone’s maiden speech in parliament was in defence of slavery.</p> \n<p>The records show that for the 218 men and women he regarded as his property, Charles Blair, the great-grandfather of George Orwell, was paid the more modest sum of &pound;4,442 – the modern equivalent of about &pound;3m. There are other famous names hidden within the records. Ancestors of the novelist Graham Greene, the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott all received compensation for slaves. As did a distant ancestor of David Cameron. But what is most significant is the revelation of the smaller-scale slave owners.</p> \n<p>Slave ownership, it appears, was far more common than has previously been presumed. Many of these middle-class slave owners had just a few slaves, possessed no land in the Caribbean and rented their slaves out to landowners, in work gangs.These bit-players were home county vicars, iron manufacturers from the Midlands and lots and lots of widows. About 40% of the slave owners living in the colonies were women. Then, as now, women tended to outlive their husbands and simply inherited human property through their partner’s wills.</p> \n<p>The geographic spread of the slave owners who were resident in Britain in 1834 was almost as unexpected as the gender breakdown. Slavery was once thought of as an activity largely limited to the ports from which the ships of the triangular trade set sail; Bristol, London, Liverpool and Glasgow. Yet there were slave owners across the country, from Cornwall to the Orkneys. In proportion to population, the highest rates of slave ownership are found in Scotland.</p> \n<p>The T71 files have been converted into an online database; a free, publicly available resource.</p> \n<p>During the production of a documentary series about Britain’s slave owners for the BBC, made in partnership with UCL, all of my colleagues who learned of the existence of the database found themselves compelled to enter their own family names. Those whose surnames flashed up on screen experienced, like Ben Affleck, a strange sense of embarrassment, irrespective of whether the slave owners in question were potentially ancestors.</p> \n<p>There are, however, millions of people, in the Caribbean and the UK, who do not need a database to tell them that they are linked to Britain’s hidden slave-owning past. The descendants of the enslaved carry the same English surnames that appear in the ledgers of the Slave Compensation Commission – Gladstone, Beckford, Hibbert, Blair, etc – names that were imposed on their ancestors, initials that were sometimes branded on their skin, in order to mark them as items of property.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2015/28/britains-forgotten-slave-owners/\" title=\"\"><em>Britain’s Forgotten Slave Owners</em></a><em>, the first of two episodes, presented by David Olusoga, will be broadcast on Wednesday on BBC2.
