The dramatic move, after 48 hours of sensational developments in Greece’s long-running battles with creditors, was sparked by the call on Friday night by country’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras , for a referendum on its creditors’ demands. That prompted finance ministers of the eurozone to effectively put an end to his country’s five-year bailout by the International Monetary Fund, the ECB and the European commission.</p> \n<p> In a brief, televised address to the nation, Tsipras threw the blame on to the leaders of the eurozone. But he did not say how long the banks would remain shut, nor did he give details of how much individuals and companies would be allowed to withdraw once they reopened.</p> \n<p>In the early hours of Monday morning, Tsipras published a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/29/greek-debt-crisis-key-points-athens-bank-controls\">decree in the official government gazette</a> setting out the capital controls to be imposed on the country.</p> \n<p>The decree – entitled ‘Bank Holiday break’ – was signed by Tsipras and the Greek president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos.</p> \n<p>It said all banks would be kept shut until after the referendum on 5 July and withdrawals from cash machines would be limited to €60 – about &pound;40. Cash machines were not expected to reopen until later on Monday.</p> \n<p>Foreign transfers out of Greece are prohibited, although online transactions between Greek bank accounts are to continue as normal. Tsipras insisted pensions and wages would be unaffected by the controls.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/29/greek-debt-crisis-key-points-athens-bank-controls\">Greek debt crisis: the key points of Athens bank controls</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Greece’s finance ministry later announced that the strict ATM withdrawal limits would not apply to holders of credit or debit cards issued in foreign countries. This was seen as a necessary move after worries that tourists were seen joining locals in front of ATMs on Sunday. Any similar restriction would hurt tourism, Greece’s one thriving industry, which accounts for at least a fifth of economic activity.</p> \n<p> The prime minister said that Saturday’s move by the eurozone’s finance ministers to halt Greece’s bailout programme was unprecedented. He called it “a denial of the Greek public’s right to reach a democratic decision”.</p> \n<p> Tsipras added that the finance ministers’ initiative had prompted the ECB to curb its assistance, forcing the government to take the steps that it had. He said he had once again appealed for an extension of the bailout until after the referendum, on 5 July, sending his proposal to the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, the leaders of the 18 member states of the single currency, the commission and the ECB.</p> \n<p>As fears spread through Sunday that capital controls would need to be put in place, growing numbers of depositors lined up at ATMs, even in affluent city areas, to withdraw what cash they could.</p> \n<p>Drivers also flocked to gas stations across Greece, prompting the country’s largest refiner to issue a statement reassuring there are enough reserves. Refiner Hellenic Petroleum said: “We maintain fuel reserves for several months. The supply of our refineries with crude oil is also assured.”</p> \n<p> The country’s plight deteriorated sharply on Friday night when Tsipras put his country’s future in the balance by suddenly calling a referendum and arguing robustly for a rejection of the price set by his creditors for saving Greece, at least for a few more months. This Sunday’s vote will ask Greeks whether they approve or disapprove of the last offer tabled by the creditors before the negotiations broke down.</p> \n<p> But during a marathon parliamentary debate that ended in the early hours of Sunday morning, opposition leaders argued that it was, in fact, a vote on whether Greeks wished any longer to be part of the eurozone. It will be Greece’s first referendum since the country voted to abolish its monarchy in 1974.</p> \n<p> The European commission said on Sunday for the first time in the crisis that it wanted to offer Greece debt relief, Tsipras’s central demand during the five months of stalemated talks. Reports from Berlin said that Angela Merkel and Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande shared that view.</p> \n<p>But the potential concession appeared to come too late to prevent growing chaos in Greece – and sparked concerns across the Atlantic. Barack Obama was said to have called Merkel, the German chancellor, to urge her to take action. Jack Lew, the US Treasury secretary, urged creditors to offer debt relief to Greece.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/28/the-greeks-for-whom-all-the-talk-means-nothing-because-they-have-nothing\">The Greeks for whom all the talk means nothing – because they have nothing</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Financial analysts will be watching the impact on the markets, which have not yet had the chance to react to the events of the last 48 hours. Mario Draghi, the president of the ECB, tightened the screws somewhat on the country.</p> \n<p> The governing council of the ECB decided to freeze emergency liquidity assistance to the Greek banks, the lifeline that is keeping the national financial system functioning. The ELA was capped at last Friday’s level of €89bn. It meant that the banks could continue to function, but the draining of money as people flocked to the ATMs to retrieve their savings also meant they would run out of money that could not be replenished by the central bank.</p> \n<p> “We continue to work closely with the Bank of Greece,” Draghi said.</p> \n<p> Greece’s financial stability committee, which includes the finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, and the central bank governor, Yannis Stournaras, met on Sunday evening to discuss Greece’s rapidly shrinking options. The high-level political confrontations on Friday and Saturday produced the greatest uncertainty over Greece and in the eurozone in the five-year debt saga.</p> \n<p> The fallout from the collapse of negotiations and the calling of the referendum brought recrimination on all sides and predictions of gloom.</p> \n<p> The German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, said he was “perplexed and depressed” by developments. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who heads the committee of eurozone finance ministers, said that with his referendum call, Tsipras was thrusting the country into a mess from which it would struggle to recover.</p> \n<p> “We are millimetres away from the total collapse of the Greek financial system,” warned Herman Van Rompuy, until last year the president of the European council and heavily involved in years of Greek rescue negotiations. “It’s actually suicide that’s taking place in Greece right now.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/28/the-guardian-view-on-greece-and-the-euro-no-money-left\">The Guardian view on Greece and the euro: no money left | Editorial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> The restrictions being imposed are anathema to Tsipras’s radical left-led government – all the more so since it desperately needs to keep public opinion on its side ahead of the referendum.</p> \n<p> Varoufakis told the BBC in a Sunday interview: “Capital controls within a monetary union are a contradiction in terms.” But he was party to Sunday night’s decision.</p> \n<p> In the early hours of Sunday, parliament voted 178 to 120 in favour of holding the referendum. Embarrassingly for the government, the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn movement joined Tsipras’s Syriza party and its populist rightwing coalition partner, ANEL, in backing the proposal.</p> \n<p> By Sunday evening, however, it had not received the necessary endorsement of Greece’s president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos.</p> \n<p> According to two polls published on Sunday, Tsipras faces an uphill battle to secure the rejection he has indicated that he favours. One in the right-leaning tabloid Proto Thema found 57% of those interviewed favoured acceptance of the creditors’ latest offer. Another in the centre-left To Vima put support at 47%.</p> \n<p> </p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a988b054a5402639a1992cde951a16178a3127c1/0_0_3500_2100/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2100,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"STRINGER/Reuters","altText":"Greek citizens line up to withdraw cash from a cash machine on the island of Crete","cleanCredit":"Photograph: STRINGER/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-29T06:26:23Z","lastModified":"2015-06-29T07:13:18Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1744,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian Traynor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/iantraynor"},{"name":"John Hooper","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/johnhooper"},{"name":"Helena Smith","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/helenasmith"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Greece","Eurozone crisis","Europe","Alexis Tsipras","World news","Banking","Business","Economics","Euro","Currencies","European Central Bank","European Union","European banks","European monetary union","Financial crisis","Financial sector","Euro","Stock markets"],"tags":[{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/alexis-tsipras","webTitle":"Alexis Tsipras"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"business/banking","webTitle":"Banking"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"business/euro","webTitle":"Euro"},{"id":"business/currencies","webTitle":"Currencies"},{"id":"business/european-central-bank","webTitle":"European Central Bank"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"business/europeanbanks","webTitle":"European banks"},{"id":"business/emu","webTitle":"European monetary union"},{"id":"business/financial-crisis","webTitle":"Financial crisis"},{"id":"business/financial-sector","webTitle":"Financial sector"},{"id":"world/euro","webTitle":"Euro"},{"id":"business/stock-markets","webTitle":"Stock markets"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-deepens-banks-close-a-week-weekend-shook-euro","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a7he","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-deepens-banks-close-a-week-weekend-shook-euro","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-deepens-banks-close-a-week-weekend-shook-euro"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-457298641","source":"Reuters","durationInSeconds":40,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/29/150629ATMs_FromGAus-16x9.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/29/150629ATMs_FromGAus/150629ATMs_FromGAus.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435538974983/Greek-ATM-001.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":640,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The lines at the Greek bank ATMs grew longer in the early hours of Monday (June 29), after the government moved to check the growing strains on its crippled financial system.

There has been a significant increase in the level of counter-terrorist policing activity in the UK. Last year, there were over 330 arrests – about one a day – and 89 people were convicted for terror-related offences.”</p> \n<p>Amid the increasing tensions over the threat posed to Britons by Islamic State, the former head of the British army Lord Dannatt said the west should take the fight to the extremist group on the ground, in their heartlands. “We have got to do much more to support those in the region who are fighting Islamist extremists on the ground,” he told BBC1’s Sunday Politics.</p> \n<p>“Yes, we can support them from the air, we should be doing more of that, but we should be doing more to support them on the ground as well. More training teams, better equipment and really giving those who are willing to fight the best chance of succeeding, because to succeed on the ground is the really important thing to do.”</p> \n<p>Security services across the west were alarmed throughout 2014 by the growth in the potency of Isis, and its ability to attract western youngsters to its cause. They point out that al-Qaida still poses a big threat.</p> \n<p>In August 2014, the UK terrorist level was raised to its second highest level of “severe”, meaning a terrorist attack is highly likely. May said the heightened alert was “related to developments in Syria and Iraq, where terrorist groups are planning attacks against the west”.</p> \n<p>Attacks in Sydney, New York and Ottawa in late 2014, then Paris in January 2015, demonstrated terrorists had the ability to strike on western soil, with attacks ranging from assailants acting alone to sophisticated group operations.</p> \n<p>The danger from so called leaderless jihad, where propaganda incites “lone wolves”, has added to the threat from more directed plots. The Islamist terror threat has twice claimed lives on Britain’s streets in recent years in the 77/attacks while the soldier Lee Rigby was killed near the Woolwich military barracks, south London, in May 2013 by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowlale.</p> \n<p>David Cameron, writing in today’s Daily Telegraph, said the government would counter the threat posed by Islamist extremists with a “full-spectrum response” and that it was important to show “unshakeable resolve” in the face of terror.</p> \n<p><br /></p> \n<p><br /></p> \n<p><br /></p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/de068c0e2d24f495cc00a69d4e73b5f562d8064b/0_56_3000_1802/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1802,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images","altText":"Sousse in Tunisia","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/42e23871be4f2aae26f25fa9699c255323d2f62f/0_0_3500_2101/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2101,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Armed Met police officers on duty at the Pride march in London.

Few at the time paid much heed to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife as they drove through the streets of Sarajevo. Within six weeks, however, Europe was at war.</p> \n<p>Make no mistake, the decision by Alexis Tsipras to hold a referendum on the bailout terms being demanded of his country has the potential to be a Sarajevo moment. The crisis is not just about whether there is soon to be a bank run in Greece, although there is certainly the threat of one. It is not just about whether the creditors overplayed their hand in the negotiations, although they did. It is about the future of the euro itself.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/28/greek-crisis-ecb-decide-emergency-funding\">Greek banks to stay closed on Monday</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There will be much talk in the next few days about how Greece can be quarantined. The three people who have been leading the negotiations for the troika - Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund, Jean-Claude Juncker of the European commission and Mario Draghi of the European Central Bank - can still cling to the hope that Tsipras will lose the referendum next Sunday.</p> \n<p>In those circumstances, the Syriza-led coalition would have little choice but to hold an election. The return of a government headed by, for example, the centre-right New Democracy, would open up the possibility that Athens would sue for peace on the terms demanded by the troika.</p> \n<p>There is, however, no guarantee of this. The troika was certain last week that Tsipras would fold when presented with a final take-it-or-leave-it offer. They were wrong. The Fund, the ECB and the European commission made a fatal misjudgement and have now lost control of events.</p> \n<p>The immediate decision for the ECB was whether to cut off emergency funding before the country’s bailout programme formally ends on Tuesday. Wisely, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/28/greek-crisis-ecb-decide-emergency-funding\">it has chosen not to make matters worse</a>.</p> \n<p> In recent weeks, the Greek banks have only been able to stay open because Draghi has provided funds to compensate for capital flight. Sunday night’s announcement of an emergency bank holiday and capital controls demonstrates just how critical the situation has become.</p> \n<p>Germany strongly supports the immediate end to emergency liquidity assistance (ELA), arguing that taxpayers in the rest of Europe should not be further exposed to the risk of a Greek exit from the single currency. The ECB, however, has always been reluctant to take what would clearly be a political decision to escalate the pressure on the Greek banks, and has announced that it will continue providing funding at last week’s level. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-disaster-athens-collosal-failure-eu\">Greece crisis: a disaster for Athens and a colossal failure for the EU</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even so, Greece now faces a week of turmoil. Tsipras bowed what seemed to be inevitable on Sunday by announcing controls to try to prevent Northern Rock-style queues outside the banks and - just as importantly - money leaving the country.</p> \n<p>The Greek government will also be making contingency plans for exit from the single currency. Tsipras and Yannis Varoufakis, his finance minister, say that is not their wish or intention, but if the result of the referendum backs the government’s stance it is hard to see any alternative. Cyprus stayed in the euro after introducing capital controls, but it was done with the approval of other single currency members and involved knuckling down under an austerity programme.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, the blame game has begun. The creditors say they offered Greece a deal that would have secured future financing in return for reforms and budget savings which would have hastened the country’s economic recovery. Lagarde has said there is now nothing on the table and that Greece should not expect the same terms to be available after the referendum.</p> \n<p>Tsipras said the troika was proposing an “extortionate ultimatum” of “strict and humiliating austerity without end”. A spokesman for Varoufakis said the referendum meant the end to five years of “waterboarding”.</p> \n<p>The stance taken by the troika has been wrong-headed but inevitable. Greece has seen its economy shrink by 25% in the past five years. A quarter of its population is unemployed. It has suffered a slump of Great Depression proportions, yet the troika has been demanding fresh tax increases that will suck demand from the economy, stifle growth and add to Greece’s debt burden.</p> \n<p>If Greece were outside the euro, IMF advice would be different. The fund would be telling Greece to devalue its currency. It would be telling the country’s creditors that they would have to take a “haircut” in order to make Greece’s debts sustainable. It would then justify domestic austerity on the grounds that the benefits of the devaluation should not be frittered away in higher inflation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/28/the-greeks-for-whom-all-the-talk-means-nothing-because-they-have-nothing\">The Greeks for whom all the talk means nothing - because they have nothing</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This option, though, has not been made available to Greece. It is unable to devalue and European governments are resistant to the idea of a debt write-down. So the only way Greece can make itself more competitive is to cut costs, by reducing wages and pensions.</p> \n<p>A fully fledged monetary union has the means to transfer resources from one region to another. This is what happens in the US or the UK, for example, with higher taxes in areas that are doing well being redistributed to areas with slower growth and higher unemployment.</p> \n<p>The euro, however, was constructed along different lines. Countries were allowed to join even though it was clear they would struggle to compete with the better performing nations such as Germany. A stability and growth pact designed to ensure a common set of budget controls was a poor substitute for fiscal union. From the start, it was obvious that the only mechanism for a country that ran into severe difficulties would be harsh austerity. Greece is the result of what happens when politics is allowed to override economics.</p> \n<p>If Greece leaves, the idea that the euro is irrevocable is broken. Any government that runs into difficulties in the future will have the Greek option of devaluation as an alternative to endless austerity. Just as importantly, the financial markets will know that, and will pile pressure on countries that look vulnerable.

But everyone was talking about the rapper – even Sunday’s closing act the Who, says Alexis Petridis</p>","byline":"Alexis Petridis","body":"<p>There are many diverting sights to take in at Glastonbury: everything from Pussy Riot forcing a gun-toting man to wear a rainbow balaclava in the name of politically charged performance art, to the Dalai Lama addressing the stone circle on Sunday morning, traditionally a time when it is largely populated not by seekers of spiritual insight but by people who haven’t been to bed since Thursday, struggling to uncross their eyeballs. But one thing you almost never see is a performer using a torrential downpour of rain to their advantage, which is one of the things that makes <strong>Mary J Blige</strong>’s Friday afternoon appearance on the Pyramid stage a genuinely remarkable event. She announces that she’s never been to Glastonbury before – handy clarification for anyone who thought they saw the self-styled Queen of Hip-Hop Soul down the front for Ozric Tentacles in 93 – but her performance is dazzlingly slick. Then she plays a startlingly intense version of the title track of her 2001 album No More Drama, crouching on the rain-lashed lip of the stage, as if she’s treating the elements as a special effect, amping up the song’s harrowing, cathartic power. Her voice is incredible, all the more so if you’ve spent the earlier part of the afternoon listening to some pretty wan-sounding alt-rock bands. When it ends, the audience goes so nuts for so long that her band can’t start the next song. Looking out over the field, Blige bursts into tears.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dde0a2a9432df12eeed34ee9fb85c51303e5f1b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435508437217/f5519297-e292-4dd1-8bd1-a536aa07aff3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mary J Blige performs at Glastonbury.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary J Blige performs at Glastonbury.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Redferns via Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>You can’t accuse Friday’s Pyramid stage bill of lacking eclecticism. Blige is followed by <strong>Mot&ouml;rhead</strong>, a band whose immutability is part of their appeal. Their sound is like a multistorey car park: grey, hard, wilfully ugly, cast in concrete in 1976. But this evening, Lemmy cuts a surprisingly frail figure onstage, and the band seem somehow sapped of their raw power: it feels tinny and sluggish. A similar problem affects <strong>the Libertines</strong>, who fill the gap left by Florence + the Machine’s elevation to headline status: their ricketiness is part of their appeal, and their set might well sound great in a smaller venue, but in a vast space like this it seems undernourished and insubstantial.</p> \n<p>“We spent our entire stage production budget on making the sun come out,” yells El-P of <strong>Run the Jewels</strong>, triumphantly, as the duo arrive on the West Holts stage. “Yeah, $82,” deadpans his partner, Killer Mike. It’s true that there isn’t a great deal to Run the Jewels’ live show: just the pair of them and a DJ. But it works, even in front of a huge crowd: the duo are incredibly charismatic onstage. There’s something infectious about their obvious delight at finding the biggest success of their respective careers as middle age approaches and they have an ability to seamlessly switch the mood from wit to fury and back again. At the other extreme, <strong>Mark Ronson</strong> pulls out all the production stops, and that works too: there’s something faintly overwhelming about his show on the Other stage, which features BMX bikers, double-dutch skippers, his band performing to a recording of the late Amy Winehouse singing Valerie and a plethora of special guests. Boy George sings Do You Really Want to Hurt Me? in a top hat with fake dreadlocks attached to it. For the concluding Uptown Funk, Ronson is joined not just by Mary J Blige, but Grandmaster Flash and George Clinton of Parliament-Funkadelic: it’s a totally joyous performance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d58536e41fbe91126cc05560329e93ddce653dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435508513615/e5f74f68-bf30-4910-8781-42cc415a84e5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Ronson at Glastonbury.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Ronson at Glastonbury.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Hordle/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Also clearly making an effort are substitute headliners <strong>Florence + the Machine</strong>. Florence Welch doesn’t so much seize the opportunity as grab it by the throat and wrestle it to the ground. She does everything to win over the audience short of offering to pack up their tents for them on Monday morning. She repeatedly ventures into the crowd, much to the consternation of the bouncers. She puts a flower garland on her head, proffered by a fan. She encourages audience members to clamber on their partners’ shoulders. She asks the audience if they want to get high: this being Glastonbury, the answer is a resounding yes. She talks about ley lines. She reminisces about the days when she played in an outlying tea tent at the festival, “but I had a feeling everything was beautiful”. She throws shapes with such abandon that we occasionally seem to be venturing perilously close to the world of interpretive dance. It veers between ridiculous, entertainingly ridiculous, faintly irritating and authentically endearing. The crowd love it, aided by the fact that the main stage at Glastonbury potentiates grandiose gestures and anthemic music: for better or for worse, a headlining set at the festival is no place to start exploring your music’s more arcane subtleties, as Kanye West will subsequently discover. A woman whose music doesn’t really have that many subtleties to explore in the first place, Welch is ideally placed: You Got the Love provokes a mass singalong, and it’s hard to begrudge her her unexpected moment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b14d736d25955a96a9f1ac457e2ae2105a5e9a3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435511329536/4499ba9c-22ca-4e77-9e00-8d454962ac2e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Florence Welch on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Florence Welch on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Saturday dawns with the beautiful sound of <strong>the Unthanks</strong> singing folk songs accompanied by an orchestra, but the John Peel stage offers shouting. <strong>Slaves</strong> are raw-throated and estuary-accented, but their take on punk is more lighthearted than it first appears: indeed, on their more jokey tracks, such as Where’s Your Car Debbie?, the ghost of Splodgenessabounds’ Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps Please lurks improbably around. And then it’s <strong>Sleaford Mods</strong>, whose approach to the festival offers an intriguing contrast to the standard “we’re-so-grateful-to-be-here-this-is-a-dream-come-true” approach. “The toilets are fucking shit here,” opines Jason Williamson. “Everything’s fucking shit here.” Their set is relentlessly powerful: Williamson is magnetic, Jobseeker and Fizzy’s howls of despair and anger genuinely hit a nerve with the audience. “Got a bit tense that, didn’t it?” he nods after the latter comes to an end. “Got a bit carried away.”</p> \n<p>Elsewhere <strong>Clean Bandit</strong> draw a huge crowd to the Other stage. You can see why Rather Be was a huge hit – it’s got a massive, inescapable hook – and they cover Robin S’s 1993 hit Show Me Love, a record that was audibly hugely influential on the the current wave of vastly successful pop-house, but their brand of dance music still feels devoid of grit, as antiseptic as the hand gel you’re advised to use after visiting one of the lavatories that so upset the guy from Sleaford Mods. Over on the Park stage, meanwhile, <strong>Father John Misty</strong> is in full flow. It’s not just that singer-songwriter Josh Tillman’s music sounds substantially more aggressive and less obviously indebted to mid-70s LA rock live than on record, although it does. It’s that Tillman himself is a brilliant performer. Besuited and luxuriantly bearded, he manages to exude an aura of sleazy malevolence while hamming it up relentlessly: dropping to the floor, plunging into the crowd, clambering on top of his drummer’s kit to perform the title track of I Love You Honeybear, thrusting his pelvis as he sings the title of When You Are Smiling and Astride Me, examining the selection of festival wristbands on his arm between songs: “This one means I’m underage, ladies.” It’s simultaneously hugely entertaining and slightly discomfiting, an impressive trick to pull off.</p> \n<p><strong>Pharrell Williams</strong>’s Saturday evening performance on the Pyramid stage offers a rather more straightforward approach. In fact, it’s got a hint of the light-entertainment spectacular about it: he brings on a chorus of children to sing Happy, invites a load of festival-goers to dance behind him – rather shamelessly, the handful of men among them are hastily ushered offstage – and offers a lot of slightly oily patter about the beautiful ladies of England. He cedes the stage to a female dance troupe called the Baes and brings on a woman who stands on her head and walks on her hands. Williams sings She Wants to Move to her inverted form, which looks a bit peculiar, as if he’s addressing the song to her crotch. Elsewhere, he smartly takes the same approach to his live show as Nile Rodgers of Chic, performing not just his solo material, but tracks he has produced or written or guested on, which means the set is almost comically overstuffed with hits: Blurred Lines, Get Lucky, Drop It Like It’s Hot, Hot In Herre.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e705da2382239e6f75e22d7b7d227b54806d8848\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435508595573/eac96cd4-42df-409c-9893-74e8ec0a804d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pharrell Williams at Glastonbury.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pharrell Williams at Glastonbury.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tabatha Fireman/Redferns via Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It all makes for an intriguing contrast with what follows: while Williams goes out of his way to win over the crowd, <strong>Kanye West</strong> doesn’t bother. There are no dancers, no grand special effects, no sense of an artist turning on the charm: just West, rapping underneath a vast ceiling of glaring white lights. There’s something admirable about his bloody-minded determination to do everything on his terms, rather than cravenly court the audience’s affections, and the opening burst of songs is genuinely thrilling. The staging is starkly impressive, his performance is forceful, not even a stage invader can blunt Black Skinhead’s edge. But for something that, according to one of West’s few onstage announcements, involved an entire creative team to stage, it’s a weirdly disjointed and uneven show. He cuts big hits short, not least Gold Digger, but extends a performance of Lost in the World, a beatless Auto-Tuned ballad featuring a guest appearance from Justin Vernon of indie folk band Bon Iver: it comes decorated with a monolgue about the song’s creation and a lot of camera closeups of West looking pensive and melancholy on the stageside screens. As the intro to Touch the Sky begins, he suddenly stops the song, mutters “that’s not what we rehearsed in the dressing room” and vanishes. He reappears performing the song on the platform of a cherry picker. It would be spectacular stagecraft were it not for the fact that there’s a vast gap before he resurfaces: the stage is black and silent, the show’s momentum is lost. It fitfully sparks again: during All the Lights and Jesus Walks, when he performs a cover of Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody, despite the fact that the latter demonstrates that without Auto-Tune, West’s singing voice is no great shakes.</p> \n<p>As the set ends, he repeatedly informs the audience that they are watching “the greatest living rock star on the planet”. He has a point. If you think that it’s the job of rock stars to be grandiloquent, complex, controversial and occasionally ridiculous figures, so remote from everyday life that they seem almost otherworldly, then it’s hard to think of anyone currently doing a better job. The problem is that tonight’s performance doesn’t back the claim up: it offers flickers of greatness rather than a blaze of glory. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7874b4d7aac0e3ae1a42acca63ade05279b592a0\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7874b4d7aac0e3ae1a42acca63ade05279b592a0/0_43_2868_1719/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patti Smith … feel the power.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patti Smith … feel the power.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The next day, the lead singer of <strong>Fat White Family</strong> exposes his genitals on the Park stage, <strong>Lionel Richie</strong> draws what looks suspiciously like the biggest crowd of the festival and spends virtually his entire show wearing a cartoonish OMG expression at their vociferous reaction: they even love it when he neglects to play Easy in favour of a version of USA For Africa’s We Are The World. <strong>Patti Smith</strong> brings the Dalai Lama onto the Pyramid stage in the middle of an astonishing, incendiary set: she ends with a cover of the Who’s My Generation, tearing the strings off her guitar as it shrieks and howls. She even manages to make falling over seem cool. “I fell on my ass at Glastonbury because I’m an ANIMAL!” she growls by way of explanation.</p> \n<p>“What a night you’ve got,” says <strong>Paul Weller</strong> gruffly, not, one suspects, a man who’s ever been much given to spending his weekends trudging through mud with glitter on his face carrying a flag that says PAUL AND SPUD’S BARMY ARMY. “Not just us but the Who as well.” The audience roar: there are people here in FUCK KANYE T-shirts, a lot of blokes with Liam Gallagher hair. But these days, at least, Weller is nowhere near as musically conservative as some of his fans. The hits understandably get the biggest response – Changing Man, You Do Something To Me, That’s Entertainment, a slightly trudgy version of Start!, a sparkier take on A Town Called Malice that concludes the set – but the most intriguing stuff he plays is off his most recent album, Saturn’s Pattern: if it’s less fragmented and strange than its predecessor, Sonik Kicks, there’s still something exploratory and off-kilter about the piano-powered title track, and the dense, ominous psychedelia of opener White Sky.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89c33a3d1057c76943666dfd19476504ff641b64\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/89c33a3d1057c76943666dfd19476504ff641b64/0_41_3000_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend of the Who.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Their generation: Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend of the Who.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samir Hussein/Redferns via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>The Who</strong>, claims Pete Townshend – even more gruffly than Paul Weller – have “an easy job”: “we ’ave to send you ’ome ’appy.” They do this by rolling out the hits in quick succession: Who Are You, The Seeker, Pictures of Lily, Behind Blue Eyes. My Generation now comes with an odd, slow little coda in place of the old explosive, Keith Moon-fuelled ending that’s presumably there to circumvent the inevitable question of what a 71-year-old man is doing singing the line about hoping he dies before he gets old: “My generation, we’re still here today.” From a projection at the back of the stage, the young Moon stares down, doe-eyed.</p> \n<p>Daltrey can still swing a microphone around with considerable panache, but his voice is rougher than it was. Even so, it still has a powerful belligerence about it that matches the sound of Townshend’s guitar and brings out the distrust and paranoia at the heart of I Can See For Miles. The guitarist seems a bit underwhelmed by the set. “It could have been better,” he says, before a version of Won’t Get Fooled Again that sounds great. The band didn’t get to soundcheck, he complains, although frankly no one would have known if he hadn’t mentioned it. And then he raises an amused eyebrow at Kanye West’s line about being the greatest rock star on the planet.</p> \n<p>Still, the next morning, it’s still the only thing that people at Glastonbury are talking about. West appears to have succeeded in making the biggest music festival in Europe all about him, which is an achievement in itself.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435508233729/8b8f977a-7f72-4518-af79-13a1240aa609-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Samir Hussein/Redferns via Getty","altText":"Bohemian rapsody (geddit): Kanye does Glastonbury","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Samir Hussein/Redferns via Getty"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435508438577/f5519297-e292-4dd1-8bd1-a536aa07aff3-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mary J Blige performs at Glastonbury.
