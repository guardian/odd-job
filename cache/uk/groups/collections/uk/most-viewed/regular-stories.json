Perhaps ironically, they came undone when the geometry-obsessed World Cup holders delivered a rare cross. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/gallery/2015/jul/02/womens-world-cup-japan-beat-england-in-pictures\">Women's World Cup: Japan beat England – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A semi-final England’s coach had predicted would be very much about set pieces was level courtesy of a pair of somewhat debatable penalties, and drifting into extra time when Japan broke and Nahomi Kawusumi unleashed an excellent, subtly curving ball from the right. If anyone needed a reminder of why high-calibre crosses change games, this was it.</p> \n<p>Under acute pressure from two attackers, Bassett attempted to clear but merely succeeded in forcing the ball over Karen Bardsley’s head before watching in horror as it grazed the underside of the bar and dropped a yard over the line.</p> \n<p>As tears began rolling down Bassett’s face, the final whistle blew. Instantly the centre half was engulfed by team-mates desperate to offer her a consolatory hug.</p> \n<p>Bassett and the rest of Sampson’s squad must travel back to London via Saturday’s third place playoff against Germany, while Japan will face USA in the following day’s denouement.</p> \n<p>Prince William and David Cameron had been at the front of the queue of well wishers sending the Lionesses good luck messages on Wednesday, but Norio Sasaki was not convinced.</p> \n<p>“There are places where England fall unintentionally apart,” said Japan’s coach, somewhat sniffily, shortly before kick off. “I wonder how they have been so successful so far?”</p> \n<p>Shortly after kickoff, Jodie Taylor looked set to ruffle his confidence after connecting with Karen Bardsley’s long kick – but she directed her volley slightly off target.</p> \n<p>After that, much of the first half was all about Japan dominating possession, with the Lionesses struggling to second-guess Aya Miyami’s midfield promptings and sometimes wrongfooted by the classy Rumi Utsugi.</p> \n<p>The good news for Sampson was that the <em>Nadeshiko</em> struggled to get behind a supremely well organised defence, and Bardsley was barely troubled. Indeed, on admittedly rare counter-attacks invariably featuring long balls, Jill Scott and Taylor, the Lionesses looked reasonably threatening.</p> \n<p>Everything changed when Claire Rafferty shoved Saori Ariyoshi just inside the area – England protested, forlornly, it was just outside – and Miayma stepped up to take the penalty. Despite delaying her kick and then stuttering in the run-up, she sent Bardsley the wrong way.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN57_OiHpqQ\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vN57_OiHpqQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  England coach Mark Sampson praises the team’s performance despite an injury-time own-goal by defender Laura Bassett which put Japan into the final of the Women’s World Cup\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If Sampson had a case for arguing that Rafferty’s inital push had been made marginally outside the area, he could have had no complaints when England – due &pound;35,000 per woman bonuses had they lifted the trophy – won a distinctly iffy penalty of their own. </p> \n<p>This time, Steph Houghton tumbled all too easy in the face of Yuki Ogimi’s challenge, but the referee bought it and Fara Williams stepped up to the spot. Sampson’s set-piece specialist did not let him down, her kick comfortably evading Ayumi Kaihori’s grasp.</p> \n<p>With Taylor’s knee – she had surgery only two months ago – forcing her replacement by Ellen White after an hour, Japan looked relieved. They appeared even more so as Toni Duggan’s shot rebounded off the bar.</p> \n<p>Sasaki introduced Mana Iwabuchi – aka “The Killer” – from the bench, and the creator dubbed “the brightest flower” of the Japanese women’s game promptly began causing England all sorts of problems as she ran through a repertoire of tricks. So many, indeed, that there was a strong suspicion that Sampson, ever streetwise, instructed Bardsley to fake an injury in order to use the break in play to re-group his Lionesses.</p> \n<p>No matter. Despite Taylor’s withdrawl, England remained very much in the game. White forced a splendid save from Japan’s goalkeeper Kaihori, and Jill Scott headed wide.</p> \n<p>Extra time and possibly penalties were beckoning – but then Bassett, otherwise excellent for England throughout this tournament, endured the worst moment of her career.</p> \n<p>In time, even she may be able to see the bigger picture. It involves the Lionesses’ achievement in reaching the semi finals of a women’s World Cup for the first time, and becoming the first national team of either gender to make the last four since Sir Bobby Robson’s boys of Italia 90.</p> \n<p>They may have stumbled at the penultimate hurdle but, with a nation newly inspired, it will be a major surprise if the topography of the female game in England does not alter beyond recognition.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/035f6fa906e080bf907c5bc1889ad9c82c396d10/0_172_3544_2126/3544.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2126,"width":3544,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ronald Martinez/Getty Images","altText":"Laura Bassett","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ronald Martinez/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T07:23:53Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T07:23:55Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1004,"contributors":[{"name":"Louise Taylor","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/21/1400686541664/Louise-Taylor-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/louisetaylor"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Women's World Cup 2015","England women's football team","Football","Women's football","Sport","UK news","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"football/women-s-world-cup-2015","webTitle":"Women's World Cup 2015"},{"id":"football/england-womens-football-team","webTitle":"England women's football team"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"football/womensfootball","webTitle":"Women's football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Louise Taylor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/louisetaylor"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aatp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/035f6fa906e080bf907c5bc1889ad9c82c396d10/0_172_3544_2126/3544.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2126,"width":3544,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Laura Bassett is comforted by team-mates after scoring her own goal.

He was promoted to captain in August 2014 and joined the ATR 72-600 fleet in November.</p> \n<p>He had a total of 4,914 flight hours at the time of the crash, including 3,151 in the ATR 72-500 and 250 hours in the ATR 72-600.</p> \n<p>However, the report showed that Liao failed the simulator check in May 2014 when he was being evaluated for promotion. Assessors found he had a tendency not to complete procedures and checks, and his “cockpit management and flight planning” were also found wanting.</p> \n<p>He passed after a second simulator check in June and was promoted to captain, although similar problems were detected during training in July last year.</p> \n<p>Instructors commented at the time that he was “prone to be nervous and may make oral errors during the engine start procedure”, and displayed a “lack of confidence”, the report shows.</p> \n<p>Issues cropped up again during training for the ATR 72-600 in November, when an instructor said Liao “may need extra training” when dealing with an engine failure after take-off.</p> \n<p>Since the crash, Taiwan’s Civil Aeronautics Administration has put all 55 of TransAsia’s ATR pilots through oral proficiency tests on how to handle an aircraft during engine failure.</p> \n<p>All but one of the pilots passed the tests, although some needed more than one attempt.

Recent incidents involving tacks scattered on roads and neck-high wire strung across cycle paths have taken the vilification of Lycra louts to a whole new level</p>","byline":"Peter Walker","body":"<p>On 14 June 2015, Alec James was taking part in the <a href=\"http://www.velothon-wales.co.uk/en/\">Velothon Wales</a>, a 90-mile mass bike ride on closed roads through countryside near Cardiff. The 28-year-old press officer, a keen cyclist, had invited along some London friends and was particularly proud to show them the region where he grew up.</p> \n<p>But his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AEWJ/status/610122967528415232\">day ended early.</a> “I was about 30 miles in, on a fast downhill stretch, and I saw one rider on my left go down,” James says. “I moved to avoid him and started to slow. Then my front tyre blew out and I went over. I rolled with the bike for a good few yards, bashed my head, breaking the helmet. I was doing about 30mph. I got deep lacerations on my leg. I couldn’t walk properly for a week.”</p> \n<p>After he struggled to his feet, James found a drawing pin in his front tyre, then saw a number of other tacks scattered on the road, at a point seemingly chosen to cause the most danger.</p> \n<p>A fortnight before this, police in Brighton <a href=\"http://www.sussex.police.uk/pressline/2015/05/29/danger-wires-warning-for-people-using-coldean-woods,-brighton\">had issued a warning</a> about wires strung between trees on a popular bike track through woodland, saying two such hazards had been spotted in as many days. A week earlier, in Dorset, <a href=\"http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/12955696.Cyclist_hurt_after_fishing_line_strung_across_path_at_Moors_Valley/\">a rider suffered cuts</a> after hitting 15 strands of fishing line stretched across a cycle path in a country park. On 23 June, mountain bikers in Cannock, Staffordshire <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Aebeebee/status/613462041391689728\">posted Twitter photos</a> of a neck-high wire between trees on a cycle trail.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f6b97f84a823fa1dbc35730a2070066120485805\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f6b97f84a823fa1dbc35730a2070066120485805/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"Alec James after his crash at the Velothon Wales..\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alec James after his crash at the Velothon Wales.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alec James</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the same week, several riders taking part in Redhill Cycling Club’s 70th anniversary road race, on back roads in the Surrey countryside, suffered punctures after <a href=\"https://twitter.com/redhillcc/status/612288507516710912\">drawing pins were scattered on the route</a>. No one was hurt, but that was mainly down to luck, says Adrian Webb, the club’s chairman: “You can guess how dangerous it can be if you have an 80-man peloton and someone punctures unexpectedly. These guys have got slick tyres pumped up very strongly for a race – there’s every chance a tyre can explode. If a rider comes off, there could a mass pile-up.”</p> \n<p>Such incidents remain rare, and any such physical threat to cyclists is tiny when compared with the danger from other motor vehicles, especially lorries. One of the many paradoxical elements about cycling in Britain is that it is both far safer than many people think – numerous studies have shown it is many times more likely to lengthen a lifespan through increased exercise than shorten it – but notably more perilous than it could be.</p> \n<p>Annual government road casualty figures for 2014, released last week, show the number of seriously injured riders rose 8.2% against the year before, a bigger increase than that in the number of cyclists. In London, in particular, the focus is on the danger posed by lorries, especially construction trucks. On 24 June, thousands of protesting cyclists brought the busy road junction at Bank to a halt after 26-year-old consultant Ying Tao was crushed by a tipper truck two days earlier. She was the eighth cyclist killed in the city in 2015, seven of whom died in incidents involving lorries, six of the victims women.</p> \n<p>Another paradox is that even as cities such as London and Bristol are, finally, building segregated bike lanes, proven to be the best way to prevent such deaths, the tone of the debate around cycling has arguably become more polarised and poisonous than ever. Some campaigners worry that the sabotage incidents are linked to a public and media narrative in which cyclists are demonised equally as both anarchic lawbreakers and smug, humourless killjoys, sausage thighs squeezed into unsightly DayGlo Lycra.</p> \n<p>The debate around cycling occasionally bears comparison with the treatment of so-called societal outgroups, according to <a href=\"http://www.bath.ac.uk/psychology/staff/ian-walker/\">Dr Ian Walker</a>, a psychologist at Bath University. <a href=\"http://opus.bath.ac.uk/9332/\">One of his experiments</a> to research attitudes towards cyclists involved riding around his home town wearing a long brunette wig with an electronic distance gauge attached to his bike, to see whether drivers gave female cyclists more overtaking space than men. They did, even when the “woman” was 6ft tall and, for the drivers who happened to look in their rearview mirror, surprisingly hairy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a73debb964f202d5480a72db202d15349c1064c\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/9a73debb964f202d5480a72db202d15349c1064c/0_110_5020_3011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cycling in traffic in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cycling in traffic in London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Images Group/Getty Images/Universal Images Group</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“What you see in discourses about cycling is the absolute classic 1960s and 1970s social psychology of prejudice,” he explains. “It’s exactly those things that used to be done about minority ethnic groups and so on – the overgeneralisation of negative traits, under-representation of negative behaviours by one’s own group, that kind of thing. It’s just textbook prejudiced behaviour.”</p> \n<p>This is played out in the media, on television and radio and, most virulently, via social media and website comments. Under a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3136411/Eighth-cyclist-killed-London-2015-Oxford-graduate-26.html\">Daily Mail story last week</a> about Ying’s death, the most-recommended reader comment until it was deleted read: “Why not ban cyclists? They don’t pay road tax.”</p> \n<p>This is a particularly pervasive point, and one that ignores the fact that “road tax” – a car-based fund set aside for highway construction – was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23694438\">scrapped in 1937</a>. Vehicle excise duty, its replacement, is based on emissions, meaning cyclists, if liable, would be zero-rated anyway.</p> \n<p>Other comments under the piece surmised that such deaths happen because of rampant cyclist lawbreaking, notably jumping red lights. Again, this doesn’t bear scrutiny. An <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/15/cycling-bike-accidents-study\">analysis of police statistics</a> found a failure to stop at a red light or stop sign was a factor in just 2% of serious adult cycling incidents; in contrast, drivers were deemed solely to blame about two-thirds of the time.</p> \n<p>Lawbreaking is one of the difficulties of the debate for cyclists. The average person on a bike is arguably no more likely to break a law then their peer in a car. However, when they do so it’s more obvious, less normalised. People notice a cyclist pedalling through a red light, whereas speeding – which 80% of drivers <a href=\"http://www.ctc.org.uk/blog/roger-geffen/rac-says-%E2%80%9Cdrivers-need-help%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-and-they%E2%80%99re-right\">admit to doing regularly</a> – is often ignored, despite the immeasurably greater human cost this causes.</p> \n<p>Chris Boardman, the Olympic track cycling champion who is now <a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/campaigning/article/cam20130530-campaigning-Chris-Boardman-MBE-0\">policy adviser to British Cycling</a>, recalls appearing on a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05vy4kk\">recent episode of BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours</a> to discuss whether cyclists should be obliged to take out insurance, a discussion prompted in part by an incident where a pavement-riding cyclist struck a young child. This premise lacked context, Boardman argues: “When you put it into perspective, there’s 36 people killed on pavements by cars, buses and lorries every year – that’s just on pavements – versus about one every three years from a cyclist. It’s ludicrous the programme was even on. Nobody seems to feel obliged to look at any facts.”</p> \n<p>Elsewhere over recent years, there has often not been any attempt at balance, even in generally sober parts of the media. Several years before anyone thought of stringing wire across Brighton woodland, Times columnist Matthew Parris <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/matthewparris/article2044185.ece\">half-jokingly advocated</a> a similar idea in a piece titled: “What’s smug and deserves to be decapitated?”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f37c7a712158bc37f0b7763d22085e408181059\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/2f37c7a712158bc37f0b7763d22085e408181059/0_0_1999_3000/666.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Boardman.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Boardman.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Marsland/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In November 2013, the Spectator ran as its <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9073071/off-your-bike/\">cover story</a> a long rant by Rod Liddle at cyclists, describing them as oversensitive lawbreakers who deliberately hold up traffic while wearing “pompous little pointy plastic hats”. Even the Observer had <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2013/apr/28/stop-pampering-scottish-cyclists\">an article</a> in April of the same year by a regular columnist, Kevin McKenna, calling cyclists a scourge, complete with jokes about middle-class bike-riding fops and their “cous cous packed lunches”.</p> \n<p>BBC Radio Kent, meanwhile, ran a phone-in show about road safety last week under the banner: “Should cyclists be banned in cities?”</p> \n<p>A recent twist on this narrative is the idea of a two-wheeled versus four-wheeled “war” on the roads, typically illustrated by dramatic cyclist helmet camera footage. “Many road rage incidents have been prompted by the ongoing war between motorists and cyclists,” boomed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvthismorning/status/611899986352177152\">a promotional tweet</a> last week from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvthismorning/status/611899986352177152\">ITV’s This Morning</a> programme. “Whose side are you on?”</p> \n<p>Boardman is scathing about such hyperbole, not least because cyclists and drivers are very often the same people – British Cycling data shows 90% of its members also own cars.</p> \n<p>“You’ve got 2% of vulnerable road users versus 98% in two tonnes of steel,” Boardman says. “How can you possibly have a war? I think that’s called a massacre. What could a cyclist possibly do to somebody in a car?”</p> \n<p>He is, however, wary of connecting this media narrative with the idea of an increase in attacks and sabotage against cyclists: “There’s about 250,000 assaults on the streets a year. If we’re going to accuse other people of taking things out of context, we need to not do that. There are always going to be idiots and people who are evil or just plain stupid.”</p> \n<p>Others profess to see the hint of a connection, at least locally. Mark Strong, a transport consultant and cycling advocate in Brighton, says the debate about bikes in his home city has been increasingly toxic ahead of the wire-trap incidents, partly inflamed by the recently ousted Green-led council’s introduction of new bike lanes and parking restrictions.</p> \n<p>“There is an element of legitimisation towards dislike of cyclists from the attitudes of the press and politicians,” he says. “It’s almost an official endorsement to be anti-cyclist. And for everyone who thinks it’s now OK to shout at a cyclist, at the tip of the bell curve there will be somebody who think it’s OK to stretch wires across bike paths.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/aldred-rachel\">Rachel Aldred</a>, a Westminster University sociologist who studies transport issues, argues that British cyclists suffer because, unlike in countries such as the Netherlands and Denmark, bikes are seen as frivolous, compared with the serious, adult business of driving. She says: “It’s as if you’re doing something you shouldn’t be doing on the roads, almost like you’re playing in the street and getting in the way of the traffic, like you’re a child. There’s also this dual way you can be stigmatised as a cyclist – it was historically seen as something for people with no choice, but now it’s seen as something for people who have a choice. It’s a leisure or play thing that they shouldn’t be doing in this inappropriate place.”</p> \n<p>Aldred has also studied the environment cyclists face on the road, and her findings are alarming. In <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/11/female-cyclists-bad-driving-harassment-study-uk-women-men-near-miss\">a pioneering paper </a>published this month she finds cyclists experience on average one “very scary” incident involving another road user every week. Female riders suffer disproportionately more, thought to be because drivers are less patient with their slower average speeds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be44892e32680443df8bf6e54bfaec6d5c4e8b8a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/be44892e32680443df8bf6e54bfaec6d5c4e8b8a/0_696_4862_2919/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman cycling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woman cycling.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Image Bank/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Do toxic anti-cyclist comments in newspapers or on social media contribute to this road environment? It’s impossible to prove. But some believe this is the case. “I’d be very surprised if that’s not happening,” says Walker. “It is acceptable to sit in a pub and say things like: ‘Bloody cyclists, we should run them off the road.’ Or to write things that are, literally, calling for murder. You can’t do that with other groups.”</p> \n<p>In 2013, <a href=\"http://opus.bath.ac.uk/37890/\">Walker led a study</a> that saw a co-researcher sent on to the roads on a bike in seven different outfits, with a gauge measuring the space drivers gave him overtaking. Four outfits made him look like a cyclist of varying experience, while three had bright yellow waistcoats with written messages. One read: “Novice cyclist: please pass slowly.” Another: “Polite: please slow down.” And finally: “Police: camera cyclist.”</p> \n<p>The data for 5,700 overtakes showed just one garb made an appreciable difference to driver behaviour: the one saying “police”. Here, the average passing distance was notably bigger, while the proportion of vehicles who passed very near the bike was significantly lower. In contrast, the tabard saying “polite” saw almost twice as many potentially dangerous passes.</p> \n<p>The lesson seems clear: drivers are perfectly able to distinguish between different types of rider, and to read the message. But rather than adjusting their driving to the cyclist’s apparent vulnerability, the only real trigger for them to take proper care is a possible legal sanction.</p> \n<p>Will things change? Bike campaigners hope London’s new network of segregated cycle “superhighways”, now being built, will increase the number of riders, and act as an example to other cities. Cycling as everyday transport, and cyclists whose progress is separated from that of motor vehicles, will, they hope, drain the poison from the debate.</p> \n<p>Such tangled considerations remain far from the mind of James, now back at work and again on the bike, though with a pedal-shaped chunk out of his thigh from his high-speed fall in South Wales: “It was the worst bike crash I’ve had by far, and all the more upsetting as it was nothing that I did. Perversely, I was quite lucky with the injuries I had. If this kind of sabotage continues, someone will get killed.”</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5befffe3bd8f3eb793c02c74178499b6524f450b/0_0_2582_1550/2582.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1550,"width":2582,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian imaging","altText":"Cyclist backlash","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian imaging"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f6b97f84a823fa1dbc35730a2070066120485805/0_0_2448_3264/2448.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3264,"width":2448,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Alec James after his crash at the Velothon Wales.

We have plenty to do in Iraq. Each member of the coalition is doing different things. Isil is organised and directed and administered from Syria. There is an illogicality about not being able to do it.”</p> \n<p>The prime minister is keen to explore whether the newly elected parliament would support an expansion of the bombing campaign as part of what he describes as his “full spectrum” response to Isis in light of the Tunisia gun attack. Cameron won parliament’s support last year for the air strikes against Isis targets in Iraq.</p> \n<p>But the prime minister stopped short of trying to win approval for expanding the air strikes to targets in Syria amid objections from the Labour party. Cameron was defeated in August 2013 when Ed Miliband effectively blocked military strikes against the regime of Bashar al-Assad after a chemical weapons attack near Damascus.</p> \n<p>Cameron, who is due to outline his response to the Isis threat abroad and to the extremist threat at home within weeks, wants to test the waters for a renewed parliamentary vote to permit air strikes on targets in Syria. </p> \n<p>In what is being described a “pitch-rolling” – the buzz-phrase for the process of preparing the ground for a change in strategy – the prime minister will see if it is realistic to return to the Commons for a vote in the autumn after the election of a new Labour leader. Cameron will be unable to act without the support of the Labour frontbench because Tory rebels would cut his parliamentary majority on any military action.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Fallon said: “It is a new parliament and MPs will want to think very carefully about how we best deal with Isil. [There is an] illogicality [with] Isil not respecting the border lines; they don’t differentiate between Syria and Iraq, they’re establishing this evil caliphate across both countries. There is no legal bar to us operating in Syria but we don’t have the parliamentary approval for it.</p> \n<p>“We don’t need it at the moment because we are playing our part in the campaign and what we do in Iraq actually frees up the US aircraft to attack in Syria. Isil has to be defeated in both countries. Its evil in Iraq is all being directed by its headquarters in Syria.”</p> \n<p>Fallon suggested that proof of a direct link between the Tunisian gun attack and Isil would intensify calls for striking targets in Syria. He said: “If we can link it back, [if] it does link directly back to Isil in Syria then we will have to reflect with the rest of the coalition how best we deal with that.”</p> \n<p>The prime minister’s spokeswoman said: “The prime minister has been clear on the need for us to be crushing Isil in both Iraq and Syria in the sense of the role we are playing alongside others. </p> \n<p>“Clearly Isil is seeking to find areas from which it can operate, from which it can seek to threaten people here in Britain. As part of what the PM was talking about, in terms of having a full-spectrum response, that means not just focusing on one area where they are but looking at a whole range of areas and how Isil are operating.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/abe26d9f5d563a3d3b93d5dda2374790903d67eb/0_0_3500_2099/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2099,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Rob Stothard/Getty Images","altText":"Michael Fallon","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Rob Stothard/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T07:21:48Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T07:21:50Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1286,"contributors":[{"name":"Nicholas Watt","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nicholaswatt"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Islamic State","Michael Fallon","David Cameron","UK news","Politics","World news","Syria","Iraq","Middle East and North Africa"],"tags":[{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State"},{"id":"politics/michael-fallon","webTitle":"Michael Fallon"},{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria"},{"id":"world/iraq","webTitle":"Iraq"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Nicholas Watt","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/nicholaswatt"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/01/uk-strategy-of-not-attacking-isis-in-syria-is-illogical-says-defence-secretary","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aadp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/01/uk-strategy-of-not-attacking-isis-in-syria-is-illogical-says-defence-secretary","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/01/uk-strategy-of-not-attacking-isis-in-syria-is-illogical-says-defence-secretary"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/abe26d9f5d563a3d3b93d5dda2374790903d67eb/0_0_3500_2099/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2099,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Michael Fallon said ‘MPs will want to think very carefully about how we best deal with’ Islamic State.

The Council of Europe said one week’s notice fell short of international standards and the wording was unclear, while Greece’s highest court has been asked to cancel the plebiscite on constitutional grounds. A judgement will not be made until Friday. </p> \n<p>Syriza’s allies in the German parliament – die Linke, or the Left – accused the chancellor, Angela Merkel, of seeking to topple the Greek prime minister. It is an open secret in Berlin that Merkel, and especially her hawkish finance minister, Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, would be happy to see Tsipras fall as a consequence of Sunday’s vote. At the very least, German government sources say privately, Berlin wants Greece’s flamboyant finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, replaced.</p> \n<p>The rising tension over the Greek debacle surfaced at the very top of the EU on Wednesday when Sch&auml;uble rejected the latest Tsipras letter to his creditors accepting most of the austerity terms that last Saturday he had described as “humiliation” and “extortion”, while arguing for much more generous rescue funding over two years and including debt relief.</p> \n<p>Sch&auml;uble said the Tsipras overture just muddied the waters further, while Merkel flatly ruled out any more negotiations this week after the Greeks have voted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnOXkGF4dr0\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JnOXkGF4dr0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Merkel says negotiations on a bailout are not possible before the referendum\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“There can be no negotiations on a new aid programme until after the referendum,” said Merkel.</p> \n<p>The French president, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, however, urged a quick fix. “The agreement must come immediately,” he said. “It’s been a while that we’ve been talking about this agreement. It must happen now.”</p> \n<p>Tsipras’s erratic tactics in veering from rejectionism to conciliation and back within hours only added to the exasperation in eurozone circles. </p> \n<p>Sch&auml;uble made plain that he had given up listening to the confusing signals from the Greek government, suggesting it will be very difficult for the two key parties, Athens and Berlin, to move quickly towards defusing a situation losing control. Time is very tight. As well as defaulting on €1.5bn of loans to the IMF on Tuesday, Greece has to redeem European Central Bank bonds worth €3.5bn on 20 July.</p> \n<p> “Greece is in a difficult situation, but purely because of the behaviour of the Greek government ... Seeking the blame outside Greece might be helpful in Greece, but it has nothing to do with reality,” said Sch&auml;uble. “The Greek government is not doing its people any favours at all if it keeps making completely false statements. Nobody else is to blame for their situation ... It’s all very sad. We’re in a much harder situation than before. It was always difficult. But it has just kept getting more and more difficult since January.” Tsipras assumed office in January.</p> \n<p>Tsipras was also criticised by Germany’s vice-chancellor in the Merkel coalition, Sigmar Gabriel. He accused the leftwing Syriza government of allowing the wealthy and the oligarchs to suck the country dry and take “billions” out of the country.</p> \n<p> “Who’s liable for this money? Workers in Germany, among others.” He said Europe was doing nothing but throw money at “this corrupt state”.</p> \n<p> Valdis Dombrovskis of Latvia, the EU commissioner for the euro, also said it might be possible to strike a deal before the ECB payment deadline on 20 July, only for Sch&auml;uble to signal that may not be possible.</p> \n<p> In the last 24 hours Tsipras has pirouetted on his tactics to demand debt relief plus a new two-year €29bn baillout from the eurozone’s permanent bailout fund, known as the ESM.</p> \n<p> However, this could only be negotiated quickly with maximum goodwill on both sides. The Germans will drive a hard bargain and Merkel may balk at having to take a third Greek bailout to the Bundestag where she could face a revolt.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> Merkel and Sch&auml;uble strongly emphasised that there was no risk to the rest of the currency bloc from the Greek meltdown.</p> \n<p> “Europe is strong,” said Merkel. “Much stronger than five years ago at the start of Europe’s debt crisis which originated in Greece.”</p> \n<p> The German finance ministry website on Wednesday issued an FAQs list on Greece blaming the Tsipras government for the breakdown while reassuring Germans about the low likelihood of spillover effects.</p> \n<p> “The impact is limited. The eurozone itself is stable and safe. Contagion risks as in 2012 no longer exist.”</p> \n<p> “The fact is,” said Sch&auml;uble, “that this [Tsipras] government has done nothing to build up a competent administration and it’s been in office for six months.”</p> \n<p> Merkel added: “Europe’s future is not at stake. It would be at stake if we forgot who we are and what makes us strong. We are stronger because of the reform policies of recent years, mainly due to Germany’s position.”</p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/26093afff9254fdfcd1607c5124ef445245f7e8e/0_3_3676_2207/3676.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2207,"width":3676,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters","altText":"The German chancellor, Angela Merkel","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-01T18:39:32Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T06:58:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":4400,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian Traynor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/iantraynor"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Eurozone crisis","Syriza","Alexis Tsipras","World news","Angela Merkel","Banking","Germany","Business","Economics","Euro","Currencies","Europe","European Central Bank","European Union","European banks","European monetary union","Greece"],"tags":[{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis"},{"id":"world/syriza","webTitle":"Syriza"},{"id":"world/alexis-tsipras","webTitle":"Alexis Tsipras"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/angela-merkel","webTitle":"Angela Merkel"},{"id":"business/banking","webTitle":"Banking"},{"id":"world/germany","webTitle":"Germany"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"business/euro","webTitle":"Euro"},{"id":"business/currencies","webTitle":"Currencies"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"business/european-central-bank","webTitle":"European Central Bank"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"business/europeanbanks","webTitle":"European banks"},{"id":"business/emu","webTitle":"European monetary union"},{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"}],"section":{"id":"business"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ian Traynor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/iantraynor"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"business"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/01/greece-crisis-berlin-blasts-tsipras-scapegoats-germany","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aadg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/business/2015/jul/01/greece-crisis-berlin-blasts-tsipras-scapegoats-germany","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/01/greece-crisis-berlin-blasts-tsipras-scapegoats-germany"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/26093afff9254fdfcd1607c5124ef445245f7e8e/0_3_3676_2207/3676.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2207,"width":3676,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, leaves after talks on the Greek debt crisis in Berlin.
