Meanwhile, the economically independent partner is more likely to remain faithful – up to a certain point. </p> \n<p>“We don’t really like inequity, and there’s probably something about masculinity that means men really don’t like it,” said Christin Munsch, a University of Connecticut professor and author of the study, which was published in the American Sociological Review.</p> \n<p>Munsch has examined this dynamic for more than six years, inspired by discussions about cheating with her friends – specifically, one unemployed young man who cheated on his partner, saying that he had felt emasculated because she made more money. </p> \n<p>The study pooled data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, between 2001 to 2011. The results are based on 2,757 individuals, and is limited to heterosexual couples between the ages of 18 to 32 who were in the same relationship for more than a year.</p> \n<p>The analysis shows that as the amount of money men make relative to their wives increases, it becomes less likely that they will cheat. But that only holds true until their share of the total income reaches 70% – after that, they are more likely to cheat again.</p> \n<p>Women, however, are least likely to cheat when they earn 100% of a couple’s total income. </p> \n<p>Munsch said that these differences indicate that gender scripts still have considerable influence on how people understand marriage, which slows societal progression towards egalitarian marriages. </p> \n<p>For a separate project, Munsch has been interviewing young men at a university that has more female than male students. She is surprised by how most of these men expect to be the breadwinners in the family, despite more women attending college – and performing better than male students – than ever before. </p> \n<p>“It’s 2015 and they’re looking around at their very successful women peers and they still feel this need to live up to that expectation,” said Munsch. “It speaks to how strong of a social norm that is, particularly in older generations, and I think that’s what’s going on with men who are economically dependent.”</p> \n<p>Now that same-sex couples in the US have gained significantly more marriage rights in the time since the survey was conducted, Munsch is curious to know how the data compares for those couples. She thinks this could be beneficial to understanding how spouses can adopt expectations of themselves and their partners that are not based on gender. </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/31/1391178581369/ce99d247-6d5e-48a1-a8b3-63927eaa9cda-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Mode Images Limited / Alamy/Alamy","altText":"AT35EY A Wedding Cake, bride and groom standing back to back wedding cake bride groom problem marriage concept wedding cake couple bride groom man woman wife husband problem relationship breakdown break-up break broken argue argument unhappy crack affair divorce over finished angry upset communication icing hate love","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Mode Images Limited / Alamy/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-01T04:00:09Z","lastModified":"2015-06-01T04:15:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":194,"contributors":[{"name":"Amanda Holpuch","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/25/1411659899648/Amanda-Holpuch-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/amanda-holpuch"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Marriage","US income inequality","Gender","Money","US news","Family"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/marriage","webTitle":"Marriage"},{"id":"us-news/us-income-inequality","webTitle":"US income inequality"},{"id":"world/gender","webTitle":"Gender"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Amanda Holpuch","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/amanda-holpuch"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/01/extramarital-affair-couples-breadwinner","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49bgb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/01/extramarital-affair-couples-breadwinner","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/01/extramarital-affair-couples-breadwinner"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/31/1391178581369/ce99d247-6d5e-48a1-a8b3-63927eaa9cda-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The economically independent partner is more likely to remain faithful – up to a certain point.

The USA Freedom Act, once passed, will be the first rollback of NSA surveillance since the seminal 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.</p> \n<p>But until then, in addition to the expiration of the NSA’s phone records collection, the FBI is prevented from using powers granted under the Patriot Act, including the pursuit of so-called “business records” relating to internet use, hotel and rental car records and credit card statements.</p> \n<p>Both developments represent a remarkable capitulation for the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who had initially sought to simply extend the Patriot Act provisions, despite overwhelming support in the House of Representatives for the USA Freedom Act.</p> \n<p>McConnell and his colleagues who opposed reform were thwarted in their efforts by a growing backlash by Senate Republicans and, in particular, his Kentucky colleague, Senator Rand Paul.</p> \n<p>“This is the only realistic way forward,” acknowledged the Republican leader during a rare Sunday evening session just hours before the Patriot Act was set to expire. Shortly after, the Senate voted 77 to 17 to proceed to debate on the USA Freedom Act – a procedural hurdle that fell three votes short during another special session focused on surveillance reform nine days earlier.</p> \n<p>The development was welcomed by the White House, which has also come to support the USA Freedom Act after Barack Obama proposed that the NSA could seek specific records directly from telephone companies instead.</p> \n<p>“The Senate took an important – if late – step forward tonight,” White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said. “We call on the Senate to ensure this irresponsible lapse in authorities is as short-lived as possible.”</p> \n<p>Even Paul, after the procedural vote, conceded that the bill will now ultimately pass, although he appeared determined to drag it out as a long as possible. “Tonight begins the process of ending bulk collection,” he said. </p> \n<p>Paul, who is running for president on a libertarian-leaning agenda, believes the USA Freedom Act does not go far enough in tackling the surveillance abuses revealed by Snowden.</p> \n<p>“I am not going to take it any more and I believe the American people are not going to take it any more,” Paul said as he took the Senate floor for another of the extended speeches that have helped propel him into the public spotlight at a key moment in the Republican race for the presidency.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f61466f517372cf6d79be7d45e525179ccef8cdf\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f61466f517372cf6d79be7d45e525179ccef8cdf/21_1323_3725_2235/1000.jpg\" alt=\"mcconnell nsa\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senator Mitch McConnell said voting on the House-backed USA Freedom Act was ‘certainly not ideal’ but was ‘now the only realistic way forward’ on a surveillance impasse.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>McConnell attempted to seek a temporary extension for additional Patriot Act powers to be affected by the expiration of powers unrelated to the NSA’s bulk domestic phone metadata program – including so-called “lone-wolf” and “roving wiretap” capabilities.</p> \n<p>But even a temporary continuation of those surveillance authorities were opposed by Paul, who has the power to block such attempts to speed up Senate business by seeking unanimous consent.</p> \n<p>Paul’s tactics provoked angry reactions from establishment Republicans, including a heated exchange with John McCain, who <a href=\"http://audio.cbsradionewsfeed.com/2015/05/31/18/Hourly-18.mp3\">accused him of endangering national security</a> to boost his presidential campaign. McCain said on Sunday that Paul “obviously has a higher priority on his fundraising and political ambitions than securing the nation”.</p> \n<p>Paul, gesturing toward the acrimony that persists in the Senate even after the vote made passage of the USA Freedom Act a foregone conclusion, said his Republican opponents were rooting for a terrorist attack to embarrass him.</p> \n<p>“Some of them I think secretly want an attack on the United States so they can blame it on me,” Paul said.</p> \n<p>Obama and his intelligence chief, James Clapper, also made a final push on Friday for the Senate to pass the USA Freedom Act, alleging the expiration of the Patriot Act provisions would <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/may/29/rand-paul-surveillance-filibuster-nsa-reform\">expose the US to terrorism</a>.</p> \n<p>But a Justice Department inspector general report found the FBI had come to use the business-records provision to amass <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/may/21/fbi-patriot-act-doj-report\">“large collections”</a> of Americans’ communications data. It noted that the spread of internet access had lead to an explosion in information accessible to the FBI, and cast doubt on Justice Department and congressional assurances that the authority, known as Section 215, is critical for counterterrorism.</p> \n<p>“[T]he agents we interviewed did not identify any major case developments that resulted from use of the records obtained in response to Section 215 orders, but told us that the material produced pursuant to Section 215 orders was valuable in that it was used to support other investigative requests, develop investigative leads, and corroborate other information,” the DoJ report found.</p> \n<p>Originally mindful of the privacy implications of Section 215, Congress permitted it to “sunset” after five years. Yet with nearly all aspects of its practical applications hidden under extensive secrecy – especially the post-2006 addition of NSA bulk surveillance – reauthorization of the Patriot Act provisions had become routine.</p> \n<p>The last time the legislation was considered, in 2011, it passed 72-23 in the Senate and 250-153 in the House.</p> \n<p>But this time, Snowden’s revelations pierced the veneer of government secrecy and ushered in perhaps the most open debate about surveillance powers in the NSA’s 63-year history.</p> \n<p>“No doubt it played a role,” Republican senator Dean Heller told the Guardian. “I think it played the same role for me as it did for most of the American people, who were surprised and stunned that the government had this sort of access to this kind of data.”</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/11f6bd1c64f93af84f7d4a8ac8bb42a8957c9837/1326_233_1043_626/1043.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":626,"width":1043,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Pete Marovich/EPA","altText":"rand paul nsa","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Pete Marovich/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f61466f517372cf6d79be7d45e525179ccef8cdf/21_1323_3725_2235/3725.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2235,"width":3725,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Senator Mitch McConnell said voting on the House-backed USA Freedom Act was ‘certainly not ideal’ but was ‘now the only realistic way forward’ on a surveillance impasse.

The revelation that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DICmivy5uP8\">the YouTube documentary</a> about the Pyongyang traffic lady is fake is buried in the comments page; Kim Jong-un’s pop-singer girlfriend’s <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/north-korean-ex-lover-kim-jong-appears-not-executed-article-1.1796085\">appearance on KCNA</a> a year after reports of her grisly murder failed to reach the same million consumers who believed her dead; North Korean gulag survivor Shin Dong-hyuk’s <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/prominent-n-korean-defector-shin-dong-hyuk-admits-parts-of-story-are-inaccurate/2015/01/17/fc69278c-9dd5-11e4-bcfb-059ec7a93ddc_story.html\">recent admission</a> that parts of his bestselling memoir are false did little to dampen belief in its credibility; and in May, Seoul’s Daily NK ran a discreet post contradicting CNN’s widely publicised story about Kim Jong-un’s poisoned aunt, stating Kyong-hui is alive in Pyongyang.<br /></p> \n<p>The truth about North Korea is also a casualty when politics come into play. On 30 December 2014, when independent cyber analysts announced that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/dec/30/sony-hack-researchers-claim-sacked-employees-could-be-to-blame\">disgruntled employees, not Kim Jong-un</a>, were behind the Sony hack, the FBI had already found North Korea guilty. Senator John McCain labeled the hack an “act of war”; Sony released<em> </em>The Interview<em> </em>with President Obama’s blessing<em>; </em>North Korea’s limited internet capabilities were mysteriously “blacked out” in an unattributed strike; and, by 2 January 2015, the US had imposed new sanctions on North Korea and was considering reinstating it as a “state sponsor of terrorism”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63e6406dd772691b307164e8737ef62493251e40\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/63e6406dd772691b307164e8737ef62493251e40/0_0_1202_721/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dead or alive: Kim Jong-un holding a baby with defence minister Hyon Yong-chol circled in the background, who has been reported executed. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dead or alive: Kim Jong-un holding a baby with defence minister Hyon Yong-chol circled in the background, who has been reported executed. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YONHAP/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Why does all this matter?

Women can wear pants. It is safe to be a tourist, if you don’t hand out bibles. It is forbidden to film portraits of the Kims soft-focus or cropped. People like to dance in public, not just when told to by the state. The country is poor, but not everyone is starving or in chains: an estimated 100,000 North Koreans are imprisoned, with a further 8.3m lacking adequate food and shelter. The remaining 16.6m rely on a growing black market economy and lead “normal” enough lives to go to the movies.</p> \n<p>Vice’s popular claim that North Korea <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/video/north-korean-film-madness-1\">no longer makes films</a> is false: Pyongyang’s five studios produce 20 to 30 rom-coms, thrillers, dramas, animations and documentaries a year. The film stars, directors and writers I met had never heard of Stanley Kubrick, but loved Bend it Like Beckham, The Sound of Music and Avatar<em>.</em> Like their southern cousins, they were resilient, warm and loved telling jokes, mostly about the Russians and Chinese. Resentment towards Kim Jong-un was evident but concealed: criticising him can lead to the gulags. </p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9780670077830/director-commander\">My book</a> about my experience featured Kim Jong-il on the cover – until my Pyongyang contact told me to remove him if I wanted my North Korean friends to survive. The Kims are considered too holy to physically depict on screen. A North Korean actor once had plastic surgery to portray founding founder Kim Il-sung in the drama, Star of Korea, then was permanently reassigned to a behind-the-scenes production role<em>. </em>Reports now assert the actor was sent to the gulags.

Another option is a <a href=\"http://www.algarvesup.com/stand-up-paddle-tours/\">paddleboard adventure</a> through them, a great way to navigate the tranquil environment at a slower pace.</p> \n<h2>Ca&ntilde;o Cristales, Serran&iacute;a de la Macarena, Colombia</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"99340d2f4005d3a153bb013e3ce86462cfbf6566\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432899912117/b9b7e051-38c0-478c-89a0-db408a7ef654-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Colors at Cano Cristales, Colombia Underwater plants\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Till/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It only takes one look at the Ca&ntilde;o Cristales to see how it earned its name – the liquid rainbow. For a few weeks every year, between September and November, the conditions cause the river to explode in colour, when the sunlight triggers a plant that lines the riverbed – the the Macarenia clavigera – to turn bright red. The streaks of crimson mix with dashes of yellow, brown shades of sand and water that shimmers in blue and green, creating a technicolour mix unlike any other. The river is near La Macarena in Meta province, deep in the Colombian grasslands. Once an area associated with cocaine production, it has only recently become a safe tourist destination, and several companies offer <a href=\"http://www.thecolombianway.com/en/our-trips/package/cano-cristales\">tours from Bogot&aacute;</a>.</p> \n<h2>Waitomo Glowworm Caves, North Island, New Zealand</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee799afecee364707293fae0dbe32e49fdbcaf6c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432899273118/26d31b53-ded0-4916-899c-a1c4dfd08f0e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"New Zealand North island Waikato region the Waitomo Glowworm Caves bristling with stalactites and stalagmites\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lining the ceiling like fluorescent space stickers found in a kid’s bedroom, the glowworms of Waitomo’s caves were discovered over 120 years ago and create a magical spectacle. In 1887, local Maori chief Tane Tinorau and British surveyor Fred Mace floated into the cave on a raft, and eventually found an accessible land entry point, which is still used by visitors today. The cave has been a tourist attraction since 1889, when Tinorau and his wife would give guided tours for a small fee. Even today their descendants work as staff at the caves. A walk through the limestone caverns concludes with a bug-illuminated boat ride.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Admission adult &pound;23, child &pound;10, family &pound;56, open daily 9am-5.30pm (5pm season), </em><a href=\"http://www.waitomo.com/Waitomo-Glowworm-Caves/Pages/default.aspx\"><em>waitomo.com</em></a></p> \n<h2>Jellyfish Lake, Palau, south Pacific</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d90ce7b36ee2375741a807e4a586f906dd5e15f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432899311452/59309d10-ff11-412f-b258-e01b02e23a57-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jellyfish Lake\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If they were poisonous, this lake would be a lot less fun. Fortunately, the two species of jellyfish in this unusual environment are harmless to humans (technically they do have sting cells, but it’s unlikely you’d notice them). The marine lake is the only one open to tourists in Palau and is on Eil Malk, part of the wild Rock Islands. Millions of jellyfish drift from one end of the lake to the other each day to feed. The lake is reached by a 45-minute boat ride from Koror; the creatures float in the water like luminous lanterns and are best viewed by snorkelling among them.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://www.visit-palau.com/\"><em>visit-palau.com</em></a></p> \n<h2>Ik-Kil cenote, Yucat&aacute;n, Mexico</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4510a01f2d368bd59b1fe2dbcab96e7e9f98f036\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432899385440/fd732a25-c924-4372-a0f2-a9b7515bcd5d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cenote Ik-Kil, Ik Kil, Merida, Yucatan, Mexico,\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cenote comes from a Mayan word meaning “well” and is used to describe naturally formed pits or sinkholes, usually caused after the collapse of a cave. The Ik Kil cenote is a magnificent one – considered to be sacred and found en route to the ancient city of Chichen Itza. A 26m-high circular rock shaft surrounds a turquoise pool of water, with jungle vines draped over the edge. About 40m deep, the pool is perfect for diving, and ledges have been carved into the limestone rock for this purpose.

Every day, at a narrow strait near the town of Bod&oslash;, the strongest tidal current in the world gathers its strength, creating a frothing mess of choppy white water full of whirlpools up to 10m in diameter. Caused by 400m cubic metres of water rushing through the 150m-wide sound when the tide changes, the Saltstraumen is a pretty dangerous water feature. Powerful RIB boats take visitors through the sound, and when they cut the engine it feels as if the boat is being pulled down by the whirlpools.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em><a

The club has said it is “deeply concerned” and has launched an investigation after calls for the trio to be sacked.</p> \n<p>The footage, obtained by the Sunday Mirror, allegedly shows the 22-year-old defender James Pearson, the son of the club’s manager, Nigel, the striker Tom Hopper, 21, and the goalkeeper Adam Smith, 22, naked in a Thai hotel room as women are filmed engaged in sex acts. In a clip of the video posted on the newspaper’s website, one of the men appears to be heard calling one of the women a “slit eye” in a racist slur.</p> \n<p>Later one calls one of the women “minging – an absolute one out of 10” as his friends laugh. Other offensive comments are made to the women as the players appear to laugh and egg each other on. It is alleged the trio shared the explicit video with friends back in the UK.</p> \n<p>In a statement the club said the players “would like to convey their sincere apologies for their behaviour – to the women involved in the incident, to the club and its owners, to the club’s fans and to their families”.</p> \n<p>Earlier Leicester City had released a statement saying: “We take the conduct of our players at every level extremely seriously and will take appropriate action, if necessary, once the full facts of the situation have been established. Pending the outcome of an internal investigation the club will make no further comment.”</p> \n<p>The club, currently touring Thailand celebrating their successful battle against relegation from the Premier League, is owned by the Thai billionaires Vichai and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha and has been in “strategic, international partnership” with the Tourism Authority of Thailand for three years. The tourism authority’s Amazing Thailand branding is on the back of team shirts.</p> \n<p>Commenting on the partnership last year, Susan Whelan, Leicester City’s chief executive, said: “We’re absolutely thrilled to continue to work with the Tourism Authority of Thailand during the 2014-15 season. Their support in the last two years has been vital in helping us promote Leicester City to a Thai audience and in reaching our goals closer to home.”</p> \n<p>Thawatchai Arunyik, governor of Tourism Authority of Thailand, said: “We are very proud to be working with Leicester City and its supporters, who have embraced the club’s increasingly strong association with Thailand and given the nation a Premier League football club its people can take to their hearts.”</p> \n<p>On Sunday fans told of their disgust on the fans forum FoxesTalk, where one posted: “Get rid of them, never getting near our squad anyway.”</p> \n<p>Another wrote: “Disgusting and inexcusable behaviour, exactly the sort of stuff that gives British tourists a bad name when we go abroad. It’s especially disappointing given the efforts the owners are going to to ensure we’re a popular club in Thailand.”</p> \n<p>A Kick It Out spokesman said: “We are aware of the allegations and have contacted Leicester City Football Club. We will await their response before commenting further.”</p> \n<p>Nigel Pearson has campaigned against racism and is a patron of the charity Show&nbsp;Racism the Red Card. A number of Thai people told of their outrage in comments posted on the Leicester City Facebook page.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/31/1433077912651/Leicester-Citys-King-Powe-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Leicester City's King Power Stadium is named after the company owned by their Thai owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha.
