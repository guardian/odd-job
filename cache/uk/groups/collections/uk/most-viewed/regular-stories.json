The incident on Wednesday involved the Octonauts Rollercoaster Adventure inside a zone of the park built around the CBeebies brand of television programming for young children.</p> \n<p>The evacuation, during which harnesses were used to clip passengers to a railing as they descended steps, was carried out after a fault caused the ride to halt and someone who was on board became agitated.</p> \n<p>The park said in a statement: “On 10 June, an incident occurred when, for unknown reasons, a guest became agitated on the Octonauts Rollercoaster Adventure. In line with standard procedures, this led to the ride being evacuated. Alton Towers resort staff followed all normal processes to ensure guests were taken off the ride quickly and safely.”<br /></p> \n<p>It is understood from sources close to the park that standard procedure would allow for the ride to be reset in circumstances where it had come to a halt. However, the decision to evacuate was taken after a passenger became agitated.</p> \n<p>A visitor to the park who contacted the Guardian after witnessing part of Wednesday’s incident said he sensed that something was wrong when he heard children shouting. “I glanced over and noticed a guy with safety harnesses on,” he said. “I was on another ride at that point. When I got off, they were taking people off the Octonauts ride. At that point, Alton Towers operatives with helmets and harnesses on were involved. There was a lady next to me whose son was really distressed and she was shouting up to him to stay calm and that everything would be all right.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>“My wife and I just decided to leave the park at that point with our children. They did absolutely nothing to stop the children and parents going into that part of the park to witness what was going on. On the way out, we went into the guest services bit of the park, where I asked if it was possible to speak to somebody about the incident. I was told they could do a customer feedback questionnaire. I said: ‘Are you being serious?’”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457118926__\n</div> \n<p>A teenage girl whose left leg was amputated after last week’s rollercoaster crash was kept alive on a machine in intensive care when she was first brought to hospital, her brother said on Wednesday.

Though he is little known in the west, Maqdisi’s importance in the canon of radical Islamic thought is unrivalled by anyone alive. The 56-year-old Palestinian rose to prominence in the 1980s, when he became the first significant radical Islamic scholar to declare the Saudi royal family were apostates, and therefore legitimate targets of jihad. At the time, Maqdisi’s writings were so radical that even Osama bin Laden thought they were too extreme.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/10/isis-onslaught-has-broken-al-qaida-its-spiritual-leaders-admit\">Isis onslaught has broken al-Qaida, its spiritual leaders admit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Today, Maqdisi counts the leader of al‑Qaida, Ayman al-Zawahiri, as a personal friend, and he is held in the highest esteem by the rest of al-Qaida’s regional heads, from North Africa to Yemen. His numerous books and pamphlets are required reading for Islamic militants around the world, who eagerly follow the latest proclamations on Maqdisi’s website, the Pulpit of Monotheism and Jihad. But he may be best known for personally mentoring <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/2006/jun/09/guardianobituaries.alqaida\">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a>, who founded the organisation that would later become <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/isis\">Isis</a>, while the two men were jailed together on terrorism charges in Jordan in the mid-1990s. Zarqawi was released in 1999 and, after swearing allegiance to al-Qaida, went on to become one of the most notorious figures in postwar Iraq, unleashing a brutal campaign of sectarian terror, which led Maqdisi to publicly upbraid his most famous student in a series of devastating public critiques.</p> \n<p>Now the man US terrorism analysts call “the most influential living jihadi theorist” has turned his ire toward Isis – and emerged, in the last year, as one of the group’s most powerful critics. Soon after the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/middle-east-live/2014/jun/30/isis-declares-caliphate-in-iraq-and-syria-live-updates\">declared the establishment of a caliphate</a> last June, Maqdisi released a long tract castigating Isis as ignorant and misguided, accusing them of subverting the “Islamic project” that he has long nurtured.</p> \n<p>Maqdisi’s war of words with Isis is emblematic of the new fratricidal split within violent Islamic radicalism – but it is also a sign that al-Qaida, once the world’s most feared terrorist network, knows it has been surpassed.</p> \n<p>Isis has not simply eclipsed al-Qaida on the battlefields of Syria and Iraq, and in the competition for funding and new recruits. According to a series of exclusive interviews with senior jihadi ideologues, Isis has successfully launched “a coup” against al-Qaida to destroy it from within. As a consequence, they now admit, al-Qaida – as an idea and an organisation – is now on the verge of collapse.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>On a sunny spring afternoon, </strong>three weeks after his release from prison, Maqdisi sat on a sofa at his friend <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/abu-qatada\">Abu Qatada</a>’s house, fuming about Isis: the group had lied to him and betrayed him, he said, and its members were not worthy of calling themselves mujahideen. “They are like a mafia group,” Abu Qatada added, while Maqdisi nodded his assent.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-451845729__\n</div> \n<p>Abu Qatada – who successive British home secretaries tried to deport to Jordan on terror-related charges – has joined Maqdisi as one of the most prominent radical clerics to publicly attack Isis, and his statements of condemnation have been even more scathing. Initially, their strategy seemed to be to bring Isis back under the authority of al-Qaida, using something like a good cop, bad cop approach: Maqdisi played the role of the disappointed father, admonishing and giving guidance in equal measure, while Abu Qatada has poured increasing amounts of scorn on them.</p> \n<p>The list of Isis’s crimes that have offended Maqdisi and Abu Qatada is long. They include creating division within the wider jihadi movement, publicly snubbing Zawahiri and establishing a caliphate to which Isis demands every other jihadi swear fealty or face death. For more than a year both say they have worked behind the scenes, negotiating with Isis – including with Baghdadi himself – to bring the group back into the al-Qaida fold, to no avail. “Isis don’t respect anyone. They are ruining the wider jihadi movement and are against the whole <em>ummah</em> [Muslim nation],” Abu Qatada said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Isis are ruining the wider jihadi movement and are against the whole ummah</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Abu Qatada</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Isis has been sufficiently worried by the increasingly vehement criticism from Maqdisi and Abu Qatada to embark on a social media campaign against them – said to have been sanctioned by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/sep/23/islamic-state-followers-urged-to-launch-attacks-against-australians\">Abu Muhammad al-Adnani</a>, Isis’s chief propagandist. Isis social media accounts berate the two al-Qaida clerics as “stooges” of the west, part of a growing conspiracy against the caliphate. The sixth issue of Isis’s English-language magazine, Dabiq, featured a full-page picture of Maqdisi and Abu Qatada, labelled as “misleading scholars” who should be avoided more than the devil himself. “Qatada and I have been critical of them,” Maqdisi said. “They hate that.”</p> \n<p>The two ideologues make an odd pair in the fight against Isis. Qatada is 6ft 3in tall, broad shouldered and lumbering, while Maqdisi is rake thin and full of hyperactive energy, bounding round the room and speaking at double speed; at serious moments, Maqdisi is given to making a sudden joke or bursting into giggles. Sometimes they will go for walks with each other in the Jordanian countryside. More often they travel long distances by road after being asked to attend funerals of fallen al-Qaida fighters.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"663209251d0a90b051e5a1422d9a150216aac5c1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433954982833/1b7d66ce-79f0-4547-b570-f68f1f82bd4e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Abu &shy;Muhammed al-Maqdisi, the intellectual godfather of al-Qaida\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abu &shy;Muhammad al-Maqdisi, the intellectual godfather of al-Qaida.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mustafa Khalili</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Maqdisi’s notoriety has ensured that he has spent most of the past two decades in and out of jail. (He claims to have been subject to torture – which is indeed widespread in Jordanian prisons; pulling the hairs out of a radical’s beard, he said, is one favoured method of inflicting pain.) It is widely believed that the Jordanians released him again this February because they realised, with Isis rampaging across the region, that his stature made him a valuable ally in the struggle against the militant group.</p> \n<p>But Maqdisi and Qatada have looked on as Isis’s young radicals rampage from victory to victory – cursing, mocking and betraying the old guard as they go, while al-Qaida, largely guided by veterans of the Afghan era, has been brought to its knees in this jihadi civil war.</p> \n<p>As Qatada poured tea into small glass tumblers, he began reeling off images to better communicate the depth of his loathing for Isis. He likes speaking in metaphors. The group, he said, was “like a bad smell” that has polluted the radical Islamic environment. No, they were better described as a “cancerous growth” within the jihadi movement – or, he continued, like the diseased branch of a fig tree that needs to be pruned before it kills the entire organism.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/2014/dec/18/-sp-the-race-to-save-peter-kassig\">The race to save Peter Kassig | Ali Younes, Shiv Malik, Spencer Ackerman and Mustafa Khalili</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Qatada, who was once described by the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2009/feb/19/abu-qatada-compensation-european-court\">British Special Immigration Appeals Commission</a> as a “truly dangerous individual … at the centre of terrorist activities associated with al‑Qaida”, has a strained, high-pitched voice, like an alto<strong> </strong>version of Marlon Brando in The Godfather; he speaks slowly, pausing for effect. His broad frame easily filled one of the throne-like Louis-XIV-style armchairs that line his reception room. Comfortably ensconced, he turned to yet another metaphor to describe how Isis has recruited a generation of young Muslims who barely remember the 9/11 attacks. “You go to a restaurant and they present to you this beautiful meal. It looks so delicious and tempting. But then you go into the kitchen and you see the dirt and the filth and you’re disgusted.”</p> \n<p>Both men are particularly appalled, they said, by the way Isis has used their scholarship to cloak its savagery in ideological legitimacy, to gain recruits and justify its battle with al-Qaida and its affiliates. “Isis took all our religious works,” Maqdisi said. “They took it from us – it’s all our writings, they are all our books, our thoughts.” Now, Abu Qatada said, “they don’t respect anyone”.</p> \n<p>Such impudent behaviour, the two men agreed, would never have been accepted in the days when Bin Laden was alive. “No one used to speak against him,” Maqdisi lamented. “Bin Laden was a star. He had special charisma.” But despite their personal affection for his successor, Zawahiri – whom they call “Dr Ayman” – they both admit that he does not possess the authority and control to rebuff the threat from Isis. From the “very beginning” of his tenure, Zawahiri lacked “direct military or operational control,” Qatada said. “He has become accustomed to operating in this decentralised way – he is isolated.”</p> \n<p>According to Maqdisi, al-Qaida’s organisational structure has “collapsed”. Zawahiri, Maqdisi said, “operates solely based on allegiance. There is no organisational structure. There is only communication channels, and loyalty.” And unfortunately for Zawahiri, Isis has done its utmost to ensure that loyalty is in short supply.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b94c36795472c4cca782521cb4c0e386af441d86\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433955365256/431b41f8-7b11-4207-ae6b-986dc5dae338-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The radical cleric Abu Qatada says Isis is a 'cancerous growth' within the jihadi movement.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The radical cleric Abu Qatada says Isis is a ‘cancerous growth’ within the jihadi movement.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mustafa Khalili</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dr Munif Samara – a veteran of the jihad in Afghanistan and a close associate of Maqdisi and Qatada, who sat with both men as they were interviewed – painted an even more gloomy picture of al-Qaida’s position. A GP who runs a free clinic treating injured Syrian fighters and civilians, Samara has more experience than Maqdisi or Qatada with the day-to-day operations of jihadi organising, and has often handled the affairs of the two men during their frequent jail stints. He said that donations, which once came in waves of “hundreds of thousands”, have dried up as donors directed their money to Isis, or else refused to fund further bloodletting between the two groups. Another former al-Qaida member, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/jun/05/former-al-qaida-spy-for-mi6-urges-effort-to-confuse-islamic-state\">Aimen Dean</a> – who defected to become a spy for British intelligence – told the Guardian that one of his sources in Pakistan’s tribal areas said the finances of al-Qaida central in Waziristan were so desperate that it was reduced at one point last year to selling its laptops and cars to buy food and pay rent.</p> \n<p>Samara described Isis’s fight against al-Qaida as an attempt to bring the older group down from within. “At this moment, we do believe there is a coup d’etat under way within al-Qaida itself,” he said. </p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>In the decade after 9/11,</strong> al-Qaida attracted money, initiates and prestige like no other jihadi group in history. It grew to command the loyalty of a wide network of terrorist branches and affiliates that stretched from Europe to Africa and South Asia. Never before had so many geographically disparate groups been united under one banner. Bin Laden achieved this feat, at least in part, by remaining ideologically flexible. He refused to be proscriptive on small matters of faith, avoiding the kind of disputes that had ripped apart other jihadi coalitions in the past. In keeping with its formal name – <em>Tandheem Qaidat al-Jihad</em>, The Organisation for the Base of Jihad – al-Qaida acted as a hub for militants to make connections and receive financial and organisational support. Regional commanders were entrusted with a great deal of operational freedom.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The finances of al-Qaida were so desperate that it was reduced to selling its laptops and cars to buy food and pay rent</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In return, al-Qaida’s leadership demanded one thing above all else: loyalty. Its commanders were strictly vetted before being appointed; only those known from the battlefields of Afghanistan, Bosnia or Chechnya – and deemed to have the requisite knowledge of Islamic scholarship – were elevated to the group’s upper echelons. On their appointment, these senior commanders swore a blood oath to Bin Laden himself.</p> \n<p>When Zawahiri took over after Bin Laden’s death in 2011, he found himself geographically isolated. While he was hiding out, according to numerous sources, in the mountains on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, the centre of jihadi activity had moved thousands of miles away, to Syria and Iraq. As Pakistan’s army and American drones tightened their net around al-Qaida central, it became harder and harder for Zawahiri to maintain contact with his commanders in the field. “What is leadership,” Samara asked, “if your leader is in Afghanistan and your soldiers are in Iraq?”</p> \n<p>In fact, al-Qaida’s main branch in the Middle East, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), had long been a source of difficulty. Since its effective creation in 2003, under the leadership of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, ISI had been happy to use al-Qaida’s brand name and its money, but often ignored pleas for closer communication with central command – even when they came from Bin Laden himself. In 2010, they crossed a line: ISI appointed a new leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, without prior approval from al-Qaida, whose senior leaders knew almost nothing about the man – where he had come from, his military experience, whether he could be trusted.</p> \n<p>In a revealing communique seized during the raid on Bin Laden’s hideaway in Abbottabad, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/23/adam-gadahn-drone-strike-al-qaida\">Adam Gadahn</a> – the American al-Qaida member and frequent spokesman – voiced his disgust with ISI’s lack of respect. Writing to Bin Laden in January 2011, he asked why ISI should be permitted to sully al-Qaida’s name with its indiscriminate slaughter when it could not even bother to keep in touch with the group’s leadership. “Maybe,” he wrote, “it is better for them not to be in the ranks of the mujahideen, as they are just like a polluted spot that should be removed and sanitised and cleared from the ranks.” Less than six months after receiving the letter, Bin Laden was dead. Now it fell to Zawahiri, a man of lesser standing, to deal with the problem.</p> \n<p>By this time, ISI had been pushed to the brink of collapse by US and Iraqi forces – but the Syrian civil war gave the group a chance to rebuild. As the conflict began to intensify, Baghdadi quietly dispatched one of his junior officers, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jun/16/isis-islamic-state-iraq-levant-q-and-a\">Abu Muhammad al-Joulani</a>, across the border in late 2011 to take advantage of the chaos. Equipped with funds, weapons, and some of ISI’s best soldiers, Joulani’s group – which would soon be known as the Nusra Front – quickly became the most formidable fighting force in Syria. By 2013, Joulani was such a powerful commander in his own right that Baghdadi feared he was on the verge of obtaining Zawahiri’s support to elevate himself as the leader of an independent al-Qaida branch in Syria.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"12742ab2e9b4c3a209856df168d23ec66b07e61b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433955535275/2d5aba52-7200-44d6-90ed-731ff75171c1-351x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaida, has struggled to assert his authority from his hideout in Waziristan.\" width=\"351\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaida, has struggled to assert his authority from his hideout in Waziristan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On 8 April 2013, Baghdadi launched a pre-emptive strike – whose consequences would rip apart the banner of unity that had long presided over the jihadi movement. In an audio recording released online, Baghdadi declared that the Nusra Front and ISI would officially become one organisation. Nusra’s battle-stained banners, which hung over their newly captured headquarters in Syrian cities such as Raqqa, Aleppo and Homs would be replaced. The merged organisation would be called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or more simply Isis. The rebrand was effective immediately. Two days later, Joulani replied with his own audio message. He rejected Baghdadi’s “invitation” to merge – and pledged an oath of loyalty directly to Zawahiri, appealing to the “sheikh of jihad” to resolve the dispute.</p> \n<p>Within 24 hours, Zawahiri dispatched a private message urging calm. He said he wanted both commanders to send him representations before he would rule on this spat, which had, thanks to the internet, become embarrassingly public. Baghdadi made it clear that he was not willing to compromise: in a personal message, he warned Zawahiri that any hint of support for the “traitor” would have “no cure except the spilling of more blood”.</p> \n<p>On 23 May, Zawahiri delivered his verdict: Isis, which had been created without prior approval, would have to be “dissolved”; Baghdadi was ordered to restrict his operations to Iraq. Meanwhile, his former junior, Joulani, would become the leader of al-Qaida’s official branch in Syria. Both men, Zawahiri added, had a year to prove themselves, after which al-Qaida central would decide on what measures to take next. Like any suspended sentence, it was both an offer of redemption and a threat: Baghdadi could prosper by playing nicely within the new rules, or lose his position within al-Qaida entirely. Finally, to ensure his accord was adhered to peacefully, Zawahiri dispatched an emissary, Abu Khalid al-Suri, in whom he vested the power to resolve any further disputes.</p> \n<p>One former senior member of ISI who did not want to be named told the Guardian that Baghdadi was incensed by Zawahiri’s letter: he was shocked to be treated as an equal to Joulani and ordered to stay out of the Syrian conflict into which he had invested so much. According to Maqdisi, Baghdadi contemptuously dismissed Zawahiri’s envoy. “Suri told Baghdadi, if you stick to these points and you go back to Iraq, I will not make this order public,” Maqdisi said. “Instead, Isis refused the orders, and then started attacking Zawahiri – saying, ‘Al-Qaida is gone, it’s burned out.’”</p> \n<p>After Suri made good on the threat to go public with Zawahiri’s humiliating diktat – which was released to al-Jazeera in June – Baghdadi issued his own blunt and unbending reply: “As long as we have a pulse or an eye that blinks,” he said, Isis was there to stay. It was the first time a major al-Qaida figure had ever publicly defied the organisation’s leader. “That was an alarm bell,” Abu Qatada recalled.</p> \n<p>That summer, Isis began preparing for war: swelling its ranks and readying itself to claim back Syrian territory from Nusra, which it believed was rightly its own. In an astonishing series of prison breaks, it freed hundreds of Iraq’s most dangerous inmates by firing mortar rounds at walls and using car bombs to blow apart entrances. According to secret documents recently obtained by <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/islamic-state-files-show-structure-of-islamist-terror-group-a-1029274.html\">Der Spiegel</a>, Isis also began implementing plans to take advantage of the stream of thousands of men who were flooding into Syria from Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Europe. Without ties to native Syrians, these foreign fighters were likely to remain loyal. And they needed to be loyal, because instead of fighting Assad – as they had come to Syria to do – they would be used to stab the homegrown anti-Assad rebel groups in the back.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>One of Maqdisi’s close associates in Jordan</strong> is a man who we will call Raheem, a personal aide to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who helped found the organisation that evolved into Isis – and who had an inside view of the group’s transformation after Baghdadi took power. A hulking figure, standing at more than 6ft 4in, he appeared suddenly one day at Maqdisi’s house, after hearing a rumour that Isis followers had assaulted his sheikh. In an interview a few weeks later, Raheem described the men running Isis as a different breed from the religiously inspired jihadis of al-Qaida; in fact, he said, the group had been run for several years by men who once served Saddam Hussein’s Ba’athist regime.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-448244984__\n</div> \n<p>According to Raheem, when Zarqawi was in charge, it was his unofficial policy to shut out anyone from the secular nationalist Ba’ath party. Zarqawi firmly believed that Iraqis in general, and Ba’athists in particular, lacked piety. Under Hussein, Iraq had been a secular state, and Islamism – the body of intellectual work that has turned Islam from a religion into a full-blown system of governance – had been brutally suppressed. “There were very few Iraqis who were exposed to other ideas,” Raheem said. “They were nationalists and were highly influenced by the Ba’ath.”</p> \n<p>After Zarqawi’s death in 2006, ISI was almost destroyed by US forces and Sunni tribes revolting against its brutal violence. To save themselves, Raheem said, ISI’s inner circle decided that the group needed to broaden its ranks: revolutionary Islamist credentials were no longer essential – if you could recite a few lines of the Qur’an and grow a beard, you could sign up. The former Ba’athists, who had run Iraq for decades, were invaluable new recruits: Hussein’s former military officers knew the vulnerabilities of the Iraqi army; his former intelligence officials knew the power brokers in each town and village. Since the regime’s overthrow, these men had lost their incomes and their authority; now the Islamic State of Iraq would serve as a vehicle for them to regain their status. (Documents obtained by <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/islamic-state-files-show-structure-of-islamist-terror-group-a-1029274.html\">Der Spiegel</a> have revealed the major role played by a former colonel in Hussein’s air intelligence service, known as Haji Bakr, who is said to have been the architect of Isis’s takeover of northern Syria; according to Raheem, he brought an entire Ba’athist unit with him when he joined the group.)</p> \n<p>Raheem alleged that it was largely these men – former Ba’athists who became senior members of ISI – who nominated Baghdadi as the organisation’s new leader in 2010. Until his appointment, Raheem said, Baghdadi was regarded as a minor figure, quiet and uncharismatic. He had no military experience, and his scholarship was of little note, though he held a PhD in Islamic studies. But he made the ideal front man: on paper, at least, he was a religious scholar; his family claimed to be descended from the prophet Muhammad; and most importantly of all, he was not himself a Ba’athist.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-inside-story\">Isis: the inside story | Martin Chulov</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After Baghdadi’s appointment, ISI’s inner circle closed ranks around its chosen leader. It discontinued all but the most cursory communication with al-Qaida central, and slowly, the few remaining senior figures considered loyal to Zawahiri were either deliberately sidelined or killed off on the battlefield. By the time Zawahiri’s fateful letter arrived in May 2013, Raheem said, there was not a single person in Isis’s senior leadership who had once belonged to al-Qaida.</p> \n<p>Later that year, while the rest of the world was fixated on Assad’s chemical weapons, Isis planned to seize control of the 500-mile border between Turkey and Syria: if it could hold the border crossings, which supplied the main rebel groups with food, medicine, weapons and new recruits, Isis would have Nusra and its other rivals by the throat. By December, strategically important border towns began to fall, one by one, to Isis fighters. Isis fighters rode into towns whose freedom from Assad had been won at great cost, stripped factories bare, and turfed out – or killed – other fighters and their families. They kidnapped high-level commanders from other rebel groups, and murdered Syrian civilians who had been involved in the earliest mass protests against Assad, calculating that these were the only people brave enough to confront Isis in the future.</p> \n<p>In December 2013, Hussein Suleiman, a handsome young physician who was also a senior officer of the Islamic Front rebel group, was sent to make peace with a local Isis unit after trouble broke out at a checkpoint near Lake Assad in eastern Syria. When Suleiman did not return to base, Islamic Front officials contacted Isis, which confirmed they were holding him prisoner as a spy. Outraged, the Islamic Front demanded his release. Surely Isis could not go around arresting peace brokers? At the very least, they asked that his crimes be tried in an independent sharia court. Isis refused.</p> \n<p>When Isis released Suleiman as part of a prisoner exchange on 31 December, the Islamic Front received a mutilated corpse: his right ear had been cut off, his teeth were knocked out, one of his legs had been broken. The young doctor had been tortured, and the top of his head was blown off. The next day, the Islamic Front posted pictures of his mangled body online, next to those of how he used to look. They spread rapidly on social media and sparked protests in towns across Syria against Isis brutality. In Isis-controlled towns, fighters shot at the protesters, fuelling more outrage.</p> \n<p>Within days, Syria’s major rebel groups – including Nusra, the country’s al-Qaida affiliate – banded together to declare war on Isis. Thousands of militants were killed over the first few months of 2014, as battles raged between Isis and the other rebel factions, with senior commanders on both sides kidnapped, tortured and murdered. As their positions were overrun, Isis was forced to retreat from western Syria. It began consolidating its control over the east, the area closest to Iraq, and the location of many of Syria’s oil fields. There, Nusra and Isis fought viciously, in and around the city of Raqqa and along the banks of the Euphrates.</p> \n<p>On 16 January 2014, Zawahiri’s envoy, Abu Khalid al-Suri, published a message online. He tweeted that Isis was seeking to corrupt the jihad as it had done in Iraq: militants should direct their bombs at the infidels, he declared, not at their fellow jihadis. Seventeen days later, Zawahiri played his final card: Isis was expelled from al-Qaida.</p> \n<p>For Isis, there was no turning back. To make clear that reconciliation was off the table, they sent their former boss a message that he would not forget. On 21 February, five men fought their way into the compound in Aleppo where Suri was staying. When their target appeared, one of the attackers detonated his suicide vest. Zawahiri’s loyal servant, who had been sent from Afghanistan to make peace, now lay dead.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>From their jail cells in Jordan,</strong> Abu Qatada and Maqdisi watched the vicious struggle between Isis and al-Qaida with growing concern. For Abu Qatada, it felt like history was repeating itself. In the early 1990s, he had been a fervent supporter of the Algerian Groupe Islamique Arm&eacute; (GIA) – issuing fatwas that gave GIA terrorists license to kill with little discrimination. But when the GIA inevitably began murdering rival militants, Abu Qatada assembled a group of radical scholars to denounce the organisation, helping to strip it of intellectual credibility among fellow jihadis. Now, more than 20 years later, he wanted Maqdisi to join him in a similar campaign against Isis – to publicly shame the group as extremists acting outside the accepted rules of jihad.</p> \n<p>Maqdisi asked Abu Qatada to hold off. He still hoped that Isis could be brought back within the fold. Some of Isis’s most senior members had already written to him in prison signalling their contrition. One letter said: “We know that we have made mistakes … We know that among our soldiers and clerics there are some who are extremists … But they are the minority.” (It was signed: “Your son, one of the sharia legislators for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria written by request and on behalf of some of his brothers.”) With the right plan for reconciliation, Maqdisi believed that unity might be restored.</p> \n<p>Using intermediaries to keep Zawahiri informed of his attempts at arbitration, Maqdisi reached out to Isis’s inner circle in late 2013, approaching one of his former students, a young Bahraini named Turki Binali. Binali had been his protege – a pupil of “extraordinary passion”, in Maqdisi’s words. Some nicknamed him “Maqdisi junior”. After joining Isis, Binali rapidly rose into its highest ranks: he was appointed as Baghdadi’s official biographer, and by spring 2014, he had been named Isis’s chief “scholar at arms”.<strong> </strong>In theory, a single decree from Binali’s pen could end the civil war between Isis and al-Qaida.</p> \n<p>Maqdisi, who dispatched two of his own students to meet Binali in person, said that their initial exchanges were encouraging: he warned Binali that unless Isis was willing to negotiate an end to the conflict with al-Qaida, the group risked condemnation from the world’s most eminent jihadi sheikhs. In response, Binali assured his “beloved teacher” that Baghdadi wanted nothing more than to reach agreement with al-Qaida. But as months passed, and the fighting continued, Maqdisi came to believe Binali had little intention of settling the feud.</p> \n<p>How, Binali asked Maqdisi, could Zawahiri have praised the Arab Spring when the people who had risen up in Egypt and elsewhere were calling for democracy, not sharia? Why, he asked, did Zawahiri refer respectfully to the US president as “Mr Obama”? Perhaps, Binali intimated, al-Qaida had decided to quit the jihad and settle into a quieter existence as a peaceful organisation? Maqdisi thought these questions were “absurd”, he said – “meaningless, insignificant points”, which Isis had “never mentioned in the past”.</p> \n<p>By spring 2014, communications between student and teacher had seriously deteriorated; at one point, Binali slighted Maqdisi by suggesting that old age had confused him. After drafting a short online article entitled “My former Sheikh”, Binali stopped replying altogether. On 26 May 2014, Maqdisi deemed the negotiations dead and, backed by his fellow al-Qaida ideologues, issued a fatwa against Isis.</p> \n<p>“It has become necessary that we tell the truth, after we exhausted all the possibilities of advice and all hopes of making Isis return to the path of truth,” Maqdisi wrote. The rebellious organisation, he declared, had no “Islamic pretext”. Baghdadi, his commanders, and their religious officials were “deviants” who had “disobeyed the orders of their leaders and head scholars”. He instructed Isis’s soldiers to defect to the Nusra Front, and decreed that no Islamic website should host Isis messages.</p> \n<p>This was a serious threat to Isis’s legitimacy, and even its future. According to a series of detailed leaks from an anonymous Twitter account – much of which the Guardian has subsequently verified – Binali approached Baghdadi with a stark appraisal of Isis’s vulnerable position. The caliphate would eventually collapse, he said, if the jihad’s leading scholars and veterans continued to stand against Isis. The project could not be sustained unless Isis recruited influential supporters.</p> \n<p>Binali’s solution to this problem was simple: if Isis could not win support, it would buy it. In the summer and autumn of 2014, messages were sent to Maqdisi, Abu Qatada and about a dozen other top-ranking clerics, inviting them to relocate to the caliphate, where they could work without fear of imprisonment. (Baghdadi even wrote a personal letter to Maqdisi to persuade him to come). To sweeten the deal, payments of up to $1m were promised. Binali also sent word to al-Qaida’s branch in Yemen that Isis would offer its leader and his men $10m to publicly pledge allegiance to Baghdadi; a similar offer, for $5m, was made to the al-Qaida affiliate in Libya.</p> \n<p>Binali’s scheme had mixed results. Maqdisi, Qatada and the other prominent scholars rejected the offer out of hand, as did Yemen’s al-Qaida commander. But Binali appeared to have captured the interest of several jihadi factions across the globe. In November, Isis trumpeted public oaths of loyalty from jihadi militants in Egypt, Libya, Pakistan and even Yemen, al-Qaida’s strongest redoubt. Suddenly, the group’s influence was extending beyond Syria and Iraq, into the rest of the Islamic world.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fd752b6156d8a2366c39079837bbe6f4a1d2c25e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433962970179/55b3457c-d644-440a-abed-cc8a3e9945d7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dr Munif Samara\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Munif Samara, the jihadi doctor and close associate of Maqdisi and Abu Qatada.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mustafa Khalili</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There would be other exchanges between Maqdisi and Binali later that year, including a failed attempt to secure the release of the Isis hostage Peter Kassig. Their final communication came not long after Kassig’s execution, when Maqdisi once again found himself mediating with Isis. On 24 December 2014, a Jordanian military aircraft was shot down over Isis territory near the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, and its pilot taken hostage; Maqdisi heard the news when the prison imam dedicated a prayer to the man. Soon after, Maqdisi sounded out Jordanian officials about an idea, originally suggested by his friend Dr Munif Samara, to secure the return of the pilot. Although Jordanian officials were wary, believing that the pilot could have been killed already, they authorised the plan.</p> \n<p>Communicating primarily via Telegram messenger, an app that allows for encrypted communications, Maqdisi sent word to Isis in January of this year that the Jordanians would be willing to conduct a prisoner swap: in return for the pilot, they would release a woman named Sajida al-Rishawi. In 2005, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had sent al-Rishawi and her husband on a mission to Jordan, where they were to explode bomb belts at the Radisson SAS hotel as part of a coordinated series of suicide bombings. Rishawi’s device did not detonate, and she was arrested, languishing on death row for the next decade. In his approach to Isis, Maqdisi said, he reminded the group’s senior leaders that, as the inheritors of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi’s legacy, they had an obligation to save her now.</p> \n<p>Although Maqdisi is not certain about who he was communicating with, he has no doubt that his messages were being relayed to the most senior members of Isis, including Baghdadi himself. The initial response was positive: Maqdisi says he was told that Isis were “eager” to make the trade. On social media, Isis supporters suddenly began calling for al-Rishawi’s release.</p> \n<p>Before any deal could be brokered, the Jordanians instructed Maqdisi to obtain proof that the pilot was still alive. In response, the Isis negotiators sent Maqdisi an electronic file that they claimed would provide proof of life – but the file was password protected.</p> \n<p>On 3 February, after a few days of tense dialogue, the negotiators finally sent Maqdisi the password to unlock the file. When he received it, Maqdisi realised he had been betrayed: the password, in Arabic, was “Maqdisi the pimp, the sole of the tyrant’s shoe, son of the English whore.”</p> \n<p>After he typed it in, one humiliating character at a time, a video appeared on Maqdisi’s screen. He watched in horror as Isis soldiers muscled the pilot into a cage, doused him in petrol, and burned him alive. Three hours later, Isis posted the video on the internet. The next day, Sajida al-Rishawi was taken from her cell and executed.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>At his house on the outskirts of Zarqa,</strong> about 25km from Amman, Maqdisi keeps a large model boat on top of one of his overstuffed bookshelves. It’s a strange object to find there: Islamic extremists are not known for their maritime collectibles. The boat was a gift from a very senior member of Isis, who built it from pencils and matchsticks while incarcerated in Abu Ghraib. Above the boat’s sails hangs a banner that reads “Journey with us,” a quotation from the Quranic retelling of the story of the flood, when Noah reaches out to beckon his son aboard. For Maqdisi, it is a symbol of salvation and unity. “It’s meant as a message for all Muslims,” he said – one with a special significance for jihadis today, as the factional bloodshed rages on.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b8b5dd34dc3a76c0d9e1da2d3cb724a209f2cf18\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433966118100/aa25bed4-770e-43b1-a47d-d497f67d7a28-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi's model ship made for him by a senior member of Isis who was incarcerated in Abu Ghraib\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abu &shy;Muhammad al-Maqdisi’s model boat was made for him by a very senior member of Isis, who built it from pencils and matchsticks while incarcerated in Abu Ghraib.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mustafa Khalili</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Maqdisi and Abu Qatada continue to hope that the unity that once prevailed under bin Laden will return – but they admitted openly that Isis is winning the war on the ground and the propaganda struggle alike. “It’s a fluid state of affairs,” Abu Qatada suggested hopefully. “At the moment, Isis are drunk on power.” But at some point, he believes, they will need to negotiate with al-Qaida again. He pointed out that al-Qaida’s branch in Syria had achieved some recent successes against Assad’s forces, while Maqdisi observed that there were several other branches, including the one in Yemen, whose allegiance remains unquestioned. “Its loyalty is strong and clear,” Maqdisi said. “When Zawahiri sends a message to Yemen, he knows his orders will be obeyed.”</p> \n<p>But the two men believe that the events of the past decade – and especially the war with Isis – are a sign that al-Qaida needs to reappraise its tactics. Maqdisi believes that al-Qaida should no longer aim to recruit followers in large numbers; it needs “people of quality”, he said, who thoroughly understand Islamic scholarship, and will not merely deploy it in the furtherance of their own personal ends.</p> \n<p>In recent years, Maqdisi has even come to believe that al-Qaida’s conception of jihad – one licensed in part by his own scholarship – may have been incorrect, a jihad of “spite” rather than “empowering believers”. Even the attacks of 9/11, Maqdisi said, were part of a misguided strategy. “The actions in New York and Washington, no matter how great they appeared to be – the bottom line is they were spiteful.”</p> \n<p>Maqdisi now wants al-Qaida to begin providing social services, as Hamas has done in Gaza. “That kind of enabling jihad will establish our Islamic state. It will enable it to become a place of refuge for the weak,” he said. Al-Qaida branches in Tunisia and elsewhere have been putting this suggestion into practice – with jihadis guarding hospitals, building infrastructure, and even picking up litter. And yet, as one al-Qaida veteran who did not want to be named told the Guardian, local commanders have reported that their soldiers are impatient with these new duties; many would prefer for Zawahiri to swear allegiance to Baghdadi.</p> \n<p>Munif Samara, the jihadi doctor and close associate of Maqdisi and Abu Qatada, worried that al-Qaida may be crippled by its difficulty attracting new recruits. Young soldiers, he said, “want action, they want blood, they want explosions. They are sitting in their countries, and either they will be in jail or something like this, and they are waiting for al-Qaida [to do something], and al-Qaida is doing nothing.” For these young men, the lure of Isis is strong.</p> \n<p>Al-Qaida has long maintained that while the establishment of the caliphate is the ultimate goal, conditions are not yet right: ordinary Muslims need to be educated about “true Islam” for many more years before it can return. But it has now been a year since Baghdadi declared his own caliphate – and the longer that Isis can hold its territory and broadcast its military successes to the world, the more credibility it will steal from al-Qaida.</p> \n<p>As ideologues steeped in almost 1,400 years of Islamic scholarship, Maqdisi and Abu Qatada tend to the long view – for them, the proper perspective on al-Qaida’s present crisis is one of decades rather than months, which may explain their relative optimism about its possibility for renewal. For now, however, their fierce attacks on Isis have done little to halt its advances. Given the group’s ruthlessness and disdain for criticism, it is hard not to imagine, as one walks away from Maqdisi’s house, that if the war continues, it may not be long before he and Abu Qatada find themselves in the crosshairs.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Follow the Long Read on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2219aaeecf8fe6a54772264c80a99531815c71ac/528_120_1701_1021/1701.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1021,"width":1701,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Stringer . / Reuters/Reuters","altText":"Militant Islamic State fighters in a military parade in Syria’s northern Raqqa province","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Stringer . / Reuters/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433954984279/1b7d66ce-79f0-4547-b570-f68f1f82bd4e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Abu ­Muhammad al-Maqdisi, the intellectual godfather of al-Qaida.

I just felt trapped, … I know I’m going to be in a huge, huge amount of trouble.<br /></p> \n<p>“I’ve even got family members into trouble but it’s my son and I need to put him first over myself or anybody else,” she told the Sun.<br /></p> \n<p>The paper said it was not aware of Minnock’s whereabouts.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Andrew Butt, who family members said is the partner of Minnock’s mother, Louise Minnock, is due to appear at Bristol crown court accused of helping the 35-year-old mother go into hiding. <br /></p> \n<p>It is understood that Butt is accused of driving Minnock from a supermarket in Highbridge, Somerset, where she was last seen, to Cheltenham, in Gloucestershire.<br /></p> \n<p>Police broadened the search for Minnock and Ethan on Wednesday, while family members raised fears that she may never see her child again once she is found.</p> \n<p>Avon and Somerset police said they were investigating reports that Minnock had been spotted in Gloucestershire and the West Midlands. Relatives said that it was possible that she had left the country, as she has friends in Ireland and France.</p> \n<p>Williams said he was deeply concerned about his son. “I’m really worried about him; I just want him back,” he said.</p> \n<p>Minnock and Ethan vanished from her home in Highbridge, Somerset, two weeks ago, but the circumstances of their disappearance remained secret until a judge lifted reporting restrictions on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Stephen Wildblood QC appealed to the media for assistance in reuniting Ethan with his father, saying: “It is really important that we work together – the court and the press – to find where this child is.”</p> \n<p>The judge warned Minnock’s brother Marvin Shaw, sister Limmie Shaw and mother that they would face charges including contempt of court and perjury if they did not reveal what they knew about the whereabouts of Ethan and his mother. All three were arrested on Sunday in relation to the family court proceedings.</p> \n<p>DCI Marie Wright of Avon and Somerset police said: “It is fairly unusual for a court to lift the reporting restrictions, allowing us to act as their agents and continue the search for Becky and her son. We need to find Becky and Ethan very, very quickly. Since they were last seen in Taunton on 26 May, we have reports that they have been spotted in the Cheltenham area and more recently in the Birmingham area of the West Midlands. </p> \n<p>“We are keen to hear from Becky or anyone who knows her whereabouts to contact us. As time goes on, we are really concerned at the emotional impact this will have upon Becky and Ethan, because the court process cannot be evaded for ever.”</p> \n<p>Minnock is described as a white woman about 5ft 3in tall, of medium build. She has dark, wavy, shoulder-length hair. It is not known what she was wearing when she went missing. Ethan is a white boy of small build with fair hair and blue eyes. Minnock does not drive, so police have asked public transport users to keep a lookout for the pair.</p> \n<p>The missing woman’s aunt Caroline Minnock said she believed her niece would lose all links with her son once she was found. “It’s all got out of hand,” she said. “I think she’s in big trouble. I know for a fact now that she won’t see him [Ethan] again. She won’t even get visitation. I know she [Rebecca] has spoken to her brother to say she is fine, but she has called from a withheld number. We don’t even know if she’s in the UK.”</p> \n<p>Caroline, from Cheltenham, said she was “gobsmacked” when members of the family were told to appear in court. “It’s mad – absolute madness. I just don’t know what is going on. The police think they know where Becky is, but nobody knows … We’ve let them [the police] into our houses. We’ve not got anything to hide.”</p> \n<p>Caroline said every day her niece had with Ethan was “precious”. “She is a quiet girl. Never got in any trouble. She went to college and enjoyed art. She is a very quiet gentle person. He is a such a sweet boy.”</p> \n<p>Minnock’s family have launched a campaign claiming that she has been treated unfairly and let down by social services, police and the courts.</p> \n<p>Ethan, who was born in January 2012, has lived with his mother since his parents’ separation in February 2013. Legal proceedings started between the parents in March 2013 when Williams applied for contact with his son. Magistrates ordered that Williams should have some contact with Ethan in the presence of Minnock in August 2013, but this arrangement broke down two months later.</p> \n<p>In January 2014, Minnock made allegations against Williams. These were all rejected by a district judge in April 2014. A hearing next took place in February 2015, after Minnock made further allegations. A district judge found these had been “fabricated” by Minnock to “frustrate contact”.</p> \n<p>Ethan began to spend four nights a week with his father and three nights a week with his mother. A child psychiatrist, Dr Mark Berelowitz, carried out a report on Ethan and found the boy had a “warm relationship” with both parents. However, Berelowitz said Minnock did not accept that Williams was innocent of her allegations and had questioned Ethan “extensively”. He recommended that Ethan should live with his father and have supervised contact with Minnock, a view shared by a social worker.</p> \n<p>Another court hearing was listed before a district judge on 27 May. Prior to the hearing, Minnock was advised that Ethan would be taken to live with his father and fled before the case could be heard.</p> \n<p>A second aunt, Margaret Minnock, also from Cheltenham, said her niece was not in a “settled” state or acting with a “reasonable thought process”. She claimed that Minnock panicked on the morning of the court case when she knew she was going to lose custody of her son. <br /></p> \n<p>“She is distraught, she is absolutely devastated. She doesn’t know which way to turn,” she said. “We’re worried about her future and how long you can sustain this for. She is a great mum. They’ve got the most beautiful relationship.”</p> \n<p>Asked whether Minnock had considered handing herself in, Margaret said: “She is struggling with that. There have been little thoughts of ‘Should I give myself up?’ I don’t think she knows what she is going to do. I think she expects to be picked up. I think eventually she will be found.”</p> \n<p>Margaret claimed that her niece has been let down by the authorities. “The case needs someone independent, higher up, to review the whole case,” she said.</p> \n<p>Somerset county council and Sedgemoor district council declined to comment, saying that they were not involved in the case. </p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433973173029/745a06fc-6381-47a7-92c7-fe38cc2f48d7-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Avon & Somerset Police/PA","altText":"Rebecca Minnock and her three-year-old son Ethan","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Avon & Somerset Police/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-10T22:05:30Z","lastModified":"2015-06-11T08:49:05Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Jamie Grierson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jamie-grierson"},{"name":"Steven Morris","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stevenmorris"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jun/10/missing-mum-rebecca-minnock-breaks-silence-run-son","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49yxb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/2015/jun/10/missing-mum-rebecca-minnock-breaks-silence-run-son","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/10/missing-mum-rebecca-minnock-breaks-silence-run-son"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-457124264","source":"ITN","durationInSeconds":157,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/10/150610MissingMother_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/10/150610MissingMother.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/10/1433956835563/KP_269228_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Police concerned about emotional impact on missing mother and son  video","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Police concerned about emotional impact on missing mother and son  video","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Police concerned about emotional impact on missing mother and son  video"}}},"importance":4,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433973173029/745a06fc-6381-47a7-92c7-fe38cc2f48d7-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Avon & Somerset Police/PA","altText":"Rebecca Minnock and her three-year-old son Ethan","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Avon & Somerset Police/PA"}}]},{"title":"Ukip insider Raheem Kassam: ‘We had to lock HQ doors because some people were too embarrassing to be seen’","rawTitle":"Ukip insider Raheem Kassam: ‘We had to lock HQ doors because some people were too embarrassing to be seen’","item":{"type":"article","id":"politics/2015/jun/10/ukip-insider-raheem-kassam-we-had-to-lock-hq-doors-because-some-people-were-too-embarrassing-to-be-seen","title":"Ukip insider Raheem Kassam: ‘We had to lock HQ doors because some people were too embarrassing to be seen’","trailText":"He was Nigel Farage’s righthand man and election strategist, and even shared a flat with the Ukip leader.

But less than a week after the election, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/14/nigel-farage-advisers-quit-ukip-civil-war-raheem-kassam-matthew-richardson\">Kassam was pressured out of his job</a> in one of Ukip’s periodic bouts of infighting.</p> \n<p>So what is his verdict on eight months at the heart of Farage’s empire? “I totally regret it. Every minute,” he says. “I don’t mean it was a horrible experience. But I’ve taken a big hit for nothing. The only good thing that’s come out of this are friendships ... But have I got anything else apart from looking at much of Ukip and thinking you are just a bunch of ragtag, unprofessional, embarrassing people who let Nigel down at every juncture? No.”</p> \n<p>The public feuding kicked off after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/11/nigel-farage-withdraws-resignation-as-ukip-leader\">Farage decided to “un-resign”</a>, going back on his promise to step down <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/video/2015/may/08/nigel-farage-resigns-ukip-south-thanet-general-election-video\">after he failed to win his target seat of South Thanet</a>. In the fallout, Kassam’s detractors accused him of being a divisive Iago-type figure, dripping rightwing poison into Farage’s ear that harmed the party’s chances of winning over moderate voters. According to his critics, it was Kassam’s “shock and awe” strategy that led Farage to warn against <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/oct/10/nigel-farage-keep-hiv-positive-migrants-out-britain\">foreigners with HIV</a> using the NHS and claim there were <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/apr/28/nigel-farage-eu-response-to-migrant-boat-crisis-would-bring-jihadis-to-uk\">half a million Islamist extremists among the migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2fd9f10a0ffb99e67d24cf1ac8932c15921a7923\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433957831247/e8348b58-f79c-416e-9920-473d4765cf67-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Raheem Kassam.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raheem Kassam.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But Kassam denies this was ever his game plan – his theory is that people were jealous that he got too close to the Ukip leader, to the exclusion of almost every other acolyte. By polling day, it was obvious to those following the Ukip campaign that the inner court of King Nigel had shrunk to Kassam, election strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe and his Kent press officer Sarah White.</p> \n<p>“Egos got in the way at every point,” Kassam says. “Who do you think Nigel would call? It was always me. They absolutely hated that. But the truth of it was that we were always mopping up everyone’s messes.”</p> \n<p>We meet at the Blue Boar, a regular haunt in Westminster, and the supremely confident Kassam seems unfazed. He has just returned from a holiday in the US, is back at his old job at the rightwing news site <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/\">Breitbart</a> and is ready to lift the lid on some bizarre and dysfunctional happenings that dogged Ukip’s campaign. Over a drink, he’s keen to outline what went wrong. The confusion over whether Farage should back a cap on immigrants? “It created an impression of chaos. There is no way to look at it and think: ‘These guys really know what they are talking about.’” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/mar/24/janice-atkinson-expelled-ukip-false-expenses-claims\">The suspension of gaffe-prone Janice Atkinson</a> as an MEP for allegedly trying to inflate her expenses? “Nigel wanted her out before that. She should have gone when she said ‘<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/aug/18/ukip-mep-apology-thai-insult\">ting-tong</a>’.”</p> \n<p>The feuding between Farage’s personal team and officials at party HQ? “It was like a playground in there ... It got to the point where journalists would come into HQ and we’d have to lock certain doors because the people behind those doors were too embarrassing to be seen.” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/apr/15/ukip-manifesto-2015-the-key-points\">The manifesto</a>? “It was a clusterfuck.” A particular party activist who remained in post despite a chequered history? “Disgraceful. The man is a racist, there is no doubt about it ... I don’t throw around racism often, I have a high threshold for it because I’m so anti-PC, but he is a definite racist.”</p> \n<p>Kassam says this was the only example of racism that he encountered during his time in the party and that he faced more prejudice when he was a member of the Conservative party. The most surreal moment? When <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jan/20/ukip-health-party-rejects-nigel-farage-nhs-reform\">Louise Bours, the health spokeswoman, decided to resign in the middle of one of Farage’s rallies in a row over NHS spending</a>. “Afterwards, I had to lock everyone out of the room and tell Nigel. I can’t repeat what he said then.” She was later persuaded to stay and the episode never became public.</p> \n<p>He blames three senior Ukip figures for engineering his exit from the party and trying to orchestrate a coup against Farage – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/blog/live/2015/may/19/yvette-cooper-says-labour-sounded-anti-worker-for-people-in-big-firms-politics-live\">Patrick O’Flynn</a>, the former economics spokesman, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/26/ukips-evans-calls-for-cross-party-alliance-to-create-eu-referendum-no-campaign\">Suzanne Evans, the deputy chairman</a>, and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/douglas-carswell\">Douglas Carswell</a>, the party’s only MP. This is a charge they all deny, but O’Flynn was stripped of his frontbench role and Evans of her responsibility for policy in the aftermath of the row. Kassam reckons Carswell will survive just another six months in Ukip because he is no longer useful, given that the party has turned down almost &pound;1m of public funding<strong> </strong>due to him as an MP. “Douglas is not worth anything, he has no clout. He means nothing to us now,” he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b4c5434bf1e226f423ad25f5f80e9dca6f8e14d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433957942036/7fecd095-a673-4458-8f07-c8545aa22f7f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Farage hears of his defeat in South Thanet on 8 May, with fellow contestants Will Scobie and Al Murray.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farage hears of his defeat in South Thanet on 8 May, with fellow contestants Will Scobie and Al Murray.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On O’Flynn, he is equally scathing: “I’m sorry, but if you are Patrick O’Flynn and you have managed via your morning briefings to elicit a headline that says the EU is brainwashing our children through colouring books – OK, you tell me who is doing more damage to the party? And you know what the worst thing is? I went out to bat for those guys every time when they were in trouble.”</p> \n<p>Kassam claims that even before the election he could see a “plot” coming and warned Farage to no avail. “I predicted everything that would happen – the Suzanne stuff, the Carswell stuff, the Patrick stuff – nobody listened to me,” he says. “It earned me a lot of credit with Nigel that I foresaw that.”</p> \n<p>Not enough to keep him in the job, some might say, with the others still in the party. But Kassam claims he was not forced out of his role as Farage’s senior adviser, but instead chose to leave at the end of his contract in order to “bulletproof Nigel”.</p> \n<p>His argument goes like this: the anti-Farage camp believed the Ukip leader was veering too far to the right and had become too toxic to lead an EU referendum campaign that was now going to happen under a Cameron majority government. As Kassam’s critics lined up, painting him as a malign Tea Party influence on Farage, he says he was confronted with the choice of trying to brave out the row or resigning temporarily before returning as part of the leader’s Brussels staff. As it happened, Kassam was on the way to see his old boss at Breitbart in the US at the time, and was offered his former job back on the spot. He downed a shot of vodka, and then made his way to the Sky News studio to start defending Farage and attacking O’Flynn, including accusing him of having “personal problems” live on air.</p> \n<p>“In those situations it’s fight or flight. You can crumble or you can rise to the occasion. I was sitting there thinking: it’s fine. It’s just a job, I did my best. If I genuinely thought I’d let Nigel down in any way I would have been upset and distracted ... But basically I’ve formed a one-man human shield around Nigel. Every time they go for him, who will the journalists come to for background and quotes? I’m his forcefield at the moment. He knows it to be true to this minute.”</p> \n<p>Certainly, the whole episode has not dented Kassam’s loyalty to Farage, whom he describes as his “hero”. He claims they still speak regularly, most recently the day before – about the content of his speeches, social media and just general chat. Not coincidentally, Farage has also just signed up as Breitbart’s new star columnist. So why is he speaking out now, and would Farage be unhappy about what he has to say to the media? “Probably. But that’s my prerogative. “I think Nigel’s had a rough time, unfairly. And I’ve had a rough time, unfairly. That’s why.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72839876c8e68542a5c2c60aab90487075ad58db\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433958056798/95ef4dcb-211b-46ca-9d4f-8af8af80b556-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Douglas Carswell and Nigel Farage in happier times.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Douglas Carswell and Nigel Farage in happier times.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The 28-year-old son of Muslim immigrants who live in Uxbridge, Kassam might not seem the most likely choice to become friends with the leader of Ukip, but he has a history of working for rightwing websites and the <a href=\"http://henryjacksonsociety.org/\">Henry Jackson Society</a> thinktank. He says he first bonded with Farage when they met in the US and went on to have what is known in the Ukip lexicon as a number of “PFLs” – proper fucking lunches, defined by the number of bottles of wine that are consumed. After he was hired – despite warnings in the media about his “wild self-importance” – Kassam believes he became invaluable to Farage because he was one of the few people to stand up to him.</p> \n<p>During the last six weeks of the election campaign, Kassam was dispatched to the target constituency to take charge as it became clear the Tories were throwing in more resources. He immediately moved into Farage’s flat in Ramsgate, which became a place where there was a wine glass stuffed with cigarettes butts, an electricity meter that kept running out of credit and Farage’s bed was a mattress on the living room floor. “It looked like a Damien Hirst exhibition,” he says with pride.</p> \n<p>On a typical day, Farage would be up at 6am, bright and perky for a breakfast of kippers at a nearby hotel. “Then we’d rendezvous at the office and decide what we want to do for the day, which would involve some walkabouts and a lot of knocking on doors. Then we’d maybe hit a pub for lunch. Then more walkabouts and more canvassing. Then another pint around 5 o’clock, go out and do more evening canvassing. Then around 9, we’d go to The Smugglers [pub] for dinner or we’d go to La Magnolia [an Italian] and have a nice civilised meal.”</p> \n<p>However, the entire Ukip team had failed to spot that Farage’s health difficulties – which led media commentators to note that the Ukip leader was tired and snappy at points in the campaign – were affecting his mood. “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/apr/24/nigel-farageukip-sleeping-pills-back-pain\">None of us realised he had back problems,</a>” he says. “That was his fault. We all saw the way he looked during the Believe in Britain speech. I thought: ‘We’d been for a steam three days running so you don’t look sweaty. But you’re still sweating and look really uncomfortable.’ I couldn’t understand it.”</p> \n<p>Farage finally spoke out about his agonising pain a few weeks before polling day, and decided to scale back his schedule and concentrate his time mostly on winning South Thanet. In the end, he lost by around 2,000 votes, having been convinced right up until the day itself that he was about to enter parliament on his seventh attempt.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b9cce539edfa5da175e405c505421d3a71e9ee0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433958213759/5115718e-49ae-4e86-8a83-92382d583031-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage faces the media after defeat.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage faces the media after defeat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“We knew by 10 o’clock that we hadn’t done it,” Kassam says. “That morning, Nigel and I went to vote together, and we were both in good spirits. I was quietly confident, I knew it was so close ... But suddenly between 12 and 4 there were queues in Broadstairs, and I thought: Oh no, these people are not voting for us ... It got to around eight and the queues in Broadstairs hadn’t subsided and everywhere else had. I said that’s it. I had tears in my eyes and I was genuinely holding back tears for the next 48 hours. I don’t cry, but I was so sad, so deeply sad.”</p> \n<p>While the results rolled in, Farage was asleep, while Kassam and Bruni-Lowe slept in 30-minute shifts to keep abreast of the news. In the morning, they accompanied Farage to the declaration, knowing that he had lost.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/10/raheem-kassam-ukip-nigel-farage-rag-tag-unprofessional-embarrassing-people\">Raheem Kassam: 'rag-tag, unprofessional, embarrassing people' spoilt Ukip's election</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Within an hour, Farage had resigned, and Kassam still insists that the Ukip leader was relieved to be going – despite famously unresigning just four days later. Kassam will also not hear any criticism of the South Thanet campaign itself, which he boldly declares to have been the “single best campaign ever, ever in British politics, bar maybe the Bradford spring”. If it were not for the SNP, he says, the party would have won around five more seats.</p> \n<p>Kassam also takes umbrage at the claims that he was responsible for Farage repeatedly bringing up the issue of immigrants with HIV using NHS resources. O’Flynn was fully onside, he says, and was present in the spin room after Farage’s television debate, ready to brief the press on the issue. He also disputes the idea that this in any way deterred potential voters.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think there was anyone who was thinking of voting for us who was put off by that,” he says. “Don’t forget Labour voters aren’t who you think they are. They aren’t sat in Hampstead sipping Chateau Neuf Du Pape.”</p> \n<p>Later on, Kassam returns to the theme. “Life is not a Michael Jackson song, you can’t heal the world,” he says. “I’d like to see any political party try and stand on that principle.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433957755010/7d8c851e-c263-49c5-a48f-b0fc98c28cc5-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Gareth Fuller","altText":"Kassam and Farage on the campaign trail on the eve of the election, 7 May.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Gareth Fuller"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433957832857/e8348b58-f79c-416e-9920-473d4765cf67-1360x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1360,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Raheem Kassam.

The findings are likely to feed into proposed legislative changes on surveillance announced in the Queen’s speech.</p> \n<p>Anderson, introducing his report, said: “Modern communications networks can be used by the unscrupulous for purposes ranging from cyber-attack, terrorism and espionage to fraud, kidnap and child sexual exploitation. A successful response to these threats depends on entrusting public bodies with the powers they need to identify and follow suspects in a borderless online world.</p> \n<p>“But trust requires verification. Each intrusive power must be shown to be necessary, clearly spelled out in law, limited in accordance with human rights standards and subject to demanding and visible safeguards.</p> \n<p>“The current law is fragmented, obscure, under constant challenge and variable in the protections that it affords the innocent. It is time for a clean slate. This report aims to help parliament achieve a world-class framework for the regulation of these strong and vital powers.”</p> \n<p>GCHQ successfully fought to retain its bulk collection powers. The recommendations of Anderson contrast with events in the US, where the NSA saw at least some curbs placed on bulk collection of phone records by Congress last month.</p> \n<p>Anderson, asked about the contrast with the US, said it would be “quite wrong” to compare laws across jurisdictions, arguing that the US had not abandoned bulk data collection.</p> \n<p>He argued that there will be some new curbs on warrants for bulk data collection in the UK, including “a tighter definition of the purposes for which it is sought, defined by operations or mission purposes”.</p> \n<p>One of the biggest changes in the report is that “all warrants should be judicially authorised by a judicial commissioner at a new body: the Independent Surveillance and Intelligence Commission”.</p> \n<p>Removing the power from ministers could meet with resistance from Westminster, where some ministers and MPs will argue that democratically elected members should be making these decisions rather than judges who do not have access to up-to-date information of terrorist threats.</p> \n<p>The new Independent Surveillance and Intelligence Commission would replace three existing bodies.<br /></p> \n<p>Anderson said that the existing legislation had reached the end of its useful life. “Ripa, obscure since its inception, has been patched up so many times as to make it incomprehensible to all but a tiny band of initiates. A multitude of alternative powers, some of them without statutory safeguards, confuse the picture further. This state of affairs is undemocratic, unnecessary and – in the long run – intolerable.”<br /></p> \n<p>The intelligence agencies, including GCHQ, have been expressing concern about the increasing use of encryption to protect privacy, with internet providers beginning to offer this as standard. </p> \n<p>Anderson, in his report, said few propose a master key to all communications be held by the state. “Far preferable, on any view, is a law-based system in which encryption keys are handed over (by service providers or by the users themselves) only after properly authorised requests.”</p> \n<p>Anderson said he could not condone Snowden’s disclosure. National security had suffered, he added, but there had also been benefits from the disclosure of the some of the intelligence agency capabilities.</p> \n<p>“The opening up of the debate has however come at a cost to national security: the effect of the Snowden documents on the behaviour of some service providers and terrorists alike has, for the authorities, accentuated the problem of reduced coverage and rendered more acute the need for a remedy,” the report says.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434014658106/6683793d-51ea-42a4-8bea-698c1cdb34b6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"AFP/Getty Images/the Gaurdian","altText":"Edward Snowden","cleanCredit":"Photograph: AFP/Getty Images/the Gaurdian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-11T09:36:23Z","lastModified":"2015-06-11T09:46:55Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ewen MacAskill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ewenmacaskill"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Surveillance","UK news","Edward Snowden","Privacy","US news","World news","GCHQ","UK security and counter-terrorism","The NSA files"],"tags":[{"id":"world/surveillance","webTitle":"Surveillance"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"us-news/edward-snowden","webTitle":"Edward Snowden"},{"id":"world/privacy","webTitle":"Privacy"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"uk/gchq","webTitle":"GCHQ"},{"id":"uk/uksecurity","webTitle":"UK security and counter-terrorism"},{"id":"us-news/the-nsa-files","webTitle":"The NSA files"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ewen MacAskill","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ewenmacaskill"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/11/uk-intelligence-agencies-should-keep-mass-surveillance-powers-report-gchq","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49y85","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/11/uk-intelligence-agencies-should-keep-mass-surveillance-powers-report-gchq","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/11/uk-intelligence-agencies-should-keep-mass-surveillance-powers-report-gchq"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434014658106/6683793d-51ea-42a4-8bea-698c1cdb34b6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The proposals are in response to revelations by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden.
