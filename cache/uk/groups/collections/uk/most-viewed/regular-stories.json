weekend of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/12/greek-crisis-european-leaders-begin-talks-with-views-split-over-agreement\">high tension</a> that threatened to break Europe in two climaxed on Sunday at a summit of eurozone leaders in Brussels where the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, presented Tsipras with an ultimatum.</p> \n <p>The ultimatum - debated over more than 15 hours - entailed a series of draconian measures as the price of avoiding financial collapse and being ejected from the single currency bloc.</p> \n <p>Tsipras acquiesced in most of the fiscal rigour demanded of him in four pages of summary instructions drafted by eurozone finance ministers.</p> \n <p>But as Monday morning broke over Brussels, he was still resisting the creditors’ demands on two key points: on having the International Monetary Fund (IMF) involved in a proposed new three-year bailout, and on a controversial German demand for Greece to park €50bn (&pound;36bn) in assets outside Greece, probably in Luxembourg, to serve as collateral for fresh loans and to provide privatisation proceeds to be used for debt servicing.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/live/2015/jul/12/greek-debt-crisis-eu-leaders-meeting-cancelled-no-deal-live\"><br

Demands that the controversial reforms be approved by the Greek government and enacted into law by Wednesday were described as “utter blackmail” by leading party members and met with stunned disbelief. </p> \n<p>Although sources close to prime minister Alexis Tsipras said the leader was now determined to do whatever was needed to keep Grexit at bay, political tumult also beckoned. Insiders conceded that a cabinet reshuffle – removing those ministers who had refused to vote the austerity package through parliament early Saturday – could come as early as Monday.</p> \n<p><strong>“What is sure is that we are going to have dramatic political developments,” said Nikos Bistis, a veteran politician from the centre left. “Basically Syriza is now split in two.” </strong></p> \n<p>By late Sunday it had become clear Tsipras’ u-turn, accepting measures he had once furiously spurned, had produced a tectonic split with potentially far-reaching consequences. In addition to suffering an unexpected loss of support with 17 MPs breaking ranks at the weekend – defections that strip his government of a working majority – 15 other lawmakers also indicated that they would not approve the agreement in its entirety when it was brought to the 300-seat House.</p> \n<p>The MPs, who included two ministers, said they were radically opposed to endorsing an austerity programme that was not only ideologically at odds with their own beliefs but would exacerbate “the country’s agonising and tragic social economic problems.”</p> \n<p><strong>The resistance raises the spectre of Tsipras being forced to call fresh elections – a move described as potentially catastrophic for the country. </strong></p> \n<p>“Greece can bend up to a point,” said Aristides Hatzis, a prominent political commentator. “But after that there is no bending, only breaking. The breaking point may well come when Tsipras realises he has lost most of his parliamentary group.”</p> \n<p>The embattled prime minister will also face substantial resistance from the parliament’s speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou in getting the policies fast-tracked through the House. </p> \n<p>A Syriza hardliner, Kostantopoulou said at the weekend: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“the government is being blackmailed.

On Thursday, questions will be asked on the ECB’s next steps on intervention, including any role in transitioning to a separate currency.</p> \n <p>Perhaps more significant will be comments Mr Draghi will no doubt make on how ECB policy can limit Grexit contagion to financial markets and eurozone economies more generally. We should expect reassurances on the extent of the policy firewall in place, including the OMT program, the EFSF and QE. On the latter, Mr Draghi pointed out that if circumstances allow, the Governing Council would “reconsider the size, the timing, the design of the [QE] programme”.</p> \n <p>Contagion seems limited so far – for example, alongside encouraging eurozone-wide indicators, peripheral bond yields have not blown out (Spanish and Italian 10-year sovereign bond yields are both at 2.2%).

The funding gaps are way beyond anything we’ve seen so far,” he said.</p> \n <p>The hard line was echoed by Peter Kazimir, finance minister of Slovakia, who said that new austerity measures tabled by Athens were already past their sell-by date.</p> \n <p>The eurozone has been united for five months in the negotiations with Tsipras, but with the stakes rising greatly in the last 10 days, major divisions have surfaced, with the French working tirelessly to save Greece and the hardliners now pushing Greece’s expulsion for the first time openly.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/11/greece-euro-exit-bailout-alexis-tsipras\">Greece nears euro exit as bailout talks break up without agreement</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><em><strong>We’ll be tracking all the main events through the day.....</strong></em></p>","postType":"summary"},{"id":"block-55a22d46e4b05111b7559b75","title":"Tusk cancels EUCO summit","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-12T09:10:43Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T09:11:04Z","body":"<p><strong>European Council president Donald Tusk has cancelled tonight’s meeting of all 28 EU heads of state and government.</strong></p> \n<p>That meeting was meant to be THE decisive event, where leaders could potentially have planned for Greece’s exit from the single currency.</p> \n<p>However, eurozone leaders will still meet, from 3pm BST (5pm if you’re in Greece).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/statuses/620138459236311040\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I have cancelled <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EUCO?src=hash\">#EUCO</a> today. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EuroSummit?src=hash\">#EuroSummit</a> to start at 16h and last until we conclude talks on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a></p>— Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eucopresident/status/620138459236311040\">July 12, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>It underlines just how bad yesterday’s Eurogroup meeting was.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/traynorbrussels/statuses/620149718006517760\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/greece?src=hash\">#greece</a> saturday was the ugliest, most depressing day in bxl for a v long time. sunday better or worse?</p>— Ian Traynor (@traynorbrussels) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/traynorbrussels/status/620149718006517760\">July 12, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-55a2303ee4b07fc6a121fb4c","title":"Italy blames lack of trust","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-12T09:17:53Z","body":"<p><strong>My colleague Jennifer Rankin is back outside the Eurogroup meeting, as ministers arrive.</strong></p> \n<p>Pier Carlo Padoan, Italy’s finance minister, has blamed the ‘lack of trust’ with Greece, she reports.</p> \n<p> He’d like to see Athens rebuilt it, by taking measures in the Greek parliament this week.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/statuses/620150060651642880\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Italy's fin min Padoan: main obstacle to moving forward is lack of trust, wants to see Gk gov rebuild trust. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Greece?src=hash\">#Greece</a></p>— Jennifer Rankin (@JenniferMerode) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/status/620150060651642880\">July 12, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-55a23188e4b07fc6a121fb4e","title":"Slovakia: Not possible to reach a deal today","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-12T09:26:06Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-07-12T09:34:24Z","body":"<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KazimirPeter\">Peter Kažim&iacute;r</a>, Slovakia’s finance minister, has ruled out a Greek deal today.</strong></p> \n<p>It’s just not possible, he says, citing the “breach of trust” between the eurozone and the Greek government. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/statuses/620154513958137856\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Slovakia's fin min Peter Kazimir: &quot;it's not possible to reach a deal today.&quot;</p>— Jennifer Rankin (@JenniferMerode) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferMerode/status/620154513958137856\">July 12, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>But he also suggests that “front-loading” Greece’s reform package could help rebuild trust.

Demands that the controversial reforms be approved by the Greek government and enacted into law by Wednesday were described as “utter blackmail” by leading party members and met with stunned disbelief. </p> \n<p>Although sources close to prime minister Alexis Tsipras said the leader was now determined to do whatever was needed to keep Grexit at bay, political tumult also beckoned. Insiders conceded that a cabinet reshuffle – removing those ministers who had refused to vote the austerity package through parliament early Saturday – could come as early as Monday.</p> \n<p><strong>“What is sure is that we are going to have dramatic political developments,” said Nikos Bistis, a veteran politician from the centre left. “Basically Syriza is now split in two.” </strong></p> \n<p>By late Sunday it had become clear Tsipras’ u-turn, accepting measures he had once furiously spurned, had produced a tectonic split with potentially far-reaching consequences. In addition to suffering an unexpected loss of support with 17 MPs breaking ranks at the weekend – defections that strip his government of a working majority – 15 other lawmakers also indicated that they would not approve the agreement in its entirety when it was brought to the 300-seat House.</p> \n<p>The MPs, who included two ministers, said they were radically opposed to endorsing an austerity programme that was not only ideologically at odds with their own beliefs but would exacerbate “the country’s agonising and tragic social economic problems.”</p> \n<p><strong>The resistance raises the spectre of Tsipras being forced to call fresh elections – a move described as potentially catastrophic for the country. </strong></p> \n<p>“Greece can bend up to a point,” said Aristides Hatzis, a prominent political commentator. “But after that there is no bending, only breaking. The breaking point may well come when Tsipras realises he has lost most of his parliamentary group.”</p> \n<p>The embattled prime minister will also face substantial resistance from the parliament’s speaker Zoe Konstantopoulou in getting the policies fast-tracked through the House. </p> \n<p>A Syriza hardliner, Kostantopoulou said at the weekend: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“the government is being blackmailed.

trending in Europe, in Greece but also in Germany where Der Spiegel described Berlin’s demands of Athens as a “catalogue of horrors”, and to the second-highest trending worldwide.</p> \n<p>In what a senior EU official described as an “exercise in extensive mental waterboarding” to secure Greek acquiescence to talks on a third bailout in five years worth up to €86bn (&pound;62bn), Merkel and Hollande had pressed for absolute certainty from Tsipras that he would honour what was on offer.<br /></p> \n<p>Under the terms set before Tsipras, the Greek parliament has to endorse the entire package on Monday and then pass several pieces of legislation by Wednesday, including on pensions reform and a new VAT regime, before the eurozone will agree to negotiate a new three-year rescue package.<br /></p> \n<p>The terms are much stiffer than those imposed by the creditors over the past five years. This, said the senior official, was payback for the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/05/greek-referendum-no-vote-signals-huge-challenge-to-eurozone-leaders\">emphatic no to the creditors’ terms delivered by the snap referendum</a> that Tsipras staged a week ago.<br /></p> \n<p>“He was warned a yes vote would get better terms, that a no vote would be much harder,” said the senior official.</p> \n<p>The Eurogroup document said experts from the troika of creditors – the IMF, European Commission and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/business/european-central-bank\">European Central Bank</a> – would be on the ground in Athens to monitor the proposed bailout programme. The trio would also have a say in all relevant Greek draft legislation before it is presented to parliament. Furthermore, the Greeks will have to amend all legislation already passed by the Syriza government this year that had not been agreed with the creditors.</p> \n<p>While Greece’s fate was being debated in Brussels, in Athens the ruling leftwing Syriza party was showing signs of disintegration. Demands that the reforms be approved by the Greek government and put into law by Wednesday were described as “utter blackmail” by leading party members and met with disbelief.</p> \n<p>Although sources close to Tsipras said the leader was determined to do whatever was needed to keep Grexit at bay, political tumult also beckoned. Insiders conceded that a cabinet reshuffle – removing ministers who had refused to vote the austerity package through parliament early on Saturday – could come as early as Monday.</p> \n<p>By late Sunday night it had become clear that Tsipras’s U-turn on measures he had once spurned had produced a potentially far-reaching split. In addition to 17 MPs breaking ranks at the weekend – stripping his government of a working majority – 15 other lawmakers also indicated they would not approve the agreement in its entirety. The resistance raises the spectre of Tsipras being forced to call fresh elections – a move described as potentially catastrophic for the country.</p> \n<p>“Greece can bend up to a point,” said Aristides Hatzis, a prominent political commentator. “But after that there is no bending, only breaking.”</p> \n<p>Although billed as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/live/2015/jul/07/greek-debt-crisis-alex-tsipras-seeks-last-chance-deal-live\">the last chance to secure “the ultimate agreement”</a> on the Greek debt crisis, the prospects of a grand political bargain to keep Greece in the eurozone are far from assured.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/alexis-tsipras\">Entering the leaders’ meeting, Tsipras</a> said he was looking for compromise: “We can reach an agreement if all parties want it.”</p> \n<p>But France and Germany are <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/11/greece-euro-exit-bailout-alexis-tsipras\">split on their approach to the Greek question</a>, while Finland could refuse outright to sign up to a third bailout for Greece.</p> \n<p>France’s Hollande vowed to do everything possible to get an agreement on Sunday night, but <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/angela-merkel\">Merkel</a> said there wouldn’t be an agreement at any cost.</p> \n<p>Other eurozone countries urged Germany to drop its objections. “Grexit has to be prevented,” said Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg’s foreign affairs minister. “It would be fateful for Germany’s reputation in the EU and the world.</p> \n<p>“Germany’s responsibility is great. It’s about not conjuring up the ghosts of the past,” he told German newspaper S&uuml;ddeutsche Zeitung. “If Germany goes for Grexit, it will trigger a deep conflict with France. That would be a catastrophe for <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/europe-news\">Europe</a>.”</p> \n<p>Italy’s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, was expected to tell Merkel at the leaders’ meeting that “enough is enough” and the eurozone should not humiliate <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/greece\">Greece</a> when it had already given up so much.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Sunday, eurozone finance ministers said they had made some progress after 14 hours of talks over two days and failing to reach any agreement on Saturday. “We have come a long way, solved a lot of issues, but some big issues still remain,” said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the Eurogroup of finance ministers.</p> \n<p>Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, cancelled an emergency full summit of the 28 countries that was to deal with the fallout from Greece’s ejection, in order to give eurozone leaders a last chance to reach an accord saving <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/greece\">Greece</a> and forestalling what would be a devastating schism, sowing deep resentment and division between Europe’s leaders.</p> \n<p>The intractable problem is that many governments do not trust the Greek government to implement a €12bn (&pound;8.6bn) programme of spending cuts and reforms that will be delivered as part of a bailout. Eurozone governments are seeking proof from Athens it can keep its promises, in exchange for agreeing to start talks on a deal.</p> \n<p>“The main obstacle to an agreement is trust,” said Italy’s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, one of the countries most sympathetic to Greece.</p> \n<p>The Irish taoiseach, Enda Kenny, urged his fellow leaders to “look at the bigger picture”. Kenny, who has been Ireland’s leader since the early days of its own bailout programme, said in his country’s case trust was built incrementally.</p> \n<p>“We don’t want to look back in 10 years’ time and think this could have been saved, but wasn’t,” he said.</p> \n<p>Der Spiegel called Sunday the biggest day of Merkel’s 10-year chancellorship and appealed to her to “show greatness” and save Europe.</p> \n<p>If Der Spiegel was right about the momentousness of Merkel’s day, the same could be said for Hollande of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/france\">France</a> who, with his government and officials, has been campaigning tirelessly in recent weeks to keep Greece in the euro, helping Athens to draft its proposals.</p> \n<p>A decision to go ahead with a so-called Grexit, which has never been closer, would be a shattering failure for Hollande and the resulting Franco-German recrimination would be deeply damaging, say observers.</p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bf873c79daa09ebb9ad58ce8618c9ae4007ec9e0/0_3_881_529/881.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":529,"width":881,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Philippe Wojazer/Reuters","altText":"File photo of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras arriving in his car at a euro zone leaders summit in Brussels, Belgium<br>Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras arrives in his car at a euro zone leaders summit in Brussels, Belgium, in this July 12, 2015 file photo.

The largest is 1.5km across the rim and rises 700m from the sea floor. The 20km-long volcano cluster is nearly 5km underwater.<br /></p> \n<p>Professor Iain Suthers, a marine biologist at the University of NSW, said the volcano discovery was made when the team was searching for nursery grounds for larval lobsters.</p> \n<p>“My jaw just dropped,” Suthers told Guardian Australia. “I immediately said, ‘What are they doing there and why didn’t we know about them before?’ It really backs up the statement that we know more about the surface of the moon than our sea floor.</p> \n<p>“I’m elated. We went there to look at eddies in the east Australia current and it was completely serendipitous to find this volcano cluster. We can only just imagine what will be around the corner if we continue to scan this area.”</p> \n<p>Scientists believe the volcanoes were created by a series of shifts in geological plates that caused Australia to split from New Zealand. Suthers said the area was thought to be “billiard-table flat” but the enhanced mapping capability of the Investigator unveiled the calderas.</p> \n<p>The 94-metre Investigator was commissioned by the CSIRO in 2009 via $120m from the federal government. The vessel, which undertook its first sea tests in March, can map the seafloor at any depth, whereas its ageing predecessor, the Southern Surveyor, was limited to 3,000 metres.</p> \n<p>Professor Richard Arculus, an igneous petrologist and volcano expert at the Australian National University, said the Investigator’s mapping ability has unveiled an “enormously exciting” discovery. </p> \n<p>“They tell us part of the story of how New Zealand and Australia separated around 40m to 80m years ago, and they’ll now help scientists target future exploration of the sea floor to unlock the secrets of the Earth’s crust,” he said.</p> \n<p>The team of 28 scientists, led by Suthers, included researchers from NSW, Latrobe, British Columbia, Sydney, Auckland, Technology Sydney and Southern Cross universities. The voyage left Brisbane on 3 June and arrived in Sydney on 18 June.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jun/04/science-funding-cuts-are-generating-fears-for-jobs-and-research-output\">Science funding cuts are generating fears for jobs and research output</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Suthers said it was “inevitable” that other undiscovered volcanoes were in the region, but the Investigator has funding to operate at sea for only 180 days a year. For the rest of the year it is tied up at a wharf in Hobart.</p> \n<p>“We should thank Canberra for the funding we do have but it’s frustrating to build a state-of-the-art vessel only to have it sitting in a wharf for six months of the year,” Suthers said.</p> \n<p>“This is a vessel that Australia has been crying out for for decades. It’s an incredibly stable vessel for those of us who are seasick. Usually when you’re hit by four-metre waves you lose a couple of days of research because you’re vomiting.”</p> \n<p>A spokeswoman for Ian Macfarlane, the industry and science minister, said the shortfall was because Labor “left absolutely no money in the budget” to operate the Investigator. </p>","section":"Australia","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/71c4279a9e184d0cdd6eb354713f5cb0ce3c6aba/0_0_1713_1028/1713.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1028,"width":1713,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Marine National Facility","altText":"Extinct underwater volcanoes, which are likely to be 50 million years old, situated about 250 km off the coast of Sydney, Australia.

The spokesman said: “If he was not adequately dressed, you could infer that he would not have been let in, but we do not comment on our guests.

We have got no god-given right to exist,” he said. Labour had to face some hard truths, and its leadership candidates bringing forward micro-policies for a 2020 manifesto was not good enough, he said.</p> \n<p>Harman’s comments came after reports that she had clashed this week with the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-child-tax-credit-cuts-affect-women-worse-men-labour-yvette-cooper\">Labour leadership contender Andy Burnham over welfare</a> during a shadow cabinet meeting.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-child-tax-credit-cuts-affect-women-worse-men-labour-yvette-cooper\">Cuts to tax credits in budget hit women twice as hard as men, says Labour</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In her BBC interview, she repeatedly warned party members “not to vote for someone who you think you like and who makes you comfortable but think who will be able to reach out to the public and listen to the public and give them confidence. The point is not to have someone that we particularly like and feel comfortable with. The point is to have someone who can command the confidence of the country”.</p> \n<p>Harman said there was no point in the party making its choice in a disappointed rage.</p> \n<p>Her remarks can be interpreted in various ways but are hardly likely to be seen as endorsement of Jeremy Corbyn, the leftwinger who is doing better than many senior party figures expected in the leadership campaign.</p> \n<p>Labour sources said the party would urge the government to make exemptions for people with disabilities and carers in setting the welfare cap and urge the Conservatives not to go ahead with cuts in the value of employment support allowance. The key vote on plans to withdraw tax credits from 2017 for families who have a third child will not take place until the autumn, by which time Harman will not be leader.</p> \n<p>In response to Harman’s remarks, Corbyn said: “If it is proposed that Labour MPs are being asked to vote for the government’s plans to cut benefits to families, I am not willing to vote for policies that will push more children into poverty. Families are suffering enough. We shouldn’t play the government’s political games when the welfare of children is at stake.”</p> \n<p>The Burnham camp said: “Andy opposes cuts to child tax credits. These are paid to people who are doing the right thing and working hard to make ends meet. These tax credit changes are regressive, they are wrong, they hit families in work and Andy opposes them.”</p> \n<p>Yvette Cooper’s team said: “Yvette has made clear from the start that she does not believe the best way to reduce the deficit is to hit working families, reduce work incentives and push more children into poverty. She has said that the Tory plans for cutting tax credits and abandoning the child poverty target do both and Labour should strongly oppose them.”</p> \n<p>An aide to Harman said the interim leader was ready to take some heat over the issue, including possibly at a meeting of Labour MPs on Monday night but that she felt she had a responsibility to send some messages to the public.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/08/july-budget-2015-key-points-at-a-glance\">Budget 2015: 25 key points at a glance</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“How the party reacts in the early days of opposition can be very formative to how people the party is viewed as it discovered in 2010. None thinks she is on the right of the party but she is reflecting very deeply on what she has heard right across the country about why the party has lost twice,” said the aide.</p> \n<p>Harman said the public did not vote for the Tories because they particularly loved the party but because they did not trust Labour on the economy and on benefits. “We cannot simply say to the public: you were wrong, we are going to carry on saying what we said before the election.<br /></p> \n<p>“The temptation is always to oppose everything. That does not make sense. We have got to wake up and recognise this is not a blip and we have got to listen to why. No one is going to listen to us if they think we are not to listening to them.”</p> \n<p>She added it was wrong to think that people had voted differently for different reasons against Labour, saying her analysis was that they were saying the same thing albeit in different accents all over the UK. “That they thought Labour was a risk and they were not prepared to take that risk,” she said. “One of the saddest things to me is that some of [our supporters] thought, ‘Phew it was a bit of a relief that Labour did not get elected.’”</p> \n<p><br /></p> \n<p><br /></p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/92b637ba6a178d8f7d8a611b77e0a58c489bd607/0_0_1977_1185/1977.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1185,"width":1977,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PA/PA","altText":"Prime Minister's Questions<br>Acting Labour party leader Harriet Harman speaks during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, London.
