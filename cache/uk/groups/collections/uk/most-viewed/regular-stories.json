The government department that oversees the police is also analysing police conduct.</p> \n<p>The dramatic footage, played widely on Portuguese TV and social media, shows the Magalhaes family by a low wall outside the stadium, where the youngest child sat down and drank a bottle of water. <br /></p> \n<p>There were few other people in the vicinity because police were holding rival fans inside the stadium in northern Portugal, to avoid clashes in surrounding streets.</p> \n<p>An officer questioned Magalhaes, then punched his father before using a truncheon to beat Magalhaes on the ground while his nine-year-old screamed: “Dad! Dad!”</p> \n<p>“The policeman came over ... and asked us why we had brought children to a stadium if we knew there might be trouble,” Magalhaes said. <br /></p> \n<p>“I told him, gesticulating, that he should be more concerned about the problems inside the stadium.</p> \n<p>“The next thing I know he’s on top of me.”</p> \n<p>Another policeman in riot gear with a shield kept the 9-year-old child away and tried to pick him up as he cried.</p> \n<p>Magalhaes said his first worry was his youngest son.</p> \n<p>“The kid didn’t understand what was going on. I wanted to get over to him and comfort him ... and calm him down,” he said. Instead, Magalhaes was handcuffed and taken away.</p> \n<p>Magalhaes said the policeman alleged at an initial court hearing on Monday that Magalhaes spat at him, a claim Magalhaes denied. Magalhaes said the police had previously been kind to him and his family by letting them leave the stadium early.</p> \n<p>The incident has brought a flurry of investigations and charges.</p> \n<p>Magalhaes’s lawyer, Sonia Carneiro, said police have brought a complaint of threatening behaviour and obstruction against Magalhaes. <br /></p> \n<p>After an initial hearing on Monday, the public prosecutor’s office is now investigating whether there is enough evidence to proceed with a formal charge against Magalhaes. There is no deadline for a decision.</p> \n<p>Magalhaes said he and his father intend to file a complaint against the police, though he acknowledges that the one officer who hit him does not represent the entire police force.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, he has to explain what happened to his children. He and his wife had taught them that the police are their friends, he said, and they “couldn’t understand why the police acted like they did”.</p> \n<p>As he nurses his bruises and stiffness, Magalhaes hopes an invitation from Benfica to watch next weekend’s final game of the season will help banish the bad memory.</p> \n<p>“The physical part will heal faster than the psychological part,” he said.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432092534449/Benfica-police-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"AP","altText":"Benfica police","cleanCredit":"Photograph: AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-20T00:52:13Z","lastModified":"2015-05-20T04:35:26Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Portugal","World news","Europe","Police","Football","Benfica","Vitória de Guimarães","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"world/portugal","webTitle":"Portugal"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"uk/police","webTitle":"Police"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"football/benfica","webTitle":"Benfica"},{"id":"football/vitoria-de-guimaraes","webTitle":"Vitória de Guimarães"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/20/outrage-in-portugal-over-police-beating-of-man-in-front-of-his-children","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/493kf","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/may/20/outrage-in-portugal-over-police-beating-of-man-in-front-of-his-children","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/20/outrage-in-portugal-over-police-beating-of-man-in-front-of-his-children"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-456784283","source":"AP","durationInSeconds":48,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/05/20/150520Benfica_FromGAus-16x9.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/05/20/150520Benfica_FromGAus/150520Benfica_FromGAus.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432092504255/Benfica-police-001.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":640,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Police outside a Benfica match beat a man who is with his two sons.

In our strategic straitjacket, we refused to accept them, to make the argument for them or to build them into a new sense of mission.”</p> \n<p>He will say Labour has to be seen to be on the people’s side and earn the right to be trusted with their future. <br /></p> \n<p>He will argue that trust “only comes when we offer a broad-based, forward-looking Labour project. A 100% strategy. Not the timid, institutionalised caution which led so many to believe we had a 35% strategy”.</p> \n<p>On families, Hunt will say: “There are historical deficiencies of our approach towards the family and the belief that child poverty can be solved largely or even entirely through material redistribution. <br /></p> \n<p>“We need institutions that tackle inequality at source – by raising the opportunities parents have to work and children have to learn, not provide a monetary sticking plaster when it is far too late. </p> \n<p>“We need to offer a childcare revolution, free all year round, for every working family. Such ambition does not come cheap. <br /></p> \n<p>“The IPPR [Institute for Public Policy Research] suggested it would mean hard choices like freezing child benefit for school-age children.”</p> \n<p>On welfare reform, he will say: “Go back to [social reformer William] Beveridge, begin to restore the contributory principle: you pay more in, you get more out. <br /></p> \n<p>“The IPPR’s <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/publications/the-condition-of-britain-strategies-for-social-renewal\">Condition of Britain report</a> proposed big reforms to restore the principle of contribution most of which ended up on the cutting room floor.</p> \n<p>“We should establish a clear principle with out-of work benefits. If you have a strong record of work, you should receive more help when you fall on hard times.”</p> \n<p>He will also express his dismay about the way Labour allowed the devolution agenda to be stolen from Labour by George Osborne, the chancellor. <br /></p> \n<p>Hunt will say: “Labour needs to win the race to hand power back to local people. Yet even more important: radical devolution must surely form a big part of our answer to the rise of nationalism – both in Scotland and in England.</p> \n<p>“A modernising approach to devolution must be about about growing local pride and local prosperity. <br /></p> \n<p>“This is about more than the powers of local government – and indeed the Labour party’s approach to community – it is about the integrity of the United Kingdom itself.</p> \n<p>“We must shed our timidity, match the Tory offer and go beyond it by giving city and country regions the power to vary local taxes, including business rates. <br /></p> \n<p>“Devo max shouldn’t stop at the Scottish border.

Rodgers has been asked to give his findings at a meeting to be held after the final Premier League game of the season at Stoke City on Sunday. There is no suggestion the manager’s position is under immediate threat but the investigation into Liverpool’s season, plus the extent of it, underlines the owner’s dissatisfaction with what has unfolded. The discussion promises to be a gruelling experience for Rodgers and his back-room staff at the very least.</p> \n<p>Tom Werner, the Liverpool chairman, and John W Henry, the principal owner, accepted last summer that the &pound;75m sale of Luis Su&aacute;rez to Barcelona would have an impact on Rodgers’ team and their prospects of a second successive challenge for the Premier League title.

However, having spent &pound;117m on nine players last summer, the Boston-based owners believed Liverpool were equipped to qualify for the Champions League once again.</p> \n<p>There is concern not only at the modest impact of the recruits but the miserable end to the season, which has yielded only eight points from the last 24 available and also included a lame FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/19/raheem-sterling-booed-liverpool-fans-club-awards-ceremony\">Raheem Sterling booed by Liverpool fans at club’s awards ceremony</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Liverpool could end the season in seventh place should they lose at the Britannia Stadium on Sunday and both Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton win their final games. The absence of Champions League football at Anfield next term – for the fifth time in the last six seasons – is also believed to be a factor in Sterling’s determination to leave the club this summer, an intention he and his representative, Aidy Ward, are expected to confirm on Friday when they meet Liverpool’s chief executive, Ian Ayre.<br /></p> \n<p>Sterling was booed by a section of the Liverpool support when he picked up the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/19/raheem-sterling-booed-liverpool-fans-club-awards-ceremony\">club’s young player of the year award</a> night on Tuesday. The 20-year-old attended the event at the city’s Echo Arena despite the latest controversy over his future with the first team squad, the Liverpool Ladies team, academy players and former players paying tribute to the outgoing captain, Steven Gerrard, along with paying customers.</p> \n<p>Sterling had postponed talks over his contract until the end of the season but the meeting was brought forward at the request of his representatives, increasing the belief at Liverpool that the England international will refuse to commit to a new deal and wishes to leave.</p> \n<p>Manchester City are monitoring developments, although Ward has claimed the latest furore over his client’s future has been exaggerated. “The story has been blown somewhat out of proportion,” said the agent in a statement. “Raheem and his representatives have a meeting scheduled with Liverpool later this week and we will take proceedings from there.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/may/19/raheem-sterling-liverpool-fenway-sports-group\">Raheem Sterling has exposed flaws in Liverpool’s desire to play fair</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nevertheless FSG is willing to take the same hard-line stance it adopted with Su&aacute;rez in 2013 should Sterling refuse to sign a contract extension and keep the winger on his current &pound;35,000-a-week deal. Sterling is under contract at Liverpool until 2017 and the club’s owners are prepared to retain the player on his existing terms until next summer – costing him more than &pound;3m in lost wages given his rejection of a &pound;100,000-a-week contract – should the impasse continue. It would take a vastly inflated offer to test FSG’s resolve.<br /></p> \n<p>The former Liverpool winger John Barnes has given a damning verdict on Sterling’s stand-off with the club, claiming he could become the next Scott Sinclair should he succeed in moving to Manchester City. “Raheem has great potential but Liverpool gave him an opportunity and he should stay,” said Barnes. “He has not achieved anything. He has not won anything. Does anyone believe that, if he goes to Manchester City, he will be the first name on the team-sheet or are they just signing him because they need English players?

Attempts by UK companies to expand into the faster growing economies of Asia have proved only partly successful.</p> \n<p>“Business must be crystal clear that membership is in our national interest,” Rake will say. “The EU is key to our national prosperity. Letting us set the trade agenda, be part of the biggest free trade deal ever negotiated – the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership – and be able to properly compete with global giants like China and India.”</p> \n<p>While acknowledging public concerns around immigration, Rake will warn that the NHS could not operate without skilled migration and that attracting the “best and brightest European talent” is good for the economy.</p> \n<p>The CBI has backed David Cameron’s view that it is in the interests of the UK to remain within a reformed Europe, with its director general, John Cridland, saying previously that the EU needs to “do more of what it is good at and less of what it is not good at”.</p> \n<p>Rake will flesh out this argument in Wednesday evening’s speech, urging that regulation on lifestyle issues should be left to member states, adding that “poorly thought-out legislation – especially on employment law – can be a real headache for business”.<br /></p> \n<p>“Today the moment is ripe for reform. The things we want are shared by our European colleagues and the EU can be more competitive without the need for treaty change,” he will say. “Reform will not happen overnight.

It’s easy to dismiss his utterances as those of a self-serving rightwing ideologue who helped craft the programme of a government shovelling wealth and power to those at the top, who is now masquerading as an anti-establishment insurgent. But in a society where there is all too little scrutiny of the powerful – that, of course, is reserved for those at the bottom of the heap – any excuse to refocus our attention towards those at the top should surely be seized upon.</p> \n<p>To find some common cause with Hilton is perhaps not all that surprising. He refers to both Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party movement as symptoms of popular disapproval with an elite that is – to coin a phrase – all in it together. At the height of both, a Venn diagram circulated. Occupy Wall Street believed that “large corporations have way too much power”; the Tea Party said “the government has way too much power”. <a href=\"http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/4e98757eeab8eaf84b000013/occupy-wall-street.jpg\">But there was an overlap</a>: “Large corporations lobby for the government to have more power, and in return the government enacts laws and regulations favourable to large corporations.”</p> \n<p>There are critiques of our system that both the libertarian right and the radical left subscribe to – crony capitalism, “socialism for the rich”, whatever you want to call it, even if the solutions diverge radically. Both opposed the bank bailouts, but while the libertarian right would have let the banks fail, the radical left would have nationalised them under democratic control. If rightwingers help give this diagnosis a wider circulation, giving the left space to respond with our own solutions, then so be it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The radical left and the libertarian right are both critiques of the same thing: socialism for the rich</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>What needs to be exposed is the self-evident hypocrisy of the “free market”, which all too often in practice means the state propping up private interests while leaving those at the bottom to fend for themselves. Globally, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/may/18/fossil-fuel-companies-getting-10m-a-minute-in-subsidies-says-imf\">fossil fuel industries can benefit from subsidies worth $10m a minute,</a> while the poorest are compelled to scrabble in the dirt to eat.</p> \n<p>“The corporate bosses, the MPs, the journalists … all go to the same dinner parties and social events; all live near one another; all send their children to the same schools,” cries comrade Hilton. He has a point. The talented former Telegraph deputy editor Benedict Brogan – sadly now purged – told me of journalists (whose theoretical job is to challenge those with political power) dinner-partying, drinking and going on holiday with MPs – or even becoming godparents to their children.</p> \n<p>But it’s not simply about social connections and piss-ups. “They flit and float between Westminster, Whitehall and the City; regardless of who’s in office, the same people are in power,” reports the revolutionary Jacobin Hilton. In other words, the powerful are bound together by a revolving door. Boris Johnson is now mayor of London, a Tory MP with a cabinet post, and, as a Telegraph columnist, the recipient of a six-figure salary (which he once described as “chickenfeed”) from the undoubtedly grateful Barclay Brothers. David Cameron, Boris Johnson, George Osborne: all recruited their spinners from that supposed hotbed of pinko leftiness the BBC. Major accountancy firms complicit in tax avoidance help draw up tax laws, then help their clients get around the laws they themselves have written: “cases of poacher turned gamekeeper, turned poacher again”, as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/aug/29/socialism-for-the-rich\">the House of Commons public accounts committee puts it</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef3dcb9a4520dc2382d00582b387cf64abf0e38b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432057104810/14a3aa17-025e-4306-8ef8-4aced6e3a530-460x321.jpeg\" alt=\"'The former Telegraph deputy editor Benedict Brogan told me of journalists dinner-partying, drinking, going on holiday with MPs, or even becoming their godparents.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"321\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The former Telegraph deputy editor Benedict Brogan told me of journalists dinner-partying, drinking, going on holiday with MPs, or even becoming their godparents.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Ireland/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The likes of Alan Milburn can become health secretary, guardian of Labour’s most treasured institution, the NHS, but upon stepping down <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jan/29/alan-milburn-labour-health-secretary-am-strategy-private-healthcare\">rake in lucrative sums as a consultant for private healthcare firms</a>.

It is a reminder that the real threat to democracy comes from above.</p> \n<p>Here are the three strategies employed by the powerful to maintain their position. First, they convince us that what is good for them is good for us all. A tax cut for the richest is an act of munificence for society as a whole: it will start raining wealth for us all.</p> \n<p>Second, they argue that anything that challenges their position will be fatal for the prospects of the country. Whatever your position on these issues, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/sep/17/fear-scottish-independence-foretaste-labour-general-election\">the Scottish referendum</a>, the general election, and the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32789709\">upcoming EU referendum</a> have all come with bluster and blackmail from major corporations.</p> \n<p>Third, they persuade us that the real enemies are those at the bottom of the pile. Immigrants, unemployed people: here is where our rage should be targeted, rather than at tax dodgers, bankers who trashed the economy, or employers who pay workers derisory amounts and then expect the taxpayer <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/18/britain-political-elite-fooled-us-again\">to pick up the bill with billions of in-work benefits each year</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/may/19/bankers-pay-civil-servants-cameron-steve-hilton\">Pay bankers no more than civil servants, says ex-Cameron aide</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Levellers championed the sovereignty of the people in the chaos of 17th-century England, long before such ideas gained common currency. The women, men and children of Manchester paid in their blood when they dared to demand democracy in the Peterloo Massacre of 1819. The Chartists were persecuted and reviled as they fought for the rights of the people in 19th-century Britain. And the suffragettes were treated as despicable anarchist terrorists, locked up with tubes inserted into their noses.</p> \n<p>The powerful no longer tend to resort to armed force. In an age when nearly all have the vote, they must employ other means of entrenching their wealth and power – lobbyists, revolving doors, corporate funding of parties, newspapers as playthings of moguls – and a shared ideology that celebrates the concentration of wealth and power.</p> \n<p>Yes, attacks on our “insular ruling class” are unexpected from close associates of David Cameron. Still, any opportunity to challenge the powerful is to be embraced.</p> \n<p>And with Cameron about to let rip on behalf of our shameless elite like never before, we should act urgently on what Hilton says. He was there, at the apex of the chumocracy, so he should know.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432056327051/Steve-Hilton-pictured-wit-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Steve Hilton pictured with David Cameron's former spin doctor Andy Coulson in 2007.
