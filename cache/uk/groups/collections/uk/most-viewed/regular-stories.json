It was a routine meeting, even if wielding the S-shaped device would be anything but.</p> \n<p>At Sheri’s, the madam asks one of her courtesans to give a skill-sharing seminar every two weeks. More than 75 women tour through the bordello’s 25 slots – some commuting from as far away as Florida, Hawaii, Germany, South Africa, Thailand – even Fiji. It’s a diverse and worldly group, which allows for some interesting cross-pollination – it’s akin to a conference of carnal knowledge, 60 miles outside Sin City.</p> \n<p>Erin, a ginger-haired 26-year-old, used to sell sex toys for a living, so erotic gadgets are her specialty. The bondage experts show the other girls the ropes. Veteran ladies of the night give coaching on the finer points of providing an “experience”.</p> \n<p>As a US marine corps veteran, Erin needed advice on expressing herself when she first arrived.</p> \n<p>“In a party, you want the customer to know you’re enjoying what’s happening,” she said. “Once I started being more vocal, the customer was more satisfied.”</p> \n<p>I have to admit, I didn’t expect this much polish and savvy from a small-town brothel. The establishment employs a PR man, and a madam who sounded like she attended Stanford Business School. The ranch, it turned out, is the Yankee Stadium of sex work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32d0baf6cb17e980c5e4726ba220edc8aa54def2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433262159041/e41cb27a-e694-43e7-af94-2faa2d1ac9f3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nevada brothel Sheri's Ranch\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheri’s Ranch workers in Playland.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Hernandez</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>To hear about the recent hardships in the Nevada brothel industry I needed to travel further north, to the proverbial bush leagues in rural areas, where several houses of iniquity have closed down in recent years – including Angel’s Ladies, Bikini’s Brothel, and the celebrated Shady Lady in late 2014.</p> \n<p>In 1985 – the industry’s heyday – there were 34 licensed brothels in Nevada. The number now stands at 19. A lobbyist named George Flint speculated that websites have allowed escorts in Las Vegas to take over the market. He believes, too, that the truckers and other working-class men who brothels rely on haven’t recovered from the recession.</p> \n<p>But those theories don’t hold up to Sheri’s success. Despite sitting an hour’s drive from the escort capital of the world, it manages to enjoy a steady stream of blue-collar and middle-class clientele. One-percenters too.</p> \n<p>The simplest explanation for the recent closures is that the industry is experiencing a Darwinian, survival-of-the-freakiest moment. The ranches with a wherewithal to embrace sexual trends and online marketing are thriving, while their competitors languish or die.</p> \n<p>I caught a glimpse of what a hyper-ambitious brothel looks like when I toured Sheri’s. You walk through their doors, into a foyer with a grand piano and Victorian furniture. Would you care to be locked in a cage, then flogged? Lusting to receive a Japanese nuru massage, or exercise latent student-teacher fantasies? There are rooms catering to all three of those. In a building named Playland, they have a classroom stocked with rulers and paddles, a cheerleader locker room, and a secretary’s desk adjacent to a boss’s office.</p> \n<p>Even the mundane “girlfriend experience” (a popular request on Christmas Day) is catered to, with a room set up for games of naked Wii.</p> \n<p>“Smaller rural brothels just can’t compete,” said Christina Parreira, a former working girl who now studies the sex trade as a doctoral student at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “They don’t have dungeons or hot tub rooms, just bedrooms and maybe a massage room. The other problem with the places that closed is that they had a fixed-price menu. At a bigger place, each individual girl charges whatever she wants – the sky’s the limit.” </p> \n<p>Yet, it’s not as though the mom-and-pop brothels have failed to innovate.</p> \n<p>The Shady Lady was celebrated last year as the first of its kind to employ a male gigolo, or “prosti-dude”. The young man occupied a “rooster’s cottage” in the back of the ranch where he stipulated that he receive only female clientele. Working girls rarely discriminate against same-sex patrons, so this bothered his cohorts, and indeed may have been his downfall. Despite receiving exhaustive media attention, including a visit from an undercover New York Post reporter, the prosti-dude had fewer than 10 appointments in two months. He quit to pursue a career in porn.</p> \n<p>When the Shady Lady closed down this past December, its owner told the Pahrump Valley Times that her heart wasn’t in it any more. In 2007 she had complained to the same newspaper that big houses of ill repute make all the money while the small operations are “dying on the vine”.</p> \n<p> I got on the phone with Phil Maita, a gruff 72-year-old brothel man who said he’d been in the “girly business” since the age of 17. He acquired the Wild Cat Brothel in Mina, Nevada, out of foreclosure two years ago. “I’m having a tough go of it,” he said.</p> \n<p>He then proceeded to blame the women.</p> \n<p>“When I have the right girls I do fine, but these girls aren’t schooled very well,” Maita said. “They don’t know how to talk to customers, they don’t know how to present themselves. They just walk in a place and hope to God someone will want to have sex with them for money.”</p> \n<p>Maita doesn’t employ a madam, and it seemed fair to assume there were no skill-sharing seminars going on. He claimed that when he gives the prostitutes advice, they rebel and do the opposite.</p> \n<p>“I’m better off not talking to them at all,” Maita said.</p> \n<p>I asked about changes to the facility or its business model. Instead of having the women line up, which conjured images of a slave trade, he said, the prostitutes now mingle with customers. Maita installed new signage, fixed a Jacuzzi, keeps the place clean and well lit. He installed televisions showing pornographic movies.</p> \n<p>“I got music playing throughout the building,” he added, “so that when you walk in it’s not totally dead. You’re walking into some sort of life.”</p> \n<p>But how would that allow him to compete with the likes of Sheri’s? I asked. Or with Denis Hof, the mogul whose establishments are featured on HBO? </p> \n<p>“I don’t think I’m getting high-rollers. My dumpy little place is not that sharp, to tell the truth,” Maita said. “I got a flat-back joint more so than a high-end whorehouse.” </p> \n<p>I asked him to explain the term “flat-back joint”. A question that inspired a groan. </p> \n<p>“Flat-back joint! Where the girl lays on her back and gets the money. In other words, she ain’t got nothing else to offer,” he said. “She doesn’t have any charm, any looks. No conversation. No jewelry. No rhinestones. No flash.</p> \n<p>“How old are you?” Maita asked. “Jesus Christ, you act like you never heard nothin’ before.”</p> \n<p>As unpleasant as he sounds, at least the septuagenarian said he will “take a beating” for a prostitute if a customer gets out of line. It’s a dangerous business, Maita noted, and so there are cameras throughout the property, a security measure lacking in the illegal sex trade. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f20e4bb21e1633931b9cd00d0c4b4f4f4e0d2304\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433261763786/8d26503d-5ca9-4208-b4f6-65185bec205b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nevada brothel Sheri's Ranch\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allissa in a ’60s-themed party room. ‘You get to play characters you wouldn’t get to play anywhere else.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Hernandez</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For better or worse, there are fewer controlled environments where women can do sex work now. And while most prostitutes would prefer to be at a pleasure palace such as Sheri’s, the bordello license allows for only 25 working girls at a time. The competition is stiff.</p> \n<p> “I started out as an escort in Seattle, where I came from,” said Allissa, a 26-year-old brunette. “I left because of the sketchiness, just the constant worry that something was going to happen. And I never looked back.”</p> \n<p>She and the other courtesans at Sheri’s Ranch seemed genuinely happy with their arrangement, which allows them to take extended vacations since they have to work a minimum of only 10 days a month.</p> \n<p>They were also grateful to do more than engage in sex. “You get to play characters you wouldn’t get to play anywhere else,” Allissa said. “I get to be the naughty student or secretary or cheerleader. You get to kind of act.”</p> \n<p>An Australian courtesan, Emma, said working in Nevada was superior to her home country, where prostitution is also legal. Places like Sheri’s make more of an effort, she said, to make the experience a special event. “In Australia, people come in on their lunch break for 20 minutes then leave. We don’t get the chance to get to know them”, Emma said.</p> \n<p>Women at Sheri’s communicate with incoming customers for months, organizing in minute detail how the occasion will unfold. It’s staggering how theatrical the work can be. Some men write scripts for courtesans to memorize and act out – and even mail in costumes. Allissa dressed as Cat Woman for a party with a Clark Kent-Superman. Others have played Wonder Woman, Poison Ivy, or Princess Leia.</p> \n<p>This level of service attracts many a first-timer, I’m told. Once, a terrified 58-year-old virgin walked through their doors, an adventure he <a href=\"http://blog.sherisranch.com/virgins/adult-virginity-legal-brothels/\">blogged about</a> for Sheri’s website. He’s a regular now.</p> \n<p>Sheri’s courtesans are lucky too, they say, not to be struggling to save money to do something different with their futures, working in some dusty hovel off a lonely stretch of desert highway.</p> \n<p>Christina Parreira, a former sex worker working on a doctorate in sociology, visited one of those beleaguered sites with her husband. They spent a day at the brothel’s pool, and were shocked not be offered so much as a tour. They left saddened by the scene.</p> \n<p>“We were only there for research, but they didn’t know that,” Parreira said. “At the brothel where I worked, that is unheard of. A client comes in, you go and greet them. You start the hustle. What they do in my opinion is bad business.”</p> \n<p>Then there’s Sheri’s – where in the middle of a serious interview, Allissa looked at me and recommended booking a session with her. I declined, announcing that my partner and my journalistic integrity wouldn’t allow it. There would be no special massage for me.</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433259915205/43cc866f-23b6-4cbf-87ab-4c3de1574097-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Daniel Hernandez","altText":"Nevada Brothel","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Daniel Hernandez"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433262159706/34335cd6-ae6a-425d-bc12-1dc287621175-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sheri’s Ranch workers in Playland.

He would be very proud.” <br /></p> \n<p>While Kennedy’s unexpected death at the age of 55 prompted friends to reflect on his troubled relationship with alcohol and the series of family tragedies which had placed him under cumulative stress in recent years, others emphasised that his spirits had been relatively buoyant despite his general election defeat in early May.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/02/charles-kennedy-left-labour-true-liberal\">Charles Kennedy: he was left of Labour, maybe, but always a true liberal | Vince Cable</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Another close friend of Kennedy, the former leader of the Scottish Lib Dems Tavish Scott, said he did not accept claims that the late MP had been brought low by the loss of his seat of Ross, Skye and Lochaber, which he had held for more than three decades. </p> \n<p>“He was in fantastic form, even after the general election, and talking about taking a leading role – if asked – in the EU referendum campaign, as well as thinking about standing for Holyrood next year. He was very thoughtful about how to maintain and resurrect his political career,” Scott said.</p> \n<p>Jamie Stone, another close friend and former Lib Dem MSP for the Highlands, described a text message exchange with Kennedy last week, in which he joked about elevation to the House of Lords. “He said that he was in London with the kids, packing up his office, and keeping up the political fight.”</p> \n<p>Other friends insisted that Kennedy’s struggles with his drinking should not dominate tributes to him. Journalist and broadcaster James Cox, who became friendly with Kennedy after being the first person to interview him for television following his 1983 election victory, said: “The danger is that the alcohol will overtake all the other things about him. Alcoholism is an illness, not a lifestyle choice, and it was only latterly that it became more serious for him. It was not the most important thing about him or his career. I don’t think this was a ‘fatal flaw’, it was something that was wrong with him.”</p> \n<p>This was echoed by author and broadcaster Muriel Gray, who bonded with Kennedy over their shared love of the Highland landscape, and said: “Most of all [he was] a man who always meant well, struggling with a terrible illness.”</p> \n<p>Munro said Kennedy had been pragmatic about the likelihood of losing his seat. “It wasn’t a case of the voters dumping him – it was a swing all across Scotland. He was aware what was going to happen and we talked about it. He was aware of the size of the swing that he was facing.”</p> \n<p>Munro recalled being on the committee that picked Kennedy for his first general election candidacy, which led to him becoming an MP at the age of 23.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/02/charles-kennedy-uk-political-leaders-pay-tribute\">Charles Kennedy: UK political leaders join forces with heartfelt tributes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> “What everybody else in the world saw later, we saw first.

A year later – close to the anniversary of their mother’s death – his older brother, Ian, was paralysed after a fall in his kitchen, leaving him in need of 24-hour care.</p> \n<p>A sense of devotion and duty meant Kennedy regarded himself as his family’s primary carer, and wrestling with the pressure of supporting his paralysed brother and elderly parents exacerbated his struggle with alcoholism and what many of his friends and allies feared were periods of undiagnosed depression.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456983536__\n</div> \n<p>His friends and senior officials within the party complained privately that he was unwilling to seek or accept professional help for his alcoholism; some suggested his depressive bouts and drinking were accepted within the Lochaber community as a private matter rather than a source of shame.</p> \n<p>But the drinking, depression and his sense of family duty meant he was frequently called off events and appointments and the party was constantly worried he would fail to appear at speaking engagements.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, close friends of Kennedy rejected allegations that he was drunk on one of his final national media appearances, on Question Time on 12 March; claims fuelled on Twitter after he appeared confused and befuddled, and at times stumbled over his words.</p> \n<p>They revealed that Kennedy was in shock after being told shortly before going on air that his frail 88-year-old father, Ian, had been taken to hospital after breaking his hip and was about to undergo emergency surgery.<br /></p> \n<p>Rather than cancel and fly home, Kennedy decided to continue with the show. “That was Charlie being upset beyond belief and distracted,” said Conn O’Neill, Kennedy’s election campaign manager.<br /></p> \n<p>Kennedy’s aides said he had refused to allow them to make that information public, despite the damage to his reputation. He did not wish to appear to be using his family as an excuse and wanted to protect their privacy.</p> \n<p>His father died on 5 April, four weeks after going into hospital at Raigmore in Inverness and a month before the general election.</p> \n<p>Munro said his death hit Kennedy hard, further setting back his ailing re-election campaign.</p> \n<p>“He was absolutely dedicated to looking after his family,” she said. “They were very close. He was heartbroken when his daddy died during the campaign.”<br /></p> \n<p>Worried that the Lib Dems’ poor reputation at national level was undermining Kennedy’s chances and desperate to make him more visible to build up his personal vote, aides and the party had been struggling to get him to hit the campaign trail and use his famous charm and approachability to woo voters.</p> \n<p> Scott, who got to know Kennedy when he worked as a parliamentary researcher for Jim Wallace, said: “He was a Highlander first. All that made up his character, his upbringing and his values, were Highland.”</p> \n<p>Those values included, said Scott, a fiercely protective attitude to his family, as well as the fact that “he cared about people at the end of the road”.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/64413c44f9fd209106c33067afb76a7b0305988f/0_194_3000_1799/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1799,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images","altText":"Charles Kennedy on the general election campaign trail in Scotland just three weeks after his father died.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/03b15b197e22d93c443fc8b20b0d85ed0c5f5463/138_224_2475_1485/2475.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1485,"width":2475,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kennedy celebrates his election as Lib Dem leader in 1999 with his then girlfriend Sarah Gurling and parents, Mary and Ian.

If there is meaning in life, it lies here.</p> \n<p>Those who graduate from the leading&nbsp;universities have more opportunity than most to find such purpose. So why do so many end up in pointless and destructive jobs? Finance, management consultancy, advertising, public relations, lobbying: these and other useless occupations consume thousands of the brightest students. To&nbsp;take such jobs at graduation, as many will in the next few weeks, is to&nbsp;amputate life close to its base.</p> \n<p>I watched it happen to my peers. People who had spent the preceding years laying out exultant visions of a better world, of the grand creative projects they planned, of adventure and&nbsp;discovery, were suddenly sucked into the mouths of corporations dangling money like angler fish.</p> \n<p>At first they said they would do it for&nbsp;a&nbsp;year or two, “until I pay off my debts”. Soon afterwards they added: “and my&nbsp;mortgage”. Then it became, “I&nbsp;just want to make enough not to worry any more”. A few years later, “I’m&nbsp;doing it for my family”. Now, in middle age, they reply, “What, that? That was just a student fantasy.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Why should 'bright, critical thinkers' be dispatched on this kamikaze mission?</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Why did they not escape, when they perceived that they were being dragged away from their dreams? I have come to see the obscene hours some new recruits must work – sometimes 15 or 16 a day – as a form of reorientation, of brainwashing. You are deprived of the time, sleep and energy you need to see past the place into which you have been plunged. You lose your bearings, your attachments to the world you inhabited before, and become immersed in the culture that surrounds you. Two years of&nbsp;this and many are lost for life.</p> \n<p>Employment by the City has declined since the financial crash. Among the universities I surveyed with the excellent researcher John Sheil, the proportion of graduates taking jobs in finance and management consultancy ranges from 5% at Edinburgh to <a href=\"http://public.tableau.com/views/DLHE_stu/SectorsandRoles?%3AshowVizHome=no#1\" title=\"\">13% at Oxford</a>, <a href=\"http://www.careers.cam.ac.uk/stuart/AnnualReport.pdf\" title=\"\">16% at Cambridge</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/intranet/CareersAndVacancies/graduateDestinations/Overview.aspx\" title=\"\">28% at the London School of Economics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.london.edu/-/media/files/programme%20files/master%20courses/mba/mba_employment_report_2014_final.pdf\" title=\"\">60% at the London Business School</a>. But to judge by&nbsp;the number of applications and&nbsp;the rigour of the selection process, these businesses still harvest many of the smartest graduates.</p> \n<p>Recruitment begins with lovebombing of the kind that cults use. They sponsor sports teams and debating societies, throw parties, offer meals and drinks, send handwritten letters, use student ambassadors to offer friendship and support. They persuade undergraduates that even if they don’t see themselves as consultants or bankers (few do), these jobs are stepping stones to the careers they really want. They make the initial application easy, and respond immediately and enthusiastically to signs of interest. They offer security and recognition when people are most uncertain and fearful about their future. And there’s the flash of the king’s shilling: the paid internships, the golden hellos, the promise of stupendous salaries within a couple of years. Entrapment is a refined science.</p> \n<p>We have but one life. However much money we make, we cannot buy it back. As far as self-direction, autonomy and social utility are concerned, many of those who enter these industries and never re-emerge might as well have locked themselves in a cell at graduation. They lost it all with one false step, taken at a unique moment of freedom.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"826e113d3864cb7c2dfcf0035a1d5d7e445c6e27\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433260180132/7afdd9d7-92e8-4b21-89b4-593aabdfdefc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Graduates throw their mortarboards in the air\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We have but one life.

We asked whether they seek to counter these lavish recruitment drives and defend students from the love blitz. With one remarkable exception, their responses ranged from feeble to dismal. Most offered no evidence of any prior interest in these questions. Where we expected deep deliberation to have taken place, we found instead an intellectual vacuum.</p> \n<p>They cited their duty of impartiality, which, they believe, prevents them from seeking to influence students’ choices, and explained that there were plenty of other careers on offer. But they appear to have confused impartiality with passivity. Passivity in the face of unequal forces is anything but impartial. Impartiality demands an active attempt to create balance, to resist power, to tell the dark side of the celestial tale being pummelled into the minds of undergraduates by the richest City cults.</p> \n<p>Oxford University asked us, “isn’t&nbsp;it&nbsp;preferable that [the City] recruits bright,&nbsp;critical thinkers and socially engaged graduates who are smart enough to hold&nbsp;their employers to account when possible?”. Oh blimey. This is a version of <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/career-advice/\" title=\"\">the most desperate excuse my college friends attempted</a>: “I’ll reform them from within.” This magical thinking betrays&nbsp;a profound misconception about&nbsp;the nature and purpose of such employers.</p> \n<p>They respond to profit, the regulatory environment, the demands of shareholders, not to the consciences of their staff.
