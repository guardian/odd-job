That remark spurred hope among progressive Catholics that the church was entering a new era of tolerance and acceptance of homosexuality.</p> \n<p>For some, that hope has been dashed by an ongoing <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/10/vatican-suspected-rejecting-approval-gay-french-ambassador-laurent-stefanini\">controversy involving a French diplomat</a> and practising Catholic named Laurent Stefanini, who is gay. The Vatican has refused to accept Stefanini’s nomination as France’s ambassador to the Holy See because of his sexual orientation, according to media reports in France and Italy.</p> \n<p>The Vatican has declined to comment on the matter, but there has been speculation in recent weeks that the pope could make an abrupt change and accept the nomination, after all. The Vatican recently told the Guardian that any news on the appointment would be made available on the Vatican’s bulletin, where such appointments are usually publicised.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday night, Parolin said the dialogue between the Vatican and France was continuing in regard to the controversial nomination, and that he hoped it would come to a conclusion in a “positive manner”.</p> \n<p>Parolin’s remarks on the Irish vote are significant given the broader role Parolin plays in crafting the church’s message on major diplomatic and social issues.</p> \n<p>At the time of his appointment in 2013, veteran Vatican reporter John Allen wrote in the National Catholic Reporter that Parolin had been “on the frontlines of shaping the Vatican’s response to virtually every geopolitical challenge of the past two decades”.</p> \n<p>Among other issues, the Italian cardinal has been an outspoken advocate for action to combat global warming. In recent remarks, he denounced the “globalisation of indifference and the economy of exclusion” that has put the planet in peril.</p> \n<p>He has also been the public face of Francis’s diplomatic efforts, including the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/dec/17/us-cuba-pope-franicis-key-roles\">church’s role in helping Cuba and the US</a> restore diplomatic ties.</p> \n<p>But on Tuesday, with his choice of words, Parolin differed from the pope in one respect: the Argentinian pontiff has also used the phrase <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.news.va/en/news/francis-war-is-always-a-defeat-for-humanity\">“defeat for humanity”</a>, but he was talking about war, not the legalisation of gay marriage.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432673360232/745f1a7a-60e9-4a81-a7d7-d0fad28f5c39-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sylvain Sonnet/Getty Images","altText":"Rome and Vatican City","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sylvain Sonnet/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-26T20:57:18Z","lastModified":"2015-05-27T07:14:52Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2095,"contributors":[{"name":"Stephanie Kirchgaessner","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stephanie-kirchgaessner"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Vatican","Gay marriage","Ireland","Catholicism","Christianity","Europe","Italy","Marriage","Religion","Sexuality","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/vatican","webTitle":"Vatican"},{"id":"society/gay-marriage","webTitle":"Gay marriage"},{"id":"world/ireland","webTitle":"Ireland"},{"id":"world/catholicism","webTitle":"Catholicism"},{"id":"world/christianity","webTitle":"Christianity"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/italy","webTitle":"Italy"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/marriage","webTitle":"Marriage"},{"id":"world/religion","webTitle":"Religion"},{"id":"society/sexuality","webTitle":"Sexuality"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Stephanie Kirchgaessner","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stephanie-kirchgaessner"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/26/vatican-ireland-gay-marriage-referendum-vote-defeat-for-humanity","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/498n9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/may/26/vatican-ireland-gay-marriage-referendum-vote-defeat-for-humanity","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/26/vatican-ireland-gay-marriage-referendum-vote-defeat-for-humanity"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432673360232/745f1a7a-60e9-4a81-a7d7-d0fad28f5c39-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The remarks by the Vatican’s top diplomat represent the most damning assessment of the Irish gay marriage vote by a senior church official to date.

Since it aired, she has been inundated with support from fellow child abuse survivors.</p> \n<p>Baker told the Guardian she was first abused by the politician when she was around six years old. Working with police, she has established that the abuse continued until she was at least 11.</p> \n<p>Detectives have been told that the politician, who is still alive and of the current political era, would make her sit on his knee while she played the piano and on other occasions sexually abused her on Cannock Chase fields. He cannot be named for legal reasons.</p> \n<p>She says she believes a lord and a judge were also involved because their titles would be mentioned while the attacks were taking place. “I was brought up in a religious household and ... I thought they were on God’s authority,” she said.</p> \n<p>“I knew they were important but I always thought they were more important in the church. That’s what I related it to at the time. But I knew there were ones that were more special than others.”</p> \n<p>A small group of police officers, some uniformed, stood guard while the abuse was taking place, she said, and other times they would join in. One of the officers she recognised from church.</p> \n<p>On one occasion Baker tried to flee the abuse but was chased and caught by one of the officers standing guard. He told her he was sorry, she said, but still took her back to where the attacks were taking place.</p> \n<p>She now believes the officers could hold vital information about the abuse meted out to children in Cannock Chase.<br /></p> \n<p>Asked whether she had a message for other child abuse survivors and witnesses, she said: “Just that it’s time to come forward. If we all come forward then they can’t stop us now. They could back then but they can’t now if we all come forward.”</p> \n<p>In a highly unorthodox statement, Jon Drake, assistant chief constable of Staffordshire police, underlined how seriously the force was taking Baker’s allegations when he said officers recognised “the horrific nature of what we are investigating”.<br /></p> \n<p>He said: “Staffordshire police is in the early stages of investigating a number of very serious allegations from the 1980s and 90s. Specially trained officers are carrying out a number of interviews with the victim to build up an understanding of what took place, and her recollections of all those involved.”</p> \n<p>Drake said detectives were determined to thoroughly gather any evidence that would help bring offenders to justice. He added: “To be clear, regardless of role, anyone who has been involved in criminal offences will be investigated to provide justice for the victim.</p> \n<p>“Child abuse is a terrible crime, whenever it occurs. We are keen to hear from anyone who knows more about the allegations, or any other victim of child sexual abuse, and they can contact the police through 101, or anonymously via Crimestoppers on <a href=\"tel:0800%20555%20111\">0800 555 111</a>.</p> \n<p>“In this specific case the victim has made the decision to waive her right to anonymity. Staffordshire police wants to reassure anyone who has been a victim of any form of child or sexual abuse that their anonymity will be protected.”</p> \n<p>Baker is receiving ongoing support from Merseyside-based group the Lantern Project, which offers counselling and advocacy to survivors of child sexual abuse. </p> \n<p>Police last week revealed the enormous scale of alleged child abuse they are investigating. Ch Const Simon Bailey said 1,433 men – including 76 politicians, 43 music stars and 135 TV, film or radio entertainers – have been identified by abuse survivors.</p> \n<p>Gabrielle Shaw, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, lauded Baker’s bravery and said her decision to speak out would help others come forward. </p> \n<p>“For everyone that does speak out it chips away at the wall of untouchability that victims feel their abusers have,” she said. “There has been a stark sea change in attitudes to survivors who have come forward since 2013, in the post-Savile era.</p> \n<p>“Ten or 15 years ago the response would have been very different – she wouldn’t have been believed – but Staffordshire police have taken it very seriously.”</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432660260569/8f526afb-1c43-40b2-9645-e1eeac1f6e04-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christopher

balance, promising to fight measures expected in the Queen’s speech that may compromise Britain’s commitment to the European convention on human rights.</p> \n<p>Clegg has said nothing in public since he resigned as Liberal Democrat leader in the wake of his party’s collapse from 57 to eight MPs and the near-loss of his own Sheffield Hallam seat, but the controversy over Conservative plans to repeal the Human Rights Act and introduce a British bill of rights is likely to be one of the most fraught in this opening parliamentary session of the first majority Tory government since 1996.</p> \n<p>David Cameron will seek to provide a blue collar tinge to a day of ermine and tradition by pledging that legislation will be brought forward to ensure that future increases to the income tax personal allowance reflect changes to the national minimum wage. The policy foreshadowed in the Conservative manifesto will mean people working 30 hours a week on the minimum wage will not pay any income tax.</p> \n<p>No 10 also promised to press ahead with plans, widely ridiculed in the election campaign, for a five-year tax lock – a law which means there can be no rises in income tax, VAT or national insurance in the next five years. Downing Street has billed the Queen’s speech as “a programme for working people from a one-nation government that will bring our country together”.</p> \n<p>Parliament will also see battles over planned &pound;12bn welfare cuts. In a report on Tuesday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank said it was “virtually certain” that some combination of tax credits, housing benefit, disability and incapacity benefits and child benefit would have to be cut to meet the &pound;12bn target.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/26/the-queens-speech-your-bill-by-bill-guide-to-the-next-parliament\">The Queen's speech: your bill-by-bill guide to the next parliament</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> Other Tory measures likely to arouse controversy include plans on union strike ballots, countering extremism, the in/out referendum on UK membership of the European Union and the right-to-buy scheme for 1.3 million housing association tenants. </p> \n<p>Although the government has an overall majority of 12 seats in the Commons, Cameron is massively outnumbered in the House of Lords and his whips will have to be alert to any signs of rebellions by backbench MPs, possibly made restive by the prime minister’s promotion of an insufficiently ambitious EU renegotiation agenda.</p> \n<p>Ministers already acknowledge that a conflict over the Human Rights Act may prove to be one of the most difficult politically, legally and intellectually for the Tories, with one wing or the other likely to be disappointed by the measures produced by the justice secretary, Michael Gove.</p> \n<p>In a bid to rally his demoralised party, Clegg will tell MPs: “The Liberal Democrats worked hard to ensure that the coalition government’s agenda had a clear thread of liberalism running through it – from the priority we gave to mental health and the green agenda, to creating the pupil premium and protecting our civil liberties. </p> \n<p>“So it is dispiriting – if pretty unsurprising – to see how quickly, instead of building on those achievements, the new Conservative government is turning its back on that liberal stance. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/25/lib-dem-leadership-rivals-unite-to-save-human-rights-act\">Lib Dem leadership rivals unite to save Human Rights Act</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“The human rights we hold dear, our right to privacy in an online age, our future as an open-minded, outward-looking country, are all hanging in the balance again because of the measures being announced by the Conservative government.” </p> \n<p>He will add: “My party’s parliamentary presence may be reduced in size, but our mission is clearer than ever.

The old days in which your pay was linked to the number of hours you clocked up, the skill required and the societal worth of the job are long over. Other factors play a bigger role in determining how much you are rewarded today. This is why we live in a world where the task of walking a millionaire’s dog through Hyde Park is considered more valuable than an NHS nurse (starting salary &pound;21k).</p> \n<p>We are surrounded by examples of this increasing disparity between jobs and pay. For example, average wages in western countries have stagnated since the 1980s, with little movement as living costs have soared and public utilities been privatised, which almost always increases the cost to users. Labour productivity and growth during the same period has steadily increased too until very recently, leaving wages far behind. If we really want to understand why productivity has recently stalled in the UK, then wage stagnation must be part of the answer. If someone asked you to work harder with the hours at your disposal, and you had not received a pay increase in 20 years, would you happily reply, “Sure”? More likely you would nod obligingly and then fake as much of the extra work as possible, behaviour <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/upshot/how-some-men-fake-an-80-hour-workweek-and-why-it-matters.html?_r=2&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=1\">recently observed in a US study</a>.</p> \n<p>And then there are the gargantuan and completely disproportionate <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/business/executive-pay-bonuses\">salaries awarded to business executives and senior public servants</a>. What determines these eye-watering figures? It cannot reflect increased effort because no one can raise their productivity levels by that much. Neither can these huge salaries be put down to market scarcity of skilled individuals. It’s not as if the pool of able executives suddenly dried up in the last 10 years. And it cannot be linked to company performance given the 2008 financial crisis. Yet executive pay has trebled over the last few years despite the double-dip recession and the banking crisis. Something else must be going on, more related to the privilege and power around the job than the actual job itself.</p> \n<p>Executive salaries stand in stark contrast to what has been happening to everybody else. Why is there now such a gulf between the work we do and the pay we receive? Unemployment isn’t a natural state of affairs, but closely managed to keep wages low. It has been very useful for deterring the kinds of wage increases that once made employment relatively worthwhile instead of a one-way ticket to hardship as it is today. Moreover, we have seen an explosion of “crap jobs”, especially in the service sector, which are often stressful, relatively difficult to do well and unduly low paid.</p> \n<p>Emerging out of this rather bleak employment situation is a new type of work ethic. It is defined by one’s willingness to sacrifice everything for work. A person’s worth is no longer defined by their positive contribution to society but their readiness to abandon all vestiges of self-preservation in order to be counted as “gainfully employed”. The message is clear: simply be grateful you have a job and accept whatever sum is offered. Hence the trend of moving the costs of employment on to the individual, which frequently exceeds their income, accounting for the horrendous levels of personal debt currently plaguing more and more workers. Many people are actually paying to work rather than working to be paid.</p> \n<p>This weird ethic of sacrifice is evident at both the bottom and top of the occupational hierarchy. In the banking sector, for example, we see some employees making the ultimate sacrifice. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2013/oct/05/moritz-erhardt-internship-banking\">Dropping dead from overwork</a> or <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2014/jan/28/jp-morgan-employee-fell-to-death-named-gabriel-magee\">leaping from the top of high buildings</a>. And then we have the working poor who expend all of their income simply to work, including an expensive commute, childcare and so forth. But the ultimate expression of the sacrificial ethos is the intern. They work for free.</p> \n<p>So rather than income accurately reflecting effort, performance or social value, it is probably more dependent on where you are located on a rather steep employment hierarchy, which increasingly appears to be determined by the wealth you already have.</p> \n<p>At the apex of this hierarchy are senior executives and public officials, selected from the same group of elite schools and families. These individuals receive so much money that they do not really need to work. They could easily join the ultra-small group of unearned income holders, the rentiers and idle rich that control good parts of Britain, the US and the global south.</p> \n<p>Then you have the second tier of employees who hold very well-paid jobs that service the rich.</p> \n<p>The third tier consists of the 99%-ers and they make up the rest of the hierarchy. So many of us are in this category that it has developed its own hierarchy of “good jobs” and “bad jobs”. Some of these are crucial to society: midwives, street cleaners, postal workers, health inspectors. Others are “crap jobs” that have proliferated in the service sector, but are still considered infinitely preferable to entering into the government-run hell called the unemployment industry.</p> \n<p>Jobs that are most necessary for the public good are often the least economically recognised. And vice versa. Given some of the pointless but overpaid jobs, perhaps dog walkers are underpaid after all.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432648310275/Dog-walkers-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'That London dog walkers are paid considerably higher (£32,356) than the national wage average (£22,044) tells us much about how employment functions today.'

We’ve been here before | Danny Dorling</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The &pound;6.3bn write-off for the cost of paying interest on a buy-to-let mortgage is the largest of its kind since the Bank of England cut interest rates to 0.5% following the 2008 financial crisis.</p> \n<p>Mortgage interest relief at source (Miras) was introduced in 1983 to encourage home ownership, but was abolished in 2000 by then chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown, who described it as “a middle-class perk”. However, landlords continue to be able to claim mortgage interest as a business expense. Critics of the expanding buy-to-let market have long warned that such tax breaks give landlords a considerable financial advantage over ordinary homeowners.</p> \n<p>Seb Klier, policy manager of Generation Rent, which campaigns for the rights of those privately renting, said: “When you get a taxpayer subsidy to borrow money, it’s no surprise that more people are choosing to invest in property instead of, say, buying shares in companies, which actually create jobs.</p> \n<p>“The tax system also puts landlords at an advantage over potential owner occupiers when competing for the limited supply of houses and it’s those thwarted first-time buyers who end up paying off the mortgage anyway in rents.</p> \n<p>“We need to stop subsidising property investment and use that money to build more homes instead.”</p> \n<p>Richard Lambert, chief executive of the National Association of Landlords, denied that his members enjoyed unreasonable tax privileges.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Letting out property is a business like any other, and is therefore treated and taxed as such</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Richard Lambert, National Association of Landlords</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“Letting out property is a business like any other and is therefore treated and taxed as such, rather than as an investment,” he said. “Landlords are required to pay tax on the profit they make and, like any other business, are entitled to offset their costs incurred from the day-to-day running of the property against tax. They don’t receive any special subsidies compared with other businesses.”</p> \n<p>Lambert said successive governments believed treating landlords as businesses encouraged better practice across the rental sector, and said NLA research found 23% of landlords with a single property either broke even or made a loss.</p> \n<p>“To discriminate against landlords and remove these reliefs, which are offered to other businesses, would cut a swath through their profitability calculations and prompt many to sell up and invest elsewhere. That would mean even higher rents for those forced to chase after a shrinking pool of rented housing,” he warned.</p> \n<p>Data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders indicated that<a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/money/2015/mar/17/mortgages-to-landlords-rise-as-first-time-mortgages-plummet\"> landlords were granted nearly as many mortgages as first-time buyers</a> in January.</p> \n<p>In April, analysis by Wriglesworth Consultancy for the lender Landbay found <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/apr/11/buy-to-let-landlords-earn-returns-of-up-to-1400-since-1996\">landlords had enjoyed returns of 1,400% since 1996</a>, far in excess of the rewards offered by shares, bonds or cash. </p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432647925303/f2f37a41-46f3-41ad-a851-7b86e75ce87c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christopher Furlong/Getty","altText":"To Let signs n the Selly Oak area of Birmingham.
