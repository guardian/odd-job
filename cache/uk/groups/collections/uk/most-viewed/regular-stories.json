That happened on Sunday night, when it emerged that the Greek people had said no to continuing to engage with their creditors on the same suffocating terms.</p> \n <p>Just over a week ago, Alexis Tsipras staked his future on forcing this denouement. The eight days that followed his midnight declaration of a plebiscite, to accept or reject the creditors’ terms for the latest slug of overdraft, have witnessed many extraordinary things. The Greek parliament licensed a hasty referendum on a question that had already been overtaken by events. A <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/datablog/2015/jul/03/greek-referendum-voters-greece-creditors-proposals\">ballot paper written in jargon</a> posed a ludicrously technical question, opening up a void for emotion to fill. Mixing talk of “terror” from their partners with haze about what would happen after a no, Mr Tsipras and his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, aimed squarely for the heart rather than the head. Meanwhile, Greeks faced the fiercest financial controls ever seen in modern Europe: bank doors were shut, supplies disrupted, and citizens queued at every cashpoint for their ration of notes. In countries such as Germany, where history engenders suspicion of referendums, it may have looked like a paradigm case of how not to do democracy.</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-559a0a45e4b00bdd27707ec7","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-06T04:57:17Z","body":"<p>As the sun begins to rise now in Greece on “the morning after” Syntagma Square appears empty.

The Greek government promised banks will reopen on Tuesday, but this looks increasingly unlikely, as the European Central Bank is expected to withhold further emergency funding when it meets later on Monday.</p> \n<p>Alexis Tsipras’s government has been counting on the ECB to restart emergency aid to Greek banks, after the programme was frozen at €89bn. But anonymous sources told Reuters the bank will maintain financial aid at current levels when its governing council holds a conference call on Monday morning. </p> \n<p>The ECB is expected to continue buying bonds of other vulnerable eurozone countries to prevent Portugal, Italy and Spain being dragged down by Greece.</p> \n<p>European markets are expected to fall sharply on Monday, following a drop in Asian stocks. But the market fallout was smaller than had been feared, as investors cling to hopes of an agreement as a flurry of meetings gets under way. Hopes of ECB action to defend southern Europe also helped take the edge off losses for the euro: the currency was down 0.5% at $1.1055, a recovery on a deeper fall below $1.10.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457414050__\n</div> \n<p>Mario Draghi, the ECB president, who once promised to “do whatever it takes to preserve the euro”, will hold talks with Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the chair of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European commission, on Monday morning. In Athens, the Greek prime minister will be meeting Greece’s top political leaders from 10am. “We must move forward immediately with negotiations … a strong national front must be created to seek an immediate solution,” Tspiras told the Greek president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, after the vote.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, German and French finance ministers were set for talks beginning in Warsaw, while the euro working group of senior officials is meeting in Brussels.</p> \n<p>As the eurozone enters a crucial 48 hours, it is far from obvious European leaders will be able to smooth over their differences. Germany’s vice-chancellor and social democratic leader, Sigmar Gabriel, said Tsipras had burned his bridges with the rest of the eurozone. But Italy’s foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, said it was the right time to start trying for an agreement again. “There is no escape from the Greek labyrinth with a Europe that is weak and without growth.” </p> \n<p>The gulf of opinion was reflected at the very top of Europe last week: Merkel refused to reopen negotiations with Athens ahead of the referendum, while Hollande wanted a quick agreement.</p> \n<p>Few had expected such a crushing defeat for the yes side after polls suggested the race was much closer. The final tally showed that Greeks voted by 61.3% to 38.7% in support of the prime minister, spurning the extra austerity demanded – led by Germany – in return for an extension of bailout funds.<br /></p> \n<p>Five years of failed austerity policies in Greece and a total breakdown in trust between the leftwing Syriza alliance and the political leaders of its creditors climaxed in a national vote in which Greeks said no to the spending cuts and tax increases demanded by its lenders.</p> \n<p>Tsipras campaigned for a no vote, arguing that this was the best way to secure a better deal, keeping Greece in the euro while obtaining debt relief from its creditors. The leaders of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/germany\">Germany</a>, France and others stated the opposite: that a no vote meant the Greeks were deciding to become the first country to quit the currency, membership of which is supposed to be irreversible.<br /></p> \n<p>It is not clear which view will prevail. The EU mainstream hoped for a yes vote, not only because it would have represented democratic assent to the euro and acceptance of austerity, but also because the Tsipras government would have come under strong pressure to stand down. Negotiations between the two sides have gone nowhere for five months and have become particularly rancorous in the past month as bailout and debt repayment deadlines came and went, with Athens missing a €1.5bn repayment to the IMF.

He has said he is on a “war footing”. The governor of the central bank, the Bank of Greece, Yannis Stournaras, is also likely to be summoned amid fears that Greece’s banks are close to being completely depleted of cash. </p> \n<p>Banks are reported to have only some €500m left in cash – equal to just €45 (&pound;32) per head of the 11 million-strong population. </p> \n<p>The stakes are high: before the result of the referendum, Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11718296/EU-warns-of-Armageddon-if-Greek-voters-reject-terms.html\">told the Daily Telegraph</a>: “Without new money, salaries won’t be paid, the health system will stop functioning, the power network and public transport will break down, and they won’t be able to import vital goods because nobody can pay.”<br /></p> \n<h2><strong>Where does this leave the bailout negotiations?</strong></h2> \n<p>Greece’s negotiating team was set to fly to Brussels where they will attempt to get eurozone leaders back to the negotiating table. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Angela Merkel, the German premier, is flying to Paris on Monday evening to meet her French counterpart, Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, in a move that suggests no immediate deal.<br /></p> \n<h2><strong>Will the European Central Bank cut off Greece’s liquidity?</strong></h2> \n<p>The European Central Bank holds the key. Led by Mario Draghi, it is scheduled to meet on Monday morning to decide whether to extend its “emergency liquidity assistance” (ELA) to Greek banks. So far, it has pledged €89bn and it was the ECB’s decision last week not to offer more that led to capital controls being put in place. Greece will ask for help again.</p> \n<p>If the ELA was suspended altogether it would ultimately propel Greece towards a euro exit. Analysts at Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale said: “The Greek government has already clearly indicated that it is not actively seeking to take the country out of the euro. We have long argued that the day the ECB cuts off ELA is de facto the day that Greece would leave the euro”. But the ECB seems unlikely to want to do that, says SocGen.</p> \n<h2>How will the markets react?</h2> \n<p>Investors get to react to the shock referendum result once markets start trading in Asia at 2.30am London time on Monday.</p> \n<p>Barclays had teams of foreign exchange traders at their desks from 5pm on Sunday night in preparation for any moves in the currency markets. The focus will be on the euro – which has already been under pressure – but also on government bonds and stock markets. Goldman Sachs has predicted that there could be an initial 10% wiped off the European shares.</p> \n<h2>Is Greece more likely to leave the euro?</h2> \n<p>While Tspiras has said a no vote would give him a better negotiating hand with his creditors, analysts at Deutsche Bank are sceptical. According to its analysis, one potential scenario is that Tsipras’s Syriza government is replaced with one of national unity to enable a new deal to be made with creditors. The Deutsche analysts also think it possible that a no vote will result in a Grexit. “We see the probability of Grexit increasing the larger the margin of victory of the no vote,” the Deutsche analysts said. <br /></p> \n<h2><strong>What about the UK?</strong></h2> \n<p>In the UK, George Osborne, the chancellor, will hold crisis meetings with the prime minister, David Cameron, and the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney. Carney had already been attending meetings of Cobra – behind-the-scenes talks at the highest level of government – as the Greece crisis was deepening last week and said that contingency plans to deal with repercussions if Greece exits the euro are being put in place. </p> \n<h2><strong>When is the next deadline?</strong></h2> \n<p>Greece missed a payment to the International Monetary Fund last week and the clock will tick down to 20 July when Greece must repay €3.5bn to the ECB – the final deadline, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. If they missed that, “It would then be very difficult to repair the relationship between Athens and the Europeans, at least under the current political configuration in Greece.”</p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/17355292d44fd9c1ff543d05227723d875c296c5/0_116_3500_2101/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2101,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Yannis Behrakis/Reuters","altText":"\"No\" supporters wave Greek national flags on the main Constitution (Syntagma) square in Athens, Greece July 5, 2015.

We have already got contingency plans in place and later this morning the prime minister will chair a further meeting to review those plans in light of yesterday’s result.”</p> \n<p>In Athens, Greece’s controversial finance minister Yanis Varoufakis <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/06/greek-finance-minister-yanis-varoufakis-resigns-despite-referendum-no-vote\">announced that he was standing down immediately</a> after pressure from the country’s “assorted partners”.</p> \n<p>He said he hoped his decision would make it easier for Tsipras to negotiate a new deal with other European leaders.<br /></p> \n<p>Earlier on Monday morning, Tsipras met the Greek president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, and asked him to convene a meeting of Greek political party leaders. “We must move forward immediately with negotiations … a strong national front must be created to seek an immediate solution,” Tspiras told Pavlopoulos after the vote.<br /></p> \n<p>Tsipras said the creditors – the ECB, the EC and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) – would now finally have to talk about restructuring Greece’s huge debts.</p> \n<p>“This time, the debt will be on the negotiating table,” he said.</p> \n<p>As the magnitude of the result became clear – the margin was a unexpected 61.3% to 38.7% – thousands of no voters began pouring into the central Syntagma Square in front of the parliament in Athens to celebrate, waving Greek flags and chanting “No, no.”.</p> \n<p>In a televised address on Sunday night, Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, said the no vote was a rejection of the “iron cage” of the eurozone.</p> \n<p>“Today’s no is a big yes to democratic Europe. A no to a vision of the eurozone as a boundless iron cage for its people. From tomorrow, Europe, whose heart tonight beats in Greece, starts healing its wounds, our wounds.”<br /></p> \n<p>The sweeping victory for Tsipras, who challenged the might of Germany, France, Italy and the rest of the eurozone, represented a nightmare for the mainstream elites of the EU. With Greek banks closed, withdrawals limited, capital controls in place and the country rapidly running out of cash, emergency action will be needed almost immediately to stem the likelihood of a banking collapse. </p> \n<p>But it is not clear whether the European Central Bank will maintain a liquidity lifeline to Greece and whether the creditor governments of the eurozone will sanction instant moves to salvage Greece’s crashing financial system.<br /></p> \n<p>Germany’s vice- chancellor and social democratic leader, Sigmar Gabriel, said Tsipras had burned his bridges with the rest of the eurozone. But the Greek leader believes he has strengthened his negotiating hand.<br /></p> \n<p>Dutch finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs the eurozone group of finance ministers, said the result was “very regrettable” for the future of Greece. “For recovery of the Greek economy, difficult measures and reforms are inevitable. We will now wait for the initiatives of the Greek authorities,” he said.<br /></p> \n<p>The Greek vote is a huge blow to EU leaders, particularly Merkel, who has dominated the crisis management through her insistence on fiscal rigour and cuts despite a huge economic slump, soaring unemployment and the immiseration of most of Greek society.<br /></p> \n<p>“The failure of the euro means the failure of Merkel’s [10-year] chancellorship,” said the cover of the latest issue of Der Spiegel, the German weekly.

It was at $1.1044 in Tokyo trade, ticking up from $1.0963 soon after early results of the bailout reforms vote were out.</p> \n<p>Shinya Harui, currency analyst at Nomura Securities in Tokyo, said the common currency was holding up as investors “assess the spill-over risks in case of a Greek exit from the eurozone”, adding: “I personally think the chance (of the Greek exit) is very high, at around 70-80%.”<br /></p> \n<p>In Athens the mood was jubilant. “Spain, and then Portugal, should follow this path.

His New Democracy party had campaigned for a “Yes” result in the referendum.</p> \n<p>Greece is teetering on the brink of financial collapse. If it does not receive cash and loans soon from European institutions, it could still be forced to resort to government IOUs or a return to the drachma to keep its economy running.</p> \n<p>Last Tuesday, the country defaulted on a €1.5bn repayment to the IMF, becoming the first developed country to fall into arrears to the institution.

Across the country as a whole, the government believes tthe move will affect 90,000 households. It will exempt those on disability benefits such as disability living allowance, personal independence payment and employment and support allowance.</p> \n<p>Osborne made clear that he would also be looking to make significant savings to the system of tax credits brought in under the previous Labour government to top up the incomes of low-paid working families. </p> \n<p>“It has become a very, very expensive system. When it was introduced, we were told by Gordon Brown it was going to cost a couple of billion pounds,” he said. <br />“It now costs &pound;30bn. That is a huge sum of money. That’s three times the Home Office budget, so we have to make savings.”</p> \n<p>Osborne confirmed reports that he wishes to transfer the annual &pound;650m cost of providing free television licences for the over-75s from the Treasury to the BBC. <br /></p> \n<p>“The BBC is also a publicly funded institution, and so it does need to make savings and contribute to what we need to do as a country to get our house in order. So we are in discussion with the BBC,” he said.</p> \n<p>He reserved his most outspoken criticism of the BBC for its website, and claimed that it had effectively become “the national newspaper as well as the national broadcaster”. <br /></p> \n<p>“You wouldn’t want the BBC to completely crowd out national newspapers. If you look at the BBC website it is a good product but it is becoming a bit more imperial in its ambitions,” he said. <br /></p> \n<p>The planned cuts and his harsh language have confirmed suspicions among some BBC executives that the Tories wish to move against the corporation. The former BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland accused Osborne of “shoddy” accounting practices. </p> \n<p>“It is the worst form of dodgy Whitehall accounting.

Expect to see the leading European share index plunge 10% initially in the event of a no vote, Goldman Sachs predicted at the end of last week.</p> \n<p>A 10% decline would be enormous, but almost any prediction is credible in the current climate. We’re back to the wild markets seen at the height of the banking crisis in 2008. Many fund managers, even last week, were expecting a strong yes vote in Greece. It’s hard to know how severely they will be shocked by the scale of the no victory. Share prices in London are bound to be affected – a 2% fall, or about 130 points off the FTSE 100 index, was Sunday night’s indication in futures markets.</p> \n<p>Bond markets, however, will take centre stage. That is where Grexit worries will be keenest. If Greece could be on the way out of the single currency, will investors be less willing to hold the debt of other eurozone states carrying heavy debt loads? The sovereign debt of Spain, Italy, Portugal and Ireland will be closely watched for knock-on effects. Will there be contagion?</p> \n<p>All eyes will turn to the European Central Bank. First, to see if it cuts off support for Greek banks. Second, to learn if it is prepared to intervene to protect the bonds of other eurozone stragglers. Last Sunday, when Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras called the referendum, the ECB and the eurogroup ministers pledged to react, if needed, to avoid a dangerous fall-out in debt markets.</p> \n<p>Their formal statement said: “Euro area member states intend to make full use of all the instruments available to preserve the integrity and stability of the euro area (which would) complement any actions the European Central Bank may take in full independence and in line with its mandate”. </p> \n<p>The ECB could reaffirm that commitment early on Monday, just to remind would-be sellers of the heavy ammunition in the wings. If bond markets are relatively calm, the ECB might then sit on its hands. If not, it could step into the bond markets as a buyer, sweeping up stock as part of its established quantitative easing programme.</p> \n<p>If markets are still panicked at the end of the week, the governing council could meet to consider emergency measures. Above all, the ECB and the eurogroup wants Spain, Italy and Portugal to continue to be able to issue bonds in normal fashion, at affordable prices. Angela Merkel and other eurozone leaders have argued for months that the eurozone could cope with Greece’s departure. The bond market will judge the credibility of that boast.</p> \n<p>The euro itself will almost certainly fall in value initially – but perhaps not heavily. The single currency was stable during the week of referendum campaigning and early trading from the currency markets in the Far East suggested a decline of only 1%. Indeed, one school of thought says the single currency would be strengthened in the long run by the departure of its weakest member.</p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/8109ea9c4e17d7ce380022b69e91a655b72731ae/86_387_4797_2877/4797.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2877,"width":4797,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ralph Orlowski/Reuters","altText":"Traders sit at their desks in front of the DAX board at the Frankfurt stock exchange, Germany, June 29, 2015.
