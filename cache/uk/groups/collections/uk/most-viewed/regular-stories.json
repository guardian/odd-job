The improvement in public finances will come partly through a tougher tax regime for buy-to-let landlords, restricting non-dom tax status and by increased dividend taxation. </p> \n<p>Declaring “Britain needs a pay rise” – once the campaign slogan of the TUC – Osborne said he was directly boosting the national minimum wage of 2.7 million workers aged over 25. The increase, accompanied by substantial welfare cuts over three years, was designed to engineer a rebalancing between the individual and the state – a political intervention to shift responsibility for low incomes from the state to employers. </p> \n<p>“Let me be clear: Britain deserves a pay rise and Britain is getting a pay rise,” Osborne said, adding that 6 million people would see their pay increase as a result of what he dubbed the creation of a national living wage.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457440437__\n</div> \n<p>The announcement was greeted by the work and pensions secretary, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jul/08/fist-pumping-iain-duncan-smith-george-osborne-living-wage-budget\">Iain Duncan Smith</a>, punching the air in triumph, but the shadow chancellor, Chris Leslie, said: “This minimum wage increase is just a rebrand of the minimum wage – trying to call it something different. It doesn’t actually compensate in any way for this massive take away from tax credits. The changes amount to a work penalty that he has introduced into the tax credit system. It hit very, very hard.”</p> \n<p>Osborne had considered a rise in the minimum wage in 2013 but could not win the support of the Liberal Democrats for the welfare cuts, or a further cut in corporation tax, an essential part of Wednesday’s package designed to ease employers’ resistance to the reforms.</p> \n<p>But despite being given the sweetener of a cut in corporation tax from 20% to 18% by 2020, the CBI said the increases would prove “challenging” for its members working in the hospitality and retail sector.</p> \n<p>Charities said that for many families the impact of the national living wage would be swamped by the changes to tax credits and housing benefit, warning that there would be a rise in poverty and inequality over the coming years.</p> \n<p>The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimated that although some middle-earners would be net gainers, the changes would leave low-earners – typically on &pound;9.35 an hour – worse off by between &pound;850 and &pound;1,000 a year.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457442013__\n</div> \n<p>Resolution chief executive Gavin Kelly said: “By concentrating &pound;12bn of cuts from a limited range of working-age benefits, the chancellor has focused a disproportionate part of that pain on the working poor. </p> \n<p>“We shouldn’t think that a higher minimum wage will compensate all low-income working families for their losses – many working households will be left significantly worse off.”</p> \n<p>Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said: “The chancellor is giving with one hand and taking away with the other. Massive cuts in support for working people will hit families with children hardest.</p> \n<p>“The chancellor has finally woken up to the fact that Britain needs a pay rise. The TUC has long campaigned for the minimum wage to rise faster and the chancellor has listened to us at last.”</p> \n<p>The budget announced an increase in the personal allowance to &pound;11,000 and a small rise in the 40% tax threshold from 2016, but the independent Office for Budget Responsibility said tax increases, including a jump in insurance premium tax and less generous tax relief on pension contributions, would raise twice as much as the chancellor gave away.<br /></p> \n<p>Stressing that it was a budget for working people, Osborne wooed motorists by freezing fuel duty and by cutting <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jul/08/budget-2015-osborne-unveils-green-car-tax-overhaul-to-fund-roadbuilding\">vehicle excise duty on most cars</a>.</p> \n<p>The overall scale of the budget, which ringfenced defence spending, announced a training levy and gave more powers to elected mayors, left Osborne as the leading intellectual force in the cabinet and in prime position to succeed David Cameron later in the parliament.</p> \n<p>The chancellor drew jeers from largely shell-shocked Labour MPs when he warned “the benefits system should not support lifestyles and rents that are not available to the taxpayers who pay for that system”.</p> \n<p>The big cuts to welfare come from:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>freezing working age benefits and tax credits for four years as opposed to the two set out ahead of the election.<br /></li> \n <li>limiting the child element of tax credits to the first two children for new claimants.

Was it something the art director of Hello! magazine had dreamed up after consuming his or her body weight in magic mushrooms? Or perhaps it was based on something Maria from The Sound of Music had run up as a playsuit for a very naughty child, by cutting up the national flag of Ruritania.</p> \n<p>The true chill of horror came with the realisation that Prince William had in fact been forced to wear the very same getup <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/gallery/2011/apr/25/prince-william-life-in-pictures\" title=\"\">in 1984</a>, when he was taken to see baby Harry for the first time.

The <a href=\"http://www.franklinmint.com/\" title=\"\">Franklin Mint?</a></p> \n<h2><strong>Euphemisms on the line</strong></h2> \n<p>Periodically, the Oxford English Dictionary publishes a list of new words. Maybe it should do the same&nbsp;with euphemisms.</p> \n<p>I was on a horrifically packed and immobile train recently: all seats taken, people standing in the aisles hunched, uncomfortable; everyone sweating. A chirpy voice on the intercom described the train as “busy” – a&nbsp;word that conjures up hectically purposeful and productive activity.</p> \n<p>This inert, resentful mass was, of course, the opposite of busy. The use of “busy” to mean “worryingly overcrowded” is sleight-of-hand corporatespeak whose purpose is to avoid admitting something is very wrong – something for which an apology or compensation may yet be necessary.</p> \n<p>When I hear the word busy over any intercom, my heart sinks. It means I am about to be squashed flat. The other popular euphemism is “struggling”, now used everywhere about everything. When I was at school teachers said sternly: “Peter is weak at maths.” Now it would be: “I think Peter will struggle with the maths syllabus” – tactfully, if patronisingly, reconfiguring the situation, removing the element of shame.</p> \n<p>On my immobile train, incidentally, I asked the guard about the wifi that was supposedly available. With a sorrowful smile, he replied: “I think you’ll struggle to get wifi.”</p> \n<h2><strong>What girls are made of</strong></h2> \n<p>Sometimes social media put aside the trolling and behave decently. Just imagine what would happen in England if the men’s World Cup football team went out in the semi-finals to an own goal. There would be a roar of humiliated rage and grief which would be converted, through an almost industrial process, into decades of poisonous irony and mockery.</p> \n<p>The player responsible would have to be a good&nbsp;sport and absorb it into his career, like Stuart Pearce and Chris Waddle doing their notorious <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SgAclSkCpA\" title=\"\">Pizza Hut commercial</a> after missing the penalties in Italia 90.</p> \n<p>But of course this time it was different: it was the women’s team that was defeated, and there was a wave of gallant sympathy. It would be lovely if this happened all the time, for all sporting disasters. Perhaps everyone thought “It’s only a game”. Or were they thinking “It’s only a women’s game”?</p> \n<p>The niceness could just be proof that women’s football is still not taken as seriously as men’s. Once it is, the nastiness will explode.

He’d been working on the project for more than eight years. As well as directing, he’d written the script (along with Joe Cornish) and was a co-producer. Key crew went with him.</p> \n<p>You’d forgive a studio for panicking. Marvel, however, didn’t. They barely blinked. It was, after all, as they stressed at the time, a joint decision, triggered by a last minute emergence of “creative differences”. An alternate director was installed (Yes Man’s Peyton Reed), likewise other team members. The script was tweaked and the shoot went ahead as planned. They didn’t even move the release date. </p> \n<p>If ever there was an outfit bigger than the talent it employs, it’s Marvel. Their slate is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/apr/04/marvel-movie-masterplan-2028-president-kevin-feigle-comic-book\">already scheduled through to 2028</a>, and probably beyond. It has a master-plan, a road map for its cinematic universe, and it’s damned if it’s going to deviate – regardless of whether a film-maker who devoted nearly a decade to it is onboard or not.</p> \n<p>So: can you tell? Can you ever. Ant-Man is a cut-and-shut muddle, haunted by a ghost, produced by a high-end hot dog factory, by turns giddying and stupefying. Watching it is like channel-surfing between Hot Fuzz, a duff early 90s Michael Douglas drama and the very schlockiest bits of Interstellar. </p> \n<p>Our hero is Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), fresh out of prison, a low-rent Robin Hood now determined to go straight for the sake of his young daughter. But he struggles to find work and so is persuaded by his – slightly questionably ethnic – criminal chums (one Italian, one Hispanic, one African-American, all bumbling wrong-uns) to break into the safe of millionaire Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdKf3MneyI\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pWdKf3MneyI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>But it’s a setup. Hank just wanted to check Scott had the skills required for an important task: to be shrunk via a special suit and then do battle alongside a troop of telepathically-controlled ants. Their target is Hank’s former protege, Darren (Corey Stoll), who’s harnessed this special shrinking tech and aims to use it for nefarious ends. </p> \n<p>So far, so promising. It’s one of Stan Lee’s wackier ideas, inherently humorous rather than hubristic. You can see why Wright might have liked it and what he might have done with it, in part because his hallmark is still all over it. A couple of lovely montages involving Scott’s pal, Michael Pena (the film’s highlight), are straight out of Shaun of the Dead, and climatic fights in a child’s bedroom and a briefcase are brilliantly conceived and wittily realised – a happy mix of left-field invention and mainstream wows. Given the success of last year’s Guardians of the Galaxy, you wonder why quirky seems to have suddenly made Marvel quite so queasy. </p> \n<p>But other scenes are hopelessly inert, sagging beneath the weight of third-rate music cues and flaccid blocking. Rudd’s romance with a scientist called Hope (Evangeline Lily) flatter than a jam sandwich; she saddled with bad wig and whiny lines, his wryness sometimes a touch too remorseless. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64eb9d638a5db83739c9339d41d503bed202ee10\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436371939592/b0e13996-3acb-4eee-beb6-6afd09bca1a2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ant-Man\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Douglas, too, is on muted form – as mad scientists go, this one’s mighty bland. Stoll plays things <em>very</em> straight as Darren the baddie, and it’s a shame Judy Greer has gone from interesting indie star to perennially-worried mum (as Rudd’s ex she basically reprises her concerned turn from Jurassic World). Though the child playing her and Rudd’s daughter is appealing, the father/sprog dynamic is just too blunt to affect. </p> \n<p>And it’s in these shameless scenes the film seems most especially to ape Interstellar, especially during po-faced CGI excursions to the “quantum realm”. These were apparently post-Wright insertions; likewise the cameo appearance of another Marvel character. Ant-Man, this appearance serves to remind you, is copyrighted property. He belongs in a stable. You can understand the impulse to bolt.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Ant-Man is released worldwide on 17

The process has been hampered by the unions frequently walking out of negotiations or refusing to turn up. LU received no response to the fair and competitive pay offer made last Monday. </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Steve Griffiths, London Underground’s chief operating officer, added: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>A night time Tube service is something Londoners and businesses have been requesting for many years. It will make life easier for everyone, cut journey times, create jobs and boost the economy. We want to reward our staff for its delivery and have been open and transparent in our negotiations with the trade unions – but unfortunately they have failed to engage. We have put forward a very, very fair offer, which consists of an average salary increase of 2%, 1% or RPI (whichever is greater) for next year and the one after, plus a &pound;500 night tube launch bonus and an additional &pound;2,000 bonus for night tube train drivers. No one will have to work more hours than they do now, and we have a longer term plan, which will mean no one will need to work nights if they don’t want to. Given these commitments, the key question Londoners will rightly be asking, is why the unions have refused to put this new pay deal to their memberships and instead opted to push on with completely unnecessary strike action, which is inflicting major disruption on Londoners and businesses today.</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-559e1c8fe4b0c514f96c67ed","title":"RMT claims 'rock solid' strike","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-09T07:05:44Z","body":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"caabaef0c129f862e564df5a8717e33e21742fd3\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/caabaef0c129f862e564df5a8717e33e21742fd3/2871_780_762_1145/666.jpg\" alt=\"Mick Cash\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mick Cash</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner. for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The RMT union says the support for the strike has been rock solid.</p> \n<p>General Secretary Mick Cash issued this statement” <br /></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The strike action on London Underground is rock solid across all lines, all grades and all depots and the unity and solidarity of the entire workforce, which has now brought London to a standstill, must force the tube bosses back to the negotiating table to address the issues at the heart of this dispute.</p> \n <p>That means an end to the attempt to bulldoze through new working patterns that would wreck work/life balance and leave staff in safety critical jobs burnt out and stressed out at a time when tube services are facing unprecedented demand.

The field, off the coast of Indonesia, would have been the single largest source of global warming pollution at the time.</p> \n<p>“Exxon first got interested in climate change in 1981 because it was seeking to develop the Natuna gas field off Indonesia,” Lenny Bernstein, a 30-year industry veteran and Exxon’s former in-house climate expert, wrote in the email. “This is an immense reserve of natural gas, but it is 70% CO2”, or carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/mar/27/rockefeller-family-tried-and-failed-exxonmobil-accept-climate-change\">Rockefeller family tried and failed to get ExxonMobil to accept climate change</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>However, Exxon’s public position was marked by continued refusal to acknowledge the dangers of climate change, even in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/mar/27/rockefeller-family-tried-and-failed-exxonmobil-accept-climate-change\">response to appeals from the Rockefellers</a>, its founding family, and its continued financial support for climate denial.

I’m sure that it would still be the largest point source of CO2, but since CO2 emissions have grown faster than projected in 1989, it would probably account for a smaller fraction of global CO2 emissions,” Bernstein wrote.</p> \n<p>The email was written in response to an inquiry on business ethics from the Institute for Applied and Professional Ethics at Ohio University.</p> \n<p>“What it shows is that Exxon knew years earlier than James Hansen’s testimony to Congress that climate change was a reality; that it accepted the reality, instead of denying the reality as they have done publicly, and to such an extent that it took it into account in their decision making, in making their economic calculation,” the director of the Institute, Alyssa Bernstein (no relation), told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>“One thing that occurs to me is the behavior of the tobacco companies denying the connection between smoking and lung cancer for the sake of profits, but this is an order of magnitude greater moral offence, in my opinion, because what is at stake is the fate of the planet, humanity, and the future of civilisation, not to be melodramatic.”</p> \n<p>Bernstein’s response, first posted on the Institute’s website last October, was released by the Union of Concerned Scientists on Wednesday as part of a report on climate disinformation promoted by companies such as ExxonMobil, BP, Shell and Peabody Energy, <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ucs-documents/global-warming/Climate-Deception-Dossiers_All.pdf\">called the Climate Deception Dossiers</a>.</p> \n<p>Asked about Bernstein’s comments, Exxon said climate science in the early 1980s was at a preliminary stage, but the company now saw climate change as a risk.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The science in 1981 on this subject was in the very, very early days and there was considerable division of opinion</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Richard Keil, Exxon spokesman</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“The science in 1981 on this subject was in the very, very early days and there was considerable division of opinion,” Richard Keil, an Exxon spokesman, said. “There was nobody you could have gone to in 1981 or 1984 who would have said whether it was real or not. Nobody could provide a definitive answer.”</p> \n<p>He rejected the idea that Exxon had funded groups promoting climate denial. “I am here to talk to you about the present,” he said. “We have been factoring the likelihood of some kind of carbon tax into our business planning since 2007. We do not fund or support those who deny the reality of climate change.”</p> \n<p>Exxon, unlike other companies and the public at large in the early 1980s, was already aware of climate change – and the prospect of regulations to limit the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, according to Bernstein’s account.<br /></p> \n<p>“In the 1980s, Exxon needed to understand the potential for concerns about climate change to lead to regulation that would affect Natuna and other potential projects.

Feel free to share this e-mail with her. Corporations are interested in environmental impacts only to the extent that they affect profits, either current or future. They may take what appears to be altruistic positions to improve their public image, but the assumption underlying those actions is that they will increase future profits. ExxonMobil is an interesting case in point.</p> \n <p>Exxon first got interested in climate change in 1981 because it was seeking to develop the Natuna gas field off Indonesia. This is an immense reserve of natural gas, but it is 70% CO2. That CO2 would have to be separated to make the natural gas usable. Natural gas often contains CO2 and the technology for removing CO2 is well known. In 1981 (and now) the usual practice was to vent the CO2 to the atmosphere. When I first learned about the project in 1989, the projections were that if Natuna were developed and its CO2 vented to the atmosphere, it would be the largest point source of CO2 in the world and account for about 1% of projected global CO2 emissions. I’m sure that it would still be the largest point source of CO2, but since CO2 emissions have grown faster than projected in 1989, it would probably account for a smaller fraction of global CO2 emissions.</p> \n <p>The alternative to venting CO2 to the atmosphere is to inject it into ground. This technology was also well known, since the oil industry had been injecting limited quantities of CO2 to enhance oil recovery. There were many questions about whether the CO2 would remain in the ground, some of which have been answered by Statoil’s now almost 20 years of experience injecting CO2 in the North Sea. Statoil did this because the Norwegian government placed a tax on vented CO2. It was cheaper for Statoil to inject CO2 than pay the tax. Of course, Statoil has touted how much CO2 it has prevented from being emitted.</p> \n <p>In the 1980s, Exxon needed to understand the potential for concerns about climate change to lead to regulation that would affect Natuna and other potential projects. They were well ahead of the rest of industry in this awareness. Other companies, such as Mobil, only became aware of the issue in 1988, when it first became a political issue. Natural resource companies – oil, coal, minerals – have to make investments that have lifetimes of 50-100 years. Whatever their public stance, internally they make very careful assessments of the potential for regulation, including the scientific basis for those regulations. Exxon NEVER denied the potential for humans to impact the climate system. It did question – legitimately, in my opinion – the validity of some of the science.</p> \n <p>Political battles need to personify the enemy. This is why liberals spend so much time vilifying the Koch brothers – who are hardly the only big money supporters of conservative ideas. In climate change, the first villain was a man named Donald Pearlman, who was a lobbyist for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. (In another life, he was instrumental in getting the US Holocaust Museum funded and built.) Pearlman’s usefulness as a villain ended when he died of lung cancer – he was a heavy smoker to the end.</p> \n <p>Then the villain was the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a trade organization of energy producers and large energy users. I was involved in GCC for a while, unsuccessfully trying to get them to recognize scientific reality. (That effort got me on to the front page of the New York Times, but that’s another story.) Environmental group pressure was successful in putting GCC out of business, but they also lost their villain. They needed one which wouldn’t die and wouldn’t go out of business. Exxon, and after its merger with Mobil ExxonMobil, fit the bill, especially under its former CEO, Lee Raymond, who was vocally opposed to climate change regulation. ExxonMobil’s current CEO, Rex Tillerson, has taken a much softer line, but ExxonMobil has not lost its position as the personification of corporate, and especially climate change, evil. It is the only company mentioned in Alyssa’s e-mail, even though, in my opinion, it is far more ethical that many other large corporations.</p> \n <p>Having spent twenty years working for Exxon and ten working for Mobil, I know that much of that ethical behavior comes from a business calculation that it is cheaper in the long run to be ethical than unethical. Safety is the clearest example of this. ExxonMobil knows all too well the cost of poor safety practices. The Exxon Valdez is the most public, but far from the only, example of the high cost of unsafe operations. The value of good environmental practices are more subtle, but a facility that does a good job of controlling emission and waste is a well run facility, that is probably maximizing profit. All major companies will tell you that they are trying to minimize their internal CO2 emissions. Mostly, they are doing this by improving energy efficiency and reducing cost. The same is true for internal recycling, again a practice most companies follow. Its [sic] just good engineering.</p> \n <p>I could go on, but this e-mail is long enough.</p> \n</blockquote>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/98b31bae98b5704f48366673cebdd422d1b47684/0_338_2400_1440/2400.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1440,"width":2400,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chris Wilkins/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Tugboats tow the oil tanker Exxon Valdez off Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound 05 April 1989","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Chris Wilkins/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-08T20:41:43Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T02:16:36Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":482,"contributors":[{"name":"Suzanne Goldenberg","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/suzannegoldenberg"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Climate change","Exxon Mobil","Oil and gas companies","Climate change scepticism","US news","World news","Environment","Climate change","Oil","Energy industry"],"tags":[{"id":"environment/climate-change","webTitle":"Climate change"},{"id":"business/exxonmobil","webTitle":"Exxon Mobil"},{"id":"business/oilandgascompanies","webTitle":"Oil and gas companies"},{"id":"environment/climate-change-scepticism","webTitle":"Climate change scepticism"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment"},{"id":"science/scienceofclimatechange","webTitle":"Climate change"},{"id":"business/oil","webTitle":"Oil"},{"id":"business/energy-industry","webTitle":"Energy industry"}],"section":{"id":"environment"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Suzanne Goldenberg","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/suzannegoldenberg"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"environment"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-climate-change-1981-climate-denier-funding","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4afpk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-climate-change-1981-climate-denier-funding","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-climate-change-1981-climate-denier-funding"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/98b31bae98b5704f48366673cebdd422d1b47684/0_338_2400_1440/2400.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1440,"width":2400,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tugboats tow the oil tanker Exxon Valdez off Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound 05 April 1989.
